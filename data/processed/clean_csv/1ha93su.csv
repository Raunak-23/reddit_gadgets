comment,m16t6vr,Jugales,,343,2024-12-09 13:17:59,,,,So this is straight up sponsored content advertisement right In many ways its much better than a Chromebook or an iPad because it is both cheap and highly customizable encouraging creative thinking I dont see this being better for education when Chromebook and iPad have all the peripherals including a nice display built in They also have an OS All of those things would need to be bought and configured separately adding a hefty load to alreadystruggling public school IT departments and teachers dealing with it,,0.0,1ha93su

comment,mbz6kpc,CompromisedToolchain,,1,2025-02-10 06:27:02,,,,No I get your point but the pi is all about tiny form factor Once you add a discrete GPU its got different power size and weight Lots of situations where a pi is great are not situations where Id leave a GPU,mbz47ix,6.0,1ha93su

comment,m18285k,adobecredithours,,2,2024-12-09 17:36:55,,,,I own a raspberry pi 4 but only use it for testing and as a streaming box on an old dumb TV I havent bought another because the price is a bit prohibitive if you need all the included peripherals and my projects typically need them I agree though that the Pi Zero series is awesome just not for the desktop experience since the peripherals and RAM arent nearly enough I guess my thoughts more accurately are that the Raspberry Pi is overpriced for a mini computer for how little it provides for quality of life If your prohects dont need the extra peripherals though like for automation routers etc then they still have great optionsI just dont use those,m17wzqk,3.0,1ha93su
comment,m17b7r0,OperatorJo_,,3,2024-12-09 15:12:57,,,,I mean it helps with not having the kids easily install things You should see how bad a kid can screw up a windows machine that isnt locked down Best one I saw was a lime green flashbang of a color config Also this is 90 Very cheap very accesible Id honestly get this and bolt it down over some crap HP orderbuilt PC tower Hell for myself I was looking up android boxes and such to replace the horrid OS that comes in a FireTV This is way better than what I was looking for,m16t6vr,1.0,1ha93su

comment,m1930n9,ungoogleable,,1,2024-12-09 20:46:01,,,,Laptops are very common in schools and you cant easily replace the keyboards on those either For 90 this is pretty cheap to replace the whole thing really I think the concern would be how easily can it be provisioned in their system If you have an existing fleet of Chromebooks one classroom of Raspberry Pis is going to take a disproportionate amount of your time to administer,m17k5k3,3.0,1ha93su
comment,m195w42,cjcs,,1,2024-12-09 21:00:48,,,,Laptops are also portable and have a screen The benefits outweigh the risk of damage I just dont really see the value add here Its a solution in search of a problem It if needs to be portable a laptop is a better solution If it doesnt then a regular pi and keyboard fulfills the same purpose,m1930n9,4.0,1ha93su
comment,m1a3rng,kwinz,,2,2024-12-10 00:09:20,,,,This is awful for schools because it cant hardware decode VP9 videos that are used everywhere online The Pi4 was already bad for not including a VP9 hardware video decoder In the Pi5 and Pi 500 its just embarrassing,m1736ho,2.0,1ha93su

comment,m1816sk,AlexHimself,,-5,2024-12-09 17:31:33,,,,What are you even defending I said its stupid unless you have a specific purpose for it then its great Your average user will get it then realize they dont need an entire keyboard attached to the Pi all the time Its like when Apple was trying to take away the headphone jack People were losing it and they were trying to convince us that the bulk of us wont want it They were right Same thing hereseems cool but Id say the bulk of Pi users dont need the permanent keyboard,m17xj4r,2.0,1ha93su
