comment,lxrv8vv,None,,1,2024-11-18 16:10:09,,,,It does help that unlike last gen Xbox gave up entirely so you either get a PC or a PS5 The results wouldve been different if Xbox didnt give up Hell in that timeline Sony wouldve made PS5 pro cheaper and include disc drive The only reason why PS5 pro is so terribly priced is because Sony can do that Its like PS3 launch days but this time we dont have xbox 360 to make Sony rethink their strategy,lxru2hj,5.0,1gu507a
comment,lxs9g9c,Usernametaken1121,,4,2024-11-18 17:22:49,,,,Why did this narrative that Xbox gave up become so popular They didnt give up on making games or being a gaming industry leader They gave up on forcing you to buy their box and only their box to play a game I just dont understand how thats a bad thing for gamers The only thing its bad for is fanboys and console war enthusiasts Console wars are obsolete Look what console war narrative have gotten us Sony who puts out a 700 mid gen upgrade thats like 30 better than base console A digital store that charges customers more because they can A refund policy that if you open the game for 1 second youre ineligible for a refund Why would gamers want that Fanboyism has really destroyed gamers ability to objectively view the industry and whats really going on,lxrv8vv,6.0,1gu507a
comment,lxsci92,None,,0,2024-11-18 17:38:07,,,,Exclusives sell console If your console has no exclusive games People wont buy it Xbox giving up on xbox is bad because it means you only have one console Playstation that is basically monopoly We need competition PS5 pro for 700 wouldnt happen if Phil Spencer spent the acquisition of third party companies funds into developing better killer apps games Like why buy xbox when PS5 gets all the Xbox games plus Sony exclusive games Sure xbox has backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 but not everyone cares about that People want to play new games not old games from 20 years ago,lxs9g9c,7.0,1gu507a
comment,lxsea3d,Usernametaken1121,,2,2024-11-18 17:46:55,,,,Exclusives sell console If your console has no exclusive games People wont buy it Thats what I mean by obsolete That was 100 true in the days of 360PS3 all the way back to NESGenesis but Xbox thinks thats not true anymore Everything Xbox makes is on gamepass so PC players can play it there and Xbox players can play it on Xbox eventually phones will be able to play most of everything too COD will sell xboxs solely on the fact you dont have to purchase it It really comes down to do you want to play on PC or console all the games are there regardless but it matters what your tastes are I wouldnt be surprised if next gen Xbox comes out with a console thats significantly cheaper than the PS6 and the whole selling point will be as a gamepass box Who knows if that will work but Id much rather prefer being able to play any game anywhere and find whatever deal or situation suits me than being locked into whatever Sony or Nintendo thinks is best PC is the place to be right now and thats specifically because everything is on there there is no walled garden I dont think walled gardens are going to last much longer Goolge might be anti trusted to hell Apple is being forced to tear down their wall on the app store I dont think gaming is far behind if on player sentiment rather than regulation I mean look at streaming People HATE that they have to have 5 subscriptions to watch the content they want the walled gardens is a losing proposition,lxsci92,8.0,1gu507a
comment,lxsfd08,None,,-1,2024-11-18 17:52:17,,,,This is not obsolete I for example became team xbox this gen solely because these fucks bought Bethesda and made Starfield exclusive meanwhile Sonys games were boring at the time Fast forward to now Xbox gave up Sonys game line up is still shit but atleast we got Stellarblade and Spider man 2 I have motivations to buy the console because why not Id never buy Xbox if I knew that its games will be released on PS5 Same with Switch People buy switch because its a unique console with unique games It wouldnt sell as well without Mario and Zelda Exclusivity breeds competition and that makes gaming evolve If we only have one console Gaming would stagnate,lxsea3d,9.0,1gu507a

comment,lxvy8jc,throwawayreddit585,,1,2024-11-19 06:03:48,,,,You have no clue what youre talking about Microsoft owns the devs and has license agreements that release the blockbuster games They dont care about console sales Theyll get paid either way They care about game pass subs where people can play day ones without having to drop 70 for each title,lxsci92,8.0,1gu507a
comment,lxrtjrz,CrazyDaimondDaze,,11,2024-11-18 16:01:08,,,,Thanks for actually being sensible about the answer unlike the others If I wanted to have a better gaming experience Id just buy a PC and upgrade it over time I got no time or the desire for that I just wanna unwind with a good selection of my favorite games and the PS4 already fills the bill on that one But I guess I said something offensive to these people all of a sudden,lxrq8vl,4.0,1gu507a
comment,lxru8pm,None,,1,2024-11-18 16:04:50,,,,Yeah idk why I personally dont care about 4k60 fps I play on switch most of the time and my primary motivation to play on consoles is games and comfort of playing them There is very little reasons to buy new consoles if old ones do fine Ill buy ps5 once it gets more games I am interested in Stellar blade isnt enough or I find it for a very good price With a disc drive,lxrtjrz,5.0,1gu507a
comment,lxrvisu,CrazyDaimondDaze,,4,2024-11-18 16:11:37,,,,Maybe Im just used to enjoying a good game over the graphics and growing up with old games when I was a kid when everyone were playing with their brand new PS1s or N64s and whatnot but I guess I dont see the appeal on better graphics or hyper realistic stuff same with loading times as long as the game is fine and thats it Like if the gameplay is fun if it has story its good or the music and this is my favorite aspect is a banger Im totally fine with it Not saying new games arent great either since they can be When my cousin got me into Elden Ring when it came out its what motivated me to get a PS4 But Im not going to buy a PS5 for better graphics or Stellar Blade even if that game looks damn good If I wanted to play something from Stellar Blades developer company Shift Up Im already a Nikke player and Im fine as it is,lxru8pm,6.0,1gu507a
comment,lxrwkko,None,,3,2024-11-18 16:17:06,,,,Same Graphics are nice but they dont sell the consoles to me I play on consoles because playing on PC sucks since you have to always tinker with stuff and you also have to suffer with always online drms You dont have this on consoles Nintendo Switch has outsold both PS4 and Xbox One despite being a 2015 spec tablet Plus unlike Sony and Xbox Nitendos exclusives are actually amazing games that you cannot play anywhere else Sony and Xbox games are good but not my cup of tea Stellar blade is nice but buying a 500 is too much for just one stellar blade game Ill do a rpatientgamers and wait for the price drop,lxrvisu,7.0,1gu507a
comment,lxrwv39,DriftMantis,,0,2024-11-18 16:18:39,,,,I used to think like this but now Im spoiled with my pc Now Im salty about anything less than like 144 fps and 2k resolution Back in the day I was perfectly content with 25 fps Nintendo 64 games but once you start the highend stuff your standards change and its hard to go back,lxrvisu,7.0,1gu507a

comment,lxsakay,Skitz-Scarekrow,,2,2024-11-18 17:28:23,,,,Yeah I got a PS5 because my PS4 was on the way out and at the time PS4 Pros were being resold for just about the same as a new PS5 My PS5 mostly plays PS4 games Almost all of my PS5 games are also on PS4 I remember people being disappointed that the PS4 and XBone werent that great of a technical improvement over the last gen but at least they got new games,lxrq8vl,4.0,1gu507a

comment,lxrynw8,None,,1,2024-11-18 16:28:01,,,,They still do Like Metaphor refantazio Hogwarts Legacy Sonic Frontiers The rest of the games are either games I dont care about or remakes and I dont see remakes as new games,lxrxw63,5.0,1gu507a
comment,lxs6hjr,CrazyDaimondDaze,,2,2024-11-18 17:07:51,,,,Its also important to note Japan usually keeps releasing games on the older Play Station console for a longer period of time than other countries so thats why they still release new games on PS4 still They did the same with the PS Vita when elsewhere it was already dead same with the PSP And yeah while remakes are cool too loved Resident Evil 2 Remake the most they still arent new games because they took an already existing concept,lxrynw8,6.0,1gu507a
comment,lxs7ikq,None,,2,2024-11-18 17:13:05,,,,Yeah but since I mostly care about Japanese games I listed them But afaik some western games also get released on last gen like latest cod games As for PS vita It was dead everywhere except Japan where it was selling well They stopped producing PS vita only in 2019 because of that,lxs6hjr,7.0,1gu507a

comment,lxvnsjo,Jedibug,,1,2024-11-19 04:39:28,,,,Used to test for Back Compat on one of the major systems years ago Specifically for a new console title upscale It was a long and tedious process that involved playing a game end to end multiple times while the screen flashes every few seconds taking screenshots Without getting too much into it There were a lot of problems from a testing perspective I can only hope the process has been improved,lxr7sjf,1.0,1gu507a
comment,lxtqf1o,rolfraikou,,0,2024-11-18 21:49:28,,,,I was skeptical as soon as upscaling came into play Nvidia did it very well I still dont use it because I dont like the way it looks So imagining it done by a company that has put less time and research into it I could only imagine it looking worse,lxr7sjf,1.0,1gu507a
comment,lxwstab,Fredasa,,0,2024-11-19 11:24:45,,,,It was always such a misbegotten idea If a game is forcing you to choose between 4K and 60fps that means it was designed to run at 4K30 andor 1440p60and the modest GPU boost of the Pro is not going to make up the difference for 4K60 in either case full stop There is a _tiny tiny_ market for people who have _n_ dollars to spend on a gaming platform but dont have the _n_ 11 dollars it would take to get an equivalent PC and finally be free of the shackles of console gaming So what is the incentive The 2 or 3 noteworthy console exclusives that Sony managed to eke out this year Sony must be hoping that consumers havent noticed that even Japanese devs are starting to give up on the dream of console exclusivity starting with the likes of Square Enix,lxr7sjf,1.0,1gu507a

comment,lxrp6b9,zarafff69,,2,2024-11-18 15:37:50,,,,Who knows Maybe its actually worse when up scaling from a lower resolution Honestly up scaling from 1440p4k wasnt really the big issue FSR is already kinda ok with that Its just that everything lower than that just makes FSR fall apart And loooots of games on the PS5 run at like 720p to 1080p internally So if PSSR doesnt fix that thats kinda bad Especially because DLSS 1080p4k still looks rather perfect imo,lxrhzuu,2.0,1gu507a

comment,lxv86wq,Demonchaser27,,1,2024-11-19 02:56:09,,,,This makes sense and all but I feel like these upscaling technologies are gonna be really hit or miss until its literally just plug n play for devs Because Ive literally seen some bad implementations of DLSS UI smearing sometimes blurry ghosting where another game has little to none on similar things etc Upscaling tech is just a shit show right now honestly This is kind of why I said in the past that to the malais of some hardcore tech redditors in another sub this shit isnt going to be sustainableworkable unless theres a solid nonhardware locked nonspecific implementation thats easy to use and pretty much universal Even DLSS cannot claim this It often requires help by Nvidia to do wellright and requires their specific hardware to work AMD is closer in that its universal and apparently easier to implement but doesnt take advantage of AI hardware to help it when it could it should honestly have two modes for better compatibility AND explicit use of hardware And as such it often looks god awful in some way or another And XeSS I mean its cool and looks good in the few times Ive seen it But apparently not really performant enough and still requires AI hardware only I suppose in future it could replace AMDs solution when every single GPU has enough AI powered components to make good use of it and no one is on preAI compatible GPUs Maybe But regardless its a fucking mess right now for devs and for everyone else who has to play games with this crap required I think were past the devs need to do better thing At a certain point if its a large enough problem you just gotta accept facts that people arent going to get better at it and instead we probably just have to improve the tech to be easier to use If its this bad we can call people lazy and get upset all day but at a certain point we might just need to make the shit simpler to use while still getting mostall of the benefits Otherwise this is just going to keep being a problem,lxrhzuu,2.0,1gu507a

comment,lxri2l5,Eruannster,,30,2024-11-18 14:58:07,,,,The issue here is also that Jedi Survivor is an incredibly messy game techwise And Respawn just does not give that many shits about fixing issues The performance mode was pretty much just completely broken for months after release because they tried slapping on a bunch of raytracing features and it completely tanked both performance and resolution and in turn image quality,lxre438,2.0,1gu507a
comment,lxrj3rl,pinkynarftroz,,-3,2024-11-18 15:04:05,,,,Honest question Is it just nitpicking or does it ruin the game I ask because Digital Foundry completely shit on FF7 Rebirths performance mode and yet when I played it in 1080p it didnt look bad at all All I noticed were some lower res textures in places if you actually stopped to look It feels like they over blow lots of things that are small and dont really matter in motion during the heat of the game,lxri2l5,3.0,1gu507a

comment,lxs07l1,DriftMantis,,6,2024-11-18 16:35:58,,,,When dlss first game out like forever ago at this point Gen 1 had some artifacting However at this point generally the image is more stable than native using modern dlss Upscaling to 4k from 1080p looks far superior to native 1080p like the other commenter stated I think you just got to play around with it to get the best image quality Generally I set the base resolution to something I can run close to 60fps maxed out and then use dlss quality to boost the game to 90100fps You can also use dlaa in some games which is using the technology to add antialiasing over the native image so dlss can be used even when youre not upscaling to boost frame rates,lxrg1if,4.0,1gu507a

comment,lxs868d,FUTURE10S,,3,2024-11-18 17:16:23,,,,Thing is when youve got something like Toy Story rendering it at 2K or 4K doesnt matter as much because its got a bunch of samples per pixel making basically flawless antialiasing Even then the resolution bump would be noticeable to those trying to find a difference By contrash video games are usually 1 sample per pixel and they benefit way more from going from 2K to 4K as a result since youre literally quadrupling the amount of samples you have on the screen Now 2K with 4xSSAA vs 4K thats when its going to be a bit less clear which is which as the line gets a little harder to spot each time with every additional set of samples but a difference is still there Also their effects take minutes to render per frame We cant really do that in video games,lxrifo4,4.0,1gu507a

comment,lxs8wnm,ConcreteSnake,,5,2024-11-18 17:20:05,,,,100 agree I dont understand why people seem to base the merit and potential of the PS5 Pro on 1 or 2 games that happen to look worse while there are a dozen other games that look better We dont do that with PC hardware we look at multiple games and the performance increase averaged across those games Hell even DLSS when it first launched 6 years ago was hot garbage Its on the develops to make good use of the additional hardware and features If the game ends up looking worse its on them not Sony the hardware manufacturer,lxrhq7f,1.0,1gu507a

comment,lxsmlk8,NickCharlesYT,,4,2024-11-18 18:28:39,,,,That doesnt surprise me if you know what youre looking for these upscaling techs always look worse even on PC in my eyes Ive tried DLSS 30 for the first time recently and it was jarring how bad it looked compared to the native resolution and the ghosting was horrific in some games Luckily my GPU can run games at native most of the time cant imagine trying to make DLSS work properly with a lesser card Like it does antialiasing better but thats about it actual details get lost so frequently,,0.0,1gu507a
comment,lxtkgrl,Jiopaba,,1,2024-11-18 21:19:22,,,,Yeah DLSS and similar techs arent expected to look equally as good as or better than the native resolution Theyre just supposed to look worse by as little as possible while still giving performance benefits In that regard a game thats DLSS upscaled from 1080p to 4K doesnt look as good as would at native 4K but depending on your specific tolerances for the kinds of artifacts it makes it can look a lot better than native 1080p while still retaining much of the performance benefit Its just weird because so much of the other technology that was developed around it was more about making things look better whereas this was just about making them look less worse,lxsmlk8,1.0,1gu507a

comment,lxxc47z,pholan,,1,2024-11-19 13:48:44,,,,Not really Sony has told us that PSSR is using an AIbased upscaler that is similar to DLSS albeit trained by Sony rather than NVIDIA FSR is an algorithmic upscaler with manually tweaked and designed heuristics to minimize artifacting In the games where it works well PSSR is generating a somewhat less stable rendition of fine details than FSR but massively reduces the artifacts around moving objects and seems to do substantially better with translucent objects,lxsdnez,2.0,1gu507a

comment,lxtccsl,None,,1,2024-11-18 20:38:42,,,,Part of it is actual incompetence The other part comes from being lazy and wanting profit over performance Jedi survivor was not as good as the first one And on top of that had loads and loads of issues Apexs competitors are thriving when compared to Apex And a lot of that has to do with how theyve been focusing more and more on selling skins rather than a working game or more actual content Yes theyre 100 carrying EAs brand of releasing and managing bad games that are only about extracting money from its users No EAs sports games are the ones actually carrying the company,lxtanef,4.0,1gu507a
