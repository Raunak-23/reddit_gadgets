comment,my3o5qk,jake3988,,14,2025-06-16 16:08:09,,,,IOP increases a lot right before waking So having a doctors appointment where they check my pressure first thing in the morning is probably a bad idea and will give unnecessarily high readings Im not aware of this but Ill have to investigate and see if this is actually true In which case Ill start scheduling my appointments for the afternoon and see if theres a difference,,0.0,1lcqro0
comment,my3uygc,Notactuallyashark,,34,2025-06-16 16:41:17,,,,Hi Optometrist here Keep your AM appts IOP increases while BP decreases or your body is in a horizontal position It fluctuates even more with patients with glaucoma We want to catch your highest readings we can so we can give an accurate risk assessment If you dont have glaucoma this spike wont affect your IOP enough to be unreliable and theres checks retests and other scans necessary before glaucoma is even diagnosed or any treatment is initiated So no need to worry about that,my3o5qk,1.0,1lcqro0
comment,my76kob,StMongo,,2,2025-06-17 02:56:22,,,,Pretty cool tech but I cant imagine wearing contacts 247 just for health monitoring Hope they make it work with glasses too,,0.0,1lcqro0
comment,myk18jh,bonesnaps,,2,2025-06-19 01:29:51,,,,To my knowledge glaucoma is extremely easy to identify by an optometrist This seems wildly unnecessary,,0.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2hd76,funwithdesign,,-34,2025-06-16 12:22:00,,,,Hmmm Lets invent something that monitors something while you are asleep using something that isnt a great idea to wear while you are asleep,,0.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2nyxn,FlorydaMan,,53,2025-06-16 13:03:38,,,,I know you might not do it with ill intention but I find these Heh I know more than these experts heres a funny remark about how dumb their proposal is comments really exhausting in this platform,my2hd76,1.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2r8vp,funwithdesign,,-33,2025-06-16 13:22:34,,,,Just pointing out that given how much doctors recommend NOT wearing contact lenses while sleeping its kind of odd that someone would invest time and money to develop something that is precisely that,my2nyxn,2.0,1lcqro0
comment,my39we7,mossymochis,,27,2025-06-16 14:59:29,,,,It takes one Google search to find an entire market of overnight wear approved contact lenses you can have prescribed by doctors I dont know why you think no one working on these has considered the risks of overnight wear Im sure thats something theyre weighing in their design and in their cost benefit analysis,my2r8vp,3.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2t3sy,FlorydaMan,,22,2025-06-16 13:33:09,,,,This is like saying omg I cant believe doctors prescribed me drugs given how much doctors recommend NOT doing drugs,my2r8vp,3.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2txee,TwoBionicknees,,-31,2025-06-16 13:37:49,,,,it really isnt No one at all gains a single benefit from wearing contacts while asleep You can gain a slim benefit of the time saved to put them in again but for anyone who has worn contact lenses youre talking about literal seconds and all to give your eyes no break from them which is a bad idea Also there is precisely zero need in the world to notice the signs of glaucoma within minutes of it happening none ever Its not like a brain bleed or a stroke in which detection the second it starts can change treatment success rates and survival massively its something that develops over time and being caught in weeks rather than months is maybe something that ends up being beneficial adds a cost provides literally no benefits only has downsides,my2t3sy,4.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2vgjo,MarvinMonroeZapThing,,21,2025-06-16 13:46:20,,,,Did you guys actually READ the article Basically this is the same argument as why is Apple developing a foldable phone when I dont have a need for one First off its in the experimental stages and if an actual product comes out of this it might be very different from whats being tested now Thats kind of the point of science Second even the article mentions the tech could find its way to eyeglasses some day Third the article explains the importance of rapid diagnosis Personally I see my optometrist once a yearnot often enough for any sort of rapid diagnosis of glaucoma And lastly I know people who wear 30day lenses only taking them out to replace them Im no expert as to whether thats a good idea or beneficial but it is a thing,my2txee,5.0,1lcqro0
comment,my2y4sy,TwoBionicknees,,-15,2025-06-16 14:00:40,,,,Basically this is the same argument as why is Apple developing a foldable phone when I dont have a need for one no its not stop making terrible analogies Firstly doctors never say dont take drugs for high bloodpressure they say dont do heroin and even if they are prescribing you drugs they will say dont do heroin Your argument was as if magically doctors say dont do drugs but then will provide you with black tar heroin and say its cool which is an awful argument This isnt a phone that you dont want that others do want and there IS an upside a folding phone can provide a bigger overall screen space in the same smallest package me not wanting it doesnt change that Personally I see my optometrist once a yearnot often enough for any sort of rapid diagnosis of glaucoma jesus christ man Did YOU read the article there are already contact lenses that do this they just arent designed to be worn at night You can already diagnose glaucoma ridiculously easily Although there already are smart contact lenses that monitor the eyes for signs of glaucoma the devices are typically only worn when the patient is awake A new type of contact lens however watches over the eyes throughout the night too THIS IS LITERALLY THE FIRST PARAGRAPH No making them wearable at night wont translate them to eyewear any more than the existing contacts do NO finding out you have glaucoma at 3am and waking up with dry eyes and potential damage because you wore contacts over night rather than finding out at 10am when you put your day contacts in holds zero benefit this isnt an argument of a contact that enables detection vs none and having to go to an optician or doctor this is an argument of a lens that can already detect glaucoma vs one you can wear at night that costs more and detects a completely non emergent health issue that a few extra hours notice will provide zero benefit in any situation ever Im no expert as to whether thats a good idea or beneficial but it is a thing two people told you it was instead of looking it up you decided to try to counter with a thing yes longer term contacts are a thing they are thinner take more expensive materials to allow higher breatheability so that your eyes take less damage from wearing the contacts the goal for longer term wear is as thin as possible with as few things blocking your eye from getting oxygen A lens with more layers and substances so it can be a smart lens is the antithesis of longer term wear contacts,my2vgjo,6.0,1lcqro0
