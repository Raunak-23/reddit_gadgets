comment,mcrecyx,AmNoSuperSand52,,31,2025-02-14 17:19:35,,,,My only concern is the weight It could be like the weight of a normal IPhoneGalaxy or its going to be twice as much Which doesnt sound like a big deal until youre wearing anything other than tight pants with a belt holding them up,,0.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcvlp09,Sakkarashi,,13,2025-02-15 09:24:13,,,,Itll probably be about the same as a normal phone similar to the other trifold on the market,mcrecyx,1.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcxqm4f,AmNoSuperSand52,,5,2025-02-15 18:06:53,,,,But whats a normal phone weight A Galaxy Fold Z weighs 33 more than an iPhone pro Thats a hefty gain and thats just one additional hinge not two,mcvlp09,2.0,1ipa4qo

comment,md19g03,criticalt3,,1,2025-02-16 06:29:23,,,,Regardless its going to be able to be ruined by a fingernail and cost more than buying a new phone and tablet combined I get the appeal but its impractical even still because of how fragile these foldable displays are,mcrecyx,1.0,1ipa4qo
comment,n18zgfz,JohnnyTwoLegs,,1,2025-07-04 03:57:51,,,,Ive been using the Z fold for a few years now I almost exclusively use the inner fold screen Im typing this on it now As long as your fingernails arent ridiculously long and pointy theres no risk I sometimes put off clipping my nails because Im lazy like that My Fold 4 screen is still in perfect condition despite heavy daily use,md19g03,2.0,1ipa4qo
comment,n19bwff,criticalt3,,1,2025-07-04 05:33:03,,,,Inner screen cracking from daily use is a known issue with the Z Fold Flip and its been demonstrated that a finger nail can leave permanent damage If youre lucky enough to have yours hold up all this time Im happy for you but its not a risk the average consumer is going to take which was my only point I baby my electronics and I still wouldnt consider getting one due to hinge and wear problems over time that has been observed,n18zgfz,3.0,1ipa4qo
comment,n19izqj,JohnnyTwoLegs,,2,2025-07-04 06:33:23,,,,Maybe its a known issue because the average user treats their devices like shit Ive also never broken a phone screen and I cant understand how so many people do Perhaps the key is just treating the device as if it was fragile and you want to trade it in in near perfect condition when the time comes to upgrade,n19bwff,4.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mctz73w,CosmicOwl47,,8,2025-02-15 01:26:45,,,,This is why Im not excited about these yet The potential is there but I kept my last iPhone for 6 years and it worked great until the last few months and it felt like the right time to upgrade Until one of these foldables can last multiple years without screen damage Im gonna stick with solid phones,mcs5czp,1.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcucyn5,killingtime1,,1,2025-02-15 02:55:04,,,,You mean single fold This is the bifold 2 folds Title is wrong its not 3 folds its 2 folds 3 screen segments To answer your question sort of Ive had three Z Folds in span of 2 years Fold 4 was very unreliable Fold 5 has been great so far,mcs5czp,1.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcuuhv0,joe_bibidi,,10,2025-02-15 05:00:16,,,,Two halves that fold together is called a Bifold Google bifold wallet and trifold wallet Bifolds have one fold two sections Trifolds have two folds three sections Similarly google bifold door or trifold pamphlet The count refers to the number of sections not the number of folding points,mcucyn5,2.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcv2hxb,killingtime1,,0,2025-02-15 06:08:44,,,,Fair enough I guess you didnt invent it but it is kind of confusing to call a single screen folded once bifold 2,mcuuhv0,3.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcxnmay,ILikeCutePuppies,,1,2025-02-15 17:52:01,,,,Its only been out for a year and a half Although I must say a good warranty does solve the breaking problem and 4 was better than 3 for me,mcuedzl,3.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcw1wmv,Mental_Medium3988,,2,2025-02-15 12:11:46,,,,i had the fold 3 and other than it not opening full i never had a problem my mom had the flip 3 and the only problem she had was when she accidentally dropped it face down onto the edge of the dogs water bowl and that was after 2 years of use she had to have the screen replaced on her flip 5 because the crease cracked my fold 5 has been extremely durable the screen protector is peeling in the middle so i need to get that fixed otherwise i have zero problems it still opens fully,mcucyn5,2.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mctaamb,HanzoNumbahOneFan,,11,2025-02-14 22:58:54,,,,Oh nice when Huaweis came out I saw the benefits of it over a dual fold Cause it doesnt add an extra screen it just utilizes the outside screen with the inner ones And the form factor when folded is way more useful than a dual fold Like movies dont really work with the dual folds aspect ratio theres still large black bars That being said this is probably gonna cost like 2200 considering the fold costs like 1800 I wouldnt even be surprised if it was closer to 2500,,0.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcrzw1r,iMightBeWright,,3,2025-02-14 19:04:47,,,,Yeah thats the formula for n number of folds based on thickness t width w according to some physics professor at W Texas AM According to him standard letter sized paper actually caps out at 7 folds But if you made the sheet half as thick you could squeeze in an 8th fold,mcrykq6,3.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcqaqle,UnsorryCanadian,,-52,2025-02-14 13:54:10,,,,It took 5 iterations for them to not have a crease in the screen Edit Why are people downvoting me for having a question Ive never seen a single foldable phone in person and Ive only ever seen a review of the Z Fold 1 I didnt even know they made a 3rd one Let alone a fourth and fifth iteration,mcq8akp,2.0,1ipa4qo
comment,mcqcibs,Miraclefish,,28,2025-02-14 14:04:44,,,,Yes because materials science is tricky and creating a screen hinge and mechanisms that can fold and also reverse the crease exactly enough to cover it up without causing damage or causing it to bend outwards instead of in is in fact really difficult to do,mcqaqle,3.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcsxcdk,Abigail716,,4,2025-02-14 21:50:17,,,,Folding phones are kind of boring but trifolding phones are absolutely a great idea A standard folding phone requires two separate screens the smaller front one for when its closed and then the larger internal one Otherwise it requires the back to have a screen thats exposed When its open its not really a good screen ratio for anything either If its triple folding it means you can use one long screen with the other two folds being tucked inside each other for protection It also means when its open the ratio is more akin to a tablet,mcqpe2t,1.0,1ipa4qo

comment,mcs3sod,fvck_u_spez,,0,2025-02-14 19:23:52,,,,Its wild that they essentially hinder you from getting the most out of your devices unless you give up anything by any other brand and only buy their overpriced stuff Im not going to give up my Linux Workstation or my Windows Gaming machine and an iPhone wont allow me to read my text messages or automatically sync files to those systems so an iPhone will never be the right phone for me No physical limitation and as Android has proved these are problems can be solved easily and quite well using 3rd party software But Apple has to flex and prove that you dont actually own the device that you paid a thousand dollars for,mcrjyun,3.0,1ipa4qo
