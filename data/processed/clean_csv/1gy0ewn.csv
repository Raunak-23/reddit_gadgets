comment,lynrlfk,Mama_Skip,,38,2024-11-23 23:57:23,,,,Even if you stick to the same hobby it can be a problem it just stages down I have ADD and like to cook Im generally consistent about it but the problem is my style of hobby progression Ill hyperfixate on researching cobbling together recipes and optimizing a single dish and then randomly without even realizing it get bored and move on And I never remember to write anything down my auto response is Ill do it later ofc so months later Ill be like oh fuck what were the exact steps to the sous vide duck thighs And Ill piece it together but usually feel Ive forgotten a proportion step or ingredient So essentially I master a recipe only to forget it ever happened,lyn8vma,2.0,1gy0ewn
comment,lyowfch,reddits_aight,,25,2024-11-24 04:22:43,,,,Been working on ADHD in therapy and one of the biggest things I learned early on was to write everything down IN ONE PLACE Tasks notes appointments things you want to remember it can be disorganized or messy at first but it cant be scattered Once youve started to form the habit you can work on adding more organization but the first step is centralizing That combined with accepting that no system is perfect so just accept whatever limitations your chosen system has instead of constantly jumping ship to a new calendarnotes platform or just abandoning it,lynrlfk,3.0,1gy0ewn

comment,lynq20y,orbix42,,9,2024-11-23 23:48:02,,,,The better thing to do here would have been to just not say anything rather than contributing to the unnecessary stigma around ADHD and autism No one brought up medication no one brought up autism and no one was making excuses for anything Theres no need to show up yelling about things you dont understand about people you dont know,lynn803,3.0,1gy0ewn
comment,lyoq77u,PuppetPal_Clem,,5,2024-11-24 03:39:26,,,,Those apps have programmed your brain to behave similar to a singular symptom of ADHD Im in my mid 30s with ADHD and never once used tiktok and barely used instagram 10 years ago I was Diagnosed at the age of 10 and because of people like you I convinced myself that it was all fake and refused medication and ruined my life in my 20s and had to start my life over at age 29 ADHD is primarily a dopamine baselevel deficiency in the brain that causes cascading failure of other neurological processes that can cause severe malformation of other regions of the brain Oftentimes it can be controlled with medication and intentional regimenting of ones daily life but to suggest that everyone with ADHD is just a tiktok addict who believes anything they hear is so fucking demeaning that it borders on outright insulting How about you just shut the fuck up about things you literally dont know about hm,lynn803,3.0,1gy0ewn

comment,lynut84,getmoneygetpaid,,6,2024-11-24 00:17:11,,,,The hub mode had 3 pretty major problems problems for me 1 Youtube Music gives me Ads even though Im a subscriber Because Google a clusterfuck the Youtube Music team pointed me to the Pixel and the Pixel Team pointed me to the Youtube Music Team If nobody is supporting this problem I cant imagine itll get fixed 2 The dock sounds like shit Slightly better than my Gen 1 Nest Mini and slightly worse than my Gen 2 Nest Mini both of which were given away for free It actually has the same speaker as the Nest Mini so that makes a lot of sense Not even close to my other Google Home speakers For 130 I was expecting it to sound like a Nest Hub at least My other tablets speakers sounds better than the Pixel Tablets dock 3 Adding it to a Chromecast audio group with nonGoogle devices Sony Onkyo would cause those devices to not work in the group any more So yeah halfbaked to say the least Id argue not fit for purpose,lyli2yh,1.0,1gy0ewn

comment,lyok0fd,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,0,2024-11-24 02:58:19,,,,I dont think theres any good reason for the average person to even consider an Android tablet iPad completely outclasses Android on tablets and its not even close Despite Samsungs valiant efforts the OS support isnt there and the app support isnt there It would be one thing if they offered a compelling value but the entrylevel iPad is pretty fantastic at the 300 price point 250 on sale every holiday and various other times If you spend 300 or less on an Android tablet youre getting a barelyusable piece of shit Samsung makes the absolute best Android tablets and Ive had and enjoyed several over the years but the cheap ones arent good and the good ones arent cheap But even when the hardware and 1stparty software are good Android doesnt scale up well and app developers dont give half a shit about Android tablets,lylzf15,2.0,1gy0ewn

comment,lylvv27,hyperforms9988,,8,2024-11-23 17:38:09,,,,Eh I feel like this is in a different category This is not like something like Stadia where its an entire proprietary platform and when they stop supporting that then all your shit is gone the related devices are rendered completely worthless and cant do anything anymore and theres no alternative device out there that can access the same thing This is a tablet running Android If they stop making tablets then get an Android tablet made by somebody else when its time to get a new one Who gives a shit The only loss to anybody here is if somehow somebody is a Google tablet loyalist and refuses to buy anything but Google tablets and I dont know how many of those people are out there Its the software that matters in a tablet Android clearly isnt going anywhere and your shit is tied to a Google account and not a physical device If what theyve already built and released is going to get regular OS and security updates then Google not making any more tablets is frankly meaningless If theyre dropping OSsecurity update support early because theyve dropped physical hardware support then thats where this would be a bigger deal I have an Android tablet and I cant say its completely useless but its little more than an alarm clock a web browser and a Discord screen for me A simple jailbrokenrooted Amazon Fire tablet can do that for me Pixel Tablet at regular price is 700 CDN for 128GB of storage Are you insane But then again Im only looking at it for what I would use a tablet for Its on a Black Friday sale on Amazon for 500 CDN currently I can get an Amazon Fire HD 8 for 65 CDN for 32GB of storage on a Black Friday sale Fire HD 10 with 64GB is going for 170 CDN on sale You can get Samsung Android tablets for cheaper too Google has no chance trying to charge people that much money for a tablet,lyl0ptv,1.0,1gy0ewn
comment,lyo5oka,ArchusKanzaki,,2,2024-11-24 01:25:34,,,,The problem with Google not having any investment on tablet is that everyone else can only do so much to push the OS Samsung is doing the herculean task of being the only company pushing for premium android tablet experience and built so many things expected of premium tablet nowadays that Google just did not 700 CDN for 128 GB Thats what Ipad Mini and Air users are paying right now Ipad Mini is literally the only option left for premium 78 tablet Being honest having Ipad Mini for several years is part of the reason why I switched to iOS recently,lylvv27,2.0,1gy0ewn
comment,lyn4b15,atomic1fire,,-5,2024-11-23 21:39:15,,,,I feel like the thing that helps and hinders Android as a whole is that its essentially Windows but mobile You can find a windows PC at nearly any price but a low end mac is always going to beat a low end Windows PC just because the cheapest mac will still have better hardware If you go with a manufacturer that makes a decent flagship device running android youll have a decent android device but most people arent going to pay a higher cost for an android device Plus I think chromebooks and foldable models are probably more emphasized in general and it wouldnt shock me at all if a merger between Chrome OS and Android resulted in better marketing for Android,lylvv27,2.0,1gy0ewn

comment,lyo1kak,gio5568,,3,2024-11-24 00:58:43,,,,I cant say Im surprised The pixel tablet just seems like a very niche product If youre buying it to be a home hub with the dock its 500 which is kinda wild to me I could buy several different combinations of the nest hubnest hub max and have home control and media streaming for that much money If I got all nest hubs the smaller one I could have one in almost every room in my house lol On the tablet side even 400 is a lot for a based on audience probably a casuallyseldom used android tablet iPad has just dominated that space for so long and you can get one for less than that now that does everything the average user would want and its not a first gen product so theres more consumer confidence for an iPad over this I would think Neat idea but it doesnt seem to perform any better than the nest hub as a home controlhub device and based on market share not many people seem to buy android tablets in general unless its a cheap one for their kids because who cares if your 5 yr old drops the 60 Walmart special tablet versus a larger 400 tablet Ok rant over fun idea but meh doesnt surprise me they may cancel it And at least make the 129 speaker sound better than a nest mini rather buy two of those and set them up as a grouppair for less than the dock if music and sound quality was my main use case,,0.0,1gy0ewn
