comment,m9jxlob,drealph90,,23,2025-01-28 00:38:32,,,,The hardware is still abandoned but Google has released the source code so Pebble lovers can get proper community firmware updates Edit So apparently I didnt read the article thats actually linked on this post I was jumping to conclusions because I had read earlier this day about Google releasing the source code for the pebble watch OS The linked article is about the founder of Pebble watch trying to revive the hardware now that the source code for Pebble OS has been released,m9ixo8o,1.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9k1bux,celticchrys,,44,2025-01-28 00:58:21,,,,and the article linked is about how the original founder of Pebble has announced that hes bringing back some version of the hardware Now that the software is finally open sourced he can legally use it again for a new device,m9jxlob,2.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9o7uz9,audigex,,3,2025-01-28 17:50:43,,,,Volume control is the main reason I sometimes still wear my gen1 Apple Watch my AirPods have playpause next track etc but no volume control I dont really care about most of the rest of what the Watch does I dont use the fitness stuff and although notifications could be handy when I worked in the office I work from home now so a glance at my phone isnt a problem so a watch with a long battery life that was more focused on music control notifications wouldnt hurt would suit me down to the ground these days,m9iwuk0,1.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9o64s2,audigex,,6,2025-01-28 17:42:50,,,,It could be revived but it would require time and effort to recreate the propriety code that couldnt be released If we know what that removed code does and how this code expects to interact with it its almost always possible to recreate it or create something that does a similarenough job The question is whether someone is volunteering to do that or if not whether someone eg a company like Pebble is going to pay someone to do it,m9lpr5l,5.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9ksv8g,dgsharp,,6,2025-01-28 03:28:53,,,,My Garmin Vivoactive 5 lasts most of a week I would have stuck with Pebble Was a great watch It died after a few years and Ive been through a couple of alternatives I miss being able to do quick text responses even if they were just canned options none of my newer smart watches have supported that Id have an Apple Watch but the battery life just seems like a nonstarter for me,m9j31nh,1.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9lj7or,KryanSA,,2,2025-01-28 06:40:20,,,,The last 46 years of Samsung galaxy smartwatches have had quick and manual typed or spoken replies for text messages The introduction of Google Wear initially slashed battery life but thats finally been resolved with the latest watches My Galaxy Watch Ultra can go 57 days with the AOD off Im going to assume youre an iPhone user which is why your newer smartwatches havent supported that Thats a youiPhone problem though From Apples perspective you use an Apple watch or nothing,m9ksv8g,2.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9jth3e,ThatLaloBoy,,14,2025-01-28 00:16:36,,,,For what its worth Amazfits wearables also last 14 days and can do all that plus work as a fitness tracker And it can do that with a touchscreen and color display Im willing to go back to Pebble if they release a good product with a nice design though The Pebble Round is still my favorite wearable ever,m9jb12z,2.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9n4x8t,wizard7926,,1,2025-01-28 14:43:30,,,,Touchscreen is a nonstarter for me Every watch Ive tried with a touchscreen becomes useless in any situation involving water despite being waterproof Meanwhile my Pebble works perfectly in the pool shower washing dishes bathtime you name it,m9jth3e,3.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9jyihe,Orjnd,,14,2025-01-28 00:43:22,,,,Always on display long battery life buttons and the philosophy of not being a smartphone on your wrist Really open platform lots of community made watchfaces and watchapps,m9j9j30,1.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9lkl7y,netver,,2,2025-01-28 06:52:53,,,,Youre essentially describing Garmin without the sports part,m9jyihe,2.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9ma8mt,Orjnd,,1,2025-01-28 11:16:20,,,,Yeah garmin is great too Theyre sports watches first very serious but in my opinion the non sports part feels clunkier a bit of an aftertought and doesnt have the same wide variety of apps and watchfaces could be different today the garmin I own is older Pebble was frequently releasing OS updates fleshing out the software and the app and watchface community was really active because that was the essence of the device,m9lkl7y,3.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9l2io0,Blastcheeze,,9,2025-01-28 04:30:01,,,,Its actually a smart watch rather than a halfbaked computer thats too small It does notifications step tracking music control and its got physical buttons The eink screen and lack of unnecessary features means you can get about a week on one charge easily with the screen always on Plus you can see it out in sunlight,m9j9j30,1.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9kpk1b,SpartyEsq,,6,2025-01-28 03:09:50,,,,I loved that it was a smartwatch that didnt look like one I always feel like a dork with a suit and a google pixel watch or the like,m9j9j30,1.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9mx5ik,zovits,,5,2025-01-28 14:00:16,,,,It was the first actually usable SmartWatch I used to wear a watch 024 and none of the other models could be used the same way put it on glance on it whenever you want to know the time and forget about it otherwise Its visible in daylight waterproof lightweight and has a small profile has great battery life 710 days and the first gen could even be charged while being worn Also it does not try to do things it could only do suboptimally,m9j9j30,1.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9j65uz,None,,10,2025-01-27 22:16:09,,,,Oh wow I still have my black Pebble Steel I loved that thing A relatively inexpensive robust and longer lasting per charge replacement to the Apple Watch would get worn quite a bit I suspect,,0.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9l2mdp,SuperRob,,2,2025-01-28 04:30:43,,,,Oof This is like those dumb phones trying to get you to see value in the limited functionality we had a decade or more ago The problem is our expectations changed I still have my Pebble in a drawer At the time I loved it for the basic functionality and customization it offered But the biggest issue was that it couldnt integrate into iOS at the level I really wanted So the basic functionality it offered didnt really meet my needs but it was the best there was at the time And then Apple came out with the Apple Watch and allowed the deeper integration Then they added health and fitness tracking And while I hate the battery life on my Apple Watch Im not willing to give up the functionality and go back to something like Pebble,,0.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9konyb,SSG_Vegeta,,1,2025-01-28 03:04:48,,,,These were my favorite watches I ended up buying every color on eBay when they sold to Fitbit and ran them for a while Alas the Apple Watch won out and while Im fond of them Im not too sure they could woo me A pebble phone though Something my iPhone could forward to or something for when I dont need to be tempted by it I might jive with that Give me a 2 week battery life and barebones text and calling with e ink screen and were cooking,,0.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9lfyn3,Practical-Custard-64,,1,2025-01-28 06:11:47,,,,I had the original Pebble Steel back in the day It had a chronic design fault that meant that the connection to the screen wasnt secure and it showed garbled patterns I went through 3 of them and shortly before the company went belly up they wanted to upgrade me to the Pebble Time which just looked and felt like a cheap piece of plastic They refused to let me have a Pebble Time Steel even if I paid the extra I really liked the Pebble Steel when it worked but didnt like the downgrade to the Pebble Time I went out and bought an Android Wear which later became WearOS watch The LG Urbane if memory serves,,0.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9lipr7,npete,,1,2025-01-28 06:35:52,,,,I think I owned 5 OG retail Pebbles total My first two iirc had bad vibe motors Then I had a couple that had display issues and I think my last one still worked but after so many failing Pebbles I was ready to move on and not wait for the last one to fail especially since the Pebble company was shutting down To clarify these were all replaced under the warranty though the last couple were beyond the original warranty but the replacements failed so soon after I got them that they replaced them under the repair warranty Anyway I loved using the Pebble It was so simple and intuitive and I thought they looked great on my wrist That said I dont know that Ill be preordering one or anything because I am still feeling pretty burned All these years later,,0.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9ra30y,ant1992,,1,2025-01-29 02:50:55,,,,Genuine question How is pebble going to compete 10 years later with everyone having an Apple Watch or samsung watch on their wrists I had a pebble and it was amazing People recognized it and always asked about it before Apple Watch was released Pebble was gaining heavy traction until apple came through and Fitbit acquired them I dont see any hype happening unless they market the shit out if it I can only see the hype for a very small niche market Unless the keep it low cost and dominate on Amazon above the cheap Chinese watches that barely work,,0.0,1ibkayl

comment,m9ky4lo,thewolfman2010,,1,2025-01-28 04:01:04,,,,Im confused by reading his blogs He intends to bring back Pebble in almost an identical format as the original yet expects it to be a different outcome I fail to see how this will succeed other than being a cheap smartwatch that most people wont want I was an original Pebble backer and had one when they launched I dont see that with beefed up specs competing with Apple Garmin etc,,0.0,1ibkayl
comment,m9lny3q,ralphonsob,,1,2025-01-28 07:24:37,,,,I could still see a light cheap watch with long battery life with smart functions like notification display and music control having a pretty good market Like a modernized Casio digital watch How they havent updated those in 40 years is beyond me The customizable display would give it fashion appeal too,m9ky4lo,1.0,1ibkayl
