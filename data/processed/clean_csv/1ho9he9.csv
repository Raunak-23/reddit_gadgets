comment,m4aeqjn,kfmush,,17,2024-12-29 01:55:00,,,,I dont see any mention of a gyroscope on that slide It mentions an accelerometer which is not the same thing An accelerometer just reads acceleration in a direction it doesnt do anything for rotation and isnt very accurate for even what it does on the scale of movements a controller would experience Theyre usually used just for gesture inputs and not for accurate pointing Heres hoping its a typo and it has a gyroscope,m493z0e,2.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4bk3na,Ok_Resolution7047,,3,2024-12-29 06:54:22,,,,I think you might be confused about the term accelerometer There are accelerometer arrays for guidance systems that are microg accurate and could record your pulse if you were touching the case,m4aeqjn,3.0,1ho9he9

comment,m49vvwr,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-29 00:05:32,,,,Ill have something I can tolerate using for when PS5 emulation gets in full swing Cant handle having the primary analog stick well below where my thumb rests naturally Theres a reason why even Nintendo has finally thrown in the towel on their precious symmetry The Xbox layout just works the best,m49bx7e,3.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4a0cvr,Ghisteslohm,,15,2024-12-29 00:30:52,,,,Nintendos special symmetry sounds funny to me because almost every Nintendo console had a different button layout for the last 30 years They seem to be the most likely to switch it up,m49vvwr,4.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4a4kpz,Fredasa,,2,2024-12-29 00:54:18,,,,Exactly Theyve tried everything they can but crucially when it came to their pro controllers they were very married to symmetry no matter what it cost the actual ergonomics It says a heck of a lot that theyve finally given it up Ill consider the transition complete when they figure out what angle works best for the side grips Ie when they copy that from Xbox as well,m4a0cvr,5.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4bw22x,KingofSkies,,1,2024-12-29 08:57:30,,,,I really want a wii u pro controller layout with 4 back buttons I think itd be neat And while Im at it the disparity between prices and availability of good aftermarket controllers for switch VS for ps5 is ridiculous Want gyro rumble Bluetooth connect and 4 back buttons And hall effect sticks OK for switch thatll be 60 For ps5 Doesnt exist Closest you can get starts at 180 Premium tax or Sony gatekeeping whatever the cause its bloody annoying,m4a7axo,7.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4aeicz,Fredasa,,0,2024-12-29 01:53:36,,,,I actually bust that out whenever I play anything _Robotron_like Basically my hands like it when the thumbs are permitted to rest above the primary controls the majority of the time In most games that means control stick on left main buttons on right I dont envy Sonys position on this You can bet theyd like to be able to provide something more ergonomic as evinced by how they finally gave up the PS1 grips for something more Xboxlike but I think theyre aware that their fanbase would be out for blood if they fixed the left analog sticks legacy position after all these decades,m4a7axo,7.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4chxbl,Ghisteslohm,,1,2024-12-29 12:46:37,,,,But the pro controllers were only on Wii and WiiU right and just as a side option to the main controller Gamecube already kinda had the asymmetrical design and then Switch has it again,m4a4kpz,6.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4f6lt1,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-29 21:51:28,,,,Sure I speak of the relevant history GC controller was essentially an evolution from what they came up with for the N64 A kind of sheepish hybrid between that early effort and what the other makers had cooking As much as I liked the Wavebird I didnt like the variouslysized primary buttons or the octagonal stick resistor Vestiges that Nintendo couldnt immediately abandon It is a good observation though It suggests that Nintendos insistence upon symmetry was part of the marketing package they came up with for the Wii,m4chxbl,7.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4dscf9,Mucher_,,0,2024-12-29 17:36:11,,,,Im on the other side Its uncomfortable and unintuitive for the sticks to be in different positions Never owned an Xbox for this reason and hate the fact that the Switch pro controllers moved the stick That said I also find the dualsense less comfortable and ergonomic than the dualshock 4 I was one of the first to offer my thoughts about the DS and found criticism from both sides of the fence That being said the real path forward imo is to make both sticks the 4 face buttons and the dpad magnetically interchangeable The reality is there will always be people on either side and the first to introduce such a feature will win the game It will also open the path for increased comfort for lefthanded individuals,m49vvwr,4.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4f844g,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-29 21:59:19,,,,Probably will never happen for the inbox pad Expensive prospect with all the downsides of a significant uptick in moving parts What is more likely to happen especially within the context of this very thread is some kind of intercompatibility between platforms and pads which even if arrived at through a third party device is left alone by the first parties Since Microsoft has already made the first significant move Gamepass in the inevitable transition away from core consoles this intercompatibility may well end up being resolved _de facto_ when both parties are simply hosting each of their platforms as GamepassGamepass clone on PCcompatible hardware,m4dscf9,5.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47u2nt,nightpop,,252,2024-12-28 17:15:31,,,,I use an Xbox controller for PC gaming and its still healthy after 4 years My PS5 controllers on the other hand all have stick drift or dead battery or both after 23 years ETA Also my switch pro and joycons are all fine like 6 years in And my PS3 controllers from gd 2010 still work RNGesus works in mysterious ways,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9
comment,m47y70c,user11711,,70,2024-12-28 17:38:00,,,,Ironically the controller thats given me the most issues is the Xbox Elite first model Rubber completely peeled the USB on top doesnt even work anymore The controller still works wireless and it still functions but mostly because I put a silicone cover around it The peeled sides made it annoying to hold All my non elite Xbox controllers work fine,m47u2nt,3.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4pxpnk,LouBerryManCakes,,1,2024-12-31 17:25:40,,,,Elite 2s have a different shell material that almost never peel off like the Elite 1s Much to my pleasant surprise most of mine have issues with the internal batteries connection coming loose which is an easy disassembly and clean bend some pins slightly and they are back to working again I have had a couple bad analog sticks and unlike all the other Xbox controllers the analog sticks are a different style the mechanism that allows them to loosen and tighten means I had to source them elsewhere But overall I like them a lot and choose to use one for my main,m4p59ac,7.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4841zx,GotSmokeInMyEye,,8,2024-12-28 18:09:47,,,,How do you charge it Edit because I realize now that the first gen did in fact have a battery pack All of my elite controllers have been gen 2 and up and only have internal batteries so I didnt know the first one had a battery pack,m47y70c,4.0,1ho9he9

comment,m49h1qn,GotSmokeInMyEye,,2,2024-12-28 22:39:10,,,,Yea I just edited my comment after googling First gen had battery pack but all subsequent models are internal battery with usbc charging only Dont know if thats better or worse tbh My last elite controller lasted like 2 yrs before getting stick drift and then I bought another one thats been going for about a year now So I never had one long enough to see if the battery will start to fail,m49goj7,8.0,1ho9he9

comment,m48q4kp,RabidSeason,,4,2024-12-28 20:09:23,,,,Its not so much random as it is designs My original PS4 controllers purchased whatever year GTAV was ported lasted up until a few years ago and never had stick drift The battery was only lasting for about an hour though so I replaced them New controllers only lasted about two years until they had the drift At that time I looked into how to change the battery and also fix the drift and all the details of taking them apart and it became very clear that they changed a lot of things The old battery was larger and the sticks were better protected from dust And looking back to PS2 and XB360 those NEVER had stick drift issues for however many years decades this is now Things are just built to lower standards now,m47u2nt,3.0,1ho9he9
comment,m485lcz,TehOwn,,16,2024-12-28 18:18:06,,,,None of my controllers have ever had stick drift PS2 controllers all still work perfectly all my original Xbox controllers my Xbox 360 controller both my Xbox Series X controllers all of my Wii controllers and nunchucks Never ever had stick drift Honestly Im not even 100 sure what the issue is but Im guessing its that the sticks dont centre any more,m47u2nt,3.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48cqju,nightpop,,10,2024-12-28 18:56:26,,,,Unless its a different issue for me stick drift is when the console registers you moving the stick even when you arent touching it So youre playing a game you stop moving but your character keeps going Its very annoying and makes any actioney game basically unplayable,m485lcz,4.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48kqf4,ThePowerOfStories,,5,2024-12-28 19:39:45,,,,And makes interacting with menus or any gridlike turnbased system damn near impossible To various degrees its affected three out of the six Xbox controllers Ive bought over the years to use with my PC,m48cqju,5.0,1ho9he9

comment,m48kcvk,None,,1,2024-12-28 19:37:43,,,,as i understand it stick drift usually comes from a joysticks moving parts or the sensors that read them malfunctioning or degrading somehow so its a technical issue more than anything its why you dont see it happen to Hall Effect sensors bc they use magnets and their critical moving parts dont contact each other sticks not centering just comes from playing too much or too hard to some extent its just wear and tear,m48fq8w,6.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48m8au,TehOwn,,3,2024-12-28 19:47:56,,,,Ive definitely played a lot but Ive always been very careful with my belongings especially tech Never threw it in anger almost never dropped it always put it away after using it and kept my tech out of harms way Never had friends who did that to any of my stuff either I do wonder if that has something to do with it I dont really get angry when playing video games or start hammering my controllers With the exception of those things where youre required to spam a button as fast as possible,m48kcvk,7.0,1ho9he9

comment,m48sxfz,None,,3,2024-12-28 20:24:54,,,,i wouldnt be surprised if the disparity in reliability reports stems from a combination of different reasons type of games played how people treat the controller how much they sweat how acidic their skin is who the designer contracts to manufacture it what guidelines the designer gives where the manufacturer sources materials the manufacturers longterm consistency all these things could affect various aspects of a game controller,m48m8au,8.0,1ho9he9

comment,m49g7b4,TehOwn,,1,2024-12-28 22:34:21,,,,I have tens of thousands of hours playing PC games about a third of them on two different Xbox controllers before that decades ago I had a Sidewinder joypad I didnt play a huge amount of Wii mostly just used it for exercise and Skyward Sword but I played a ton of PS2 with two different controllers mostly Final Fantasy 7 8 9 and X but also a bunch of Gran Turismo 2 THPS2 DMC and so many other games that I forget Its PS2 there were so many good games The only time Ive ever had to replace a controller was last year when my infant daughter drooled on a thumbstick and her drool nuked the logic board I took it apart I fix things for a living I still have the spares which will come in handy if I do experience drift in future I played a fuck ton of Xbox but only the OG and almost all of that was using the Duke controllers yes I liked them Never had a single issue Played the absolute shit out of the first two Halo games but also Splinter Cell THPS2X Fusion Frenzy and a ton of other games most of which I imported from Canada because it was cheaper You can think Im a liar but Im not Idk what to say Ive never had stick drift I never abused my controllers either so idk if those are related I just play and dont have issues I think Ive had a sticky bumper before but I forget what controller that was probably my X360 one I used that for ages Both of my PS2 controllers still work great but the thumbsticks have started to deteriorate not the function just the rubber on the outside My nunchucks are absolutely fucked though because they were stored in a closet that got water damaged,m49dh51,7.0,1ho9he9
comment,m49iwq6,valryuu,,5,2024-12-28 22:49:50,,,,Ive only ever had stick drift on the Switch Joycons and Im sure thats just because they do have an inherent design flaw from how their mechanism works compared to normal sticks Everything else Ive used though PS1 2 3 4 Xbox 360 One GC Wii Switch Pro no problems at all,m485lcz,4.0,1ho9he9

comment,m486kth,ciemnymetal,,12,2024-12-28 18:23:25,,,,Xbox playstation switch all use really the exact same cheap potentiometers Even if 1 of potentiometers produced are a badsubpar batch thats still a lot of bad units given the scale of production Eg xbox series xs sold 30 million units Thats 60 million potentiometers 1 is 600k bad units Usually only one stick starts drifting so there are about 600k controllers with a bad potentiometer that will drift early And since people are more likely to complain you will more likely hear from the 600k people who have a drifting xbox controller And if the parts have a higher failure rate the number only goes up Note my numbers arent meant to accurate just to illustrate the scale that even 1 of subpar parts affect hundreds of thousands of people,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47xjo1,Atomiclouch44,,1,2024-12-28 17:34:28,,,,Ive suffered the grips coming off the elite controller but to be honest I think it was sheer overuse and a slight lack of care that did it After a few months it just became the main controller for me and my partner and wed use it for every game even if the paddles werent in use and every app like YouTube Disney After two years of use pretty much every day it started rapidly falling apart and it sucks but I do think its my own fault,m47snkx,3.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4871r7,Mattdodge666,,6,2024-12-28 18:25:56,,,,FPS games can be pretty rough for stick drift especially call of duty now with all the tactical sprint shit they introduced I find myself being pretty hard on my left stick at times My L3 button went on the controller that came with my Xbox in like 6 months I think that was a manufacturer defect I ended up buying a scuff which still uses Xbox sticks and it recently developed awful stick drift after about 2 years of absolutely nothing but I think that might be a motherboard issue because its so extreme out of nowhere The only controller I can genuinely remember developing stick drift for sure was my PS3 controller I went for a controller with hall effects sticks now and am currently loving it,m482gxt,3.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48br0g,namon295,,3,2024-12-28 18:51:12,,,,This is why they really needed to put back buttons on all controllers to be the L3R3 buttons when this started to be a thing Its insane thats really only a feature on high end expensive controllers still,m4871r7,4.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47wown,brapbrapcake,,18,2024-12-28 17:29:51,,,,Im going to ditto this People are too hard on their controllers in general and I have to wonder if them being hard also causes drift Ive never had drift what so ever Ive had the same controllers that came with all their respective consoles and have purchased more only because I like a few paint jobs or limited editions Not to mention the few Ive purchased so I could spray paint some for customizations sake I work in retail and would have people returning Xbox controllers mainly not really any PS controllers and the sticks would be pushed in to oblivion andor be flat out broken and just spinning in place They would always say they play hard but I would tell them you dont need to crush the controller a light touch goes a long way Or they need therapy,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4a5e6v,foreveraloneasianmen,,-1,2024-12-29 00:58:53,,,,Its a stick module which you use to rotate around it supposed to function as it is How are you supposed to light touch the stick when you play games like sports game fortnite or COD where you constantly required to rotate the stick often for fast movement Unless you dont move your character often It also depends on the game you play Watch this short and you know why it just depends how often you rotate your stick especially on the same direction,m47wown,3.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4ajm2y,brapbrapcake,,1,2024-12-29 02:25:29,,,,Light touch as in just literally dont crush the stick in for a click or dont crush it in any one direction as if an analog stick were more analog and if you kept on pushing the stick to the circular edge it would make the stick work better An analog stick only goes so far Youd be surprised in retail how many people dont know that,m4a5e6v,4.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47vfka,cleanerbot,,10,2024-12-28 17:22:56,,,,Old controllers have larger deadzones The reason we see this big change in drift is because series and ps5 controllers have 0 deadzone Meaning the old controllers had to drift alot more before it was noticeable The new controllers drift from slightest problem in the potentiometers Even though they all use the same kind of potentiometers this makes a big difference Graphitepads are really bad and hopefully they all change to tmr or hall effect next gen,m47trgr,3.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4aft2z,MobileVortex,,0,2024-12-29 02:01:39,,,,Dont press so hard You seriously think everyone rotates and presses the stick the same Like what are you going on about here Please actually make a point,m4afmpx,9.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4agaww,foreveraloneasianmen,,0,2024-12-29 02:04:45,,,,You seriously think everyone rotates and presses the stick the same When did i say that we are talking about rotation here You dont press your stick unless you are activating L3 or R3 Now you are accusing me randomly,m4aft2z,10.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4ai9rh,MobileVortex,,0,2024-12-29 02:17:03,,,,Sir Madam I understand how thumbsticks work I have replaced quite a few of them over the years for friends who go ham on theirs Yes normal wear and tear can cause stick drift but not pressing so hard on both the edges when rotating or down when activating makes this happen significantly less Pressing harder or sharper cause the wear and tear of the device as described in the video you linked The fact that you can watch this video and not understand that how you take care of your controller GREATLY affects how long it will last This whole video is pointing that out and somehow youre not getting it lol If you are going through controllers all the time The issue is somewhere between the thumbsticks and the chair,m4ah6de,13.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4airw2,foreveraloneasianmen,,1,2024-12-29 02:20:13,,,,please watch the video again clearly you didnt It depends how often you game and the type of game you cant tell other people to game less to take care of their controller stick And can you please stop talking about pressing the stick why do you keep talking about this please stay in the topic i didnt mention anything about pressing here You are accusing me here,m4ai9rh,14.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4ajlh1,foreveraloneasianmen,,0,2024-12-29 02:25:22,,,,are you stupid or pretend to be stupid some game use alot of dpad some games use alot of stick rotation Do you keep rotate your stick when you are playing a grid base CRPG Im starting to think whether you are actually trolling here,m4aiycy,16.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4akerg,MobileVortex,,1,2024-12-29 02:30:30,,,,dude you are so close to getting it Keep trying Generally its natural to press move rotate more aggressively when playing say competitive shooters Which is why playing these games can result in causing stick drift What I am saying is Its possible to still play these games and not press move rotate as hard as some people do and your controller will last longer This is because it causes less friction within the thumbstick as pointed out in the video you linked Some people grip their controller VERY hard when they are playing these types of games You dont HAVE to do this if you dont your controller will last longer Seriously this is insane to me this is not obvious to you,m4ajlh1,17.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4aks73,foreveraloneasianmen,,1,2024-12-29 02:32:54,,,,how do you know whether that someone abuse their controller stick if their controller drift You have proof I dont play COD or fortnite yet my controller drift so are you assuming i abuse my controller now BTw you are basically agree what i said earlier depends on the game you play hi james i know you are playing COD but could you errgently move your controller stick,m4akerg,18.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4alxcf,foreveraloneasianmen,,0,2024-12-29 02:40:11,,,,you cant tell people to rotate the stick gently or less these sticks are supposed to work as intended So its wear and tear depends on the usage which i mentioned in my first reply point 2 1 You dont rotate the stick often,m4aln0d,22.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4bsdly,Durahl,,1,2024-12-29 08:17:42,,,,Well Users not affected by Stick Drift will generally not rush to the Forums applauding how their stuff doesnt break so yeaa Id also like to think if you break more than one Controller within a short time then perhaps the problem is not just with the device but the user That being said Despite not having any issues with my Elite Controllers I intend to not be buying any newer release unless they come with Hall Effect like Sticks It would cost them like literally nothing to use them instead of Potentiometer based ones but it would solve pretty much anyones woes,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4db248,None,,1,2024-12-29 16:04:29,,,,I think it depends on what games you play often COD and FIFA involve constantly pushing the left joystick in 1 direction Platformers etc seem to have more varied movement on that joystick I have my original dualsense that came with the console that has a bit of stick drift that I use for casual games and a black one I only use for story based games thats got zero drift,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9
comment,m4ebw2u,darktotheknight,,1,2024-12-29 19:14:37,,,,It really depends on what games you play I played Tekken on DualShock and the DPad would break within 3 6 months I was playing Mishimas so it was quite heavy on directional inputs The rubbersilicone was tearing and resulting in skipped inputs Another common issue was Micro USB slot becoming loose pretty quickly leading to disconnects while playing due to us Tekken players always playing over cable for constant and less input delay Stick Drift on PlayStation and Xbox is mostly affecting Call of DutyEgo Shooter players who are wearing off the analogue stick If youre a casual gamer and only play from time to time you probably will never notice any sort of issues with your controller,m47rq1h,2.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47wlcs,DredZedPrime,,2,2024-12-28 17:29:19,,,,See Im the opposite though I play quite a bit and mostly pretty rough games Ive had my PS5 for a few years and only just recently started to notice the slightest bit of drift on my controller and even then only where the game itself is very sensitive to it I dont doubt that the PlayStation controllers are a bit more prone to getting drift than others but I honestly dont see it being nearly as bad as most people try to say,m47vmt0,5.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47ztjq,bigjoe980,,1,2024-12-28 17:46:47,,,,ALPS sticks are inherently flawed for a multitude of reasons biggest of which is they have absolutely no sealing between the actual pad and the housing so dust and debris can and will dust likes to weasel into electronics get in and scuff the pads ps5 controllers in particular have this nasty habit of rubbing off some of the inner plastic when you move it and have it pressed to click L3R3 theres these little like uh support ridges i guess id call them they rub against the corners of the actual metal assembly of the stick housing some of that plastic dust can fall down into the pads not even joking biggest short term fix for stick drift without changing the design to hall effect would just be to quit putting critical game functions on fucking L3R3 granted that doesnt apply to switch joycons but hey those are ALPS too all the major 1st party brands are so you can circle back to the inherent dustdebris issue,m47sotg,3.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4b86rd,makomirocket,,5,2024-12-29 05:12:33,,,,Except it was also an issue on the PS4 dualshock too You cant beat a bigger battery compartment of the Xbox controllers nor their ability to be fully charged with a second battery pack in seconds while I have to play with a cable plugged in for an hour or two if I forget to charge my PS5 controller A rechargeable AA is about 2500 mAh EACH Vs the dualsenses 1500 mAh No comparison,m48dhu6,2.0,1ho9he9

comment,m482mfz,UncleMrBones,,3,2024-12-28 18:01:56,,,,A half pull of the trigger is normal fire but a full pull is the alt fire with significant resistance at the half way point to differentiate the alt fire Furthermore when the alt fire is still charging when it is pulled the vibration of the trigger and the speaker inform you of its cooldown status without taking your eyes off the enemies The haptics also vibrate in the direction of interactive objects so not only does it notify you if your near health you might not see it will let you know exactly where it is even if it isnt visible on the screen,m47x7m4,5.0,1ho9he9
comment,m485obn,whewtang,,0,2024-12-28 18:18:33,,,,For me the ps5 trigger feature on returnal is just annoying Astrobot does a better job with using the features of these controllers But none of that is really all that impressive Id trade all of that for reliability Because either way mine have all had stick drift Some after a couple weeks,m482mfz,6.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48axs5,UncleMrBones,,1,2024-12-28 18:46:52,,,,The way Returnal implanted haptics and the adaptive trigger are designed to make you a better more responsive player which is vital in an intense bullet hell shooter Your always holding the altfire button and as soon as it is ready fire which you will know without ever taking your eyes off the enemy you just have to press the button your already holding a little deeper Any health or consumables will be felt the haptics are unique allowing you to identify it as health or a consumable without looking as you dodge attacks and continue blasting Astro Bot has great haptics but they are implemented purely for enjoyment and dont impact gameplay in any significant way It would be a less enjoyable experience but your platforming wouldnt suffer if you play without the haptics and adaptive triggers I wouldnt say that this is a worse implementation it suits the game perfectly,m485obn,7.0,1ho9he9
comment,m48g459,whewtang,,1,2024-12-28 19:14:35,,,,Personally preference then Im not sure the argument works better by narrowing the discussion Astrobot more effectively highlights what the PS5 controller is capable of Id personally prefer to disable the adaptive trigger on returnal Or any shooters,m48axs5,8.0,1ho9he9

comment,m47xpqx,DredZedPrime,,-4,2024-12-28 17:35:23,,,,See I absolutely hate the joystick placement of XBox style controllers Ive never understood why anyone would prefer it I like the symmetry of having my hands in the same position to be on each stick since thats where they usually spend the majority of the time anyway A removable battery would be nice but like I said Ive never actually ran my DS5 battery down to nothing even playing a good amount in a day Theres always need for breaks and stuff anyway I just throw it on the charger when Im doing anything else in between playing I definitely think the reactive triggers do add a lot to certain games when theyre used well though I do agree that theyre not used as much or always as well as they could be,m47x4o6,6.0,1ho9he9
comment,m487lgm,ThatLowKeyGuy,,-1,2024-12-28 18:28:51,,,,If you think of it ergonomically its more comfy moving your thumb down on the fuller hips of the Xbox controller when using the d pad The DS5 has made it a bit better by elongating the legs but its more strenuous to move your thumb up and like hitting the sides all the time The DS4 and down are the worst for this bc theyre stumpy and dig in to your hand all the time Its not about how good it is now batteries degrade over time and the controllers are pricey The haptics and triggers have been so meh to me And Ive played spider man 2 gow cod and that Astro game The ONE time it really impressed me was swinging in spider man and brushing the top of a tree Its really neat how the controller rustles Other than that Its more annoying than cool tbh Either I dont notice or its like doing way too much for like very short blips Like sure it makes quick time events more fun but thats not why I play games lol The Xbox elite controller has triggers you can set and thats all Ive needed pretty nice to switch between it being a click and like 30 inputs depending on what Im playing but thats up to me,m47xpqx,7.0,1ho9he9

comment,m48muf9,darkbreak,,1,2024-12-28 19:51:17,,,,I hope it comes to fruition A while back Xbox sent out a questionnaire asking players if they wanted to see DualSenselike features in a future Xbox controller They very clearly saw the DualSense as a remarkable piece of gaming tech I very much hope they make something like it for Xbox If they do we can have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for almost any game for almost any platform going forward,,0.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4915wp,obi1kenobi1,,1,2024-12-28 21:10:17,,,,I guess the fact that its a patent is something but this doesnt really tell us anything that the big console roadmap leak from over a year ago didnt tell us That leak said a revised controller with SonyNintendolike haptic feedback I dont remember if the leak mentioned the triggers and gyro support was coming in 2024 but it never happened nor did the cylindrical Xbox Series X revision Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers would be nice especially if they were implemented in a way that makes it relatively straightforward to make the functionality crossplatform since that would encourage PC titles to adopt those features if they know the most popular PC controller supports them But really what I want more than anything is gyro because the industry refuses to universally support gyro aim assist as long as that feature isnt supported by Xbox their controllers have been holding the whole industry back by 1015 years and its time for them to catch up to every other controller on the market,,0.0,1ho9he9

comment,m4djema,None,,0,2024-12-29 16:49:31,,,,Honestly it doesnt matter how many bells and whistles they add to their controllers because theyre probably still going to feel wrong which is why Ive never left Playstation Just the controller won me over in the PS1 days and almost nothing else besides their terrible controllers keeps me from owning an xbox Nintendo has the same problem but I tend not to play as seriously on Nintendo so its not as important If everyone wants their controllers to feel like Sonys it goes past the features into the form Because the thing about Sonys controllers that makes them feel good has been the same since the first one And to know what that is all you have to do is look at an xbox or Nintendo controller look at a Sony controller identify whats the sole difference then look at your hands and theres the answer Because I dont know about anyone else on the planet but my thumbs are in the same place on each hand I am not a crab I dont have one finger thats an inch longer at a different angle My hands are mostly symmetrical so the controller should be too All the haptic feedback and sensors and crap in the world do not make the controller itself feel better,,0.0,1ho9he9
