comment,mrc6q1i,account22222221,,-22,2025-05-09 00:10:37,,,,Ok but like you know thats actually nonsense right Like if we wanted massive surveillance programs the is no rule it has to be a single drive Europe UK and the US are currently already capable of storing many many exabytes A normal data center might have a few thousand individual drives The real answer is the economy of data center hardware and what they are interested in buying Maybe the drives need certain racks to be mounted in and those racks are not popular in Europe or some other such gorp so they decided they would not likely sell many Who knows But it certainly isnt because of facism,mr8jbvp,1.0,1kholog

comment,mrds9t5,hungry4nuns,,3,2025-05-09 07:20:36,,,,If people are still buying the same amount Are they Thats a significant if to hang the rest of the point on They can raise prices in one market but not another Demand drops in the European market fewer sales but overall make more profit to offset the losses in the US market due to the actions of US leadership But the company probably take a hit overall due to tariffs and increased manufacturing costs So is this the new European price correct for the new market No Things are priced at the maximum a market will pay only applies to a free market If you have a proportion that are deliberately priced out and cannot afford a product they are forced to make do with an alternative product that does not fully meet their needs then its a restricted market A free market requires unrestricted competition When companies take themselves out of certain markets theres less competition within the market less innovation less value to the consumer and more coercion to buy whatever is left that they can access an inferior product A free market has a full array of options across the board and the consumer sets the price by what theyre willing to pay In the 24TB hard drive example theyre directly taking themselves out of the entire EU market for this product line In the euro price creep example they are taking themselves out of the bottom proportion in terms of affordability therefore more and more products become inaccessible to the lower end of the market Thats not a free market setting,mragtn4,2.0,1kholog
comment,mrp7pj0,DJEmirMixtapes,,2,2025-05-11 04:25:28,,,,Yes that is the problem with todays society we have easier access to things and corporations have easier access to more customers if we get lazy and dont try boycott or buy less of an item when it is priced too high then they will continue to price guage Can you maybe go without updating your phone for a few models Unfortunately for a while there I kept outpacing hard drive capacity so had to keep upgrading every few years At first I had 2 x 4TB hard drives but then I was running out of room unfortunately the next generation only went to 6TB so I got two of those then I was running out of room I had to get 2 8TB then 2 12TB finally it took longer to fill those and by the time I needed new hard drives they were finally in the 20TB limits so I purchased two of those and now am set with two 20TB hard drives But I have not updated my phone for a few gens now I have a Samsung Galaxy 20 Ultra and have not upgraded since the later generations removed the Micro SD card as many companies use that as a way to sell us Cloud Storage I am sticking with my phone for the moment as I have a 1TB micro SD card and 500MB internal storage whereas the next generation only have 256GB 500GB internal but no ability to add additional storage I feel if we complain about it and dont buy new phones they will need to lower their prices a bit for future releases But most people cant wait for the latest next best thing and cannot go without the next upgrade even if some parts are a downgrade,mragtn4,2.0,1kholog

comment,mr8zqf0,Nope_______,,-18,2025-05-08 14:21:53,,,,I doubt theyre including Russia and Turkey or any other European country not in the EEA in the European market but I could be wrong Then its a lot closer to the US population And maybe the costs to enter the European market make it not worth whatever size consumer base is there compared to the US or UK Youd have to ask Toshiba Im just making the point that more people doesnt mean more consumers of a certain product China has several times the US population but a smaller consumer base for certain products so having more people doesnt always mean more consumers of a certain product If you have a better source of data or better method of determining disposable income than OECD Id certainly be interested to see it,mr8x1u1,7.0,1kholog

comment,mr9fooj,S_A_N_D_,,2,2025-05-08 15:40:06,,,,Nevermind that hammering drives for a week ends up as a stress test for possible failures This is why I switched to RAID 6 when I made the new server and also why we recently upgraded all the drives Not because we needed the space though eventually we will need it but rather because the drives were 5 years old and all the same age Chances are if one failed others might be close as they were likely all manufactured on the same production line at the same time and have all been subject to identical conditions They were all showing clean SMART tests but I wasnt going to take the chance Ideally I wanted to stagger to the upgrade over a year to avoid having drives all the same age and from the same manufacturing run but circumstances meant I needed to do it all at once,mr9d294,5.0,1kholog
comment,mr9m663,tastyratz,,1,2025-05-08 16:11:28,,,,Honestly your best bet is going to be through redundancy through backups Remember your array is for IOPS and uptime availability not backups If you can just do a flat restore in a bubble in acceptable time especially if you can wait for some data vs other data then drive loss wont be so catastrophic,mr9fooj,6.0,1kholog
comment,mr9r96j,S_A_N_D_,,1,2025-05-08 16:36:38,,,,Absolutely There is a second backup server squirrelled away in a different wing of the building but Im also limited by resources so while we have full backups with time snapshots as you describe its not a perfect 321 Id also rather not have to try and restore from the backup if at all possible since its never been tested Im not really sure how I could test a full restore without a full second set of drives which I dont have the budget for Im not an expert in this matter rather Im just the closest thing we have to an expert Were just a small academic lab so we dont have the resources for much else and we are also constantly clashing with both funding agency data storage requirements which limits many of the big name solutions because the data centres might be in another country and our own institutional IT policies both of which dont have any sort of real policy on how to handle this kind of thing and neither of which offer suitable solutions of their own When I last inquired about using our own IT for this kind of thing they quoted us around 30 000 per year Its a pressing issue which the interested parties are keen to put policies in place but just keep kicking the can down the road when it comes to putting solutions in place,mr9m663,7.0,1kholog
comment,mr9yf1k,tastyratz,,1,2025-05-08 17:11:05,,,,Storage arrays are always the weaker link management understands cpu and ram more A backup thats never had a test restore isnt a backup yet Even if you split things to a few smaller luns so you can do critical pieces over the monolith you should Also if your backup is just an online duplicate in the same building it doesnt do anything in case of fire electrical surge or ransomware Thats just long distance raid,mr9r96j,8.0,1kholog
comment,mraa8o7,S_A_N_D_,,1,2025-05-08 18:07:34,,,,Management in my case is our PI who understands but just has limitations on how much money they can direct this way Unfortunately grants rarely take into account data storage and retention Also if your backup is just an online duplicate in the same building it doesnt do anything in case of fire electrical surge or ransomware I understand all of these and Ive mitigated them to the best of my ability and resources Simply put there are limits to how much I can do and the rest are risks Ive communicated Fire and electrical surge are unlikely Both are on power filtering battery backups hooked into on the universities redundant power circuit and its unlikely a power surge would manage to get through all of that on isolated circuits and go so far as to irreparably damage the hard drives best it might kill the computer power supply Fire is unlikely to take out both Its a massive and relatively new building and the wings are completely isolated from each other with multiple layers of fire breaks Its not a continuous linear building If a fire manages to take out both servers that will be the least of our worries given that well have also lost hundreds of independant academic labs an insurmountable number of irreplaceable research equipment and biological samples including cells lines and bacterial strains and hundreds of millions of dollars in lab equipment The data loss for our single lab at that point would just be a footnote and wed functionally be shut down anyways Offsite or a different building unfortunately isnt an option But again it would take deliberate action combined with a complete breakdown of fire suppression efforts to have both servers lost in a fire famous last words a la Titanic I know Ransomware is an issue but its not a simple 11 copy rather the backup is encrypted immutable snapshots on different underlying platforms While I could see the server being hit by ransomware it would more likely take a targeted attack to take out both systems which is also very unlikely As I said though there are definitely a lot of flaws here but I dont have the ability for a perfect solution and my PI is well aware of the issues but is also powerless to force the institution to help adopt a better solution Best I can do is my best to mitigate them,mr9yf1k,9.0,1kholog
