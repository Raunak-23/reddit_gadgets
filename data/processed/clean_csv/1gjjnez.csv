comment,lvdxqe3,drmirage809,,103,2024-11-04 18:20:26,,,,Nvidia has the high end market pretty much locked down at this point which is not a good thing Id love for AMDs products to be more prevalent Competition is a good thing and currently things are tilting towards one company in both CPU and GPU space AMD has the high end desktop CPU market and Intel blundered themselves out of it Nvidia got the GPUs and AI accelerators And they seem quite content to ask more and more ridiculous prices while limiting features to new products Because the 4080 and 4090s primary competition are the 3080 and 3090,,0.0,1gjjnez

comment,lvgb98s,Vodkamemoir,,5,2024-11-05 01:50:14,,,,I think thats part of their upcoming strategy Currently nvidia has the lions share of the market to the point that developers focus on games running on nvidia hardware AMD is a after thought Focusing on the mid to low end to increase their market share should icentivize develop to keep AMD in mind Thats what Id hope for anyway,lvfnuzw,2.0,1gjjnez
comment,lvggd02,None,,1,2024-11-05 02:19:32,,,,I would not be surprised if Nvidia and AMD decided to stake out this division through collusion It benefits both bottom lines to not fight each other Focus on their particular areas and dont impede,lvdxqe3,1.0,1gjjnez

comment,lvh434e,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2024-11-05 04:48:23,,,,and AMD FineWine tech strikes yet again Lmao AMD FineWine tech dogshit horrible drivers at launch mean AMD has to provide stronger hardware to hit X performance at Y price point then as their drivers mature over some years the performance obviously improves Lol,lvdwlnb,2.0,1gjjnez
comment,lvfotno,foxhound012,,1,2024-11-04 23:40:56,,,,As someone upgrading to from 6600xt to 6800 how much of a difference is it between the 6800 and 6900xt Wondering if i should save a bit more for it or pull the trigger and buy the 6900 if the upgrade is that good,lvdwlnb,2.0,1gjjnez
comment,lvigg61,IntrinsicGiraffe,,2,2024-11-05 12:36:23,,,,Base on Toms Hardware GPU Hierarchy chart the difference seems marginal Personally Id get the 6800XT to get the best bang for bucks Currently Im waiting for Thanksgiving sale to build a PC,lvfotno,3.0,1gjjnez

comment,lvi1c66,NeuroXc,,2,2024-11-05 10:21:32,,,,I switched from AMD to Nvidia because of how bad AMDs drivers are To the point that I would get random driver crashes while gaming Reported the crashes to AMD every time Other people were reporting similar crashes with the same games only with AMD Put up with it for 2 years before I gave in Zero crashes since going to Nvidia,,0.0,1gjjnez

comment,lvhpr37,FungZhi,,1,2024-11-05 08:09:55,,,,The only reason that I would buy a nvidia card is that amd didnt release mid tier gpu that shorter than 250mm while nvidia have the 4070 super,,0.0,1gjjnez

comment,lveor6a,Stereo-Zebra,,0,2024-11-04 20:32:59,,,,Tbf Nvidias investment in AI was genius and AMD playing catchup is evidence of that DLSS is fucking magic for gaming I legit cant tell quality dlss at 1440p between native and I know server applications are a huge part of the market not knowledgable on that side AMD makes awesome low end gpus for raw raster but the upscaling seems a gen behind at all times and more games support dlss3 than fsr3 natively,lvedcza,3.0,1gjjnez
