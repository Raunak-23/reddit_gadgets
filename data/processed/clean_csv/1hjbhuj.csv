comment,m36tgae,thekeffa,,35,2024-12-21 20:49:03,,,,In the British military we call this Dead weight The idea that in order to make your equipment feel lighter and more carryable and to stop it bouncing up and down your back you basically spread the weight around your pack Called a Bergan in British military parlance with the emphasis being that the heavier things are nearer the top So higher up on your back You also make it so that your weight cannot move by stuffing all the air gaps between equipment with soft things like your poncho waterproofs spare clothes and anything else soft You test it by jumping up and down with the bag on If you feel anything moving in there when you jump you have dead weight and you need to fix it The difference between a bag that is packed in this way and a bag that just has stuff thrown in and able to move around is like night and day The well packed bag that avoids dead weight is barely an inconvenience Up to a point of course there is no trick in the world that is going to make you not notice 55kg whereas the badly packed back with lots of dead weight is a relentless torture device on a loaded march Pack your bag so you have no dead weight and your back will thank you in the future when you are old Or at least it wont be as bad as it might be,m35i4yp,1.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m393i2v,mr_trashbear,,8,2024-12-22 06:49:42,,,,Can you explain why you put heavier things up top Wouldnt that lead to a more well top heavy load that would be less stable and therefore more prone to bouncingmovement,m36tgae,2.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m3a84kw,achillies665,,15,2024-12-22 14:09:10,,,,It should be heavier things near the back Never heard of up top but we always packed it with the heaviest stuff was as close to your back as possible,m393i2v,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m3aut3z,mr_trashbear,,3,2024-12-22 16:33:43,,,,Yeah thats how Ive always packed stuff Heavier stuff towards the middlebottom and closer towards the body Avoid the void still definitely applies though,m3a84kw,4.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m39mewu,quick_justice,,1,2024-12-22 10:35:52,,,,I never being to British military but my hypothesis is that on balance heavier things will prevent lighter things on the bottom from moving about by power of gravity I dont know if this is more or less important than resulting slightly higher centre of mass but it should work in terms of stabilising the load,m393i2v,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m3apv9p,StreetlampEsq,,1,2024-12-22 16:04:47,,,,You want it closer to your center of gravity so heavier items towards the back lower down but since youre leaning forward to offset the pack the top section curves towards your center of gravity Edit btw have no idea what Im talking about,m393i2v,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m3axmg7,thekeffa,,1,2024-12-22 16:49:54,,,,Yes certainly Top in this case refers to it in a 3D sense in both the horizontal and vertical planes so further up the back towards the head and also closer to your back The idea being that the Front of the pack is closest to your back in the horizontal sense The reason that you put the heavier things nearer the top In the vertical sense is that the top is essentially the middle of the back for most people and in a process I myself do not fully understand it counteracts the motion of the hips when walking leading to a more stable weight on your back There is a downside to this which is leaning over and picking up the bag is harder but that generally is a lesser consideration It should be pointed out clearly that even weight distribution with all air gaps packed out so it is immovable weight is the actual sought after end result Your bag should not be top heavy even with the heavy items at the top but if that is not achievable its better for the bag to weigh a bit more at the top than at the bottom My PTI instructor said it best If your bag feels like its stuffed full of heavy pillows you have done it right,m393i2v,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m35yh2i,IM_OK_AMA,,15,2024-12-21 17:49:13,,,,The videos of these things in use are hilarious because the models have to maintain a certain rhythm with the backpack which seems like more work than just carrying the weight properly,m35i4yp,1.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m35mfte,Significant-Mango300,,43,2024-12-21 16:38:54,,,,Good point imagine securing the bag well helps with things not bouncing around as much or wrapping heavy items around a bubble wrap or cushion of some sort,m35i4yp,1.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m35n42v,SteakandTrach,,56,2024-12-21 16:42:42,,,,Its more about the energy requirement of your muscles to accelerate the bag upward followed by the compressive forces on the vertebral discs and knee joints to halt the falling of the bag on its way back down Walk smooth use less energy and suffer less wear and tear,m35mfte,2.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m35pi3r,SteakandTrach,,16,2024-12-21 16:56:30,,,,Not really especially considering modern packs are compressive meaning you buy the pack to fit the volume you plan to carry so rarely will someone be hiking with a 60L pack with 40L in it And if you do carry less than your pack will hold youll be cinching down all the straps so that everything is still compressed so that its tight Stuff doesnt really shift that much in a backpack Padding that isnt between your body and the straps is just added volume and weight,m35ngwi,4.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m35re3m,restform,,8,2024-12-21 17:07:48,,,,Distributing the peaks probably would reduce the overall energy expenditure from the user though no If youre not raising the bag as frequently then that should be a net decrease in energy,m35fs8y,1.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m3652bk,Noleta,,-3,2024-12-21 18:26:51,,,,No Imagine a curve of energy exertion If this pack weighed nothing it would essentially clip the peaks of the curve and fill in some of the valleys Overall energy or area below the curve remains constant But this pack is not weightless So although the curve is smoothed out its offset upwards with more overall energy required Worse than that its tuned for certain weights and certain walking gates If not in that range then the oscillating can actually amplify the peaks and valleys on the curve Its snake oil,m35re3m,2.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m368ct9,whatnowwproductions,,7,2024-12-21 18:45:26,,,,This is not true because the additional effort necessary for the peak of movements requires significantly more energy than keeping a constant where youre more efficient,m3652bk,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m36a62w,Noleta,,2,2024-12-21 18:55:36,,,,Youre only looking at half the walk That same arguement can be made to say that the valleys when the mass is in freefall consume less energy than a constant load This isnt a magic design its just mass moving over distance same work Moreenergy is going to be spent with extra dead weight If this wasnt snake oil then militaries would have implemented it years ago There have been many evaluations and yet no permanent deployments,m368ct9,4.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m36dm5j,baicai18,,2,2024-12-21 19:15:11,,,,Ita a prototype but ignore the tuning for a second Energy is force distance When walking horizontal energy to move pack is going to remain constant However it takes energy to lift the pack on each step up to thr peak Then when at peak gravity does its job and drops the pack so a person has to expend extra energy to counteract the kinetic enrergy of the pack coming back down so there is absolutely a savings considering just the mass of the pack Its why a lot of hikers will try to move smoothly with no bob to achieve a smiliar thing Where the benefits come over just forcing yourself not to bob is that our natual human gait has evolved to use our muscles most efficiently with a slight bob so forcing no bob saves energy but we lose muscle efficiency This prototype pack could help maintain those energy savings while allowing you to walk with a normal bobbing gait for muscle efficiency Of course whether that energy savings can counteract the energy needed to haul the extra frame and battery weight is another matter,m3652bk,3.0,1hjbhuj
comment,m388hqh,restform,,2,2024-12-22 02:23:56,,,,But when moving up and down is the bag not just acting like a store of energy in that as you move lower relative to the bag the bags potential energy increases and as you raise yourself bag to the level of the bag the potential energy decreases as opposed to that energy not coming out of your legs The way I see it if the bag decreases the amount of lateral movements then quite simply it will be decreasing energy expendituring I do agree this may not actually function so smoothly in real world terrain but thats a bit besides the point of the convo,m3652bk,3.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m3876h1,restform,,1,2024-12-22 02:14:40,,,,Damn relax My point was more that this bag genuinely seems like its conserving energy whereas normally if a bag falls lower to the ground you are losing energy that needs to be reapplied again If youre bag is bouncing up and down that bouncing motion is literally only possible as a result of energy being expended you are overcoming inertia and fighting gravity moreso than something that remains stationary When you step down and the new bag is sliding up relative to your torso its effectively increasing its potential energy and when you move back up that energy is being taken from the potential energy stored in the bag rather than your legs Thats my first intuitive assumption of how this works at least Im happy to be wrong but based on your reply Im not convinced you have a good understanding of it either,m36oklu,3.0,1hjbhuj

comment,m35ntda,Lott4984,,1,2024-12-21 16:46:41,,,,The trouble with backpacks is the center on mass changes as more and more item are placed in the backpack This causes you to lean farther forward to compensate for the center of mass moving farther away from your body The farther you lean forward the more strain that goes on your lower back The closer you can get your center of mass straight up and down lowers strain on your back because when your spine is aligned more of the weight is distrubuted over your whole spine It appears by the picture they are using a weight attached to the frame and that the hiker is still leaning forward to compensate for that weight But the weight has a center of mass much closer to the hikers back than a fully loaded pack thus less strain on the hikers back If you pack your pack with the heavy objects as close to your back as possible that would reduce the strain on your back But that is not easily done,,0.0,1hjbhuj
