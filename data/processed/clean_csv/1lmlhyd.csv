comment,n0w38v5,Aridez,,10,2025-07-02 04:57:35,,,,The moment they start to make decently priced smart glasses that include a HUD Im sold These seem just like yet another speaker on your glasses kind of thing no matter how they are selling it Ive seen a few cheap ones with great quality already but I find no use for them that a pair of good quality headphones cant do much better Sony even released some not long ago with an open design that would let external sounds go through the same as not wearing them So not too different from the glasses,,0.0,1lmlhyd
comment,n0xas3p,danielv123,,3,2025-07-02 11:29:30,,,,There are quite a few options there are 2 different displays to choose from One has a decently wide FOV and 1080p screen the other is more expensive looks a lot sleeker but has a narrower FOV and 240p ish screen Both are held back by software They dont really interact with the real world The even G1 is a good example they look good the screen is decent but nowhere near an immersive AR experience Using it for navigation and live translation is neat but Id really like to use it for ebooks Thats just not a thing because as far as I understand you are stuck with the apps they give you,n0w38v5,1.0,1lmlhyd
comment,n0xss1m,Aridez,,1,2025-07-02 13:21:37,,,,Yea Ive seen them and look neat I always thought that would be super nice when I have to do presentations having a small prompt guide at the side if I get lost or even during meetings if they are discreet enough But comparing the 600 of these to a 60 price you can get for a nice pair of classes with cameras and speakers having decent quality both it makes me think that the technology on that side is not yet there On the other side is what you say every vendor tries to put their own closed system with limited apps instead of making an open SDK I guess they want to cash in those AI subscriptionstranslation services instead of letting anyone take advantage of the glasses and its also whats killing them Those prices for a product with closed systems of a newish company dont give me any kind of confidence If anyone made a pair of glasses with an open SDK that would give easy access to every developer already in the play store or the app store Everyone would be able to create this compatibility something similar to what happened with smartwatches But my guess is that wont happen until a big player gets into this specific market like apple or google forcing the rest to open to the whole store to compete,n0xas3p,2.0,1lmlhyd

comment,n0zeawj,Vo_Mimbre,,3,2025-07-02 17:57:54,,,,I hate that when actual real AR glasses come out theyll need a new name These smart glasses are just headphones with corrective lenses if you want Like yay,,0.0,1lmlhyd
comment,n0wahtv,WrongUserID,,3,2025-07-02 05:58:22,,,,What I like about Xiaomi is that they experience a lot These glasses might be another pair of glasses with music but they dont just scrap the model they build on it and next version might have HUD Take their phones They were some of the first to have small factors or small bezel or small notch for camera Xiaomi innovate and have done it since the beginning My point is Watch where these glasses are going in 6 months time,,0.0,1lmlhyd
