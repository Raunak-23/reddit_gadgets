comment,mwjrh1e,CumAssault,,7,2025-06-07 20:42:36,,,,Statements like this are trash Soundbars are great for 95 of people No real wires or mess way more accessible than custom surround sound setups and 1000x better than TV speakers,mw32wpe,1.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mxx8eco,Useuless,,1,2025-06-15 15:31:49,,,,I actually prefer my TVs integrated speakers over a 1000 msrp sound bar that I tried simply due to the fact that it is closer to my ears With the sound bar I tried it was so obvious that everything was below my head and ready from a very tiny spot It was driving me insane Sure my TV speakers dont have as nice drivers or the level of power but try to give an open sound even if it has limitations,mwjrh1e,2.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mxxbkra,CumAssault,,1,2025-06-15 15:48:25,,,,On most modern TVs the speakers are on the rear of the TV and actually bounce off of the wall Which might be why you perceive it as wide and open sound TV speakers have gotten better but a good soundbar should still blow it out of the water,mxx8eco,3.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mxxpzqz,Useuless,,1,2025-06-15 17:02:57,,,,Im aware of this But it contradicted the expected logic And honestly I only have LG which makes it stranger Sony and Samsung have better technologies like Acoustic Surface or Object Tracking It was a Samsung Q900C if youre interested It was a horrible product TBH So sharp sibilant limited EQ ability bass felt disconnected and the calibration literally did nothing And add on top of all that it sounded like it was coming from a tiny box under the TV,mxxbkra,4.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mwl08lb,Jonsnoosnooze,,1,2025-06-08 01:10:34,,,,Dumb mindset like this one is the reason soundbars exist They still suck,mwjrh1e,2.0,1l3q5dc

comment,mwnz3d3,kiltedsteve,,3,2025-06-08 14:57:46,,,,They might not be the best option for you but they work amazingly well for a lot of us Dont use a blanket statement with nothing to back it up,mwl08lb,3.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mw5m93v,GrayDaysGoAway,,3,2025-06-05 16:02:33,,,,Hell no they dont Sound bars are fucking awesome for those of us who want better sound than the TV speakers but dont have room for a surround setup,mw32wpe,1.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mw2wteb,internetlad,,3,2025-06-05 04:25:57,,,,I already have an LG soundbar but no OLED How do I make this work for me,,0.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mwh0evg,emiliabow,,2,2025-06-07 11:13:29,,,,I mean the important detail here is that it is not any OLED setup only LG OLED G5C5,,0.0,1l3q5dc
comment,mw3d2wr,FrozenToonies,,0,2025-06-05 06:44:15,,,,Ive set up a few 8898 LG OLEDs for professionalcommercial installs but I cant share due to NDAs The issue is that OLED displays are 95 for consumer markets Ive yet to install a large commercial grade OLED in a professional visual FX studio for example,,0.0,1l3q5dc
