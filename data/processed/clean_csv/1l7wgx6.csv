comment,mx2lowr,Swastik496,,12,2025-06-10 19:30:05,,,,this is true but I think the last generation of Intel Macs will be the exception rather than the rule,mx1momr,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx432pu,beaurepair,,9,2025-06-11 00:01:49,,,,And to be clear 2019 was the last generation of Intel macs So they still will be getting 6 major OS upgrades and will keep security updates for longer than that,mx2lowr,3.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx8lpym,obi1kenobi1,,1,2025-06-11 17:52:01,,,,Is there even still a hackintosh community It kind of made sense in 2008 when people were putting that shiny new Intel MacOS on cheap Intel hardware but I dont think Ive heard the word in over a decade I mean I guess it was always about the thrill of problem solving and figuring out how to do it rather than people wanting to use them as reliable daily computers but once Intel Macs were mainstream and especially by the midtolate 2010s when Apples OS support was super long there just didnt seem to be much reason to do it anymore,mx00lty,1.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx5lryi,Stunning-End-6870,,1,2025-06-11 06:08:56,,,,What OS are you running on it currently I have an older MBP from 2013 but anything beyond Catalina makes it run borderline unusable slow,mx3njfc,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx2qxu6,abarrelofmankeys,,3,2025-06-10 19:55:14,,,,Mine can barely run adobe stuff anymore and now Adobe will have less incentive to fix it At least its for work so its not my problem to replace,mx08i8l,1.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx4titz,CrazyLlama71,,1,2025-06-11 02:37:13,,,,Thats an Adobe issue not an Apple issue Ive read that Photoshop 2026 will need at least an M1 chip or better to even run And honestly after doing testing for work you really need at least an M1 now to do pretty basic things And if you are working 16bit files you need better than that I could barely open 16bit files with my M1 chip so traded in my work machine for a new M4 Adobe just keeps adding and it requires more processing power,mx2qxu6,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx4xfqy,abarrelofmankeys,,1,2025-06-11 03:02:04,,,,Thats what Im saying thats what I use it for and every year it gets worse Im using the same camera gear Ive been using and same laptop No reason things should be rough aside from Adobe being lazy since this is getting phased out but the phasing out will just make Adobe and other companies have even less incentive to bother supporting these computers even though theyre fine,mx4titz,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx4zwtc,CrazyLlama71,,1,2025-06-11 03:18:28,,,,Unfortunately Apple and Adobe dont have the best history of playing nice with one another That has changed recently though Its only going to get worse with the consumer demand for AI features in Photoshop which will take tons of processing power,mx4xfqy,4.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx3z5bo,NickCharlesYT,,2,2025-06-10 23:39:59,,,,Honestly with security updates for another three years youre getting a good 10 years of support out of it as a whole Thats not bad Id be happy to get the same 10 years of support out of my M4 based MBP,mx08i8l,1.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx1om7d,4kVHS,,17,2025-06-10 16:56:30,,,,Youre blaming Apple because you bought outdated hardware to run outdated software Yeah Apple totally set you up on that one,mx1naba,4.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx1twmm,nurse-ruth,,-9,2025-06-10 17:20:34,,,,Huh I bought it new three years ago and we didnt have a choice We had to buy Intel You make it sound like jerkoff Cook gave us a choice,mx1om7d,5.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx1w3bj,PoopStickss,,11,2025-06-10 17:30:28,,,,Your choice included the option of another windows pc You still chose apple Well apple is phasing out intel You wanted intel so you chose an old model of mac that clearly was on its way out Those were your choices lmao,mx1twmm,6.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx2ib1t,nurse-ruth,,0,2025-06-10 19:13:52,,,,Those are all garbage HP and Dell are not valid options for people that need a working and reliable laptop Even the trackpads are crap that quickly fail The Apple ones are the best ever made,mx1w3bj,7.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx2i2fu,nurse-ruth,,-2,2025-06-10 19:12:45,,,,Liar All of the new ones had proprietary CPUs that wont run most software If you need Intel and want a 16 mine is the newest and best model made,mx1xj6a,7.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx2lz11,Swastik496,,5,2025-06-10 19:31:26,,,,Realistically they were wrong to keep selling the Intel Macs but it was made very clear by Apple that M series was the futureand theyre one of the few companies with the market power to make third party software fall in line,mx2i2fu,8.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx318ot,nurse-ruth,,0,2025-06-10 20:43:14,,,,It was not made clear initially at all Thats why people were so upset that Cook lied CNBC reported Apple might never be able to increase yields enough to stop selling Intel CPUs,mx2lz11,9.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx32djc,Swastik496,,3,2025-06-10 20:48:32,,,,CNBC and similar have turned into garbage clickbait for the most part Lmao apple not being able to increase yields enough to commit to a monumental switch that they promised The fact that those headlines were believed even after Apple silicons huge success in mobile is insane Apple shouldve stopped selling Intel stuff and made the switch at once to prevent selling e waste but the M series had revolutionary performance and battery life from Day 1 Even just from trying one at the Apple Store it was clear where the future was headed I would hope apple atleast highly subsidizes trade in values for the super late Intel macs but sadly I doubt it,mx318ot,10.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx344p8,nurse-ruth,,0,2025-06-10 20:56:41,,,,That is an obvious lie They report from SEC filings When Apple decides to commit fraud and lies to the SEC how can you blame the journalists for exposing their crimes,mx32djc,11.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx4cgu2,Swastik496,,3,2025-06-11 00:56:43,,,,lol I have several family members who make these reports and file the 10K and quarterly filings for other companies If something small that could ever possibly be an issue is even mentioned in a passing conversation that an exec hears it will be included there Better safe than sorry Using those reports to make headlines is nothing but clickbait They will include anything that could possibly happen from an external party that will impact earnings and operations,mx344p8,12.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mxlf5ri,mach1alfa,,2,2025-06-13 17:07:40,,,,shouldnt you blame the software company for not releasing an update so it can run on new systems you should have knew whats coming when you make such a purchase back then,mx1twmm,6.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx4wazr,CrazyLlama71,,2,2025-06-11 02:54:46,,,,But its apples fault because your software developer wont put out an update to work on the new chip You bought that computer 2 years after the M1 chip came out Thats on the software developer not Apple Plus the current OS will be supported for years Which means it will continue to run your old ass software too,mx1naba,4.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx07jjv,Gamebird8,,138,2025-06-10 12:30:57,,,,Security updates are really the only thing thats important for the life of a system Features can be nice but on older hardware they can add bloat that slows the system down,mx029vl,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx23lv0,GolemancerVekk,,9,2025-06-10 18:04:42,,,,Security updates are really the only thing thats important for the life of a system Not quite Apple changes the OS APIs very often Most software creators for iOS and Mac OS dont bother trying to keep up with anything except the very latest API on the assumption that most of the users will upgrade I dont think they will go out of their way to maintain a second version for a second old platform Bottom line the last existing versions of software for Intel will keep working of course as long as Apple doesnt make a breaking change If that happens I think their makers will take this opportunity to abandon them,mx07jjv,4.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx07t42,MeBeEric,,8,2025-06-10 12:32:36,,,,I agree I was an AASP tech for a handful of years and saw a very large amount of PowerPC Macs coming in for service Later on we saw a few clients with Macs running OS versions not built for their models mostly 2011 MBP running Big Sur Shits ran like ass,mx07jjv,4.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx099mb,RapNVideoGames,,3,2025-06-10 12:41:22,,,,As someone who used lucky patcher on a 2011 MBP I can agree it is ass You maybe be able to upgrade past the limit but good luck using any modern software,mx07t42,5.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx0niit,pm_social_cues,,1,2025-06-10 13:59:43,,,,But inevitably some apps will stop updating and possibly stop working since they cant be updated when they start using features that require updated version of macOS just like running an old iPhone with a previous version of iOS,mx07jjv,4.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx0iskc,norbertus,,15,2025-06-10 13:35:04,,,,Well there are a number of historical precedents within the Apple ecosystem Apple sold computers based on Motorola CPUs from 19861994 8 years After the launch of the PowerPC CPU in 1994 Apple provided backwards compatibility until they adopted the Intel CPU in 2006 12 years After the launch of Intel Macs Apple provided Rosetta compatibilty with PPC apps until 2011 5 years Apple launched the M1 chip in 2020 9 years after ending PPC support They supported Intel for 5 years while also making their own chips Right now Intel support on Apple silicon is provided by Rosetta 2 You might get a couple more years of that,mx00254,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx32emx,jrherita,,3,2025-06-10 20:48:40,,,,Interesting so a 2005 PowerPC G5 Mac could still run 68K apps via built in OS emulation,mx0iskc,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx3i0y7,norbertus,,3,2025-06-10 22:06:14,,,,Yes there was builtin emulation For the transition from PPC to Intel Apple licensed Rosetta Rosetta 2 was developed inhouse for the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon though it looks like theyre planning to drop support in two years,mx32emx,4.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx3kiqr,jrherita,,2,2025-06-10 22:19:38,,,,Thanks,mx3i0y7,5.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx00rbx,xanas263,,22,2025-06-10 11:46:52,,,,It will basically be up to individual developers if they want to maintain support for intel Macs and that decision will mainly be driven by install base My educated guess is at this point the majority of Macs being used are probably Apple Silicon and so most software will probably also lose support once this change goes into effect,mx00254,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx062y7,galactica_pegasus,,11,2025-06-10 12:21:53,,,,It really depends on the developer There are apps that still dont even have Apple Silicon binaries and rely on Rosetta 2 looking at you Dymo,mx00rbx,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx05omf,kindrudekid,,9,2025-06-10 12:19:22,,,,It just means it wont get MacOS 26 and new features that come with it It will likely continue to get OS security updates I have a 2013 MacBook Air and it got security updates periodically until I sold it a year ago or two ago,mx00254,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx0875c,ThisI5N0tAThr0waway,,10,2025-06-10 12:34:59,,,,Correction if the article is to be believed it will get macos 26 but not Mac OS 27 Security updates timeline are TBD I guess,mx05omf,3.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx0smu1,Destabiliz,,-7,2025-06-10 14:25:08,,,,Still kinda crazy that such a relatively new and perfectly good computer the 2018 Mac already stops getting new OS updates so soon Microsoft got absolutely deserved shit on by the community when they decided to start dropping support for old PCs starting with Windows 11 And old PCs in this case meant for example my previous still perfectly fine desktop PC from 2007 that came with Win Vista and received updates all the way to this day until now Microsoft decided its too old to officially receive Windows 11 even though Im 99 sure it could run it just fine since it still runs Windows 10 just fine as well And so that PC will now be losing software support maybe this or the next year with Windows 10,mx05omf,3.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx1ifd8,m0rogfar,,3,2025-06-10 16:27:24,,,,Theres two reasons why Apple is getting much less crap for this than Microsoft One is that theres an understandable technical basis for why its happening ARM chips and x86 chips are fundamentally incompatible so it makes sense for technical users that it could be a spec cutoff The Windows 11 cutoff is easy to deride because its so obviously arbitrary and based entirely on whether the processor was released before or after summer 2017 a fact that should be completely obvious since Intel released a laptop chip at 45W early that year which isnt supported and then rereleased the exact same chip in the fall with the only difference being that it was now underclocked to 15W which is supported Another is also that Apple made a new computer thats so disruptively better that it has no trouble justifying why you should do a potentially premature upgrade solely based on the merits on the new hardware and has likely already convinced much of the userbase to make that switch Thats very unusual its really the first yearoveryear processor upgrade since the 90s that can lay claim to once you see how much better the new one is at everyday usage the old thing will literally seem unusable by comparison and you will just want to throw it in the trashstatus and thats probably not something well see again anytime soon,mx0smu1,4.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx2h35j,pinkynarftroz,,3,2025-06-10 19:08:06,,,,It depends The biggest issue is newer versions of your software requiring an OS you cant run It was the reason I upgraded my 2010 Mac Pro to an M1 Max Adobe CC started requiring Catalina and the Mac Pro topped out at Mojave,mx00254,2.0,1l7wgx6
comment,mx20k9i,dark_sylinc,,7,2025-06-10 17:50:46,,,,Developer here My main grip with Apples approach is that in order to submit to the App Store the app mustve been compiled with latest XCode Which requires a very recent version of macOS which in turns requires recent mac HW This is unlike other platforms where you can develop on a potato with Visual Studio 2005 and Windows XP and still publish fine for Win 11 Of course you should test on newer HWOSes where the user will run it I exaggerated to make the point but its literally possible to do it my point is they force you to buy upgraded HW that on average isnt older than 5 years and that applies to their iPhonesiPads too Developing for that platform has some hefty costs,mx00254,2.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx3umue,dark_sylinc,,5,2025-06-10 23:15:09,,,,I guess its possible but theres a lot of nuances With every XCode macOSetc upgrade 1 Something in the project breaks eg script dependency order setting was renamed 2 Some API or function or feature was deprecated or removed This includes OSlevel stuff in your tooling like when Python was removed bash was changed for zsh or Intel was replaced by ARM 3 Theres a linking issue 4 Theres a runtime issue eg an XCode bug that causes your app to crash its rare but not super rare It happens frequently enough to be on this list This consumes a lot of time and a lot of testing And with a rented Mac it means you cant push the xcode project modifications to your repo because youd still have to work with the older version on your own mac,mx32lh8,4.0,1l7wgx6

comment,mx1nxcv,DonutsMcKenzie,,4,2025-06-10 16:53:23,,,,Also All Im saying is that there is a big difference between Linux is terrible for audio and Linux is terrible for my specific compositionproduction workflow that involves a Windows DAW and a bunch of Windows VSTs Frankly I have more than enough shit to make music Too much stuff probably I know professional musicians who do just fine in a dawless setup without a computer at all I also know pros who do nothing but chiptunes in a tracker program like Deflemask and Furnace There are a lot of different studio setups and workflows what works for me might not work for you and what works for you might not work for Yuzo Koshiro or whatever Linux might not be right for you and thats fine you clearly had a bad experience so its not like youre making shit up but to say its generally terrible and cant be done is misleading You absolutely CAN compose produce transcribe and edit music on Linux How difficult and painful it is for you really depends on how much you rely on Windows software which Windows software it is how familiar you are with Linux how familiar you are with WINE and so on People who are willing to give Bitwig or Reaper a shot are going to have an easier time for sure but like you said Im never going to recommend that someone switches their preferred workflow just to run Linux In the end of the day use the tools that are best for you just understand that those tools are not the best for everyone even among Windows and Mac users,mx1n9gu,9.0,1l7wgx6
