comment,m6diozo,mailslot,,5,2025-01-10 08:55:08,,,,Eh As I recall it has more to do with the initial HDTV standard Past 720p there is only 1080i to broadcastInterlaced And that does look terrible with movement despite being much sharper Its also lower frame rate than 720p which can do 60fps for super smooth NASCAR ESPN has been 720p as far back as I can remember over cable dish online FOX jumped into 1080 land with two feeds 1080i and 1080p It depends on the broadcaster and the sport When league games were first made available online they were just reencoded broadcast satellite feeds you could watch on your computer I believe interns had to watch and start the encoding manually or viewers would miss the first few minutes,m6cqxe0,3.0,1hxqv22

comment,m6bx2pg,sCeege,,4,2025-01-10 01:44:02,,,,Its can be as as big as you want it to be I typically find 60ish GB to be the sweet spot for feature length movies in HEVC without too much artifacts so Im definitely looking for sub 50GB AV1 files if not less I know a lot of people pixel peep and want the highest quality no judgement Either way AV1 will be a value add for digital hoarders,m6bs1va,3.0,1hxqv22
comment,m6bynso,ArseBurner,,9,2025-01-10 01:52:53,,,,MB didnt realize you were talking about recompressing content I was thinking more about straight BD rips Id typically remux them to get rid of menus and fluff but otherwise leave the content asis Guess chances are pretty slim that publishers use AV1 to compress content meant for a physical disc,m6bx2pg,4.0,1hxqv22

comment,m6d2q86,sCeege,,3,2025-01-10 06:17:37,,,,Yes I typically consume 4K content from my desk which has a 32 4K monitor sitting pretty close to me In dynamic scenes its not very noticeable but long periods of scenes including darkness can show a lot of banding or other artifacts even afar from a TV Even on a 90 TV from a few feet away the banding is very visible My general rule of thumb is if its a notable film say the Harry Potters or some award winning film where Im watching on purpose I try to leave as much bitrate as I can afford to store if its just a casual flick Ill watch over dinner I can get away with 20gbs or less which is close to 1014GB per hour,m6cpvkj,5.0,1hxqv22
comment,m6jkngs,GentlemenHODL,,1,2025-01-11 07:13:12,,,,I can see 4K content going down to 3050GBs while retaining a decent bit rate Most 4k HDR pirated content is 4060gb range I occasionally see 2840gbbidnthrbmovir is shorter I dont know what the standard bitrate so for scene releases tho,m6bg803,2.0,1hxqv22
comment,m6cia8r,imakesawdust,,8,2025-01-10 03:47:28,,,,Thats what Ive been saying We have a 75 TV but our main seating position is 13 feet away At that distance I dont think I can tell the difference between 4K and 1080p if Im being honest How big does the screen need to be before you can really see the difference between 8K and 4K at 13 feet Perhaps 8K will find traction in VR goggles where maybe you can see the difference,m6bf4ly,1.0,1hxqv22

comment,m6lz63h,flac_rules,,2,2025-01-11 18:06:43,,,,80150 is on the high end though In fact I wouldnt be surprised if more movies are below 80 than above 100 150 i have never seen And while I dont think 8k is that useful it is not true humans cant see the detail and distance says not enough by itself the size of the display also matters better to look at the angle what is the smallest discernable angle,m6bf4ly,1.0,1hxqv22
