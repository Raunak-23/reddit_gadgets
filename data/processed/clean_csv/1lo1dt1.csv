comment,n0kfl47,thekeffa,,73,2025-06-30 12:36:04,,,,I have both of these devices Ignore the other comments about the Legion not having a trackpadmousepad It absolutely does have one The SteamDeck is the superior device but I dont think you would feel like you made an error if you bought the Legion as long as it is the SteamOS version Also as something of a PSA the SteamDeck supports wireless mice and keyboards If you feel the game that you are playing is too difficult with the thumbsticks or trackpads,,0.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0m6uwu,jalerre,,31,2025-06-30 17:54:16,,,,I dont know that the Steamdeck is necessarily the superior device The Legion Go S has a larger higher refresh rate higher resolution screen and a better processor and potentially more RAM It depends if you value that more than OLED and larger dual trackpads,n0kfl47,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0mok2y,thekeffa,,10,2025-06-30 19:18:51,,,,Its always going to be subjective as its not so clear cut between them but with practical experience of both I can say the OLED and the smoothnesscompatibility of the games wins it out for me as well as the overall feel of just a better built product That and the fact it supports bluetooth mice and keyboards as some games just do not make the transition well to thumb controllers But I did point out that the Legion Go S isnt something you would feel you made a mistake with if you bought it instead of a SteamDeck If I had to have a Legion Go S instead of a SteamDeck I wouldnt feel aggrieved about it,n0m6uwu,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rquni,GrayDaysGoAway,,7,2025-07-01 15:08:14,,,,I had an OLED Deck and sold it for an Ally X last year because OLED doesnt matter much when the resolution is only 800p Modern games just straight up dont look good on the Deck imo Plus compatibility sucks as it doesnt support things like gamepass or even basic anticheats,n0mok2y,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rva0z,ThePandaKingdom,,3,2025-07-01 15:28:30,,,,I liked my steamdeck so much i bought an Ally I put steam OS on it the other week unsure of how i would feel about it and i can say that i am loving it over windows It feels a lot better for a device with its use case,n0rquni,4.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0nk88w,jalerre,,2,2025-06-30 21:55:10,,,,I dont disagree just pushing back against the idea that the Steamdeck is the definitively superior device,n0mok2y,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0kzx1z,DeadButGrateful,,15,2025-06-30 14:29:57,,,,From the article What is missing from Lenovos design are the Steam Decks two trackpads Those haptic trackpads add a surprising amount of versatility in some games especially in CRPGs or strategy games like Tactical Breach Wizards The minuscule trackpad on the Legion Go S didnt even seem to work out of the box I had such a bad experience with it on the Windows versionwith it vibrating like a rabbit dipped into a freezingcold lakeI wasnt keen to fix it,n0kfl47,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0lgb6b,thekeffa,,10,2025-06-30 15:50:06,,,,The minuscule trackpad on the Legion Go S didnt even seem to work out of the box I had such a bad experience with it on the Windows version My emphasis The other comments are saying it does not have one at all Yet it clearly does The one on the SteamOS version works fine for me I wont deny its not quite as useful as having two Hence my pointing out the SteamDeck is the superior device but the Legion S DOES have a trackpad And in my experience there was nothing wrong with it outside of the trackpad being generally crap for controlling games as all trackpads are in my opinion Including the SteamDeck ones,n0kzx1z,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0oadkt,BurantX40,,2,2025-07-01 00:19:08,,,,Its great for me I use a trackpad mouse so Im more keyed into my thumb being very precise compared to a joystick in which I have to push and relieve pressure on to be accurate,n0lgb6b,3.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n2ae1l7,Healthy_Wolverine_75,,2,2025-07-10 01:44:53,,,,I am curious since you have both devices The Lenovo can run games at a higher resolution with a higher refresh rate and more fps than the Steam Deck Theoretically therefore if you were willing to bring the fps down to whatever the steam deck gets per game you could raise the graphical presets So strictly speaking in terms of graphics to someone who has never seen either system in person on two equal displays the game with the higher resolution and higher graphical settings is going to look better Is the Steam Decks OLED screen really that good that it can offset those disadvantages,n0kfl47,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n2bqvuc,thekeffa,,2,2025-07-10 07:47:28,,,,On the balance of just the screen and the screen alone being the deciding factor the Legion would probably edge it The deeper colours of the OLED screen on the SteamDeck are nice but so is the higher resolution and higher FPS on the Legion If it was just down to that I might pick the Legion However one thing to remember is the Legion has a slightly bigger screen so that increased resolution spreads out over more screen estate But its not just the screen that is the deciding factor and that makes the difference This is likely subjective but the resolution is something that either bothers you or it doesnt and if you have never seen the difference it doesnt bother you Also some games are a bit hard to see on the small screen so having a larger resolution doesnt always help Now this might also be subjective to the person but even if you do see the difference its not so great that you go Oh wow I can never go back to the SteamDeck Its just a bit better Not game changing better And heres the thing Some games dont run well at that higher setting They are both great devices but they arent gaming PCs and sometimes a game doesnt run quite as well on the Legion as the SteamDeck And that is the real beauty of the SteamDeck If Steam says it runs it runs No frame rate drops no chug no tinkering The Legion performance and experience isnt quite as smooth Some games need a tinkering with to get them optimised Add to the fact the steam deck has better controls and options and it just feels like the better device But as I said its close enough that if you bought the Legion you arent going to feel like you bought an inferior device in the slightest Id be happy with either device and would not regret buying one over the other no matter which one I went with,n2ae1l7,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n3cvlnj,PartyDifficult,,1,2025-07-15 23:53:37,,,,I have the Legion Go S SteamOS 599 and I could tell you from experience that it struggles with fps on 1200p with most games Sometimes even on 1080 I currently have that one and the Steam Deck OLED and been struggling for the last month on which one to keep,n2ae1l7,2.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0kx1wf,physeK,,42,2025-06-30 14:15:20,,,,Just a callout that is purely anecdotal and might be worthless here Im an original Legion Go owner I loaded Bazzite onto it and have been exceedingly happy with it its basically SteamOS but with some extra customization options Literally last night inspired by some other posts that I saw I installed the official SteamOS release onto it instead I know its not technically officially supported but most folks were saying that it was functional Well it wasnt My FPS in the Steam interface outside of any games was pathetically poor I was seeing consistent drops to less than 60FPS and brief hangs that brought me into the 10s I tried to play one game Sworn which is similar to Hades and it was holding a steady 20FPS at 720p I loaded Bazzite back onto it Consistent 144hz in the OS 5560FPS at 1600x900 resolution while on the Balanced TDP profile Night and day difference Now I noticed while poking the BIOS to disable secure boot that my Legion Go was set to the quiet hardware mode which is an 8W TDP I dont recall setting that myself but I mightve done so a year ago or more I didnt see anywhere to customize TDP draw in SteamOS like I did with Bazzite and that well may have accounted for the performance dip But without a quick way to customize forced to go into the BIOS it would be annoying Im guessing there are things that one could install to allow for this control but thats an extra step Tldr original Legion Go is great especially with Bazzite My experience with SteamOS was subpar but mightve been my own fault,,0.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0roskc,SSD84,,3,2025-07-01 14:58:15,,,,Thanks for your input The original legion go was on sale for 500 on Amazon so I was wondering how it worked with steam OS I also wonder if Valve will work on it as much as they are working on with ROG Ally Considering that lenovo just released the legion go with same exact specs,n0kx1wf,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rs4ce,physeK,,1,2025-07-01 15:14:09,,,,The Legion Go S is supposed to have official support for SteamOS so theyre working with Lenovo for sure The original Legion perhaps not Ive seen other reports of it working well I suspect that if my TDP wasnt set for 8W the experience may have been better and I believe that there are tools available to allow for TDP switching in SteamOS as well From my experience the SteamOS installation was smooth and seamless definitely the quickest OS install Ive ever done But while its a tad bit more complex I returned to Bazzite for 99 of the same experience with some additional stuff builtin Im not sure if they have an image specifically for the Legion Go but its available in the device dropdown menu so its definitely tested at a minimum Ive been very happy with it for my Steam games which is 99 of my Steam library Once Windows releases their improved handheld experience or whatever alongside the Xbox Ally or whatever its called Ill probably give Windows a shot again because rumor is that as part of the project theyre cutting way down on bloat boosting performance and suppressing a lot of the annoyances While maintaining full Windows compatibility including all launchers and Xbox Gamepass,n0roskc,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0kgfph,MassLuca007,,91,2025-06-30 12:41:28,,,,I dont see why no one talks about the rog Ally and only the Steam deck Do people really not like handheld windows I dont really find it that bad,,0.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0rsckq,GrayDaysGoAway,,5,2025-07-01 15:15:12,,,,I like it because its compatible with everything With SteamOS you cant even use basic stuff like gamepass or popular streaming apps without jumping through a bunch of hoops It was a massive pain in the ass for me and contributed greatly to my decision to sell my Deck,n0kvgg3,2.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0kye4p,mackandelius,,34,2025-06-30 14:22:13,,,,If it wasnt for the fact that I like dabbling with Linux then my Steam Deck would have felt like a console Windows on a handheld is not even close to being that seamless it just isnt made for screens that small or the controls available on a handheld,n0kgfph,1.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0lrzna,Persian2PTConversion,,11,2025-06-30 16:46:10,,,,Yeah not having a decent sized track pad is a deal breaker Have fun playing Rimworld on an analog stick or a track pad the size of your pinky The Steam Deck configuration is the clear winner nothing comes close Now if only it was a bit faster,n0kytaw,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0mjf2x,jay227ify,,5,2025-06-30 18:54:24,,,,All theyd need to do for the deck 2 is just increase the chips speed and keep the same battery life keeping everything the same and people would be extremely happy Obv QOL stuff like 169 for seamless docking including a dock detachable controllers anti cheat resolution bump less small glitches would all be great but the deck is already so close to perfection where it matters,n0lrzna,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0otz1d,tyrantcv,,4,2025-07-01 02:14:58,,,,I keep seeing people mention how amazing the track pads are but I barely use them Ive tried in a few games to replace a mouse and I feel like I have more control using the joystick what am I doing wrong lol,n0kytaw,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rrenz,GrayDaysGoAway,,2,2025-07-01 15:10:51,,,,Hard disagree I owned a Deck got rid of it last year and got an Ally X and havent for one second missed the trackpads I found them extremely awkward to game with and only used ever them because the touchscreen on the Deck is comically bad,n0kytaw,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rxq3k,KasseanaTheGreat,,2,2025-07-01 15:39:36,,,,What types of games do you tend to play on your handhelds Just from experience Im not sure if I could play something like Crusader Kings 3 or Civ 6 as much as I have on the Deck without the trackpads,n0rrenz,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0ryrjh,GrayDaysGoAway,,2,2025-07-01 15:44:21,,,,Thats fair strategy would be a different beast But I wouldnt want to play those on such a small screen tbh I mostly stick to action adventure games fighters RPGs puzzle games etc on handheld For more involved games I play on my regular PC,n0rxq3k,4.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0rzmej,KasseanaTheGreat,,1,2025-07-01 15:48:13,,,,Theyre a lot better on the handhelds than most people give them credit for CK3 Im pretty sure Ive put more hours in on the Deck than on a proper PC CK3 in particular gives you a lot of control to scale up the UI to make it feel more specifically designed for a handheld screen,n0ryrjh,5.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0mtndv,punIn10ded,,4,2025-06-30 19:44:12,,,,As it currently stands is a sub par experience Navigating the desktop is such a subpar experience But for me personally its the lack of instant pause and resume IMHO a portable device without that is pointless Steamdeck and the Switch have it Windows portables do not,n0kgfph,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0mu8gf,Oops_I_Cracked,,3,2025-06-30 19:47:05,,,,Absolutely people do not like windows on a handheld Even Microsoft knows this thats why theyve given the Xbox team broad power to customize windows in ways theyve never been allowed to before on the new Xbox branded handheld,n0kgfph,1.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0oz21v,LiftSleepRepeat123,,1,2025-07-01 02:46:15,,,,My prejudice comes from being a Linux and Mac poweruser who has been able to configure my system exactly for my needs Chief among these are keyboard shortcuts superior on Mac keyboard and mouse shortcuts for moving and resizing windows an option in any Unixbased operating system You may not care about these things but I do and I dont spend all that much of my computer use gaming so it takes secondary consideration I just buy a separate PC just for gaming at this point though The fact is that Windows is more of a walled garden has less customizability and continues to push some of the most ridiculous sales tricks on people and yet the gaming community which normally opposes large corps for their greed seem to think that simply using older Microsoft IP ie Windows 7 when 10 was out or 10 when 11 came out is somehow sticking it to the man,n0oyafv,5.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0p1ezz,Cbeckstrand,,1,2025-07-01 03:01:06,,,,I should have phrased my comment better I do understand some of the hate for windows on a handheld since it is very clunky and not well optimized for gaming with all the junk running in the background For someone expecting a console experiance I can absolutely see the appeal of SteamOS The problem is that so many people think SteamOS is the solution for eveything I had far more frustration with my SteamDeck why I tried to do anything outside of Steam and I have enjoyed the Ally so much more even with all windows quirks I know this is largely because of my lack of Linux knowledge but I dont see how anyone nontechnical would have any better experiance if they venture outside of the Steam wall garden,n0oz21v,6.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0lj5wi,Velgus,,3,2025-06-30 16:03:40,,,,Im a longtime PC gamer and am not a fan of the trackpads At least not for actually controlling ingame movement of any sort their other features like custom input menus with SteamInput and typing are alright but losing them wouldnt necessarily be a dealbreaker when considering handhelds just a bonus to factor into a decision If Im playing a game on Deck Im not going to be playing it competitively anyways so I dont care if sticks are technically inferior for precise control or whatever which I wont deny just like with mice movementtomovement definitely has a higher capacity for speed and precision than tilttomovement ignoring the fact that some games have substantially overtuned autoaim if using controllers Im playing on Deck to sit back or lie down and relax and analog sticks are substantially more comfortable for that eg if you have to make a continuous leftward movement you just tilt left not repeatedly have to move your thumb lift it move it again etc The only games I wouldnt mind playing as much with the trackpads are ones that are MKBonly and also very slow paced such that theres never any need to quickly select anything like Disco Elysium Even then analogtomouse works fine for those too If a game is MKBonly and required fast pace movement and precise clicking or a large variety of keyboard inputs I wouldnt play it on the Deck in the first place,n0l9hc0,3.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0jwph3,Fredasa,,22,2025-06-30 10:10:01,,,,I like how they had an opportunity to go with the both analog pads on the bottom layout and differentiate themselves in that way but nobodys pretending anymore Not even Nintendo Primary analog stick underneath left thumb at rest primary buttons underneath right thumb at rest Sony is kinda stuck because they know theyd be flayed alive if they dared to walk back the Dualshock layout even though the only reason it was like that was because there was nowhere else to put the pads,,0.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0k3s7v,VagueSomething,,12,2025-06-30 11:11:49,,,,It is definitely the superior layout for the majority of people despite a small group insisting Sony has it right Honestly as iconic as it is I think overall people would appreciate Sony fixing their controller Their layout between the bumpers and sticks is only good if you use claw grip Most people are not the Butler from Scary Movie though,n0jwph3,1.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0ke6cf,Fredasa,,9,2025-06-30 12:26:59,,,,Honestly as iconic as it is I think overall people would appreciate Sony fixing their controller Its not impossible As of the PS4 they finally ditched the ergonomicallychallenged housing theyd been on since 1994 and they seem to have lived to tell the tale And with the PS5 pad they edge kind of shamelessly in the direction of the Xbox form factor as did Nintendo Grips are still a touch too vertical but Im sure theyll get there My guess They have a portable PS5 coming They really _cant_ get away with keeping the primary analog stick at such an inconvenient spot on a Steamdeck clone so they may just go ahead and use that as their excuse and say their hands were tied,n0k3s7v,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0k9774,yelsamarani,,11,2025-06-30 11:52:52,,,,My brain just cant accept the thumbsticks not symmetrical lol And I think that colors my entire experience with controllers where the thumbsticks in different vertical locations Im already predisposed to dislike them as soon as I hold them and my brain just refuses to learn to use them as it screams this fucking thing is not symmetrical,n0k3s7v,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0kbo69,VagueSomething,,2,2025-06-30 12:10:12,,,,Nature finds symmetry to be ugly but it pleases the human brain especially for neuro divergent individuals Personally function over form is my preference the left stick being higher makes moving forward easier as the thumb rests ready to go with the shape of the hand so long sessions cause less strain The right stick has the thumb under tension as looking is a rapid movement but the constant walking in games doesnt need the left thumb under such stress,n0k9774,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0kekej,Fredasa,,0,2025-06-30 12:29:31,,,,My brain just cant accept the thumbsticks not symmetrical lol This was Nintendos hangup too They tried the Playstation layout for the Wii Pro Controller Realized having the main analog stick on the bottom kinda sucked Then they tried having both analog sticks on the _top_ WiiU Pro Controller and realized that having the primary buttons that 99 of games use on the bottom also kind of sucked Then they finally threw in the towel on their precious symmetry But we got a glorious and idealized Robotron control pad out of it,n0k9774,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0le17f,cabalavatar,,6,2025-06-30 15:39:07,,,,It is _not_ definitely the superior layout Thats hogwash from bias Sony does not need to fix the analogs on its controller because they are as they _should_ be symmetrical That was a big reason why I got a Steamdeck over a Lenovo or Asus Properly symmetrical joysticks Idk about the rest of your hands but my left hand and that of every other human Ive met are not mangled claws with a thumb that points upwards,n0k3s7v,2.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0m0pvj,TechNickL,,2,2025-06-30 17:26:25,,,,My one largest complaint with my GPD win max is that the buttons and sticks are all in one row and they went with Xbox layout The problem is that since theyre all in one row using the right stick or the dpad feels awkward Because you have to bring your thumb inwards instead of down So natural positions that arent awkwardly asymmetrical are left stick and face buttons works or right stick and dpad but youre almost never using the dpad and the right stick at the same time A lot of modern games use both sticks and the triggers so in that form factor PS layout actually kind of makes sense I guess it depends but most games I play that mostly use face buttons are 2d and dont mind using the dpad,n0jwph3,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0n7teg,Fredasa,,2,2025-06-30 20:53:14,,,,Because you have to bring your thumb inwards instead of down Yeah thats braindead The reason the Xbox layout works on a pad is because the thing 99 of games need you to control is sitting directly underneath your thumb at rest The scenario youve outlined completely violates that design advantage A lot of modern games use both sticks and the triggers so in that form factor PS layout actually kind of makes sense Sure theres no one size fits all Theres only one size fits most Realistically speaking though the games youre talking about are almost certainly better to play with KBM I will say that the Xbox _controller_ as an entire package is far from perfect Especially if were talking about XB1 Its the layout that wins Theres nothing stopping Microsoft from giving us bumper buttons that are actually buttons as opposed to levers but apparently thats a bridge too far And obviously they have some serious design hangups when it comes to the poor Dpadthe best one theyve ever had was only available on limited edition 360 controllers But eh as long as I can comfortably use the Dpad as four bonus buttons Im happy,n0m0pvj,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0nti7p,TechNickL,,1,2025-06-30 22:45:24,,,,Yeah but sometimes I wanna play em without having to set the thing on a desk Not necessarily shooters but like say fromsoft games I seem to remember at least one dark souls game didnt support the mouse in the first place you had to use wasd and ihjk as dual sticks,n0n7teg,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0wjj69,TechNickL,,1,2025-07-02 07:21:27,,,,I will say that the Xbox controller as an entire package is far from perfect Honestly yeah from a feature perspective dualsense reigns supreme but from a layout perspective Xbox nailed it first and as long as were talking just sticks and buttons no one has found a way to do it better Except with regard to heavily specialized controllers like fightsticks and the like I do love me my leverless,n0n7teg,3.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n0wutq6,Fredasa,,1,2025-07-02 09:13:09,,,,The ergonomics of the Xbox pad has also been essentially perfect with minor inconsequential tweaks since Xbox 360 whereas I still dont consider the PS5 pad comfortable to hold even though theyve blatantly scooted the frame in an obvious Xbox direction twice now The grips are just too vertical The less the wrists need to bend from a neutral position centerpoint between both extremes the better The angle you get on an Xbox pad is just fine not so vertical that I feel inclined to hold the pad away from my lap and not so angled that its just a silly design,n0wjj69,4.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n1mpicj,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-07-06 13:20:26,,,,Actually I should have said the original Duke Xbox controller was also ergonomically amazing IMO it just looked ridiculous and the black and white buttons placement actually made a lot of sense since the design of the Xbox was influenced by Microsoft devouring the corpse of SEGA of America it was like the 6 button controllers on SEGA consoles that worked great for fighting games Controller S moved them totally out of the way and suddenly it felt just random,n1mavpa,7.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n1m8e0j,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-07-06 11:15:03,,,,Nobody remembers the original PS1 controller with no analogues But I remember That shit ruled for Tekken But the analogues were added as a how do we change the shell molding and PCB layout the least midgen afterthought that happened to catch on Theres not an amazing reason for the layout to be the way it is it was just convenient from a manufacturing standpoint and it stuck,n0jwph3,1.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n1mbdlx,Fredasa,,1,2025-07-06 11:40:06,,,,Precisely It was sort of Sonys bad luck that they felt that retrofitting their existing pad was the best way forward Or Microsofts good luck that they didnt have any shackles when situating their own layoutthough I will say it was prescient of them to understand that the analog stick was going to be the primary way of controlling console games which in turn dictated their decision to go against the Nintendo and Playstation trend and place it in the primary spot for the thumb,n1m8e0j,2.0,1lo1dt1
comment,n1mq2dg,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-07-06 13:23:56,,,,It wasnt even that prescient that left thumb stick placement was already done on Dreamcast and the design influence transferred via Microsoft eating the fresh remains of SEGA of America It just made too much sense,n1mbdlx,3.0,1lo1dt1

comment,n0k5yut,cobaltocene,,7,2025-06-30 11:28:49,,,,I stuck with the Steam Deck throughandthrough for its ergonomics just felt right to hold you know I got the LeGoS recently because I wanted to try something with a bigger screen and higher specs specifically in this case because people had called out its ergonomics as a selling point Its very very good Im still getting used to it and there are some things that I dont prefer the placement of the home and QAM buttons the sizeplacement of the right stick but so far none are dealbreakers The biggest thing going for it is that the console is huge but you can barely tell while youre holding it It just feels right The Ally didnt have that shape despite being lighter and the original LeGo just didnt feel great to hold for very long note the Go S is actually much closer in size to the OG Go than I expected but despite that I cant tell while gaming For me the best handheld is the one that just feels right when I pick it up something that doesnt feel like a chore to play for a longer session I game a lot on airplanes no blue 8bitdo either Steam Deck had been the only one that did that for me but the Go S is the first that feels like it could actually get me to retire my Steam Deck,n0jhir9,1.0,1lo1dt1
