comment,miq2uro,tifosiv122,,657,2025-03-20 01:28:57,,,,Under the settlement agreement HP doesnt admit to any wrongdoing It also wont pay any monetary relief to customers impacted by the November 2020 firmware update However HP agreed to pay 5000 each to Mobile Emergency Housing Corp Performance Automotive Tire Center and David Justin Lynch who was eventually added to the complaint to compensate them for the services they performed on behalf of the classes HP said It will also pay 725000 in attorneys fees and expenses A win for HP users comes from the companys legal commitment to allow users of specific printers to decline firmware updates that would push Dynamic Security Wow the lead plaintiffs got 5k and everyone else got a commitment Lawyers got 725k,,0.0,1jfd4n8

comment,miqpoxv,MyLastAcctWasBetter,,18,2025-03-20 03:52:15,,,,I mean you do realize that the alternative to no class actions is no accountability right Our legislatures arent doing shit about anything and wont enact any meaningful commercial regulations in the near to distant future Without class actions consumers would have no ability to take on large companies given the cost to win ratio their damages just arent that large Class actions ensure that companies cant harm consumers in micro transactions without some recourse And the more people who join the suit the more leverage the class has The system isnt perfect and its only growing more limited with infinite arbitration clauses But its sure as shit better than nothing If you think companies are shit with the existence of class actions imagine how much exponentially shittier they would be without any means of mass accountability And thats saying nothing about the injunctive forms of class action relief,miqeug6,4.0,1jfd4n8

comment,mit4j4s,TheRealLazloFalconi,,9,2025-03-20 15:21:21,,,,The alternative is judges actually making damages damaging to the company and more importantly its shareholders When the awarded amounts are so low that just becomes the cost of doing business a line item the same way company cars or electric bills is,miqpoxv,5.0,1jfd4n8
comment,mit89rt,MyLastAcctWasBetter,,2,2025-03-20 15:39:38,,,,Bro do you know how class actions work Judges dont make the damages Class actions almost NEVER go to trial because it benefits neither side Thus the two sides negotiate over settlements and then at the very end the judge holds a hearing to determine whether to approve the settlement But the judge cant just magically supersede their negotiations and demand the company pay more He can deny the settlement if he thinks its in the class best interest but there are several factors the judge considers to make this judgement And he doesnt get to then demand more money from the company Youre suggesting that single judges should have power that they just dont If you want actual penalties to be imposed Im with you 10000 But this is something that CONGRESS must enact And just FYI even extremely high punitive damages can be predicted and factored into the cost of doing business If its predictable its factored Thus when a company chooses not to take some shitty action theyve determined the cost of litigationpenalties is too high to be worth it And when they choose to take an action theyve made the other calculation The only way to counteract this analysis would be through introduction of unpredictability and uncapped punitive damage awards And I hate to break it to you but most states have passed legislation preventing those And the Supreme Court has also held that they should be calculable,mit4j4s,6.0,1jfd4n8

comment,miqyetw,night-shark,,9,2025-03-20 05:02:14,,,,The funny thing is lawyers get all the flack for this and certainly to a good extent that is justified But having been a litigator its insane how many clients insist on moving ahead with costly lengthy litigation just for the principle contrary to advice Clients would hire us wed advise them that litigation is expensive and that they were better off pursuing alternative options or just letting it go Then theyd insist on litigating Then when wed send them the bill theyd complain and complain Then when they got a lukewarm or even bad outcome theyd blame us So glad to get out of that Lawyers can but those clients suck worse lol,miq3y0v,2.0,1jfd4n8

comment,mismfc9,Mr_ToDo,,2,2025-03-20 13:48:24,,,,Kind of hard to search for that But from what I can see it looks like the answer is the same solid maybe as when I started So I found this It talks about a cartridge vulnerability The problem is that its a report on malware that HP themselves reported as part of the bug bounty program And it seems they didnt want to release any real proper details on it I mean its a buffer overflow But so what What is it targeting how does it gain persistence and while not part of a vulnerability knowing what was wrong would go a long way to knowing what they did to fix it assuming that this wasnt the thing that locked people into OEM only ink anyway,miqn3xs,2.0,1jfd4n8
