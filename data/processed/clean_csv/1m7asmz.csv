comment,n4q2g9k,YourWaifusHusbando,,245,2025-07-23 14:59:06,,,,The console gaming community is used to that Look at the PS5 theres barely any games on it that arent on the previous console or every other platform Its got nothing new on it barely any games have utilized the hardware and theyre already talking about the 6,n4pzb8h,1.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4qjs8w,Remy0507,,158,2025-07-23 16:19:05,,,,Saying that there are very few games that are exclusive to ONLY the PS5 if youre including PC in the conversation is accurate Saying that theres nothing new on it or barely any games utilizing the hardware is just silly nonsense though Every game that runs at 60fps on the PS5 but only 30fps on the PS4 is utilizing the hardware,n4q2g9k,2.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4rex4s,Seienchin88,,-7,2025-07-23 18:40:31,,,,All ps4 and most ps3 hits in updated form thats already enough to make those console look weak in comparison On top of that astrobot ff7rebirth Baldurs gate 3 HZD FW death stranding 2 doom the dark ages and demon souls remake Not to mention resi4 remake and cyberpunk are technically also on ps4 but really poor if not downright unplayable And probably more I dont remember but bottom line I defy you to name a console with a better game lineup even if many games are just playable ps4 versions,n4r48uo,5.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4rku5u,lemonylol,,4,2025-07-23 19:07:59,,,,Yeah but then he only lists three exclusives over the like 5 years the PS5 has been out while his whole point was that the Nintendo Switch 2 has 2 exclusives within just the first few months of release Like otherwise if were including crossplatform games this really is just a reason to buy a PC,n4rjz1c,8.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4rlfkc,Remy0507,,15,2025-07-23 19:10:47,,,,Unless you just dont want to deal with PC gaming believe it or not some people prefer gaming from their couch in their living room without any hassle being involved,n4rku5u,9.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4soo0r,Teldrynnn,,2,2025-07-23 22:20:03,,,,I play on PlayStation with my friend on PC and the amount of times his game is crashing or loading shaders while Im just playing the game is one reason I love consoles I have a beefygaming laptop I just cant get some of my favorite games like Red Dead 2 to run without weird issues So I pretty much only play my consoles Maybe its just an issue with my system but man PC gaming involves so many more individual updates like system GPU multiple launchers having to reload shaders on game updates And then certain games having to run on different APIs for better performance depending on what hardware you have and other random stuff like that Its just a hassle lol I guess is my main complaint Id rather just press 2 buttons on my controller and be playing my game,n4rxij7,13.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4u0fqy,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-07-24 02:52:36,,,,RDR2 is a game from 20182019 Do you have any current examples Jedi Fallen Order Thats not a multiplayer game so it cant be the one in the fake story,n4tulvx,18.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4xy328,Teldrynnn,,1,2025-07-24 18:04:48,,,,The story is that I had issues with single player games and how much of a hassle it is And secondarily that my friend on PC who I play call of duty with has a lot of issues when I play with him You can extrapolate whatever you want from that its the reality of my life lol,n4vktjh,21.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4skbad,ItsBlizzardLizard,,12,2025-07-23 21:57:24,,,,Saying that there are very few games that are exclusive to ONLY the PS5 if youre including PC in the conversation is accurate This is all Ive ever said and people still get angry at me I have a PC The only game Im missing out on is Astrobot And thats an awesome game But a whole console for one game I dont care about Demons Souls,n4qjs8w,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4slx24,Remy0507,,5,2025-07-23 22:05:41,,,,Also Gran Turismo 7 If you care about that I dont have a PS5 for the handful of games that arent on PC though I have a PS5 for those games to be able to play their other first party games when they come out instead of having to wait for the PC port and this is key because I dont want to play games on PC And I have a PC Its getting old now but its still capable and was top of the line when I built it in 2018 And you know what ended up happening When games came out I would end up playing them on my consoles in my living room from my couch and not on the PC that I paid 2500 to build Thats why I have a PS5,n4skbad,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4so1go,ItsBlizzardLizard,,1,2025-07-23 22:16:46,,,,And thats totally fair Almost like its good to have options I went the opposite direction Over the years Ive slowly used my consoles less and less and as Ive gotten older use my PC more and more PC having such seamless controller support now was a huge part of this That and moving away from TV DVR to online streaming really discouraged me from using my TV I miss oldschool DVR So now Id rather watch at my PC and have adblock etc while not paying for the ad free tier The only thing I miss is not having a 4k Bluray player after selling the consoles I still have my launch PS4 and it does 1080p fine I kind of want to upgrade to a PS4 Pro just for media A big drawback on the PS5 is the lack of DLNAUPnP PS4 isnt great at it either but its better than the PS5 not having it at all Meanwhile PS3 is the best for it but I want to be able to use Hulu Dont really know what the answer is PS4 Pro feels like the best option My launch PS4 does have PT on it though,n4slx24,5.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4wvccn,M3thodFud,,2,2025-07-24 15:09:28,,,,Same as you all my consoles are boxed up now besides my Switch 12 and Steam Deck The PC is my primary gaming device If I want to play on the couch and not at a desk in my office I just use Moonlight to stream to my living room which works pretty damn good As for the 4K bluray players I just bought a Panasonic Bluray player that supports Dolby Atmos and Vision I dont need to keep my large consoles in the living room anymore which is nice Plus last I remembered my PS4 Pro didnt support 4K Bluray movies and my Xbox One X was subpar and didnt support things I wanted like Dolby Vision For the media sharing I built a home server with spare PC parts that I had loaded it up with 1000s of moviesTV shows and set up Plex Just about every device in our house can use Plex Its great for the kids or wife that cant tell the difference between streaming something and playing an 4K movie off a Bluray haha No more subscriptions and no more kids handling my Blu rays,n4so1go,6.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4wrcbd,MiaowaraShiro,,1,2025-07-24 14:50:59,,,,I took it more as they were saying there arent many games designed to take advantage of the PS5 not that there arent games that can take advantage of more horsepower Games that are made possible by the PS5s hardware vs games that are made better by it Edit I personally have no clue the state of things in the PS4 world Im a PC gamer mostly,n4qjs8w,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4wrwwg,Remy0507,,1,2025-07-24 14:53:39,,,,I mean there are varying degrees of course Its not like most games for any given console generation are really pushing the hardware to the max and taking full advantage of it How many games on the PS3 looked as good as The Last of Us or Uncharted 3,n4wrcbd,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n563dub,SharpEdgeSoda,,1,2025-07-25 22:28:22,,,,Which is also true of the Switch 2 as well The PS5 has won as the FifaNetflix box this gen Thats a massive market often buying games 2nd hand as well so the sales numbers are hard to track I do think its impressive that it would be odd for someone to buy the Switch 2 as their Fifa box but a lot of people need their Mario Kart box,n4qjs8w,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qcz8i,Orbital2,,34,2025-07-23 15:47:36,,,,I feel like this is a weird standard because you are essentially punishing Sony for more consumer friendly practices making games available on previous consoles pc They have released loads of great games you can play on PS5 In terms of strictly the PS4 PS5 debate Plenty of people upgrade their PCs when they dont have to to get better graphicsperformance,n4q2g9k,2.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4qutd2,y0ssarian-lives,,8,2025-07-23 17:09:24,,,,Something I dont see talked about enough whenever this comes up load times alone are worth the price of admission on PS5 You can play RDR2 or the massive Assassins Creed games on PS4 if you have to But the load times alone make the PS5 experience so much better,n4qcz8i,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qxsrd,royalenocheese,,3,2025-07-23 17:22:33,,,,Thats why I upgraded Destiny 2 loading into a trials match on ps4 was hilarious Theyre on round 2 and I can hear my team dying but the screen is black Load times with interactions built in being gone was worth the cost I have barely any time to play so Id rather spend it playing and not waiting to play,n4qutd2,4.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4q5qql,Chad_Broski_2,,5,2025-07-23 15:14:25,,,,Its been this way for decades tbh The PS3 is one of the best consoles in history and I still remember people memeing about it in like 2008 that itd been out for a few years and still had almost no good exclusives But then Uncharted 2 Persona 5 and the Last of Us came out and all was forgiven People are more than willing to buy a console now to play games that will be released in the future And honestly there are some dope looking games coming An exclusive Fromsoft game could be enough to buoy a console on its own plus all the usual first party Nintendo IPs,n4q2g9k,2.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q6yz7,OriMoriNotSori,,22,2025-07-23 15:20:03,,,,Except that PS3 was released in late 2006early 2007 depending on region so in 2008 the console was a little over a year old at worst PS5 is now 5 years old This would be like PS3 being in 20112012 and theres still not enough games being developed for it or something,n4q5qql,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q7g2e,Chad_Broski_2,,6,2025-07-23 15:22:15,,,,Oh yeah fair point Still had the S2 on my mind didnt realize how far behind the PS5 was Although I dont think the S2 is gonna follow suit from the Nintendo Direct it looks like they have a lot of games coming in late 2025 and 2026 Nintendo can always fall back on their first party IPs while I guess Sony is having trouble enticing developers to keep anything exclusive,n4q6yz7,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q9e37,OriMoriNotSori,,8,2025-07-23 15:31:08,,,,I think the long lead times for developing good third party games doesnt help too Alot of casual gamers would just play stuff like GTA and FIFAEAFC and back when they would release new gen exclusive features people could feel the next gen leap too Like I remembered how for the first proper PS4 FIFA game they added actual individual blades of grass on the field instead of it being just a flat surface before and I was mindblown lol,n4q7g2e,5.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4r58bs,lemonylol,,1,2025-07-23 17:55:40,,,,I dont know why you included The Last of Us on there didnt that come out at the last year of its lifespan lol What about God of War Infamous Ico Fat Princess MGS4 Killzone Resistance Twisted Metal Little Big Planet and Ratchet and Clank,n4q5qql,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4rcwhd,Chad_Broski_2,,2,2025-07-23 18:31:10,,,,Yeah Persona 5 was near the end of the PS3s run too iirc I didnt put much thought into it just was trying to remember the highestprofile PS3 releases in the later half of its life cycle God of War was PS2 though no I think either GoW 2 or 3 was in like 2010 though and was the first one on the PS3 Same with Killzone I dont know I cant remember exactly it but I do remember for a hot minute that the Xbox 360 had waaaay better exclusives than the PS3 but then the PS3 caught up and surpassed the 360 by the early 2010s,n4r58bs,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4rjgc9,lemonylol,,2,2025-07-23 19:01:29,,,,God of War 3 was PS3 Im just saying God of War in general because the PS3 also had the remasters of 1 and 2 and Ascension The 360 had better exclusives but it also had far less exclusives It was essentially just the Halo games Gears of War and Forza A lot of people just went for the 360 because of Xbox Live despite needing to pay for it and this was precrossplay And I think at the time there were also exclusives on XBLA,n4rcwhd,5.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4q541w,ProjectPorygon,,5,2025-07-23 15:11:34,,,,I think with nintendo typically you can depend on them to always have a ton of great games on their consoles even if by every metric theyre a failure even virtual boy has more first party developed exclusives somehow then ps5 With PlayStation its a crapshoot if youre getting anything but a remasterremake There will be a few new titles on the console sure but they heavily depend on third parties to maintain their library And XboxiswellXbox I think Nintendo achieved around 80 first party titlesexclusives during the switch gen Which given thats 8 years or so is basically the best console gaming investment Theyre just dependable to almost always give ya amazing experiences,n4pzb8h,1.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4s1k9o,kdog6791,,3,2025-07-23 20:26:43,,,,Honestly the issue here is that most of what youre criticizing isnt unique to Nintendo Its industry standard across PlayStation Xbox and Steam Nintendo is just now catching up with some of these modern DRM practices and because its new for them theyre taking way more flack than competitors whove been doing it for years For example the idea that you dont actually own the console or your games well thats true across the board when it comes to digital purchases Youre not buying the game itself youre buying a license to use it Sony Microsoft Valve they all reserve the right to revoke that license under certain circumstances Its right there in their user agreements This isnt a Nintendoexclusive issue In fact all of Nintendos firstparty games are fully on the cartridge which means you actually own them The bricking concern is also being misrepresented Nintendo has the ability to revoke online access if youre found violating the terms usually for modding piracy etc but theres no evidence theyre out here randomly bricking physical consoles Every time a story surfaces theres always more to it Maybe someone bought a used game that had previously been banned due to that copy having been pirated Its never just a clean innocent user getting targeted out of nowhere And even in those edge cases people have appealed and gotten it resolved In none of those cases has Nintendo ever fully bricked someones console You can still use it offline just like how Sony and Microsoft handle bans for modding or other violations They all block you from online services not the console entirely And yeah to be clear Nintendo does deserve criticism in certain areas Charging 80 for Mario Kart World Total BS Ten bucks for Welcome Tour Also BS But you dont have to pay for it and Im not And even then you can essentially get MKW for 50 when you grab the 500 bundle with the system Thats not a bad deal Its just frustrating how much legit criticism gets wrapped in misinformation and outrage bait and then reasonable people get misled into thinking Nintendo is uniquely evil when in reality theyre doing what everyone else has been doing just with more spotlight on them If Nintendos the villain here then so is every other major gaming company,n4rdujr,5.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4tymp6,alidan,,1,2025-07-24 02:41:17,,,,because everyone discounts the fanboys who will buy even at a scalped price they exist for every console and it seems nintendo had a massive stockpile of console unlike sonymicrosoftnintendos usual paper launch and then constantly trying to keep up with stock for 2 years approach I dont put much value in fastest selling at launch I want to see the sustain and how many games they sell going forward because 8090 a game is going to likely bite them in the ass on their software sales,n4pxhno,1.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qs0aw,LickMyTicker,,0,2025-07-23 16:56:52,,,,Not sure about anyone else but I bought it now because I know I wanted it eventually and Im scared of price increases over tariffs Nintendo is known to deliver their 1st party games and I like playing them I would have probably waited had the economy been less volatile I think there are still a ton of frivolous spenders out there making purchases thinking things are about to tighten up Also Nintendo had stock It is not as if previous releases for consoles had overstock just waiting to be purchased Its mostly been about inventory,n4pxhno,1.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qrorb,VagueSomething,,-3,2025-07-23 16:55:26,,,,The conversation isnt without nuance it isnt purely Nintendo Bad and it would be silly to take such a stance but theyre not without problems The issue comes down to things like decades of aggressive legal attacks on fans and heavy handed attitudes towards consumers that contradict the PR image of Nintendo being a childrenfamily focused company On the aspects of how the company treats workers sure Nintendo seems to be doing well for the industry They had limited layoffs in 2024 but have a large retention of staff overall It is good to support companies that treats employees well and it is worth rewarding companies that value the people who make their company successful beyond just large payouts for their management Most things are never black and white It is why forums are worth using for discussion rather than purely tweeted rants Here we can discuss how the hostile IP protection and years of attempting to end the secondhand market is likely why Nintendo can try to maintain staff at higher rates than the current standard We can break down where we fall on the idea of this poisoned chalice and question if theres room for a better balance This shouldnt ever be a circle jerking echo chamber of Nintendo Bad or Hurr Reddit Wrong Again There are legitimate arguments to be had for and against most aspects and the idea of a forum is to expose yourself to other opinions and new facts to help your own opinions to form and evolve,n4qjnyw,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4yyl8c,FigoStep,,2,2025-07-24 20:56:22,,,,Nintendo recently released the average age of users playing various popular switch games and numerous had an average age of late 30searly 40s This is such an outdated lame misconception From a report released two days ago And yet according to new research on average age and gender ratios for popular video games it appears the average Nintendo fan is in their 30s while online live service games are where the younger audiences are The research was conducted by GEM Partners and Nikkei Entertainment which surveyed 30000 people across the ages of 15 to 69 and has been handily compiled and translated over on the ResetEra forums Also this Nintendo franchises appear to skew more towards older audiences The average age of players of the Super Mario Kirby and Pokémon games falls between 30 and 32 with The Legend Of Zelda and Animal Crossing sharing an average player age of 35,n4whm05,2.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4z1fuj,tokoraki23,,-1,2025-07-24 21:10:02,,,,Youre conflating two different measures You said this is a report of users but its not its a survey of video game fans ages 1569 So not only does this have nothing to do with who is playing the Switch the data literally doesnt even include children Surveying teenagers and people who grew up playing Nintendo games of course the average age of those 30 year old franchises are 30 year old people The average active age of a Switch 2 user is not over 30 Anyway youre the one that chose to be insulted Im just speaking facts,n4yyl8c,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4z2n90,FigoStep,,2,2025-07-24 21:15:56,,,,You said its a console designed for children and yet the vast majority of users are adults Youre focusing on all the wrong things to make a dubious point Its clear the console caters towards an adult audience in addition to releasing family friendly games Why on earth would a game like Cyberpunk be released on it if it was designed for children Anyway full demographic data from 2021 including children Interestingly enough children only make up for a small portion of Switch players Ages 1012 are the biggest demographic among minors but the numbers pale in comparison to what we see from adults,n4z1fuj,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4zepw5,tokoraki23,,0,2025-07-24 22:16:59,,,,Dude its a console designed for children Just because adults play it doesnt mean that its not designed for children Its just a fact that Nintendo hardware is designed with children in mind first and foremost Its why the cartridges are coated in bitterant or is there an adults swallowing plastic epidemic that Im not aware of Can you name a single other video game peripheral or devices that includes a child safety feature Why does the first switch barely fit in my hands and is generally unusable without causing hand pain Maybe because it was made for the tiny hands of children No matter how many times you claim the users are mostly adults Nintendos core demographic is children first then nostalgia seeking adults Youre the one choosing to be insulted by it Im not using it as an insult Its factual and I just said to the guy hell be okay bc theres a billion other things he can do as an adult to cope with not having a switch 2 Anyway Id take surveys conducted in 20202021 on video game use with a pretty fucking massive grain of salt There happened to be some conflating variables there if you recall,n4z2n90,5.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4ztdpz,FigoStep,,1,2025-07-24 23:37:23,,,,They know theyre selling more to adults Thats why theyre pushing games like Eldin Ring Cyber Punk etc The demographics show that clearly Youre living in the 1980s The fact children play it doesnt mean its designed for children when they make way more money off it adults lol,n4zepw5,6.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qp2ak,dandroid126,,14,2025-07-23 16:43:40,,,,What Nintendo does is scummy Same with Microsoft though Same with Sony Same with Nvidia Same with Asus Same with Dell What am I supposed to do Not play games If I boycott every company that reddit tells me to boycott then I would be living naked in a pit in the ground that I dug with my hands because the companies that make shovels are too scummy I personally believe its up to our governments to protect us from scummy companies They are unfortunately doing the opposite Its not realistic for individuals to research every company and product before they buy things Imagine how long it would take for a trip to the grocery store,n4q3gkf,2.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4qyzv9,Veaeate,,1,2025-07-23 17:27:48,,,,Absolutely I totally agree Gov should be stopping this but it doesnt And it likely wont ever Its not an issue at the end of the day cuz you make up your own mind on how you spend the money I dont believe in ppl just simply stopping playing cuz what the heck are we gonna do then Unless its a collective stop the heck is one person really gonna do But I do believe ppl shouldnt stop calling companies out And there seems to be a disconnect on calling the company out when it comes to nintendo fans Those other companies get the fans calling them out most recent to memory is the helldivers Playstation issue that instantly comes to mind Nintendos fans seem to protect the company at all costs regardless of what they do and i think thats an issue in part as well Ppl out here defending the palworld pokemon patent issue is kinda wild imo SV is another one Ppl singing ita praises on the Switch 2 and how smooth its running meanwhile ppl were running it on emulators on their PC saying that from week one of its release that it was badly designed for the Switch End of the day ppl who said the system was gonna fail were wrong Like I said unless Nintendo fails in some kind of huge aspect they will never go out of business Especially in an era where new IPs are unwanted and companies play it safe,n4qp2ak,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q7iqb,Landondo,,12,2025-07-23 15:22:35,,,,I could see them failing if they start releasing mediocre games from their major IPs Someone at Nintendo said they are looking at shortening development times to save cost I feel like their systems are sold on Mario Zelda and Pokemon then to a lesser extent the other exclusives If they start pumping out flops then theres no reason to go Nintendo Maybe Im wrong though Pokemon seems to exist on nostalgia alone the quality of recent Pokemon games seems lackluster at best,n4q3gkf,2.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4qhdxc,VoidsInvanity,,-6,2025-07-23 16:07:56,,,,First off if buying isnt ownership piracy isnt theft Secondly it limits the console from ever playing a game not pre installed at that point Thats bricked imo But you can continue to simp for corporations who will continue to chip away at the agreement between the two sides because reasons,n4qgecg,5.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4rpaw2,ThatGuyBackThere280,,2,2025-07-23 19:29:06,,,,If you talk about it on reddit you get downvoted and called a bootlicker The top comments are people consistently praising Nintendo and upvoted of people making fun of others on reddit stating that this was something that this isnt exactly a good thing for consumers as a whole with increased pricing but want to feel redeemed They also conflagrate fastestselling vs longtime sales and think both are one and the same Its a little ironic in a way where the PS5 was at the previous role of fastest selling console but you had people on reddit still jumping on Sony for their actions on the anticonsumer stuff yet the moment Switch 2 surpassed that and suddenly a chunk of people flip on actions and ignore the anticonsumer actions theyre doing too The point on that last statement is that people will find any way to have a win with gradeschool mentality to feel right and console war antics If one enjoys the system is fine but also dont ignore their bad practices and brush them off cause it affects everyone,n4qo0rm,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4r74un,blacksoxing,,1,2025-07-23 18:04:22,,,,Cant lie it reads like a trick question as one of the biggest cons of the Switch 2 was that theres no games I mainly have just played these three games since June Zelda echos as it felt like the best time to finally dive into it Happy I did Mario Kart World Donkey Kong Banaza and I admit that I initially was going to wait on buying this one but my wife forced me to just pay the money I love just smashing shit after work I though bought this not for the games but just to be able to finally play games on a big screen if I felt like it The PS Portal is great and is the same size but its a different use case obviously I anticipate Im going to eventually get back to the regular Switch 1 games and again Im happy to do it on something I can easily see and hold It feels STURDY It looks vibrant No not as good as my OLEDs all around my house but I dont need it to be like that I just need it to work It works Hope that answers your question Have a great one,n4r2o48,4.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4q3oiy,IamEclipse,,-8,2025-07-23 15:04:56,,,,Bananza feels like a joke Im just not in on Ive watched the trailers and the direct they put out and it didnt really grab me so I held off buying it Yet every single review Ive seen of the game has been so insanely positive This isnt to hate if anything Im looking for someone to sell me on the DK magic,n4pykvz,2.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q5mem,SG4LPilgrim,,6,2025-07-23 15:13:53,,,,Id be happy to try So I think the biggest thing is that the game was sort of primarily sold as this big destruction fest It can be and its honestly a lot of fun to find a huge area on a stage go Bananza and just destroy things it works best like a traditional 3D exploratory platformer Nintendo excels in charm and DK nails it every new level is gorgeous there are a ton of fun ideas and it slowly evolves in a way that organically lets you grow into the systems Its Mario Odyssey level challenge in that the challenge is what you make it but its exciting to just explore There are soft determined paths towards some collectibles once you start noticing the signs but other times you might just decide to start slamming your fists into the ground and accidentally uncover a banana or fossil I said it in another post but I read an article about how DK feels like the culmination of Mario Odysseys fluidity and collectathon joy mixed with Breath of the WildTears of the Kingdoms ability to give you a goal hand you the tools and let you figure out the best way to do itit really does feel like that to me,n4q3oiy,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q6urj,IamEclipse,,3,2025-07-23 15:19:31,,,,DK feels like the culmination of Mario Odysseys fluidity and collectathon joy mixed with Breath of the WildTears of the Kingdoms ability to give you a goal hand you the tools and let you figure out the best way to do itit really does feel like that to me Now that helps sell it a bit Are the collectibles more like Odyssey where theyre just everywhere or is each stage a bit more structured with a main goal Im pretty sure that Id get into it should I buy it but at the same time 65 is a big ol price on something Im not sure on especially with a massive backlog,n4q5mem,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4saxjj,Carvj94,,2,2025-07-23 21:10:43,,,,The collectables are everywhere just like Oddesy however its not a slog to try and 100 this time around cause you can find randomly generated treasure chests when digging which have treasure maps that mark collectables on your map So with a bit of digging everything ends up marked on your map However you dont need to find any of the collectables as far as I can tell The banana gems give you a skill point for every five you collect and the fossils can be turned in for apparel I believe you can just blitz the objectives if you want without collecting anything cause I havent been held back so far,n4q6urj,5.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4qa3sw,SG4LPilgrim,,0,2025-07-23 15:34:27,,,,Theyre EVERYWHERE And its not like Odyssey where you have to get a certain amount bananas only give you skill points so you can really customize how you want to play Between the gold for consumables NPC requests and Bananza meter treasure chests which give either gold or treasure maps bananas used to upgrade DK and chips used for banana shops and refueling Bananza meter and fossils for the clothing shops the economy is well balanced to always make you feel like whatever youre picking up is meaningful Any direction you go youll find something thats useful Also with price point I wont pretend that new games arent steep but I will pitch you on the enjoyment and replayability I dont know how long the game is because Ive been taking my time but Im at least 25 hours in and probably only at the halfway,n4q6urj,5.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4q7ua7,bassnasher,,3,2025-07-23 15:24:05,,,,I was honestly the same way I didnt understand how punching through the level could be fun and the platforming could hold up But there is something so satisfying with the level of destruction you can inflict on the area Its an absolute blast when you find a vein of gold and go wild collecting it all it just tickles something in my brain Scattered around the level are bonus stages you enter that have dramatically toned down destructible elements and focus way more on proper platforming too If you enjoyed Mario odyssey you would enjoy this too Id reckon,n4q3oiy,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4s1zmx,3163560,,3,2025-07-23 20:28:45,,,,I was planning to be on the fence about bananza I enjoyed odyssey but found the lack of difficulty for 99 of the game a little disappointing I was planning to wait for reviews on bananza The day bananza came out I caved and bought it anyway Finished the main story last night While the lack of difficulty is certainly back but it really didnt matter one iota Because the game play loop was satisfying as fuck and the level design was absolutely top notch There was a legitimate sense of wonder everytime you dropped down the whole to next level about what the theme would be,n4q7ua7,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4s1qpc,CattDawg2008,,3,2025-07-23 20:27:31,,,,Not sure why youre getting downvoted its a valid opinion to hold But the game is fucking fantastic The environments and interactions are amazing the core mechanic of smashing everything and bending the terrain to your will is consistently exciting the characters are surprisingly not annoying Not to mention the fact that the game looks and performs great It pays a decent amount of respect to the DK Country games as well which is something I appreciate as an oldie It is everything many of us wanted out of the Switch 2 It has the same vibe and energy as previous platformers ESPECIALLY Mario Odyssey but expands upon it and elevates it in the best ways possible,n4q3oiy,3.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4qasdi,Kindness_of_cats,,2,2025-07-23 15:37:36,,,,Its Odyssey 2 with some new mechanics and gimmicks plus improvements to the gameplay loop particularly what BananasMoon equivalents do for you that make collecting as many as possible feel more rewarding even if youre not 100ing the game Simple as If you liked that game youll likepossibly loveBananza,n4q3oiy,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4t5zm6,Flipp_Flopps,,1,2025-07-23 23:53:53,,,,I thought I wasnt gonna enjoy the game that much because Ive never enjoyed Donkey Kong and I already played Odyssey but the freedom of movement you have in the world is legitimately undescribable compared to other open worlds Theres still surprisingly in depth puzzles and fights too What really made this an 1110 game for me was the later levels and the ending oh my god the ending was amazing It just kept getting better and better Im in the post game now and theres so much to do Theres just so much content and it feels so thought out and unique instead of being filler like Super Mario Odyssey and its moons Its really just an experience you have to feel for yourself If you like action adventure games like God of War and Odyssey then youre going to be addicted to DKBananza,n4q3oiy,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4t3hr3,FireLucid,,3,2025-07-23 23:40:09,,,,Yeah that comment was a bit of a dick but Ive seen so many people spreading the brink myth I initially though you were too Apologies I have no issue with them cutting access to online for people that mod the console I dont want hackers in my online games 1 person ruining the fun of 24 in Mario Kart for example And its not like its secret If you are going down that method you know what will happen If you have the knowledge to mod a console you are aware of what is going to happen,n4t2ab4,8.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4t4i86,Zeromatt111,,1,2025-07-23 23:45:42,,,,I agree with your point but ban them from the game or Nintendo online I dont want to buy a console where they can remove my online capabilities because they want to I said below I dont trust Nintendo to do thorough investigations in this and I dont trust them to not take it further in the future I think in general taking away internet access as a whole is terrible Take away online gaming but let them download games and play custom games if they want For years the consequence for modding was being banned in the game now its an entire console ban It will go further in the future,n4t3hr3,9.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4t7bc7,FireLucid,,2,2025-07-24 00:01:27,,,,I dont trust Nintendo to do thorough investigations in this Some dude bought a banned console 2nd hand and got it unbanned so they sound reasonable about it He had a receipt showing purchase after the date it was banned I personally dont have an issue with it every outrage over a ban Ive ever seen has been legit Google autistic kid xbox live ban and see how many articles it generated,n4t4i86,10.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4t99qf,Zeromatt111,,1,2025-07-24 00:12:43,,,,While that does give me a bit of relief it still doesnt say anything about wrongful bans which while I can admit are rare they wouldnt really have a way to make right unless Nintendo realizes they were wrong I understand Im realistically shouting into the void as Nintendo doesnt care and isnt reading any of this but it just sucks that the industry is moving so heavily towards you buy something but we can always say actually you didnt Im quickly being priced out of my favorite hobby and even then the things I buy can be taken away at a moments notice Edit I realize you actually did address my first point I meant it as in any wrongful bans being worse than a thousand valid bans They may be mostly valid but they arent all valid,n4t7bc7,11.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4xby71,Ovidhalia,,1,2025-07-24 16:25:20,,,,This recommendation should come with a warning that a lot of Switch 1 games do not scale well on the Switch 2 Its up to the publishers to update these games so some might never properly be updated for Switch 2 When I was younger I used to sell my old consoles to buy a new one Stopped doing that years ago and I honestly would recommend to anyone who has a Switch 1 to keep it and save up for a Switch 2 Especially if they had a large game library for the Switch,n4tsdew,2.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4t3vxo,SquidSystem,,2,2025-07-23 23:42:17,,,,They dont have an audience like that but what they do have historically is a more consistent growth trajectory Xbox and PlayStations fanbases are far less dedicated but they have managed to consistently sell consoles throughout their consoles lifespans The Switch is honestly a fairly unique success for them almost never struggling to ship consistently high console sales unlike the Wii U Wii and GameCube before it Im not trying to hate on the new console Im just trying to suggest a bit of caution in reading record launch sales when launch sales are only a part of the battle for success,n4spn60,2.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4uo3pd,SquidSystem,,2,2025-07-24 05:47:49,,,,Its hard to imagine a world where Nintendo isnt fine no matter what happens but I do worry about a few things in their immediate future with the Switch 2 I think its easy to hear stories about the console outselling other things and hear positive things about the 2 first party games weve seen but theres a lot of points of concern that can kinda get drowned out by the hype cycle,n4uitor,4.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4upu2e,wearablesweater,,2,2025-07-24 06:02:39,,,,Yea thats fair theyre incredibly solvent What are things in their immediate future that have you worried My main concern is they will sit on their chat feature and make little too no improvements its nice to have but nothing on discord or PS chat Their response to western market expectations almost seams defiant in some ways so I have little faith it will improve Ive enjoyed my Switch 2 so far but I think handheld gaming and ARM finally maturing to the point it has means Nintendo are gonna be under a different sort of pressure then theyre maybe use to Theres already way more competition in the last year,n4uo3pd,5.0,1m7asmz
comment,n4uvwhd,SquidSystem,,2,2025-07-24 06:56:35,,,,I feel like the game lineup and sale price are both big points of concern for me 450500 USD buyin is a lot to ask but not completely unreasonable but its a lot harder to sell nonnintendo fans on the console with a more premium pricetag Their quality first party titles are kind of sparse for launching a new console It launched with the next 2 years having 5 major releases that are exclusive to the new console and many of those releases are somewhat limited in their appeal They all seem like great titles but I dont think they have any of the woah I should buy a switch so I can play this In the same way BoTW MK8D Odyssey Ultimate ACNH and others did The NS2 roster kind of appeals to the Nintendo fanbase but I dont think it appeals to the average consumer especially again because the buyin price has been increased by 15x Can you really convince someone who just wants to play Metroid Prime 4 to pay that price for it when the Switch 1 version will probably be fine Can you convince a person who bought a Switch 1 to play Mario Kart with their friends maybe once a month to shell that money out to play World I just think theyre not setting themselves up for success here even if the console and games are good,n4upu2e,6.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4ukxnv,SquidSystem,,1,2025-07-24 05:21:09,,,,Yeah Im mostly making these points because I think the switch 1 was such a generational hit that people to an extent including Nintendo might have forgotten that failure is 100 an option I also wanted to mention the Wii definitely sold well but a lot of its success was frontloaded It failed to maintain strong sales data throughout its life like the Switch did,n4t6gt9,4.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4tk8id,B19F00T,,1,2025-07-24 01:16:21,,,,when you buy a game digitally you do not own it you own a license to play it within the terms of the eula that has always been the case if ur paying 80 for a physical copy you have no problem playing that copy because youre hopefully buying it new so it will be tied to your account and you can play it used can be a separate issue if the previous owner violated the ToS and the game key cards are also a license to play the game so as long as you have that game downloaded it works just like a cart with the game on it and you have the option of selling it when youre done which digital games dont have so they did put a little thought into it its not perfect we dont know if there will be issues with it down the line when they stop supporting these games safe to bet there will be sure but thats a thing with every console and obsolete games,n4tcnrf,3.0,1m7asmz

comment,n4rbc0n,dig-up-stupid,,0,2025-07-23 18:23:54,,,,No if you buy a key card basically all of it is stored on the system Thats the whole point the publisher is saving money by not paying for the cartridge Cartridges arent super expensive but theyre still dollars not pennies like blank discs are Im sure youre right about the owning part I havent looked into it since if Im not getting an actual physical copy Id just buy a full digital copy personally,n4pz6gn,2.0,1m7asmz
