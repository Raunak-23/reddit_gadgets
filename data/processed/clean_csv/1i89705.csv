comment,m8uq3ie,garry4321,,7,2025-01-24 03:53:23,,,,This headline doesnt make any sense in the way its written Choosing desserts Cake is a good choice because even ice cream would be a good choice,,0.0,1i89705
comment,m8uu52k,Leafan101,,15,2025-01-24 04:18:25,,,,You are misunderstanding I think Ryzen is a CPU whereas the 5090 is a GPU It is saying that even running 5090 at 1080p which is going to weigh down the CPU heavily the Ryzen still isnt the bottleneck which is pretty insane,m8uq3ie,1.0,1i89705
comment,m8uwoj7,garry4321,,-8,2025-01-24 04:34:48,,,,Why would running a high power GPU at 1080 fuck the CPU,m8uu52k,2.0,1i89705
comment,m8uzoj1,Leafan101,,12,2025-01-24 04:54:50,,,,Because FPS is limited by the slowest part of the process When you drop a high powered GPU down to 1080p it can blaze through frames However in order to allow the GPU to get as many frames as it can the CPU has to process its work fast enough to keep up It isnt always the case that the fastest gaming CPU can keep up with the fastest gaming GPU at low resolution and usually it ends up being the CPU that slows things down But apparently not with this generation,m8uwoj7,3.0,1i89705
comment,m8uzxpz,garry4321,,-6,2025-01-24 04:56:37,,,,Interesting Dont know why you would even be concerned about frames past the 120fp mark but I guess I never thought about it that way,m8uzoj1,4.0,1i89705
comment,m8vwgm6,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,4,2025-01-24 09:49:55,,,,Higher FPS Lower latency Its one of the reasons why people that play ultra competitive games like CS2 very seriously and at pro level play at 500 FPS and on insanely fast 360Hz monitors It doesnt matter for 99 of people and its not really a realistic scenario but its a well known test for CPUs,m8uzxpz,5.0,1i89705
comment,m8v0n6j,Leafan101,,1,2025-01-24 05:01:32,,,,Well d√©finite benefit in some scenarios to going higher than that as professional esports have been shown to benefit from refresh rates and FPS much higher than that even But in this case it is probably just to show off how powerful the CPU is,m8uzxpz,5.0,1i89705

comment,m8ulyqt,uncubeus,,16,2025-01-24 03:29:09,,,,Its just for comparison purpose On higher resolutions the gpu is the bottleneck,m8svqmf,1.0,1i89705
comment,m8wp847,BenjiSBRK,,2,2025-01-24 13:40:41,,,,Its not the point of the remark Most CPUs would be the bottleneck at a lower resolution but with a 9800x3d even the most powerful GPU there is will be the bottleneck which means the CPU will not hold you back at 4k either and youre sure to take advantage of the full potential of the 5090,m8svqmf,1.0,1i89705
comment,m8wqx2z,dinin70,,1,2025-01-24 13:50:34,,,,Were speaking about the CPU not bottlenecking the most powerful GPU,m8svqmf,1.0,1i89705
comment,m8ull66,UnsorryCanadian,,1,2025-01-24 03:26:54,,,,True Ive got old displays but if I could afford a 5090 I could afford at least one 1440p screen,m8svqmf,1.0,1i89705
comment,m8uovt1,KingKapwn,,3,2025-01-24 03:46:11,,,,If someone is buying a 5090 and they dont own a 4K display they really should not be buying a 5090 Its a mantle piece a prize horse not meant to be something you get unless youre at the most extreme edge of consumer technologies and you have the wallet to pay for every bell and whistle,m8ull66,2.0,1i89705

comment,m8vx7i5,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,1,2025-01-24 09:57:31,,,,Especially considering how the tech making huge leaps is locked to generations A 5090 may last years of 4K gaming but maybe not because in one or two generations it wont be able to use the latest DLSS RT boost or whatever Nvidia comes up with next and which games will rely on Gone are the days of buying the halo card and holding onto it for 45 years Youre much better off buying an XX70 every year or XX80 every two for the same money a XX90 would cost for that timeframe,m8uovt1,3.0,1i89705

comment,m8unqa8,ShiftyThePirate,,1,2025-01-24 03:39:23,,,,5090 imo would be a waste at 1440p Def a 4k card having a 4080S I very much wish Id gotten a 90s variant but then Id also need a new PSU and blah blah,m8ull66,2.0,1i89705
