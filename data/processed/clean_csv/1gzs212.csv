comment,lz201gm,Aleashed,,5,2024-11-26 10:33:37,,,,Mostly disappointed in magnetic charging and data USB cables This is going to be a cable not a port built into devices like Magsafe They are slow and burn up Took a while to get some half decent ones that only do charging for controllers and I keep spare heads on the cables to keep them working The 2010 magsafe was a good implementation though you are less likely to throw your mbp into your lint pocket It worked because it was recessed and small so its hard for stuff to fall in the port The cable also had the contacts on the inside protected from damage I hate the Surface Pro 4ish version with a fin that slides in It comes out too easily and its so big you need to fold the cable just right so it fits and stays in Charges so slow that I cant plug it in and turn on the PC without it turning off It cant charge the battery from empty and power the surface at the same time got to let it charge to 10 in it so when it boosts it doesnt shut off,lz1ybam,5.0,1gzs212
comment,lz26z5n,throwthegarbageaway,,3,2024-11-26 11:43:02,,,,Oh Yeah those suck lol The older surface cables were just terrible and the magnetic USB adapter cables are downright scary The pins are so small and so exposed that you could short that and burn your peripherals in an instant The ones with just charging tend to be safer but even then heat is a real concern like you said,lz201gm,6.0,1gzs212

comment,lz3kjlr,kurotech,,1,2024-11-26 16:49:33,,,,If they wanted to make as more efficient and better solution magnetic io ports would be the better bet with a physical plug you have to insert held in place by magnets again still not really an actual improvement but that would be the better solution than this although it involves redesigning Ethernet ports so wont happen anytime soon lol,lz3amm3,3.0,1gzs212
comment,lyyxzna,angrydeuce,,50,2024-11-25 21:20:41,,,,Except for the 2k 48 port switch Ive got just sat temporarily upon the flaking out 48 port switch in the rack while I programmed it You know the one that I tripped over the cable i had run to my laptop which then yanked the switch onto the floor from 5 feet up and smashed the shit out of it Mag safe would have been nice in that case but thats admittedly fringe lol Ive never done that since never did that before then either but also have never done it since so theres that lol,lyyhpy6,1.0,1gzs212

comment,lyzxzvm,angrydeuce,,2,2024-11-26 00:41:44,,,,I just didnt want to unrack the old one until the new one was completely setup I didnt have a running config because we couldnt even get into it via putty to pull one and of course nobody had a backup saved anywhere because why would we do that Anyways I had to program it up from scratch no biggie there then the plan was to just move the patches across in situ unscrew the old one and then gently slide it out so the switch on top of it could get racked where the old one was Me tripping over that stupid Cat6 cable turned a 30 minute affair into a 3 hour affair as I had to scramble to run back to the office and grab another new one and start all over Thank GOD we had another one of the same type waiting which is not always a given lol,lyzp26h,3.0,1gzs212

comment,lyziizx,akgis,,4,2024-11-25 23:10:32,,,,man alot of things are just convenience Why are you so anti about this lol This is not a new standard for Ethernet connections its something for ppl were they work still mandate Ethernet connection its nice the safety of the laptop and the person and convenience,lyzffay,3.0,1gzs212
comment,lyzklu6,OperatorJo_,,6,2024-11-25 23:22:36,,,,Because its ewaste in the end This is a convenience for ONE piece of equipment And not a great one for the masses As well as you WANT a stable internet connection This isnt even good for handhelds either because of arm movement it can be an easy disconnect This isnt even great as specialized equipment because its just an internet connection point while pushing updates and such is still easily possible via usb Like what is this good for apart from I took 3 seconds less to plug in an ethernet This is Temu levels of unnecessary gimmick tech,lyziizx,4.0,1gzs212
comment,lz22bi9,GlowiesStoleMyRide,,-1,2024-11-26 10:57:30,,,,I wouldnt call this ewaste out of hand Its very niche but it certainly fits a purpose I think there are plenty of cases where someone might need to plug eg a laptop into some hardware to perform maintenance There you likely dont have a desk or something and theres a very real risk of the cable or laptop being pulled due to clumsiness The cost of fixing damaged to the laptop or equipment will probably far outweigh a magsafe network cable,lyzklu6,5.0,1gzs212
comment,lz3ujd3,notfork,,2,2024-11-26 17:40:24,,,,Except the fact that you know that feature is literally built into Ethernet cords already just break the clip point This does the same thing But now instead of paying 00002 cents per termination cap you get to pay 23 dollars per termination cap And really the one valid use case I see with these is laptops in a server hot swap environment but good luck finding new laptops with an Ethernet port at all much less a new mag safe Ethernet port,lz22bi9,6.0,1gzs212
comment,lz404la,GlowiesStoleMyRide,,-1,2024-11-26 18:08:18,,,,But without the clip the connection is loose so this is not a good solution This is not the case for a magsafe disconnect You only need one such cable in this scenario so I dont think the price aspect really comes into play here I wouldnt want to wire an entire datacenter with magsafe cables that would be terrible,lz3ujd3,7.0,1gzs212
comment,lz71olj,ZZ9ZA,,0,2024-11-27 04:41:36,,,,It really isnt If your MagSafe power cord comes undone you still have battery If youre Ethernet cable disconnects shit just stops working immediately,lz404la,8.0,1gzs212

comment,lz0cyie,TemporaryCompote2100,,2,2024-11-26 02:10:03,,,,All of these same arguments can be legalistically applied to many forms of technologies which are developed either for very particular use cases or that arent an absolute necessity but rather an alternative andor potential improvement People seem to forget how much subjectivity there truly is in design and engineering These cables would be super useful in multiple instances for me as a sys admindevops engineer but they wouldnt be replacements for the main plumbing of any of our network They arent necessarily intended to be replacements for the main plumbing of any of our servers racks or switches primarily They are simply an alternate options which in some uses cases would be beneficial and worth the additional cost ALL of that being said magnetic end caps on all of our Ethernet being standardized potentially changes the game when it comes to rewiring server racks if they ever were put to use in that particular application Those appliances sit in data centers literally locked away they cannot legally be touched outside of certain exceptions Typically most businesses dont need to rewire with any frequency so long as things are networked properly to begin with unless in the case of major changes which absolutely can and does occur,lyzffay,3.0,1gzs212
comment,lyyhuz3,NotAnotherNekopan,,132,2024-11-25 19:58:07,,,,Was this a problem people were frequently having I can see _maybe_ disconnecting a laptop frequently but at that point get a docking station Anything else and usually its plugged in and stays plugged in,,0.0,1gzs212
comment,lyyjy1l,judokalinker,,25,2024-11-25 20:09:00,,,,Yeah my thought was magsafe was to prevent laptops getting pulled to the floor when people tripped over the power cable Are people plugging laptops into Ethernet directly still,lyyhuz3,1.0,1gzs212
comment,lyynt8p,babybambam,,25,2024-11-25 20:28:52,,,,Are people plugging laptops into Ethernet directly still My entire office plugs directly into the network instead of using WIFI We have WIFI but LAN performance is much better for our use case and were also in a very congested area so it can be difficult to get a channel that isnt overloaded with noise The block I live on is double the people that live in the town I grew up in,lyyjy1l,2.0,1gzs212

comment,lyyp8df,babybambam,,2,2024-11-25 20:36:10,,,,directly into the laptops They dont actually move so there was no need to bother with a docking station We prefer laptops over desktops because for the price it includes the features we need Touchscreen backlit keyboard backup battery power all in one unit,lyyof1s,4.0,1gzs212

comment,lyyxup5,babybambam,,2,2024-11-25 21:19:59,,,,UhhhIm not sure how you figure These are 1k machines Just for the features Ive listed were looking at north of 450 in stand alone equipment Buying it as a laptop means everything is upgraded each time is guaranteed to work well together and is much easier to swap if there are issues,lyysuyi,6.0,1gzs212
comment,lyz7gos,Mooseymax,,0,2024-11-25 22:09:22,,,,Because unless youre getting something like Framework and their modular laptop system a purpose built PC will always run cheaper and are upgradable A standard APU isnt going to cost more than 100200 All of the other components you list are one time purchases Nobody is upgrading their office keyboards every 5 year PC cycle,lyyxup5,7.0,1gzs212

comment,lyzuaqb,Mooseymax,,1,2024-11-26 00:19:59,,,,A pre built equivalent desktop addons will cost less over time and are more upgradable even if youre not hand building them from scratch is the point Im trying to make,lyztl8d,9.0,1gzs212
comment,lyzx550,brickmaster32000,,2,2024-11-26 00:36:42,,,,They arent upgraded in a corporate environment either The time it would take techs to gather and tear down every computer to rebuild them for an upgrade means companies are just going to swap the whole unit at once,lyzuaqb,10.0,1gzs212
comment,lz03iui,bkral93,,3,2024-11-26 01:14:35,,,,I cant but laugh at this exchange Im sorry Its like some pcmasterrace kid is trying to argue with a Government entity on IT asset policy Its way easier for me IT Security Manager to get a ticket from a user that something is wrong with a laptop warranty claim it send the entire thing back and get a new one than troubleshoot to component and then file warranty with a CPU or RAM manu A tech refresh isnt really something that people deal with on a mass scale so the logistics of doing laptops vs component based desktops isnt something most people even computer nerds will ever deal with,lyzx550,11.0,1gzs212
comment,lz040xb,bkral93,,4,2024-11-26 01:17:34,,,,Cheap and upgradable isnt something 99 of businesses care about Im sorry its the absolute truth They do 25 year complete refreshes Everything is fully replaced and they call it a day,lyz7gos,8.0,1gzs212
comment,lz0n3by,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,0,2024-11-26 03:11:42,,,,Thatd still be cheaper as desktops Also most of them wouldnt toss perfectly good monitors unless an upgrade was coming Same with UPSs,lz040xb,9.0,1gzs212
comment,lz0nzx6,bkral93,,2,2024-11-26 03:17:25,,,,Monitors and UPSs are peripherals not generally impacted by a tech refresh Also desktops prevent users from quickly relocating or working remotely In a perfect world cloud or local network storage would prevent the need but sometimes you need to be able to move a workstation to present material or work from another area and a lot of instances dont allow for the network is bad as an excuse Again Im not saying that youre wrong Is it cheaper Sure But companies are not squeezing pennies when it comes to IT assets Not any company thats scaled to the point where it would be a sizable savings at least Source I work IT on very large networks,lz0n3by,10.0,1gzs212
comment,lz0ovo9,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2024-11-26 03:23:06,,,,They said they liked laptops because it was a complete hardware refresh Also they said their laptops never moved Also if youve used the miniature desktop PCs businesses like to deploy its about as much work to move one of those as it is to move a docking station,lz0nzx6,11.0,1gzs212

comment,lz0nvk6,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2024-11-26 03:16:39,,,,Youre talking to people who clearly have no idea what computer hardware costs especially in the business world Desktops are cheaper Its why companies like Dell and Lenovo make those little compact desktop PCs Its their exact use case except you dont end up replacing your monitor and keyboard each time and you dont have to pay extra for the extra miniaturization and custom hardware that laptops use You benefit from not replacing a bunch of stuff you dont need to replace as well as getting the benefit of better economy of scale While its true that companies are generally going to toss the whole desktop rather than upgrade the CPU it still saves a ton of money to use the mini desktop PCs rather than laptops,lyz7gos,8.0,1gzs212

comment,lyyu3y9,TylerInHiFi,,3,2024-11-25 21:00:50,,,,If the cable can handle all of them together why not Its still just pins Make the correct pins active in the appropriate ports Plug a USBC cable into a network port on one end and the power on the other Doesnt work but wont fry anything And I mean Ive already got my monitor powering my MacBook through the same port it uses for video signal so its not like multiuse ports in the USBC format are impossible And PoE is a thing If its all one port and one cable capable of doing everything whats the problem,lyylfjf,2.0,1gzs212
comment,lyyyrfx,SickestGuy,,0,2024-11-25 21:24:37,,,,There isnt a problem other than people are stupid Do you know many people would even know that a monitor could power their macbook Or a computer could charge an iphone What happens when a person plugs in a power cable usbc into a network port usbc that isnt meant to get power In your perfect simplistic world every single piece of electric would have to have a handshake with the device its pairing with in order to know its the correct device or how to manage that device Do you know how much that would cost to implement across all devices All companies would need to have a work together to make this happen Then I cant imagine how long it would take to move to USBD when USBC becomes obsolete Basically you either dont work in the IT world have no clue how it works or have very little interaction with people in general to think this is going to happen even in the next 30 years The fact you own a macbook speaks volumes about your level of ignorance towards to rest of the population Mac users are always living in a massive bubble,lyyu3y9,3.0,1gzs212
comment,lyz1oeu,TylerInHiFi,,1,2024-11-25 21:39:31,,,,Given that I a work in the tech world b understand very well how it all works c work with the general public who struggle with basics like clicking on the forgot password link and trying to stuff an HDMI connector into a USB port and d own Apple products specifically because the lack of default intuitive interoperability of nonApple devices 20 years ago pushed me into this market segment for personal use youre dead wrong on all counts Its also telling that you accuse me of being ignorant because I use a MacBook but also claim that my knowledge level is head and shoulders above others because most people wouldnt know that a monitor could power their computer I want the rest of the tech space to catch up to Apple on interoperability even though Apple is far from perfect on this Theres no reason that companies cant build a handshake into every USBC connected product Because companies are already doing it for products that work seamlessly with macOS Fuck my monitors are Dell and they have no problem passing power video and USB hub functionality through a single cable both with my MacBook and with windows laptops that support that functionality The problem is that a lot of them dont support it yet for no real reason whatsoever We already have USB over Ethernet We already have PoE We already have USB as the endpoint connector for networking via USBRJ45 adapters Yes everyones a complete dumbass except us But weve dragged enough of them along to this point theres no reason we cant continue and force things to be better at their short term expense,lyyyrfx,4.0,1gzs212
