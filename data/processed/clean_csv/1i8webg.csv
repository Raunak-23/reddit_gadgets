comment,m8x0j7h,ASaltySeacaptain,,240,2025-01-24 14:43:29,,,,I already bought a silicone one from a different company US needs to operate more like the EU where the company must prove that their products are safe instead of it being on the consumer to prove that theyre unsafe,,0.0,1i8webg
comment,m8x60p4,francescomagn02,,82,2025-01-24 15:11:12,,,,The timing for that is probably not the best right now lol i guess the silver lining is europeans will keep having the us population as indirect guinea pigs And i am aware of how dystopic that sounds,m8x0j7h,1.0,1i8webg
comment,m8xged1,Omegalazarus,,30,2025-01-24 16:00:33,,,,Yeah we operate as their guinea pigs and they operate as our regulators since their market is large enough to cause global change in some products,m8x60p4,2.0,1i8webg

comment,m92afz6,Luolong,,-7,2025-01-25 08:43:59,,,,To be fair as a form factor I did like the lightning port better than usbc but I do appreciate having less connector types to worry about and carry around,m923qw9,4.0,1i8webg
comment,m96win1,EnderManion,,5,2025-01-26 01:18:22,,,,What specifically did you like better about it From my perspective there dont seem to be any upsides to the technology at all,m92afz6,5.0,1i8webg
comment,m989d99,Luolong,,0,2025-01-26 06:47:33,,,,As I said I like its form factor The physical connector itself is simpler and more compact and easier to use and connect For some reason whenever I bring this up everyone seems to misunderstand that I prefer lightning port protocol connectivity and speed over usb but that is not what Im saying,m96win1,6.0,1i8webg
comment,m9qs68b,alecdvnpt,,2,2025-01-29 01:13:22,,,,I feel like its also sturdier built to have phones and iPods rest their entire weight on them in those docks and doesnt have the flimsy middle bit in the female connector to potentially break like in USB C,m989d99,7.0,1i8webg
comment,m9vriwu,Luolong,,1,2025-01-29 20:06:33,,,,Its an unpopular opinion though,m9qs68b,8.0,1i8webg
comment,m8zw88l,ObviouslyTriggered,,21,2025-01-24 22:54:03,,,,That isnt how the EU regulators operate PFAS isnt banned in the EU and even the current and proposed partial restrictions would not have applied to these types of products Like everyone we have a large list of GRAS materials and there is 0 regulatory requirements to perform any 3rd party compliance testing over here in Europe for these,m8x0j7h,1.0,1i8webg

comment,m8xnxzx,Bennehftw,,35,2025-01-24 16:35:18,,,,If youre active at all anything that really isnt silicone will quickly get dirty Even if youre not active constant contact and shedding will lead to caked on dead skin and oil build up imbedded into the band,m8x5t79,1.0,1i8webg
comment,m8yphok,Derek420HighBisCis,,48,2025-01-24 19:28:51,,,,Washing things is a real thing Ive had my current canvas wristband on my watch it has seen 3 desert deployments to Iraq and 2 to Afghanistan for a cumulative 54 months in austere conditions It was new in 2001 Its still just as good as it ever was It gets scrubbed once a month,m8xnxzx,2.0,1i8webg
comment,m8yw72h,writeanythingwr,,10,2025-01-24 20:00:34,,,,Just depends My job we start the day by scrubbing dirty restrooms I dont like the idea of shit being deep in the fabric and having to clean it every day I like that the silicone can just get cleaned down fast without needing to dry Just got over a rash from the dirty shit we do on any given day and Im the one who is the most cautious when it comes to PPE,m8yphok,3.0,1i8webg
comment,m96d1se,other_usernames_gone,,5,2025-01-25 23:29:19,,,,You can take your watch off when you know youre about to get your hands dirty Especially when you know youre about to clean a bathroom Wearing a watch makes it harder to clean your hands properly Its why nurses and doctors dont wear watches when working,m8yw72h,4.0,1i8webg
comment,m8yzmom,Derek420HighBisCis,,6,2025-01-24 20:17:02,,,,Obviously there are exceptions I fell into a small pool of human waste while on foot patrol in Iraq The watch was sanitized completely before going back on the wrist,m8yw72h,4.0,1i8webg

comment,m8ys3nm,Bennehftw,,-2,2025-01-24 19:41:07,,,,Its possible to be clean Id argue once a month is a cesspool of bacteria and mold in clean conditions More like once a week minimum In desert conditions with sand existing quite a bit youre asking for abrasions on top of bacteria which is a bad time to anyone who isnt a healthy individual Youre basically saying for 20 days of a month mold is okay Just because you cant see the dirt doesnt mean it isnt there Silicone I clean whenever I feel like it or if its obviously dirty The contact point of the watch needs more consistent cleaning Sand will be a problem no matter what the material is if it gets in the band,m8yphok,3.0,1i8webg
