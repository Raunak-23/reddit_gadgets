comment,n4jqz4x,ChrisFromIT,,-3,2025-07-22 16:11:25,,,,Even if it doesnt target 5080 prices that is not good news It means that Nvidia could offer the 6080 for the same price and performance as AMDs new flagship if you wanted Or offer a 6070ti at the same price and performance and then a 6080 with maybe a 10 or 20 performance boost over the 6070ti and AMD flagship And that is bad news EDIT wow people downvoting me because Im pointing out how AMD deciding not to compete at the top end for the next generation is bad for us gamers all around,n4idrlt,1.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4v705c,Naxirian,,1,2025-07-24 08:41:17,,,,The reality is the need to actually buy top end isnt really there anymore If youre playing eSports titles you can hit your monitor refresh rate on a midrange GPU these days and even at 4k my 9070 XT easily holds 60 FPS in pretty much any game with FSR enabled often 100 Sure you can get more with a 4090 or 5090 but thats just because you can It isnt necessary GPUs and upscaling tech has advanced to the point that even GPUs considered mid range are fine for 4k let alone 1440p and the vast majority of gamers are still on 1080p I built a brand new setup this summer to replace my old one and I had been planning to use the 9070 XT for 18 months or so and then replace it with AMDs next flagship but so far its handled everything Ive thrown at it in 4k just fine so Im not even sure I will bother next gen,n4jqz4x,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4xenvy,ChrisFromIT,,1,2025-07-24 16:37:52,,,,Sure you dont need to buy at the high end The issue is that competition at the high end drives larger performance gains overall and sets up performance large gains for the generation afterward too,n4v705c,3.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4y64k9,Naxirian,,1,2025-07-24 18:42:40,,,,I think youll see less and less actual performance gains and more fake numbers The Nvidia 5000 series are a minor improvement hardware wise over the 4000s probably the smallest generational upgrade theyve ever done Its all in the software trickery at the moment Nvidia dont care as much about pushing GPU tech because their main business is no longer GPUs Its AI Only a minor portion of their income is now from gaming GPUs so they are far less motivated to push the boundaries,n4xenvy,4.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4yb2vs,ChrisFromIT,,1,2025-07-24 19:06:28,,,,The Nvidia 5000 series are a minor improvement hardware wise over the 4000s probably the smallest generational upgrade theyve ever done And that is because there was no competition at the high end Its all in the software trickery at the moment Nvidia dont care as much about pushing GPU tech because their main business is no longer GPUs They are still pushing GPU tech It is just they are only doing so in software and again it is as I said because there is no competition at the high end Competition at the high end drives hardware innovation Competition at the low end only helps drive innovation on the software side of things,n4y64k9,5.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4zh72a,Naxirian,,1,2025-07-24 22:30:23,,,,They care for sure but theyre not pouring as much effort or money into it as they were Their CEO straight up said they are no longer a graphics company I have no doubt AMD will come out with something higher end next gen but for AMDs graphics division the money is not in the high end Companies do not give a singular fuck about pushing the boundaries they care about profit If theres no profit to AMD pushing the high end which there almost certainly isnt then why would they bother Their money is in the midrange and supplying the hardware for PlayStations RIP Xbox,n4yb2vs,6.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4zkftx,ChrisFromIT,,1,2025-07-24 22:48:18,,,,AMDs graphics division the real money is in the midrange battle Not even Most of their money in graphics has come from consoles It is about 23 to 45 of their gaming segment I have no doubt AMD will come out with something higher end next gen This whole thread is how AMDs nextgen flagship is targeting 5080 levels of performance Their CEO straight up said they are no longer a graphics company Yet graphics just for consumers is still about 18 billion in revenue for them yearly Not to mention some of the data center segments are for graphics base processing Also keep in mind that Nvidias CEO said they were no longer a graphics company way back in an email in 2012 So it really means nothing,n4zh72a,7.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4nf75a,ChrisFromIT,,7,2025-07-23 03:28:10,,,,No it is the lack of competition that is bad Literally we have AMDs next gen flagship targeting the performance of Nvidias current gen 2nd best GPU That means there is a lack of competition at the top end for the next generation That is not good Case in point look at the top end of GPUs for this current generation That is because AMD decided to skip being competitive at the top end of this generation,n4neo89,3.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4or5hr,P_ZERO_,,3,2025-07-23 10:19:42,,,,There isnt really any competition AMD consistently comes in late with pricing that doesnt inspire Heres how it usually goes nvidia set new performance standard and price point half way through the generation AMD release slightly lesser product for marginal price cut nvidia release a refreshprice point gap filler that directly competes with AMDs product This basically creates a loop where people wait for AMD to release something knowing full well that nvidia has a product waiting to fill a void True competition would be getting a like for like product that offers substantial financial incentive to buy The last 10 years have simply been quarrels over marginal differences in 6001200 cards,n4neo89,3.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4i5yte,PineappleLemur,,110,2025-07-22 11:03:53,,,,Its all about value imo Im ok with a card being only 4080 if it costs as much as a 2060 Even if its years late I dont need the latest shit to enjoy 10801440p at high FPS,n4i3y6z,1.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4i8fv7,Lagviper,,85,2025-07-22 11:22:17,,,,But they are not agressive on value either and I can bet they wont be again in the future not against old card but even against the RTX 6000 series competing equivalent,n4i5yte,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4jy8vv,flamingtoastjpn,,-11,2025-07-22 16:45:16,,,,New gfx cards are ridiculously complex extremely expensive to design and test and the investors arent going to support these projects unless the gross margin is 4050 Thats just the reality of the industry right now Value for money is in old gfx cards or buying a new one with the intention of running it into the ground and not buying again for a decade I love my 2080ti,n4i8fv7,3.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4ifwx3,FdPros,,33,2025-07-22 12:12:48,,,,except amd pricing strategy will be to price it just slightly under the 5080 that it wont be very attractive honestly they should put the cpu marketing guys in charge,n4i5yte,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4j63v8,neoKushan,,10,2025-07-22 14:34:32,,,,they should put the cpu marketing guys in charge Problem with this is that AMD actually competes in the highend of the CPU market and Intel absolutely fumbled several generations in a row Nvidia for all their flaws and greed make the fastest GPUs out there and at least on some SKUs offer improvements every generation to keep that lead,n4ifwx3,3.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4ja1j3,FdPros,,13,2025-07-22 14:52:56,,,,intel fumbling didnt help but ryzen being competitive at a lower price helped them bring the much needed market share plus the longevity of the am4 socket and the fact that u didnt really need a new motherboard to upgrade is amazing amd gpus are decent but their pricing over nvidia is not that much cheaper to convince people to switch to amd prices have settled down now and in my country a 9070xt vs 5070ti pricing is about 100150 dollars apart that imho isnt enough to convince most people especially when nvidia still has better raytracing and upscaling tech,n4j63v8,4.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4k852j,FdPros,,7,2025-07-22 17:29:33,,,,okay the fact that you could do it is good why hate on more options and upgradability plus the difference between pcie 5 4 and 3 on a gpu is just a few percent and likely completely negated by the cpu upgrade,n4k0b9q,6.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4iz615,Noselessmonk,,18,2025-07-22 14:00:43,,,,Yeah AMD is working a worse version of the strat that worked for them back in like 2014 price at like 75 of Nvidia because your performance was 85 of the competition from Nvidia It made sense then AMD has continued to price their cards to the raster performance But we live in an era where Ray Tracing is becoming more and more common AMDs cards until the 9000 series at least were at least a full gen behind Nvidia for RT FSR3 and under dont hold a candle to DLSS in terms of image quality Overall for years now its felt like AMD sold cards at 90 the price of Nvidias competitor card while offering a total package product that was much much less And fwiw I rock a 6700xt,n4ifwx3,3.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4jzu4h,madmofo145,,6,2025-07-22 16:52:29,,,,Yeah Im still rocking a GTX 1080 as its been super rough trying to upgrade it reasonably The 3000 series made it clear the DLSS was a real game changer but pricing was crazy due to CovidCrypto If you mostly wanted a card for gaming and were okay with making use of DLSS upscaling ignoring frame gen then Nvidia still generally won on the FPS per dollar spent But pricing has been consistently a bit crazy and even with the 9000 series its unclear AMD is able to win on that performance per dollar metric,n4iz615,4.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4lczax,kanakalis,,1,2025-07-22 20:39:51,,,,theyre forever using the nvidia50 pricing strategy i thought the 9070xt would break the chain but no nobodys selling at that fake ass msrp also have a 6700XT,n4iz615,4.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4i88a8,nine7i,,6,2025-07-22 11:20:45,,,,But that wont happen But that time it releases the 5080 will be cheaper plus compared to a new release You might even be able to get a 4080 super instead of whatever that amd card would be,n4i5yte,2.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4pujxk,Hikashuri,,1,2025-07-23 14:21:56,,,,But thats not how AMD works If it competes with a 5080 they will price it 100 below the cheapest 5080,n4i5yte,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4k7vqd,Haelphadreous,,8,2025-07-22 17:28:23,,,,The rumors when AMD canceled their high end RDNA 4 chiplet designs was that they moved the resources over to UDNA development and were planning to pull it ahead as much as possible Current rumors are that UDNA might enter mass production as soon as Q2 2026 obviously take published rumors with a grain of salt they are not always accurate The latest Nvidia rumors I heard were that the 50xx series Super cards would be launching end of 2025 possibly December If both of those rumors do pan out to be true it seems likely that UDNA will be launching in roughly the mid point between the 50xx series Super cards and the 60xx series,n4i3y6z,1.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4i6h74,zarafff69,,-8,2025-07-22 11:07:42,,,,In terms of flagships Obviously I hope this AMD card will not be as expensive as an RTX 6090 But its still a very valuable comparison There are way more 50904090 cards sold than 50804080 cards 50904090 are somehow actually even a better value even though they are so much more expensive their performance is just in a league of its own and nothing really comes close,n4i5dez,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4i8fp0,nekolas564,,6,2025-07-22 11:22:15,,,,I mean obviously their performance are in a league of their own but is it as amazing as you make it sound We have performance comparison reviews that boils it down to a difference Likewise we can compare the price difference in percentage In the end you just decide whether you want to pay x more for x more performance And Im sorry but I dont believe the 90 series extra performance somehow is magically special coming from a 90 series owner As for things being better value it is all relative Nvidia made the price gap smaller on 80 vs 90 series and not in the consumer friendly way Not to mention some people dont have PC budget for 90 series or some plan ahead knowing they will upgrade earlier and therefore buys a lower tier model that still has great performance btw,n4i6h74,3.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4iaq5y,zarafff69,,2,2025-07-22 11:38:30,,,,I mean previously the difference between an RTX 3080 and 3090 was pretty small Some more VRAM but no ground breaking performance difference But if you look at the reviews the RTX 5090 and still the 4090 is in a league of its own The RTX 5080 sadly doesnt come close to an RTX 4090 And AMD is basically unable to match that performance for half a decade Thats pretty insane Now am I saying that everybody should go out and buy such an expensive GPU Absolutely not I also dont have one But its kind of depressing that its taking AMD this long to have a good competitor to that tier of GPU So long that not even the next generation will match the RTX 4090 This is not good for competition and this will make nvidia just continue pricing their best GPUs sky high,n4i8fp0,4.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4jepse,Sylanthra,,2,2025-07-22 15:14:32,,,,So it is going to compete with 5080 more than a year from now roughly in line with when Nvidia will release the 6070 Ti which will likely also compete with 5080 So AMD is planning to be in the exact same place relative to Nvidia with regards to performance that it is now The article makes it sound like it is moving up but that would only be sort of true if beats the future 6070ti to market by at least a few months,,0.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4k5e4h,Haelphadreous,,2,2025-07-22 17:17:17,,,,This article doesnt make sense First of all why is it conflating UDNA and RDNA AMD has already announced UDNA the U stands for Unified its meant to combinereplace RDNA and CDNA Secondly they are discussing a card with a 50 wider memory bus and 50 more CUs than the 9070 XT on an architecture that is rumoredexpected to see roughly a 20 IPC uplift for raster and a 100 IPC uplift in RT compared to RDNA 4 like its going to be trading blows with a 5080 or gasp maybe even a future 6080 The 5080 is about 15 faster than a 9070 XT in Raster and around 50 to 60 faster in RT Scaling is not 100 linear but assuming the IPC rumors about UDNA are accurate the hypothetical card configuration they are discussing would have roughly 80 more raw raster performance 200 more raw RT performance and assuming that its going to use GDDR7 at least 120 more memory bandwidth than a 9070 XT it seems to me that the real would performance would be significantly higher than a 5080 given those specs,,0.0,1m6aqgz

comment,n4ixcej,led76,,4,2025-07-22 13:51:35,,,,Crutch is a funny way to put it Its the correct way to compute lighting assuming that cards can handle it I think the issue is more that its expensive in terms of performance and price and consumer cards on the average arent yet powerful enough to support it,n4il5j1,2.0,1m6aqgz
comment,n4t1ka4,fraseyboo,,1,2025-07-23 23:29:26,,,,Baking lighting for raster graphics can take weeks for some games enabling raytracing is comparably far simpler for a developer where they dont need to worry about how each individual light or scenery change will affect the render There are plenty of crutches out there like DLSS which get conflated with raytracing but if a developer cant be bothered to add in a nonray traced option then theyre probably willing to cut corners in other areas too,n4ixcej,3.0,1m6aqgz
