comment,m9pxfjn,1980-whore,,5,2025-01-28 22:34:10,,,,Unfortunately 34 days now is if you are running a smart watch on max features and getting constant texts Mine if i have it just on basic features and texts gets 20 days,m9pgkbi,7.0,1ic004x

comment,m9rhzz3,LearningIsTheBest,,2,2025-01-29 03:36:08,,,,I currently have an Amazon Bip The battery life is even better than Pebble I get 10 or more days depending on use That being said not a fan of the Chinese ownership and the software has gotten worse I wish an open source project would arise Otherwise I just cant stand a watch that needs daily charging since its my alarm clock every morning,m9mszw2,4.0,1ic004x

comment,m9mgs9b,juntoalaluna,,217,2025-01-28 12:12:18,,,,Its poorly reported Its quite clear in his blog that he wants the company to be sustainable ie not target making billions not trying to compete with AppleGoogle etc rather than environmental sustainability,m9mg52x,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mhvdt,fendermrc,,118,2025-01-28 12:20:38,,,,I like this ethos I cant stand the constant cry to create shareholder value by innovating where a brilliant product is enough to support a company and its employees and its sources Innovate to remain competitive to improve but dont do it only for the sake of growth or market share I mean many of us benefit from stock market growth but I hate what it does to company culture,m9mgs9b,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mnr5n,joomla00,,54,2025-01-28 13:02:30,,,,Thats the cost of going public There are many founderowned type private companies that are just happy making steady profit every year If its important to you you should try to support these companies more,m9mhvdt,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9n62fx,ZgBlues,,10,2025-01-28 14:49:33,,,,Agreed 100 If every business idea had to devise a plan for global domination on day one then nobody would ever create anything Its the Shark Tank effect people think any idea that isnt scaleable to planetary proportions isnt worth investors time Fuck that If you have a product or service people like stick with it make your customers happy if you earn enough to cover your costs thats good enough in my book And I dont agree its because of shareholders its because of a certain type of shareholders After all blue chip stocks are the most valuable not because of growth potential but because of stability The stock market isnt a casino investing isnt gambling And frankly no healthy company would want gamblers to invest,m9mhvdt,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9o2wq4,NecroCannon,,1,2025-01-28 17:27:59,,,,And that makes me actually interested and want to buy his product if its good So many people want to start a business nowadays which is cool but they keep chasing the rich dreams and lifestyles A lot of successful major businesses and corporations started off as small local businesses that grew over time they invested their time and money wisely and things worked out Thats not the norm though or wed have tons of competition right now in the market At your core you should want to start a business to solve a problem you see needs to be fixed and that you can make enough money to be sustainable Its why I dont really care about the outcry for small businesses against pay raises thats a part of being sustainable you cant do that work by yourself and run a business,m9mhvdt,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mhi95,Antique_Dot,,31,2025-01-28 12:17:51,,,,I think the articles author misunderstood what the original announcement meant by sustainability or at least mangled the meaning in the headline The original announcement talked about building a more sustainable company unlike the original pebble which overcommitted to making a large number of watches it couldnt sell The idea is to have a smaller team which designs and markets the watches to be more tailored for a specific user base thus lowering operating costs and being able to make smaller runs of somewhat niche tech gadgets,m9mg52x,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9pwsem,CX-001,,2,2025-01-28 22:31:00,,,,Low volume typically means higher retail price tho Dive computers watch form factor for instance,m9mhi95,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9r4d4c,NeverLookBothWays,,1,2025-01-29 02:19:16,,,,If the right balance is hit on quality however thats not too bad of a thing The original Pebble watches hovered around 100150 When looking around for einkpaper replacements after Pebble closed shop there werent many out there Garmins got pretty close but were twice the price for a fraction of the features,m9pwsem,3.0,1ic004x

comment,m9mqz3s,eras,,40,2025-01-28 13:23:16,,,,The extent of the help seems to be releasing the Pebble source code under an open source license Apache so I think its fine They got it by acquiring Fitbit which had acquired the IPR of Pebble Event Fitbit bothered to keep the Pebble app in the store for some time Good people all around,m9mpt52,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9nt2s8,mark-haus,,2,2025-01-28 16:41:38,,,,Could also be googles secure open source embedded OS called tock Its made to be used with microcontrollers that have basic security features for the likes of their 2FA devices but having worked with it I could easily see a more rudimentary watch OS be used with it as well,m9mqz3s,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9ok1m5,Ajreil,,5,2025-01-28 18:45:54,,,,I just hope the Pebble developer has a backup plan if Google randomly cancels the collaboration someday Especially since Google purchased and then dismantled the original Pebble,m9nt2s8,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9pobme,xXgreeneyesXx,,2,2025-01-28 21:50:34,,,,Im not certain google can be credited for killing Pebble if I recall correctly Pebble was already killed by Fitbit prior to them being purchased by Google Anyways Im pretty sure you cant unopensource things,m9ok1m5,4.0,1ic004x

comment,m9p3p6n,quazmang,,5,2025-01-28 20:15:45,,,,I cant trust any project google touches What is the point if they might just shutter it or stop providing support for any arbitrary reason Or in the likely event that they steal some tech sell a lot of units of perfectly functioning hardware and then brick them bc of some lawsuit they get involved in,m9mpt52,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9pp0yz,Blastcheeze,,4,2025-01-28 21:53:48,,,,Thankfully the only involvement Google has in this is making the Pebbles OS open source,m9p3p6n,2.0,1ic004x

comment,m9mixz0,sixfourtykilo,,21,2025-01-28 12:28:42,,,,I know nothing about these watches Did they have any actual smartwatch functionalities and how was the battery life I love my Garmin and my wife has the 7x Pro Solar and that thing lasts as long as 30 days without charging,,0.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mkhom,Governmentwatchlist,,53,2025-01-28 12:39:56,,,,They were really the first smartwatch made with kickstarter support back when Apple not only didnt make them but openly flaunted that it wasnt a product people wanted,m9mixz0,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9q0sxi,JamesHeckfield,,2,2025-01-28 22:50:48,,,,I believe most people wouldnt have been interested in a Pebble It was really for nerds I know because I had a Pebble Steel Loved that thing for the time I had it then the Series 0 Watch came out and Ive never looked back,m9mkhom,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9ml2cf,raptir1,,37,2025-01-28 12:44:02,,,,Pebble really originated what we think of as smartwatches today They were out before the Apple Watch and the smartwatch Fitbits They worked well on either Android or iOS and had a pretty robust app store with a lot of community development The battery life was incredible for the time it came out in 2013 and had 7 day battery life I imagine an updated model would be similar to the Garmin LCD watches but I dont know if theyll go with solar for cost purposes The 7x Pro Solar is a 1000 watch in 2025 and the Pebble cost 100 back in 2013,m9mixz0,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mm9fe,TheW83,,15,2025-01-28 12:52:26,,,,Well the 7x Pro is absolutely insane in functionality and nobody needs that except for extreme athletes The instinct 3 solar basically fits any active persons needs at 450 Garmin has never really been a smartwatch maker and focuses specifically on fitness Some of their latest ones do include basic smartwatch functionality like receiving notifications and calls,m9ml2cf,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mo2bx,raptir1,,5,2025-01-28 13:04:35,,,,For sure I love my Instinct 2X but my point was that I dont expect Pebble to include solar charging if theyre looking at a similar price point to the original,m9mm9fe,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mvmzh,sioux612,,8,2025-01-28 13:51:28,,,,Yeah and even the normal Garmin with normal screen and screen always on lasts almost 2 weeks It was my first smartwatch and I genuinely cant understand how somebody can deal with battery life as short as Apple Watch has,m9mixz0,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9mwx7b,sixfourtykilo,,3,2025-01-28 13:58:54,,,,I had the original Moto 360 and I loved that watch and all of its shortcomings but battery swell and the lack of water resistance made it a bummer My first Garmin was a 235 and it was fine Limited but finally did the things I actually needed Then I got a screaming deal on a previous gen 935 and havent looked back The ten day battery life is great But Im jealous of my wifes Fenix both in terms of size I like the bigger watch faces and battery life Ive never seen a modern battery operated device measure its battery percentage in days instead of just a percentage number,m9mvmzh,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9nujag,VenomGTSR,,2,2025-01-28 16:48:22,,,,I went with an Apple Watch after really enjoying my Fossil Hybrid Went from 3 weeks battery life to maybe 4 days if I turn it off and only wear it 8 or so hours a day Its rough having to think about that battery life Most of the added functionality is lost on me since I really just use it like I did my Fossil and Pebbles before it,m9mvmzh,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9p0o87,MrDelmer,,1,2025-01-28 20:01:39,,,,Currently wearing a Fossil gen6 hybrid and i couldnt be more excited about the news from this article mine has been showing signs of slowly dying and i cannot find anything remotely similar that would achieve the same Very excited for this,m9nujag,3.0,1ic004x

comment,mazj3hc,VenomGTSR,,1,2025-02-04 20:42:55,,,,Its more about longterm battery life for me The less often you have to charge it the longer the useful life of the battery Also its a small thing but not needing to take a charging cable along on trips was kind of nice,m9q1x0j,4.0,1ic004x
comment,m9pbmw7,SQL617,,2,2025-01-28 20:52:15,,,,I have the Apple Watch Ultra 2 I charge it for roughly 20 minutes in the morning as I shower and get dressed other than that I wear it 247 Ive never had an issue with low battery or being stuck with a dead battery Sure two weeks battery on a single charge would be cool but thats not necessarily a reason Id buy one model over another 72 hours is plenty for me,m9mvmzh,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9q1oa6,JamesHeckfield,,2,2025-01-28 22:55:12,,,,Most people charge their phones everyday And Id imagine most Apple Watch owners shower regularly And they have fast charging now You just plug it in while you do your self care routine and then youre good Its not like they are gonna figure out a way to get the watch to last a whole week or something So Apples target is a reliable day of battery life they arent going to invest a ton into improving the battery just so you only have to charge it once a week,m9mvmzh,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9n0fiw,None,,3,2025-01-28 14:19:00,,,,I have a Garmin Instinct Crossover and it includes many of the features that this new Pebble watch will have thirty day battery life sunreadable transflective LCD screen buttons instead of a touchscreen for navigation I love it Much better than my Google Pixel Watch Gen1 that have about twelve hours of battery life and finicky touchscreen controls The big downside of the Garmin watches is that theyre crazy expensive I only got mine because I was able to use a perk from work to pay for it These new Pebble watches could be a nice cheaper alternative,m9mixz0,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9p0fk8,ok-commuter,,2,2025-01-28 20:00:33,,,,Theyre also massive on the wrist and nowhere near as dev friendly as the Pebbles Pebble had over 15k watchfaces as just one example,m9n0fiw,2.0,1ic004x
comment,m9p34iv,hirsutesuit,,1,2025-01-28 20:13:05,,,,Right If they made a Pebble as large as the 7x Pro Solar itd easily last longer than 30 days,m9p0fk8,3.0,1ic004x
comment,m9ocw12,jbFanClubPresident,,2,2025-01-28 18:13:33,,,,Yes they had smartwatch functionalities They even had their own App Store I developed a popular game for them,m9mixz0,1.0,1ic004x

comment,m9oe94w,rocktsrgeon,,3,2025-01-28 18:19:43,,,,By sustainable you mean develop a nice watch like the pebble and not sell out and make them all ewaste like they did last time I loved my pebble,,0.0,1ic004x
comment,m9q06lw,tempest_87,,1,2025-01-28 22:47:43,,,,They werent ewaste You can still get them to work on modern phones including downloading watch faces and whatnot The sustainable comment was around the business model Where they tired to get too big and develop too much new technology As opposed to making a good watch and building and selling that good watch,m9oe94w,1.0,1ic004x

comment,m9p9is5,anitricks,,1,2025-01-28 20:42:35,,,,Yes if you can extend the battery life so that you dont have to charge every night Apple Watch with good tracking it will do well Currently I use garmin and I just forget its there and charge it every 3 days If pebble can do that and make it a week I feel like that direction would be sustainable,,0.0,1ic004x
comment,m9ponh7,dep,,1,2025-01-28 21:52:04,,,,I definitely recommend the Garmin Instinct 2 Monochromatic transflexive display 1 month battery life buttons instead of a touch screen Definitely feels like a spiritual successor more than anything Ive found Also my instinct 2 has a whitered toggleable flashlight on the top that you can invoke with a double button press I use this daily and cant imagine not having this on a watch now,,0.0,1ic004x

comment,m9s7xq9,senpizzle,,1,2025-01-29 06:44:55,,,,Please God yes I kept buying Pebble 2s for years after production ended Everything about those watches were amazing except the build quality of the buttons The only reason I gave up is because they were got even more expensive every few years when I needed a new one because the silicon buttons ripped off,,0.0,1ic004x

comment,ma2xn41,skriefal,,1,2025-01-30 21:17:30,,,,Theyre a nice choice for those who like such things including me But perhaps not for just anyone who is looking for a reliable tool Theyre usually offinaccurate by about 10 seconds per day versus about 10 seconds per month for a quartz watch meaning that the time will need to be adjusted every week or two if you want reasonable accuracy in the displayed time The date display also will need to be adjusted following the end of any month with fewer than 31 days And to keep the accuracy described here youll need to have the watch serviced every 7 10 years or so at a cost of 200 300 for basic watch can be 500 for a chronograph,m9s8xf7,1.0,1ic004x

comment,m9o7ds4,Longhag,,-1,2025-01-28 17:48:32,,,,We already have pretty sustainable watches My citizen eco drive is over 10 years old and works like a charm never needs a battery or charging Will likely last another couple of decades My seiko kinetic is the same but 25 years old Electronicsmart watches are the worst for sustainability Just stick with old mechanical ones that can be easily repaired and dont need a battery There are plenty of mechanical watches 50 years old and going strong,,0.0,1ic004x
comment,m9ozc2w,Plethora_of_squids,,1,2025-01-28 19:55:32,,,,Even digital watches can last a pretty damn long time Ive seen some old ass digital watches where like the band falling apart or the calendar ticking over is more of a concern than the hardware failing Hell I went and dug out the casio I had as a kid and probably havent worn for like a decade and while its deffo pretty beat up its still working perfectly fine Might even be on the original battery which by now is probably 1520 years old if not then this watch also withstood 13 year old me with a screwdriver and a battery from the supermarket Probably a hell of a lot more resilient than a smart or mechanical watch too which honestly if youre talking about longevity Id say is more a concern Having something that can go forever doesnt quite mean as much if it can be throw out of whack by being dropped in the sink or falling down the stairs,m9o7ds4,1.0,1ic004x
comment,m9psoa4,Longhag,,1,2025-01-28 22:11:03,,,,True that I still have an old Casio digital that works when I replace the battery I guess my thought was more around the sustainability side being not having to replace batteries and not using smart type watches where internal batteries die or software becomes obsolete and unusable A good Casio is super long lived too,m9ozc2w,2.0,1ic004x
