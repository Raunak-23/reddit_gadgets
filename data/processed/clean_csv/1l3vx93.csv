post,1l3vx93,chrisdh79,Wyze Says ‘Screw It’ and Shoves a Camera Into Its Latest Smart Bulb | We can't decide if this is a great or terrible idea for your smart home.,813,2025-06-05 10:37:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1l3vx93/wyze_says_screw_it_and_shoves_a_camera_into_its/,193.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mw45ogf,Em4gdn3m,,534,2025-06-05 11:12:56,,,,Why is this so terrible It allows you to easily power a security cam on your front porch or whatever without the extra wiring Its not like Wyze hid a camera in regular lightbulbs without customers knowing about it in order to spy on customers,,0.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4n3qu,mauricioszabo,,61,2025-06-05 13:06:25,,,,Clickbait The article mentions no downsides and not even once there are any mentions of why its a bad idea,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93

comment,mwgd4vy,paco_dasota,,12,2025-06-07 07:22:03,,,,I mean their existing cameras magnetically clip on to surfaces and face a similar problem,mw51ztq,3.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwolnly,Fidodo,,4,2025-06-08 16:53:32,,,,You can also rip off most diy security cameras Youll know that it happened and capture any footage until then plus catch them in the act if you have multiple cameras,mw51ztq,3.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwr254y,YnotBbrave,,1,2025-06-09 00:47:22,,,,Its brilliant but a bit ugly looking,mw4n3qu,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4dwzg,sump_daddy,,82,2025-06-05 12:10:28,,,,And add to that the fact that this concept has been around for YEARS in basic straightouttachina products there really is nothing to see here unless you want an easy way to watch the outside of your house near a light fixture and in that scenario what there is to see here is the outside of your house near your light fixture The only thing missing is a small battery for daytime monitoring in scenarios where you dont want to replace ALL the bulbs on that switch with smart ones and then leave the switch permanently on,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4o4w2,nick99990,,30,2025-06-05 13:12:16,,,,Funny you mention that everything Wyze is is straight out of China I had found a firmware bug that caused the MAC address of one of my Wyze cams to give its burned in address from the manufacturer instead of the one that gets coded in their custom firmware Came back to a company in China Started looking into it and yep everything is white box and they just put a fancy wrapper on it with their app It was then I decided I didnt trust Wyze anymore and started working to get rid of them I dont recommend them anymore and all I have left is my door lock which Ill replace when I get around to it,mw4dwzg,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4y8tc,samanime,,5,2025-06-05 14:07:02,,,,Yeah When I clicked in I thought it was going to be some hidden camera in your house for something goofy like autoonoff of the light or something But this seems like a darn good idea A security camera with no installation or wiring seems pretty good I guess the only possibly downside is it is easily stealable but youd have the thief on camera p,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4i0gp,4kVHS,,10,2025-06-05 12:36:19,,,,Its only terrible because Wyze made it I cant wait for other manufacturers to pickup on this form factor,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4omoh,Em4gdn3m,,6,2025-06-05 13:15:03,,,,Sure I understand completely not trusting certain companys and their skeezy practices and I wouldnt buy this product from Wyze either but the idea is a good idea and makes a ton of sense,mw4i0gp,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw50b28,4kVHS,,4,2025-06-05 14:17:29,,,,Yeah thats what Im saying I like the idea of it I just dont like Wyze Ive had several Wyze cams fail for no reason and several software issues that they refused to fix Their support was very difficult to work with Im done with them,mw4omoh,3.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw66orn,AveDominusNox,,2,2025-06-05 17:38:28,,,,Are there any smart home ecosystems that run entirely locally not cloud based Like I have computers Capturing and compressing video when a motion sensor goes off isnt exactly offload this work to someone elses supercomputer farm kind of work,mw4i0gp,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw9y9cp,haarschmuck,,2,2025-06-06 06:58:07,,,,I have like 20 wyze cams and not a single one has failed even after years of outdoor use Why would I spend hundreds per cam when I can get them for literally 40,mw4i0gp,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw6ojkl,ScientiaProtestas,,1,2025-06-05 19:02:59,,,,There are a ton of light bulb cameras out there Just search for what I put in quotes But most are lower end as higher end will not be limited by a light bulb socket,mw4i0gp,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw8y9pd,DMala,,1,2025-06-06 02:26:21,,,,I have one now thats just a camera with a light bulb base Its great because getting power out there would be a PITA otherwise I wouldnt mind one that is also still a light bulb although we have three other lights out there so its not super necessary,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw8zleg,that_one_wierd_guy,,1,2025-06-06 02:34:38,,,,only problem I can think of is that there might be security issues ie is the feed encrypted can it be selfhosted or does the feed go off to someone elses servers,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw5s34k,SalltyJuicy,,1,2025-06-05 16:30:31,,,,I think the bigger concern is largely how widespread and innocuous surveillance is in every day life Its generally distressing that we are being filmed all the time I think its concerning that we are getting more products with cameras I mean if every house and every place of business has a camera we basically end up with a privatized surveillance state,mw45ogf,1.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4i49b,murdacai999,,22,2025-06-05 12:36:58,,,,They make a 3rd part accessory that goes between a regular bulb and the socket and provides the USB to plug in a regular wyze camera Wyze Lamp Socket Power Adapter This current product the bulb cam sounds terrible to me If the bulb dies you need to spend another 50 bux for a new camera,mw45ed6,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw56j02,Moscato359,,1,2025-06-05 14:47:50,,,,I assume it has a warranty,mw4i49b,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw5s7ps,IronFrogger,,4,2025-06-05 16:31:09,,,,Yes the warranty period will end just short of the average life of a bulb Also in the fine print it will say cant be placed upside down like in the demo photo,mw56j02,3.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw5ug78,euph_22,,2,2025-06-05 16:41:46,,,,But that rules out the vast majority of light fixtures,mw5s7ps,4.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw5uy6p,IronFrogger,,6,2025-06-05 16:44:08,,,,Thats the joke But on a serious note youll find a lot of LEDs are not rated for hanging upside down or in enclosed spaces,mw5ug78,5.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw6g9qx,pancak3d,,1,2025-06-05 18:23:28,,,,Its fully cable and mount free so there are some advantages Niche product for sure The ewaste element for dead LED is criminal,mw4i49b,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mwfrcik,murdacai999,,1,2025-06-07 04:07:58,,,,The accessory bulb isnt the same as the bulb attached to the camera its just an additional bulb that can be made to turn on when the camera detects movement,mwfr051,3.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwfrr1v,silenc3x,,1,2025-06-07 04:11:02,,,,Oh yeah youre right I thought it just popped over that They claim 25k hours85 years on the bulb cam life Wonder how accurate that would be,mwfrcik,4.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwfy9bx,murdacai999,,2,2025-06-07 05:03:02,,,,I personally like to leave my outdoor lights on to keep the driveway well lit So roughly 3 years of use if thats accurate,mwfrr1v,5.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwfzp0v,silenc3x,,1,2025-06-07 05:15:11,,,,If I can set a schedule with Google Assistant on the bulb separately I would just have it come on at sunset turn off at sunrise 4k hours a year I dont want it on all the time or motion activated Interested to see if I can make that happen As a renter its worth it to me Otherwise Id just get the wyze bulb socket wire alongside a normal smart bulb and use a Cam v3v4 This is just a bit easier in terms of setup and installation,mwfy9bx,6.0,1l3vx93
comment,mwh85tl,murdacai999,,1,2025-06-07 12:15:13,,,,Good idea Im sure its possible to schedule it to come on off duskdawn Would def increase its longevity,mwfzp0v,7.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw6nn2k,ScientiaProtestas,,1,2025-06-05 18:58:39,,,,There are a lot of cameras that screw into a light bulb socket So you have many choices Just search for light bulb camera Most dont have a separate light If you want it to still work as a light you can use the builtin LEDs of the camera which will be directional But there are some that have a 360 degree light,mw45ed6,1.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4ef5c,Riversntallbuildings,,34,2025-06-05 12:13:45,,,,The concept is fine in fact its a brilliant way to get power without running new wires Fun fact originally all appliances screwed into light sockets because lighting was the first commercial use of electricity What I hate is the design Make design a bit more elegant A domed 360 camera or even a small enclosed camera that rotates inside is way better than those ugly cubes hanging off the light WTH,,0.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw62gjj,Butt_Face2000,,6,2025-06-05 17:18:59,,,,Im guessing they skipped a motorized version due to cost The telescopic extension is pretty smart because you have to get the camera to extend outside of the glass of whatever light you are putting it in A set height domed camera wouldnt solve this problem and would be useless in a light enclosure,mw4ef5c,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw7t3v3,Riversntallbuildings,,1,2025-06-05 22:20:47,,,,Ahhh valid points However I could see an even better design for those more industrial flood light bulbs Theyre not really decorative but they could essentially put a camera in the middle and an LED ring light around the outside Hahaha,mw62gjj,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw45m6w,dougms,,42,2025-06-05 11:12:26,,,,Ive actually been looking for either a lightbulb socket either a usb output or this for above my garage so I can put in a camera out front Might actually unironically look into this,,0.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw46d0f,whewtang,,9,2025-06-05 11:18:04,,,,You can buy bulb socket adapters for less than 5 Bulb to usb or a power outlet Also two wire pigtails if you need to hand wire something to it,mw45m6w,1.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw49hyc,Leper17,,14,2025-06-05 11:40:45,,,,Those socket adapters are a fucking nightmare For a camera should be fine but most sockets are rated for 100w max power draw Which is less than 1 amp at 120v Ive come across a lot of melted ones,mw46d0f,2.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4ho5w,whewtang,,4,2025-06-05 12:34:11,,,,Good point,mw49hyc,3.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw4n1di,Leper17,,3,2025-06-05 13:06:01,,,,They should and maybe the adapter is rated higher but standard A19 base light bulbs max out at like 150W and most fixtures arent even rated for that The majority of residential light sockets are rated at 60w max because theyre only supposed to run a light bulb Most of the melted ones I come across are people plugging in the block heater of their car which pulls from 612 amps depending on the vehicle,mw4ho5w,4.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4e8h5,sump_daddy,,6,2025-06-05 12:12:32,,,,Because at least five popular brands in the USA and more in the rest of world already sell this product and its YEARS old at this point People acting like Wyze is some sort of creepy trailblazer are really really odd they are just copying an already successful product,mw4ams5,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4d3y9,Jewrisprudent,,2,2025-06-05 12:05:10,,,,Because its literally just a clearly visible camera attached to a light Nothing is hidden here the only potentially unique bit is that it fits into a light bulb socket But in terms of combining a camera with a light this is no different than a lot of outdoor cameras like Ring etc,mw4ams5,2.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw50x5s,Drink15,,3,2025-06-05 14:20:32,,,,I get it but its a there is a balance between security inconvenience This maximized convenience over security which lots of people prefer or need but there are other options if anyone wants security over convenience It all depends on the situation This is great for rentals or if the light fixture isnt in an easily reachable place,mw4w39y,5.0,1l3vx93
comment,mw51m49,finakechi,,1,2025-06-05 14:23:56,,,,I totally agree I just think it should be something people think about Theres plenty of fixtures that would be too high for people to reasonable remove and plenty of spots inside that this would be useful as well,mw50x5s,6.0,1l3vx93

comment,mw4kjf3,Catenane,,1,2025-06-05 12:51:30,,,,I bought a single wyze cam to test feasibility of stuff like this as the cameras are good quality but I dont trust wyze sketchware whatsoever I previously played with wz mini hacks but it left a ton to be desired It never touched my network until it was on thingino and I will never make a wyze account or let any camera traffic out of my network whatsoever Same reason my vacuum runs valetudo and that was a prerequisite for me even buying the thing And now I can ssh in to both my vacuum and camera and manage like any other box lol My prerequisite for most of this kind of stuff is that accounts never get made and the device never touches the internet until its running something I trust,mw4j5s7,3.0,1l3vx93
