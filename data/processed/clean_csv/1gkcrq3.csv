comment,lvloug9,redsterXVI,,14,2024-11-05 22:32:55,,,,Just checked the PS2 The PS3 released in Nov 2006 but the PS2 was sold until the end of 2012 6 more years Total lifetime was 12 years so it was previous gen during half its run It seems to have sold 37M of the total 155M times while the PS3 was already on the market,lvlmbet,3.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvkpxd3,Shoelebubba,,51,2024-11-05 19:41:32,,,,Im sort of hoping for an OLED option at launch because losing out on how nice the OLED screen looks on the current Switch to get a different type of screen on the Switch 2 would be a bummer,lvki60g,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvmkkyx,CMDR_omnicognate,,12,2024-11-06 01:33:14,,,,Maybe on one hand the OLED is so much nicer than the standard one on the other hand it complicates production plus if they release an OLED version separately in like 2 years time or so theres a lot of people that bought the switch 2 that will buy an OLED version on top of the one they already have,lvm7sbs,3.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvn4lq6,Mother_Restaurant188,,3,2024-11-06 03:33:33,,,,Definitely wait at this point unless its completely unplayable I got the Switch OLED when it launched even though my Switch OG was totally fine except for the awful battery life Worth every penny,lvki60g,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvlziji,Specialist-Rope-9760,,1,2024-11-05 23:30:52,,,,It will be interesting as long as they dont totally fuck up backwards compatibility I think that will make or break the system It will also be interesting where OLED sits in the new lineup and if they would launch with multiple options out of the gate It would be hard to expect current OLED users to downgrade their screens,lvki60g,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvok9hw,Weir99,,1,2024-11-06 09:46:52,,,,Rumours seem to indicate only a base option at release Nintendos probably seen enough disastrous console launches that they dont want to over produce for this one If sales go well I would bet that well see an OLED and Lite model earlier in the new devices lifecycle than what happened with the Switch,lvlziji,2.0,1gkcrq3
comment,lvk97q9,Brandunaware,,86,2024-11-05 18:20:41,,,,Teasing a successor thats probably backwards compatible but not announcing anything concrete does not seem like a great strategy for selling the current model Theyve made money hand over fist on this thing so theyre fine but I have to wonder what their communications strategy is Or maybe its supply issues and the timeline went pear shaped on them,,0.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvml7tu,CMDR_omnicognate,,6,2024-11-06 01:37:08,,,,Nintendo wont want to announce a switch successor until after the holiday period since they sell bucketloads of consoles over that time period as Christmas gifts announcing a new console coming out in the next 69 months from now would probably dissuade a lot of parents from buying them for their kids,lvkrh2o,2.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvl3h3g,_Didds_,,6,2024-11-05 20:47:58,,,,Communication has always been terrible with them I have an alternate take maybe with rose tinted glasses but something I really belive to be true They are the best from the big 3 console market players at communicating things without exaggerated hype or making fans guess what they mean Microsoft and Sony are happy to tease their products and new consoles and let fans build their hype over incomplete information or limited information Most other major player console launch was marked with people having to guess or decrypt what some features would mean console version capabilities and limitations and how they eoukd fare vs the competition Most of the time a clear picture is only provided by 3rd party websites post launch reviews or other similar sort of media Now Nintendo doesnt take part of that game They will talk to consumers when they feel its the correct time for them and not fall to temptation to build hype with vague information in between Their launch communication will provide a clear picture of what the product is their gimmick vs the competition and what to expect from it Reviews post launch wont uncover for the most part new stuff or shocking limitations cause it will be made clear by Nintendo what the product is They will talk less and less often but when they do they will nail the pin in the head and not dance around the subject And breaking the above rule thats one thing that made the Wii U a failure They failed to communicate clearly what the console was and aimed to achieve its features and 3rd party communication ran wild with it instead of Nintendo taking the active voice I honestly preffer their method of talking when they feel like they should and not when people try to pressure them to and try to make them in control of their own narrative instead of relying to hype or hear say And thats why most Nintendo fans can really on the good old method of if Nintendo doesnt say something then its not oficial or otherwise they woukd say it themselves,lvkrh2o,2.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvl1j3c,Estrava,,7,2024-11-05 20:38:34,,,,The general consumer probably doesnt think or read news on if a new one is coming It still makes great gifts for kids and new games like Mario party will come out and people will get the console for the first time,lvl0kyg,2.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvlqt7x,jibbyjackjoe,,3,2024-11-05 22:43:11,,,,Youre joking right Announcing it now right before the holiday would plummet the sales of current consoles,lvk97q9,1.0,1gkcrq3
comment,lvkds92,wicktus,,3,2024-11-05 18:42:27,,,,Ensuring a strong lineup and solid supplies dont look beneath that imho especially since it was apparently slated for a Q4 2024 launch but delayed to ensure a stronger launch,lvk97q9,1.0,1gkcrq3
comment,lvkv4e8,Shakey_J_Fox,,-1,2024-11-05 20:07:09,,,,I hope so Nintendo hasnt had a system launch with a solid exclusive lineup since GameCube I just want to do more than play a wii sports type game for the first six months after release otherwise whats the point of early adoption,lvkds92,2.0,1gkcrq3
comment,lvkoyrp,CrippledCox,,1,2024-11-05 19:36:50,,,,They had a major investor meeting and had to confirm when the next console was coming Im sure they would have done it differently if it didnt line up with that,lvk97q9,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvl7nwb,blueblurz94,,19,2024-11-05 21:08:09,,,,They know they can beat the 155 million figure which was Sonys last officially confirmed total for the PS2 in 2012 Anything above that is just a bonus for Nintendo to boost their lead as the new alltime sales king of consoles after nearly 2 decadesPS2 took the crown from the GameboyGameboy Color in mid2007 That 160 million statement from former Sony CEO Jim Ryan earlier this year as he was retiring has not been officially confirmed or supported by Sony themselves So the 155 million figure is the official number to beat Its only fair since Nintendo posts official numbers every quarter,lvks0o4,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lx26z7n,talllankywhiteboy,,2,2024-11-14 08:59:20,,,,Im expecting the Switch to take up the budget portion of the Nintendo line up for a few years If they drop the price of the Switch Lite by 50 and bundle something like Mario Kart 8 with it it would still be a great buy for kids,lvks0o4,1.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvo2uh4,KowardlyMan,,3,2024-11-06 07:20:39,,,,Remember that if you see frame drops in an exclusive its really not the consoles fault Its completely the developer They could have worked on performances better in the case of Pokemon the new games are terribly optimized or used a graphical style that is less resource intensive Were not talking about ports the game is done for this hardware,lvkl5gx,1.0,1gkcrq3
comment,lvp9fpc,Gsquat,,2,2024-11-06 12:56:02,,,,Right Thats what someone else said I guess my point was I definitely wanted to see the Switch 2 be a little more capable than the steam deck and it doesnt look like thats going to happen Ill still probably get one and enjoy it but just nitpicking I trust the MP4 will be optimized well I just hope to never experience a AAA title perform that bad on a console again,lvo2uh4,2.0,1gkcrq3

comment,lvlli99,BandiriaTraveler,,1,2024-11-05 22:15:42,,,,I hope they make it at least a bit more up to date than the og Switch whose chipset was dated even in 2017 The Switch was a great indie machine in the early years but it has really struggled with some big indie games in more recent years And even first party games have had performance issues since day one and increasingly so as time has gone on It would be nice to have a reason to use my Switch more than a week or two a year when one of the big first party releases drops,lvl45l0,4.0,1gkcrq3
