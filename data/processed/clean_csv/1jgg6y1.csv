comment,mj0lzha,BlastFX2,,12,2025-03-21 18:23:20,,,,Windows 10 will have been supported for 10 years which is perfectly in line with the normal support window for mainline Windows desktop versions 95 was supported for 6 years 98 for 8 2000 for 10 XP for 13 Vista for 10 7 for 10 8 for 10 The support period is expected The reason to migrate is Windows 11 UI being garbage,mj0g8td,5.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj66v6w,BlastFX2,,1,2025-03-22 16:59:52,,,,Thats quite arbitrary An OS wont get a meaningful speed boost from vector instructions and even if it did 41 was the last version that added anything noteworthy 42 just added string search and CRC32 instructions And even with the SSE 42 restriction that really only limits you to Nehalem first generation Core i CPUs 2008 and onward Microsofts limit to 8th gen 2017 and onward is completely arbitrary,mj437tq,11.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj1t7k0,OttawaTGirl,,6,2025-03-21 22:00:17,,,,MS has a shit rep for UI design They have made windows less versatile by making it too simple A desktop should have the availability of details Its not a phone The same with MS office They have been a yoyo of bad design Like they tried to kill off the tab and ribbon with the simplified ribbon which was a half assed toolbar and absolute garbage They take the start button and move it to a dynamic centerd position You broke the standard for start menus for a start menu that is not anchored FFS,mj0lzha,6.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj2nk54,tokinUP,,-2,2025-03-22 00:53:35,,,,Oh I understand EOL just fine Im just chastising the forprofit software companies for pushing such flawed products to market in the first place then not keeping them upgraded properly Think about it in terms of a car recall the manufacturer is still on the hook for issues,mj2mtbu,6.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj2x7f0,rathlord,,2,2025-03-22 01:53:27,,,,Except this isnt a recall and theres no flaw here They made the choice that Windows 11 requires newer security hardware Not even new TPM has been standard for nearly a decade Theres no flaw this was an objectively good decision that protects consumers Theres a ton of things to be frustrated with Microsoft about I have four or five different OSs running at my house depending on the day and I love Linux But this isnt something to be critical of Microsoft on If you think it is thats an education problem on your part Edit and Microsoft isnt even the manufacturer of your hardware unless youre using a Surface I guess in which case theyve had TPM chips and thus Win 11 support since the first gen,mj2nk54,7.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj65llg,Opus_723,,3,2025-03-22 16:53:23,,,,I didnt say multifactor is stupid Did I upset you so much you hallucinated But I do think many security types seem to operate under the assumption that more security is always better when there are definitely tradeoffs and other people arent unreasonable for wanting to be inconvenienced less,mj4iu6v,10.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miz8en2,ThePretzul,,-5,2025-03-21 14:23:24,,,,Honestly its not unreasonable for a company to discontinue support for an outdated software product 10 years after first release and 4 years after the successor has been released 10 years of support for a product with 4 of those coming after its been replaced is one of the better policies out there for software support MacOS is 710 years of security support on average for released versions so its not like Microsoft is behind any of their competitors here,miywbkk,2.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mizb52j,BrunoEye,,13,2025-03-21 14:37:05,,,,The issue is that after 4 years the replacement is still significantly inferior in many aspects,miz8en2,3.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mizbfmx,ThePretzul,,-10,2025-03-21 14:38:33,,,,Sure thats a valid opinion It still doesnt change the reality that 10 years of support for released software is well beyond industry standard You are not forced to upgrade to Windows 11 your Windows 10 PC will continue to work just fine and they are not forced to maintain Windows 10 for all eternity,mizb52j,4.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj05af1,BrunoEye,,5,2025-03-21 17:03:47,,,,No one is claiming what they are doing is illegal Just that its a shitty customer experience A lack of security updates is a valid concern so sticking with W10 isnt a great option if you intend to use the internet,mizbfmx,5.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj06nef,ThePretzul,,-3,2025-03-21 17:10:17,,,,Just that its a shitty customer experience What Im saying is that peoples expectations are clearly out of touch considering its a better customer experience than literally any other operating system provides with respect to security updates Not even MacOS supports security updates for longer than 7 years Beyond that for the majority of users it doesnt change their experience in the slightest Windows 10 will continue to work just fine on their PCs It just wont receive new updates beyond the end of life date The histrionics about it being a shitty customer experience are wildly off base with reality considering Windows security updates the thing that is ending are one of the single most complained about things by users of Windows 10 Im calling out the unrealistic expectations of unlimited updates and support for outdated products that have already been supported far longer than industry average People just love to complain whenever a company doesnt provide them with free dedicated support and updates for 20 years on a software product they paid very little for 2030 in the case of buying a prebuilt PC 100 or less for most who purchased their own license separately,mj05af1,6.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj0g7mg,BrunoEye,,5,2025-03-21 17:54:58,,,,The issue isnt that the support duration is too short Its that support is being stopped before there is a suitable upgrade option This would be completely fine if W11 wasnt so shit,mj06nef,7.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj0i0dn,ThePretzul,,0,2025-03-21 18:03:39,,,,If you think Windows 11 is shit then dont use it you genuinely dont have to Your user experience will not fundamentally change at all with Windows 10 Youre still potentially vulnerable to zero day exploits even when the operating system is actively receiving updates Windows Defender still will continue to receive regular improvements for its active screening since it is cloud connected and shares this new data across Windows versions The only change will be that if a new vulnerability in windows itself is discovered it will not receive a security patch unless its particularly major in which case theyll release one patch once every 13 years as has happened with older Windows versions and you will rely on Windows Defender or 3rd party antivirus software to prevent an attacker from executing code that utilizes this vulnerability This is identical to how it currently works for zero day or recently discovered security vulnerabilities A vocal minority or even majority of consumers disliking the newer product is not a compelling argument to forcibly extend support for the older product that has already been supported longer than anyone else supports similar products Im personally not a fan of the data collection in Windows 10 or the vast expansion of data collection in Windows 11 but the push should be for them to fix the problems with the current product rather than keep something outdated on life support a little bit longer when the vast majority of security improvements the Windows Defender active screening capabilities are still going to be delivered for W10 users even after the W10 end of life To be perfectly clear Im not saying that Windows 11 is a perfect or good product here Im just trying to provide a voice of reason since this article is nothing but rage bait over something that has been planned for years by now is beyond industry standard levels of support and is something that will not at all change the user experience for 95 or more of people on Windows 10 computers except by no longer having Windows update annoyances Its not perfectly ideal for consumers but its better than what literally anyone else provides and the actual impact to the vast majority is virtually nonexistent,mj0g7mg,8.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj1mjks,JaneksLittleBlackBox,,5,2025-03-21 21:24:53,,,,Yeah just like RAC and Aarons NZXTs entire business model is aimed at targeting customers who cant take out a credit line for the items they need and people who are illiterate when it comes to credit are the perfect demographic to fleece over time with insane payments that essentially costs the customers twice what a comparable product would Rent to own has always been this way because the target demographic is financially illiterate and usually so badly in debt that they could never lease the products anyway,mj0mza2,6.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mizxsa3,Gunfreak2217,,1,2025-03-21 16:27:45,,,,Youre close The problem with NZXT is that you could have taken out a loan Paid the interest on the loan over the course of a year and owned it for the price of just renting for a year So its actually cheaper to take a loan out and buy the product rather than renting it Also the loan could have been the MOST predatory highest interest illegal loan possible and still would have been cheaper to do than rent the pc from NZXT,miywhzu,2.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miz0521,Im_Very_Important,,6,2025-03-21 13:39:32,,,,I guess the point is that security is about layers the more potentially vectors of access they easier it is for an attack Most people are likely running old out of dated of insecure routers combine that with known OS vulnerabilities that will never be patched Slightly out of date browsers and way to many people use an administrator account as their login Top it all off as you mention the PEBCAK is the greatest attack vector Im not saying you cant do it just the potential for issues goes up All the above comments being said if you have and older machine that doesnt need specific applications Linux does run most things these days There is a slight learning curve to it but overall you can do most things with more say in what is on your system or where your data goes Also saves a perfectly functional computer from the bin,miyuy2g,3.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miz8ka0,m0rogfar,,9,2025-03-21 14:24:11,,,,Honestly I dont see it The crux of the issue with Linux on the desktop is that while the kernel and backend is solid and regularly updated due to Linux strong presence in servers the desktop environment and the other stuff only needed on a desktop is ridiculously undermaintained The desktop environments all still feel like a proofofconcept that was made to pitch the idea of Linux on the desktop rather than a finished product Falling back to CLI because some advanced feature wasnt implemented in GUI is still far too common and backend implementations like the XorgWayland thing and the QTGTK split cause weird quirks that essentially require the user to know about the technical implementation of the GUI to understand the behavior of the OS Of course one may argue that more users could change the game but theres a major asterisk there Whats needed isnt really more users but more money to hire more developers and because Linux distributions are generally free for endusers more users does not necessarily mean more money In fact I would be quite surprised if even 1 of the userbase that switches because their hardware is over seven years old and they dont want to pay for new hardware that would give a better experience are suddenly going to turn around and pay or donate enough to make a meaningful dent like say 100year in hopes of funding development to make a better experience viable in the future Apple has shown that making a wellfunded customerfocused desktop environment as a minority OS vendor is absolutely possible but also that the secret sauce to make that financially viable is essentially to convince users that they should pay more money to not use Windows Linux is doing that on the server side just look at something like RHEL server SaaS pricing but doesnt seem to have any idea how to get there on the consumer side,miz02ak,4.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj05uod,FrozenLogger,,1,2025-03-21 17:06:28,,,,As a Linux desktop user this The desktop environments all still feel like a proofofconcept is silly Windows is the least productive desktop you can get MacOS is slick and you can get a workflow for it but it is Mac way or the highway And frankly it drives me crazy having to use it There is so much more functionality in Linux desktop if you KDE or a nice workflow if you use Gnome plus extensions and for some people tiling is a godsend I am not sure why you think anything is missing with the linux desktop although you have a valid point that the transition from X to Wayland has been a bit rocky,miz8ka0,5.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj1ies9,Kyoraki,,2,2025-03-21 21:03:15,,,,Its not very difficult to switch Its also not worth bothering with in 999 of cases as it will expect hardware nearly identical to the Steam Deck itself Either install Arch and set things up yourself or wait for an official release,miz5l5v,3.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj1ozbq,_tnr,,2,2025-03-21 21:37:48,,,,Yeah I mean there are plenty of distros out there Bazzite is actually a quite nice user experience and essentially does the entire setup for you My comment wasnt necessarily about switching to SteamOS exclusively but linux in general,mj1ies9,4.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj2usbx,rathlord,,2,2025-03-22 01:38:22,,,,For clarity SteamOS on the Steam Deck is not the same as SteamOS that you can download for other hardware right now The Steam deck SteamOS is awesome and hopefully should be released to consumers soon but you cant easily install it on your hardware for now The other SteamOS that was built for the unsuccessful Steam console hardware and its pretty dated and rough,miz4cfj,2.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mizo1zy,herbertfilby,,1,2025-03-21 15:40:37,,,,Arch Linux is running behind the scenes on the Steam Deck Installed that on my gaming desktop and its absolutely a perfectly viable substitute for Windows Proton allows you to basically run 99 of games and most software like MS Word have open source alternatives like LibreOffice Setup of Arch can be complicated but there are YouTube tutorials,miz4cfj,2.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj4jllo,rathlord,,1,2025-03-22 10:42:19,,,,Yes with Windows 11 Microsoft made a conscious choice that they would require security architecture on your board thats been a standard for nearly a decade Windows is both Enterprise focused and supportive of people who dont understand their computers and for both applications this decision was smart and necessary Its not some arbitrary decision TPM doesnt just mean fiddly modern software thing Its a dedicated security module that protects you from a lot of very common very scary attack vectors People dont understand this so they get angry but its a good decision for that exact reason those very angry people are the ones its there to protect This happens as technology progresses sometimes Its not happening with Linux right now but that doesnt mean it never will or never has You cant install an x8664 distro on x86 hardware or x8664 on ARM This is a similar hardware requirement As Ive said before I love Linux I daily drive it a lot I support all three major OSs at work Theres a ton of reasons to be upset at Microsoft This isnt one,mj3qjm8,3.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj0ebs6,Maxerature,,2,2025-03-21 17:45:57,,,,So I made the hop about 4 years ago and its been pretty great overall Some fiddling for some things but there are very few programs I have missed because everything either runs great with Wine has a Linux native version or has a great alternative If you make the jump there are a few things Id recommend DISTRO Pop OS or Kubuntu Both are great though I prefer Kubuntu The nice thing about Pop OS is that it handles Nvidia Drivers on install without issues Kubuntu does that now too to be fair If you like Windowsstyle UI as opposed to OSX id suggest Kubuntu as Pop uses an OSX style display unless you fiddle with it SETUP While setting up the OS there are a few things it makes you do One of the more confusing ones is setting up drive partitions I made a ton of choices that I lived to eventually regret at first so to save some trouble a mini guide is 100 GiB to Root this is the actual OS 32 GiB to Swap swap this is virtual RAM Useful at times As much as possible for home home Recommended sizes for everything else The main point of this setup is that by separating root and home if you want to change Distro at any point you can just overwrite Root and keep all your personal data and settings which are stored in home or other sub partitions if for example you want a separate documents partition homedocuments PROGRAMS There are a bunch of programs that wont quite work as well on Linux as Windows but there are ways of making some work Others have great replacements First Ill say some really useful programs Lutris works with Wine to manage windows programs makes it easy to configure them and run them Most of the time Make sure your wine is Wine64 not Wine32 Thats easy to look up Steam obviously steam is the fucking best I want to note that most games that dont have Linux versions can still be played The website is great for checking what works well To run a nonlinux game go into the game configuration comparability settings and tick the enable comparability box This enables Proton which makes 90 of games run flawlessly Libre office Replacement for MS office Works great mostly KDE programs The people who make KDE make a ton of programs that are amazing Some are out of the box some you need to download Theyre all great Some are even extremely popular on windows like Krita Thunderbird the best email client out there better than Outlook even on Windows Made by Mozilla Gimp decent Photoshop alternative Photoshop is still king but actively breaks itself on Linux even with Wine every update Firefox just because fuck chrome TIPS Linux can seem pretty scary at first I promise you that its not though The terminal becomes your friend after a while but even now I run into things I dont know how to do mostly when trying to do something new or weird Most people will barely need to use it Google Everything If you dont understand something somebody else had a hard time already too The answer is out there Dont be afraid of Chat GPT Sometimes Google sucks Chat GPT is great at filtering complex weird niche questions and gets you an answer most of the time that Google doesnt work This is one of the few things that its genuinely good at Many people dont like to use snap or flatpak They suck for most things and many prefer to install everything from deb files if available However snaps and flatpaks bundle all dependencies and everything together so they wont break if something on your system changes Feel free to use them but they can get frustrating if you become more of a power user,miyvp04,1.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj2wjfy,rathlord,,2,2025-03-22 01:49:18,,,,dont use snap or flatpack Thats not great advice for noobs Unless youre really worried about disk space theyre generally fine and way less likely to randomly break something on your computer because of dependency snafus,mj0ebs6,2.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj3jc28,Maxerature,,1,2025-03-22 04:26:39,,,,I mean most users will just be installing things like Steam Firefox and other common nonpower user programs It is extremely unlikely that those are going to cause problems,mj2wjfy,3.0,1jgg6y1
comment,mj4hwz7,rathlord,,1,2025-03-22 10:24:41,,,,And for those things snaps or flatpaks will absolutely work fine as well except instead of being unlikely it wont cause a dependency meltdown its guaranteed To be clear I dont use either myself typically Im a normal package guy But for novices theres very little reason to warn people off them especially if youre preaching about Linux being easy to use,mj3jc28,4.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj6iy15,Maxerature,,1,2025-03-22 18:01:47,,,,The style of sandboxing they use as opposed to App images is still often pretty awful One of the most frustrating things is that flatpaks really dont like interacting with other programs which makes things like using keepassxc with flatpak Firefox impossible Flatpaks also have issues with update distribution compared to deb installs with multiple versions clogging up the filesystem,mj44dcl,3.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj47h6m,FrankMiner2949er,,1,2025-03-22 08:29:19,,,,The biggest stumbling block of Linux are the games that have anticheat software that buries itself deep within your operating system The thing is Im not keen on anything that alters my computer to that extent Im playing GTA Five at the moment but after I finish Im going to reload a snapshot of my operating system before I installed the game Im sticking with Windows until Steams Deckard goes on sale Once I dont need Windows 10 for my VR then Ill be leaving Microsoft behind And if any game doesnt install on my Linux station itll most likely be because of some sort of anticheat system didnt like its inability to compromise my computer and Im okay with not installing such a game,miz6hmg,2.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miywib2,badguy84,,35,2025-03-21 13:18:46,,,,Okay so headline Microsoft tells Windows 10 users to just trade in their PC for a newer one because how hard can it be My expectation there is some communication from Microsoft saying you should trade in your old PC for a new one that can run Windows 11 Im dubious and yes that shows my bias a little but Im curious whether its true or not Clicking the link I see a 310 word article XDA must have a 300 word minimum including a quote from Microsoft and some shilling at the end to deep link some additional helpful XDA articles I will count them though otherwise this writer wouldnt hit their 300 word count Now the quote where Microsoft tells people to trade in their Windows 10 machines for new ones that support Windows 11 Uhm XDA This seems to be a rather generic statement about recycling your old computer after buying a new one Or maybe doing a trade in for a discount of some sort Where does it say trade in their PC for a newer one XDA had me all excited to read about Microsoft sending people emails pretending like its easy to just swap your PC out for a newer one Alas with the context that this writer included themselves it seems much less interesting than the title made me think Honestly this is a tumblr post poorly disguised as tech news Do better XDA,,0.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj0fqvf,ThirdEyeClarity,,1,2025-03-21 17:52:46,,,,You can most likely still upgrade and it should still operate just fine Or you can do a clean install of Windows 10 or 11 IoT Enterprise LTSC which are supported longer and activate with MAS Flyby11 is a simple patcher that removes the annoying restrictions preventing you from installing Windows 11 24H2 on unsupported hardware Got an old PC No TPM Secure Boot or your processor isnt supported Flyby11 lets you install Windows 11 24H2 anyway Technical Note The POPCNT requirement cannot be bypassed it is essential for running Windows 11 24H2 as the operating system requires this feature to be supported by the CPU POPCNT has been included in CPUs since around 2010 However the patch is expected to work for most users with compatible hardware,miyvcnh,2.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miyxcyh,nate390,,4,2025-03-21 13:23:43,,,,The problem with this approach is that can be temporary Often the biannual feature updates fail to apply if you install Windows 11 this way so youll still end up behind one way or another unless you keep doing clean installs,miyw18t,3.0,1jgg6y1

comment,mj1115s,justin6point7,,1,2025-03-21 19:37:21,,,,Im wondering how many people are going to sell off perfectly good machines for cheap on marketplace because M told them the hardware is obsolete Someone with money and time could make a business buying up hardware and reselling them with a Linux distro that matches the user experience level Take it a step further and offer to import the Steam games that are compatible but also let them know which ones might not be which is more likely going to be because of video card specifications for than either Windows or Linux compatibility For what Microsoft said its worth its worth repurposing to make something awesome out of on the cheap MS is way out of touch with reality people arent going to want to replace good computers vendors arent going to accept outdated systems in a trade in unless it was for this very purpose and Im not suggesting scamming people with repurposed lemons but people will buy systems that will work for their specific needs and dont want the bloat and BS of MS Sure it might be a new learning curve but if the alternative is Windows 11 resistance to change is futile just pick something that works and doesnt cost extra I can think of a bunch of uses for dedicated computers for audio A guitarist could just want to record or use VST effects on the simple end but if the user wants to pay for software licenses you could set them up a whole digital audio workstation If theyre new to DAWs Reaper might be a good way to go though a lot of others are mostly compatible They all should be but 3rd party VST licensing activations are slightly problematic Most VST work as long as they are selfcontained and can use registration codes instead of authenticators Id be slightly worried about my licenses for software restricted to one device might need to deactivate licenses for Windows to reactivate them in Linux but Ill stop there because Ill end up getting too technical for a gadget thread turning the gadget into DAW Plenty of topics on that subject,,0.0,1jgg6y1

comment,miyw4kp,galvanized_penguin,,-6,2025-03-21 13:16:34,,,,Surely this is lawsuit territory They want you to take an inferior version of their product pay for new hardware because they dont want to fix the issue for slightly older machines accept copilot everywhere blindly take on downgrades of their services All with the minor threat of ceasing support for a more popular product that would leave many vulnerable at worst and maybe more peaceful at best Im already on windows 11 as I didnt have much of a choice last time out but 10 is superior by far 11 is just a better vehicle for them to shovel their horseshit down your throat,,0.0,1jgg6y1
