comment,mm7jlwr,locofspades,,5,2025-04-09 13:35:07,,,,ESkates usually have much bigger wheels so pebbles arent a death sentence anymore Source i have an eskate and i can survive big cracks even some potholes as long as you pop the front trucks You can even go offroad of course that tanks speed and battery,mm6mpe5,2.0,1jv0iop

comment,mm8ntpc,PacketAuditor,,7,2025-04-09 16:56:14,,,,Not on a skateboard The fastest Ive gone on a longboard is 30mph and I wouldnt want to go much faster than that Though this board looks like its designed to be easy to use at high speed,mm6uexv,1.0,1jv0iop
comment,mmaeyj0,SkiOrDie,,7,2025-04-09 22:05:33,,,,I used to longboard we always considered 30 to be the point where things start to get real At 3540 you might as well be going supersonic in terms of feel Im sure having brakes and that jazz helps a lot at speed but Ive never ridden anything motorized,mm8ntpc,2.0,1jv0iop

comment,mm7jznj,locofspades,,16,2025-04-09 13:37:15,,,,Most eskates have a controller and real brakes My eskate will do 30 mph but going down hills is 1000 safer when you can ride the brake and stay in control Speed wobbles can be fixed instantly with a little brake You would be surprised how much safer eskates are except the whole top speed part lol,mm7fkm5,2.0,1jv0iop
comment,mm8c2gm,981032061,,6,2025-04-09 15:58:24,,,,I think its important to make a distinction between inherently dangerous and not actively preventing you from doing something stupid Anyone whos ever spent an afternoon building bike jumps as a kid can tell you it takes exactly 0hp to hurt yourself at speed If youre the kind of person who hops on something and immediately pegs the throttle a 45mph electric skateboard may be bad for your health,mm7jznj,3.0,1jv0iop
comment,mm8x3p1,locofspades,,4,2025-04-09 17:40:07,,,,Bingo I had MANY days as a youth building and crashing off of ramps I was just stating that keeping control going downhill is so much safer on a board with remote controlled brakes lol i still have speed wobble nightmares 20 yrs after retiring from real skateboarding,mm8c2gm,4.0,1jv0iop
