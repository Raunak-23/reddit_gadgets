post,1jounzt,chrisdh79,"Some Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs are dying unexpectedly, mostly on Asrock motherboards | There are over 100 reported incidents",1205,2025-04-01 12:44:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1jounzt/some_ryzen_7_9800x3d_cpus_are_dying_unexpectedly/,121.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mkuiexa,chrisdh79,,166,2025-04-01 12:45:09,,,,From the article AMDs Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains an incredibly popular CPU especially among gamers But it seems not every buyer is having a good experience There have been over 100 cases of owners whose chips have died after working for a short amount of time and for no obvious reason Reddit user natty_overlord compiled a list of all 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died The chips passed POST and worked for varying amounts of time before dying with no signs of failure Whats interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on 98 of the cases or 82 happened on Asrock boards though that could be due to their popularity as a more budgetfriendly board maker Toms Hardware notes that the company released a new firmware update for AM5 motherboards in February that improved boot problems in AMD 9000 series CPUs Whether those issues are related to the dying chips is unclear,,0.0,1jounzt

comment,mkwayfj,xantec15,,98,2025-04-01 18:30:04,,,,98 of the cases or 82 Thats just lazy writing 98 is almost 91 of 108 but the article doesnt mention that there are 12 other non9800x3d CPUs involved for 120 total that they calculated the 82 from,mkuiexa,1.0,1jounzt
comment,mkzdqkg,VailonVon,,9,2025-04-02 05:56:06,,,,While it is lazy writing I think this is also a reading comprehension problem with how the article is written on the page You can even see it when its copied into reddit it says someone compiled a list of 108 reddit posts No where has it stated that is all of the cases Then it gos on to say in another place that 98 of the cases happened on specific boards The article doesnt really need to mention that the percentage isnt related to the 108 its clearly defined by not including them together Specially when they go on to say there are 16 5 and 1 other boards involved giving you the 120 total Edit I would actually argue more that the person that copied the article to reddit copied poorly more than the article having poor writing,mkwayfj,2.0,1jounzt
comment,mkzfzuv,xantec15,,3,2025-04-02 06:18:54,,,,I get your point But if the article wasnt so lazily and terribly written then the comprehension wouldnt be an issue They start out saying there are 108 cases of 9800x3d chips that have died followed by saying 98 of them or 82 occurred on ASROCK boards They directly link the 98 to the 108 with their wording Whats interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on There is then a break in the article with a tangentially related link After the break they then mention 22 other motherboards However no where in the article do they mention that there are any other CPU models involved So someone keeping count is now wondering how 108 dead CPUs are connected to 120 motherboards leading to further confusion The article would have had more value if they simply said 120 AMD processors have recently died 98 of them on ASROCK motherboards Here is a link to a Reddit post about it,mkzdqkg,3.0,1jounzt
comment,mkziduv,VailonVon,,0,2025-04-02 06:43:59,,,,Again this is why I agree its poorly written but its a reading comprehension problem Reddit user natty_overlord compiled a list of all 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died This right here is a complete statement full stop 108 reddit posts The article then goes on to talk about the cases in full then again goes on to talk about the reddit posts natty_overlord also tallied the cases based on chipset The largest number of incidents 49 occurred on X870 followed by B850 36 B650 16 and X670 7 At no point has the article ever suggested that it was only 108 cases total and has also clearly stated what it is talking about if you read it The problem you are having is you are taking what is written and including it with other parts of the article when it has clearly defined statements and spacing for you to not include them together The only issue is this The rest of the boards are made up of 16 from Asus 5 from MSI and 1 from Gigabyte Is placed weirdly due to website placing a link inbetween information that goes with the the percentage and the 98 cases Edit Im not even sure the person who wrote the article even intended for a link to be there spacing the last point apart from the percentage paragraph,mkzfzuv,4.0,1jounzt
comment,mkzlweh,MyGruffaloCrumble,,1,2025-04-02 07:22:04,,,,Even if it was 200 CPUs compare that with how many have been sold Im not saying there isnt a problem but thats a really low percentage of failure I remember the Cyrix days when half your software would crash your computer because they didnt do a great job of matching intels CPUs The shitty thing is this is an EXPENSIVE CPU and whos covering the warranty replacement on these when it fails Who is actually responsible or has the cojones to take responsibility Asrock wont buy you a new CPU thats for sure,mkwayfj,2.0,1jounzt

comment,mkwxbrn,Fredasa,,4,2025-04-01 20:24:42,,,,My brother bought an Asrock and learned about this phenomenon like three weeks ago There was a bios update allegedly intended to address it Its nice that people are keeping it in the news but this isnt really _new_ news I myself was choosing between an Asrock and a MSI and went with the latter primarily due to reports of coil whine with Asrock motherboards Which my brother has,mkuiexa,1.0,1jounzt

comment,ml05cuf,TheOriginalKrampus,,-4,2025-04-02 10:56:51,,,,When in doubt undervolt your CPU Ever since Ryzen 1000 theyve been pumping too many volts into these chips My old R5 2400G used to push sometimes 14v at stock on an Asrock ab350 I dont care what architecture that is 14v is way too high Then you have people with R5 3600s dying years later because stock settings were running too high So dont listen to AMD telling you that 95C is safe long term They clearly dont know shit Neither do these mobo manufacturers I feel like theres always one or two AIBs every generation who fuck up the voltage and blow up CPUs Intel has been having the same problem Arguably worse but the Ryzen 9000 series scandal is just the most recent one IMO if you get a new CPU AMD or Intel Take some time to learn how to undervolt that particular platform Whether its applying an offset in PBO some adaptive voltage sorcery for intel wtv Theres guides everywhere Try at the very least to maintain stock clocks at a lower voltage And invest in a good tower cooler Anything above 80C should be concerning,mkxuq6h,3.0,1jounzt
comment,mky3qmz,Poppyspy,,3,2025-04-02 00:24:10,,,,You cant trust some testimonials during early purchase periods because they commonly attempt to return CPU or GPU that doesnt OC to their expectations Usually based on stuff they see on social video that may or may not be completely true We already know some tubers get higher binned chips for reviews so its logical nobody should expect OCs as high as that Anything said on reddit is pure speculation and to be completely honest Ive built many systems and usually any issues are related to system board firmware anything else is pure consumer error with their own behavior causing issues Namely OCing RAM CPU GPU Parts in that order causing system instability and randomly blaming all parts as the cause to return,mkvggvq,2.0,1jounzt

comment,mkwycco,Fredasa,,8,2025-04-01 20:29:44,,,,If it were me Id be avoiding Asus for a litany of reasons that anyone else in these forums would be familiar with Id be avoiding Asrock because of coil whine and OPs topic Id think long and hard before buying Gigabyte and I wouldnt buy a brand I didnt even recognize like some of those Chinese sounding ones Asrock can be tempting because if you ignore any known issues with the brand they seem to offer the most features for the least money I was too picky for that and it means I probably dont have to worry about my motherboard killing the CPU I got an MSI Not the best value on the planet but really were only talking about a 1020 difference,mkwd81i,4.0,1jounzt

comment,mkwhuuh,1leggeddog,,13,2025-04-01 19:05:37,,,,I get that but at the same time the jump in price of AM5 motherboard was jarring Plus they only came out with the premium highend boards first It took a long time before B850 was available iirc x670 to b650 was like a few weeks but x870 to b850 was what almost 4 months,mkwg4d8,4.0,1jounzt

comment,mkyfkfl,NickCharlesYT,,8,2025-04-02 01:38:40,,,,Why Its literally built to a spec set by the manufacturer of the CPU and 99 of people dont need crazy overclocking capable boards to run their PC Its not like PSUs where the units arent paired and designed with the components they are built to power AMD and Intel have a lot of say in the tolerances of these boards A B series board has no less potential for reliability than an X series board either so spending more isnt necessarily going to get you a longer lifespan unless youre pushing the power delivery components to their limits which the vast majority of users arent I would also like to point out expensive ASRock boards exist too,mkwg4d8,4.0,1jounzt
comment,ml3i1ty,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-04-02 21:40:41,,,,ASRock has been widely considered one of the best mobo options arguably THE best for AMD CPUs over the past few years To the point where most of their boards have been selling out as quickly as they can make new ones,mkwg4d8,4.0,1jounzt

comment,ml0l2f2,satsumapen619,,2,2025-04-02 12:54:50,,,,Ive had zero issues with am4 or am5 All bioss in the early newer boards had issues like black screens and what not but got fixed very quick If you got an x870e board your an early adopter and they sort the kinks out Did the same when I got my first x670e took about 2 months and no issue after Nirmally tomahawk is there zero extra crap board and have less issues same as the pro gaming The higher end board like the carbon and up have issues at first Only takes a minute to update bios if need be my boards OC usability is amazing and I love it same as my am4 boards Only issue Ive had with the aorus master cards Is GCC not working correctly But normally a rollback works Im just saying what Ive had no problems with vs people with gigabyte boards thats sucks overpriced strix that do nothing different or better asrock except taichi In the systems Ive built theres been alot of issues but no where near with msi boards Everything will have things that miss QC unfortunately though or user errors where theyre mixing ram changed a setting and made it completely unstable but thats an every day thing,mkzv1jd,2.0,1jounzt
