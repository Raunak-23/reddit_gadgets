comment,n6dqdc9,Key-Web5678,,10,2025-08-01 17:03:53,,,,Ive seen this before and I have questions The implant is good for what Four doses So what happens when you run out Do you like get the old one removed and replaced Seems insanely invasive,,0.0,1mevjfj
comment,n6e1qyn,TheShryke,,8,2025-08-01 17:57:03,,,,I believe the idea is that this is just for an emergency situation not routine doses You would keep treating the condition normally but if something goes wrong this would kick in,n6dqdc9,1.0,1mevjfj
comment,n6e6095,Key-Web5678,,-1,2025-08-01 18:17:40,,,,That breeds another question then Glucagon has a shelf life Usually its a year So does that mean it has to be routinely replaced,n6e1qyn,2.0,1mevjfj
comment,n6e6b9c,Severe-Caregiver4641,,12,2025-08-01 18:19:09,,,,Read the article It says it would require yearly replacement and they are working on a multi dose reservoir As someone with seizures related to blood sugar this doesnt sound too invasive at all,n6e6095,3.0,1mevjfj

comment,n6hkvbz,other_usernames_gone,,1,2025-08-02 06:50:22,,,,Patenting something is super expensive Plus the expensive part isnt the idea Its doing the RD to make it real Normally medical patents arent for the idea itll be for some key part of it Eg in this case the patent would be for a small implantable oxygen sensor Insulin patents arent for insulin nowadays its for the specific method theyre using to produce it Although Im guessing you having patented the broad strokes would stop someone else innovating on it without your permission youd need to check with a patent attorney Youve got to designsource a low oxygen sensor small enough to be implanted Then design the rest of the system to use that sensor to decide when to deploy the narcan Then design a package for it that can be sterilised and implanted Then comes testing You have to get medical approval which means proving the device will never trigger for anything but an overdose what if someone is hiking up a mountain Will it trigger What if someone drowns Will it trigger and make the situation worse Is the dose right Can you fit the right dose in your device Is the right dose small enough to be implanted From an ethics side would a patient having one of these mean theyre more likely to overdose because they know the device will save them making them less cautious Then youve got to convince people to let this get implanted into them None of these problems are impossible to solve but theyre not cheap A non profit wouldnt be able to afford it The chaotic neutral method is to just publicly publish the idea which OP already has you cant patent an idea thats already public so noone else can patent it While you avoid the cost of a patent lawyer Although again they might just patent a key part of the more detailed design like I mentioned earlier Also maybe the idea is unpatentable because its now public knowledge youd need to check with a patent attorney,n6dm2kv,4.0,1mevjfj
