comment,ly9jh9e,missprincesscarolyn,,37,2024-11-21 16:20:57,,,,Theres absolutely no way monoclonal antibodies can survive the GI tract Pepsin and chymotrypsin along with bile alone will absolutely destroy them Source am Protein Biologist,,0.0,1gwh3lm
comment,lya1ghl,Gabenism,,10,2024-11-21 17:51:00,,,,Also minipumps have been a thing in bio labs forever With realtime telemetry data paired to them And humans can fit much bigger ones than mice and rats Also bioinspired as a single word hurts the same part of my brain as protein interactome and all the other new omes biologists keep coining,ly9jh9e,1.0,1gwh3lm
comment,lya2807,missprincesscarolyn,,2,2024-11-21 17:54:43,,,,Whats important is whats in the mini pump Mini pump and some injectable insulin is relatively stable at ambient temperatures although ideally it should be refrigerated Bigger proteins like antibodies are more finicky The monoclonal Im on has to be refrigerated Proteins are kind of like fussy children at times Most need very specific conditions to behave properly pH salt temperature Some are more flexible than others and some will precipitateaggregate if you look at them the wrong way Ugh,lya1ghl,2.0,1gwh3lm

comment,ly9oocl,missprincesscarolyn,,3,2024-11-21 16:47:42,,,,I take one every month Ofatumumab so independent of my scientific background I need it to work every month so that I dont end up even more disabled than I already am I get that injections suck but theyre just a part of taking a certain medication If anything Im glad that you can do it at home And that for now I only have to give myself an injection every 30 days In 6 months or so Ill have to do every other day injections of a small peptide glatiramer acetate for 9 months Again I wouldnt want that to be destroyed by my digestive system either,ly9nzoc,2.0,1gwh3lm
comment,ly9xcaz,seahorse_party,,4,2024-11-21 17:30:55,,,,I just switched to Cosentyx infusions from Rinvoq oral for psoriatic arthritissppndylitis This is biologic 9 so Ive been on injections of some sort for 12 years I think until switching to Rinvoq last year Were hoping the infusion delivery method is more effective than both the oral Rinvoq and the subq version of Cosentyx which Ive already been on Its worked the best out of all of the meds it just wore off too soon its newly available as an infusion so thats why Im trying it again I will gladly drag myself to The Cancer Center every month for an IV if I get my life back I would do it once a week if I could feel 50 of my preillness normal Whatever works,ly9oocl,3.0,1gwh3lm

comment,lya1fxp,missprincesscarolyn,,1,2024-11-21 17:50:56,,,,Im sorry youre dealing with PA These autoimmune diseases suck so much I wouldnt wish them on my worst enemy I have MS Maybe the infusion version of the antibody Im on is a better method for controlling my disease activity Ocrevus can be given as an infusion or now a 10 minute injection Theres also Briumvi which again is the same antibody but with slight modifications glycosylation to prevent it from triggering allergic reactions Right now Im on Kesimpta the once a month injection So far the injectable form isnot so effective At least it wasnt after my first three loading doses and I ended up in the hospital for a week My neurologist told me to stay the course and check in at 6 months which reminds meI need to schedule my MRI I hope youre having a relatively low symptom day At least the weekends around the corner,ly9xcaz,4.0,1gwh3lm

comment,lyajfct,GuerrillaRodeo,,2,2024-11-21 19:20:20,,,,Just today I saw a patient who complained about the number of tablets she had to take every day more than 20 I mean its relatable I would probably lose track too but asking that of an 80something year old patient Damn near impossible In the medical community it is well known that therapy adherence and the number of medications one has to take are practically inversely correlated Weve long diddled with depot medication and the likes but this might be a game changer taking your platelet aggregation inhibitors after a myocardial infarction is standard practice but people ever so often forget about it especially if theres more medications involved and with heart attacks there most definitely are Plus you dont know if patients are telling the truth about their therapy adherence who knows if they take their meds 100 of the time or just 60 The diabetes patients with the best HbA1c longterm blood sugar lab value I care for are either insanely disciplined or use closedloop systems blood sugar sensors that directly communicate with their insulin pumps effectively emulating the pancreas This approach has huge potential,,0.0,1gwh3lm
comment,lyb3i02,missprincesscarolyn,,2,2024-11-21 21:02:09,,,,This is definitely true My mother is 70 and supposed to be taking at least 5 different medications a day At different points it was more than that Shes never taken them as prescribed and has become more and more disabled as a result particularly with her MS treatments over the years once she finally agreed to start taking them Combine stubbornness with cognitive decline and you have the perfect recipe for noncompliance and worse outcomes for patients longterm especially as you said the ones who really need those medications in the first place Unfortunately I also have MS and a few other chronic health conditions I use alarms reminders calendars and pill organizers I take 4 different oral medications 6 pills a day and then the monthly injection Technology can make it easier but only if the patient is committed to it Thank you for what you do Im tremendously appreciative for all of the doctors who have helped me Its clear you care about your patients,lyajfct,1.0,1gwh3lm

comment,ly9wda6,TheTompten,,4,2024-11-21 17:26:03,,,,Keep an eye on this Ive been diabetic since childhood and every couple of years a projected advancement like this is brought up in tech or medical magazines It never makes it to market and is usually bought by a large company and hidden away Its always better for business when you have to buy more products at regular intervals than a one time solution or cure,,0.0,1gwh3lm
