comment,lv7hrz1,icedcoffeeheadass,,9,2024-11-03 17:23:21,,,,1500 is about 1000 too high for a product that is still in novelty status No one needs one when most consumers dont even need a laptop anymore The average American consumer can survive with an iPad and printing at work Its good to move towards this direction Less waste,lv6s58a,2.0,1gin7az

comment,lvbbvw9,KazzieMono,,1,2024-11-04 07:20:35,,,,Seriously A valve index is 600 A full set controllers base stations and the headset itself is 1000 Why in any mother of god would I spend more than that Hell a fucking oculus is 300 You seriously cannot get cheaper than that Apple overestimated their value and completely misjudged their competition,lv6s58a,2.0,1gin7az
comment,lv77iix,Shapes_in_Clouds,,8,2024-11-03 16:32:32,,,,The problem even at 1500 is device fatigue People have phones laptops tablets TVs they all cost roughly 1k1500 or much less for budget versions Not only does this eat up money but it eats up time People have only so much free time in a day and while VRAR can offer very novel and interesting experiences it has become harder and harder for people to justify yet another device in their lives with so much already competing for their attention While an argument can be made that headsets can replace some of these devices I dont think its so simple because being a wearable is a huge shift in how one uses the device Sure I can run iPad apps on a VP but Id rather just use my iPad I really enjoy VR and theres certain games and apps that totally sucked me in But at the same time Ive just kind of fallen off of it because there are honestly too many other things to do and right now the VRAR space doesnt get a lot of investment,lv6iwlx,1.0,1gin7az
comment,lv6ptqs,SilverCarbon,,4,2024-11-03 14:59:54,,,,I agree unless Apple comes up with a usecase where you put it on at least once a week and preferably more often otherwise it wont sell beyond a small batch of fans who are limited by budget Others will spend their money on other Apple products on which they glance dozens of times a day like the phone and watch,lv6iwlx,1.0,1gin7az

comment,lv7wxde,SilverCarbon,,0,2024-11-03 18:37:54,,,,I agree with you Actually Tim Cooks vision was a kind of AR glasses like the Google Glass from 2012 but the tech isnt there yet So a plan B was developed but Eyesight on the outer display doesnt really solve the problem of the closed environment Nobody even talks about it anymore except that it looks goofy Thats why I also think a cheaper price or light version isnt going to move the needle I would also give it five years or more for innovation and improvement Meta Orion seems the way to go but thats even more expensive and not yet ready for mass production,lv6ymud,3.0,1gin7az

comment,lv7o38e,CarpeMofo,,1,2024-11-03 17:54:52,,,,Youre missing a big part of justifying the cost of getting a new phone You can sell your old phone back to your carrier I bought my initial iPhone 13 Pro Max outright for 1200 Then when it was time for me to upgrade I sent my old phone back and they gave me a thousand dollars for it so my 15 Pro Max only cost 200 bucks Ill probably do the same when the 17 comes out as well 200 bucks every 2 generations to keep my phone updated is a very good deal,lv6iwlx,1.0,1gin7az
comment,lv97ve0,EfficientAccident418,,1,2024-11-03 22:38:33,,,,The sweet spot for pricing is under 1000 The Vision Pro is way over because its overengineered with no real focus It makes me think of the solidgold Apple Watch Edition ok cool but what the fuck for All the bells and whistles on AVP especially the digital screen on the front that creates a simulacrum of your eyes are just silly,lv6iwlx,1.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6keql,MisterEinc,,25,2024-11-03 14:29:29,,,,Plus it has basically no software It looks like Apple chose Unity as a software partner probably early in development when they were closer in parity to Epics Unreal But Fortnite basically allowed Epic to throw a ridiculous amount of resources into development and have left Unity in the dust Not to mention the whole licensing snafu So AVP has sort of been DOA because theres just not a lot going on in the app store,lv6f1t2,2.0,1gin7az
comment,lv6rhhn,Brico16,,14,2024-11-03 15:09:00,,,,Yeah its this exactly There was no killer app that truly drove the value proposition home The hardware is awesome but none of the software takes advantage of that awesomeness For example the killer Quest app was and largely still is beat saber Super accessible simple to understand a high skill ceiling for those that want a challenge and took advantage of most of the innovation in the hardware Apple needed something similar and didnt deliver Its pretty much an expensive desktop monitor that you wear on your face,lv6keql,3.0,1gin7az
comment,lv6wg5i,aykay55,,10,2024-11-03 15:35:32,,,,They also didnt open up the device to developers pretty much at all requiring them to have the 100 membership and then special order a 300 developer strap to actually interface with the damn thing Because there was seemingly no way to use VR controllers with the headset it pretty much leaves it out from any WebVR shenanigans So now you have a device that cant access most existing content has no active development by its own creators and doesnt know if its a device for business productivity personal pleasure or gaming The only people whove benefited from buying it are those who didnt spend that money on a large TV instead,lv6rhhn,4.0,1gin7az
comment,lv77rs5,FinndBors,,5,2024-11-03 16:33:51,,,,Judging from a few years back when I was doing this Unity is an easier development environment but unreal has better performance visual quality Especially startup performance which is pretty key for some experiences,lv6keql,3.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6gdms,IamAkevinJames,,9,2024-11-03 14:05:28,,,,For sure which is why I was wondering It was wasnt a bad product it seemed to be undercooked in some regards like the head straps Apple does seem to be out of touch and expects that the whales will come out of the woodwork everytime,lv6f1t2,2.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6p3yu,SilverCarbon,,2,2024-11-03 14:55:58,,,,Even at a lower price it still has to have continued use Enthusiasts mostly dropped the Pro after a few weeks they should focus on making people pick it up more often but Apple hasnt found anything yet Unless youre that rare frequent flyer who insists on putting it on for longer flights,lv6f1t2,2.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6j4ve,salsation,,4,2024-11-03 14:21:57,,,,Bleeding edge halo products are like that The price is the bleeding part Some people with money to burn like to try the newest new thing and for them its a successful tech preview If you set aside price the biggest issues are weight size and lack of 3rd party software And that battery yeesh In terms of the OS I think it makes the Meta effort look like garbage,lv6eoas,1.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6kejt,jzr171,,20,2024-11-03 14:29:27,,,,It wont be relevant by then Theyre hardly relevant now Theres plenty of companies that could make one now but they dont Microsoft discontinued theirs Samsung said they might make one just to undercut Apples price Meta is 90 there and could obliterate Apple with a 500 unit No one else seems to care ARVR is a very niche market and I dont see it going anywhere until its the size of sunglasses And even then people seem creeped out by the idea with the couple that have been glasses sized already They were immediately used for bad things and the reputation has been ruined,,0.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6wvrm,aykay55,,2,2024-11-03 15:37:45,,,,I mostly agree with you but I think that the creative population has yet to really get their hands on the tech I think that artists are currently really afraid of touching VR due to the complexity but they havent seen how much easier its become,lv6kejt,1.0,1gin7az

comment,lvb6sj3,Asking4Afren,,2,2024-11-04 06:26:43,,,,Its honestly the most mind blowing thing Ive tried the demo I havent tried the quest 3 yet to compare though so Ill reserve my thoughts on if apple is really setting their prices far beyond what it should be maybe someone here can answer this for me Also imo dropping 25004k for one isnt the issue really Its that theres literally no support for this device For someone like myself that WANTS it really really bad and do have the extra cash laying around for something like this my drawback is the support Id use it for sports and watching movies Quest has xstadium from what Ive seen and has roughly 50 immersive games for nba Why would I go to apple if they dont even have that yet Ive seen it in the demo but its not out Once prices start to get between 15002000 I might just bite but by then itll be too late I might have a quest 3 or 4 and Ill wait for the next edition of avp One reason Im holding back from the quest is Im hearing the visual quality is better and touch gestures on the avp Im also entirely in the apple ecosystem,,0.0,1gin7az

comment,lv6nsev,dylan_1992,,13,2024-11-03 14:48:39,,,,That is indeed NOT what customers want We used to have plastic phones that wouldnt break when dropped then people gobbled up iPhones and ran those companies out of the market A famous story during iPhone development was the decision to use a plastic vs glass screen Engineers wanted plastic because it wouldnt shatter Jobs made the argument that glass had far superior user experience and felt more premium and plastic was more prone to scratches Jobs said if a user puts their iPhone in their pocket and it get scratched up by their keys theyll blame the phone But if they drop and shatter it theyll blame themselves Jobs was right Customers prefer the glass with a better feel with the trade off that accidents happen,lv6f522,1.0,1gin7az
