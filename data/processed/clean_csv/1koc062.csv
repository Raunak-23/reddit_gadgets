comment,msqnvxg,GoodAsUsual,,175,2025-05-17 03:42:27,,,,It seems like a product without a viable market ie a solution without a problem,msqk336,2.0,1koc062
comment,msroipr,JagsAbroad,,54,2025-05-17 09:34:26,,,,Nah Id absolutely get one if it was more affordable I love the idea of using one on a plane or the AR features One use case Id do is if it was comfortable enough Id use it while cookingbaking I love the idea of having a timer floating to my left and the recipe open on the right while recording the whole thing POV Im constantly glancing at my iPad while moving it around so it doesnt get damaged,msqnvxg,3.0,1koc062
comment,mst7dp6,Akrevics,,14,2025-05-17 15:59:45,,,,Id watch movies on it all day just not for 3500 I dont even care if its not in 4k watching movies even in 2k for about 1500 whatever for a more plastic one would be more worth it,msroipr,4.0,1koc062

comment,mst8jnj,Tibbaryllis2,,7,2025-05-17 16:06:05,,,,Nah Id absolutely get one if it was more affordable I love the idea of using one on a plane or the AR features Thats kind of the point uGoodAsUsual is making though right There isnt really a market for bakerschefs using a multithousand dollar headset as a convenient timer Now if it was priced in the 5001000 range maybe there is more of a market amongst tradespeople But even then it would need a major redesign to incorporate features and materials that make it appropriate for that application Like uerfivor said its probably something not intended to be used around steam splattering oil the heat blasting out the open oven door etc,msroipr,4.0,1koc062
comment,mssild0,Erfivur,,26,2025-05-17 13:40:28,,,,I just wouldnt want a device like that with screens and cameras around steam and saucesoils It sounds like a great idea but practically I think the ends up being unhygienic,msroipr,4.0,1koc062

comment,msread6,Vietzomb,,22,2025-05-17 07:44:06,,,,5000 is a lot of money period But as more an accessory Just not going to cut it Sure if someone had the spare cash and buying something like this as an alternative to a computer were not even really there yet may be different My grandparents paid more than that for their first Mac and Printer in the 80s if memory serves correct But again they were among a small percentage of people who could afford to buy something like that,msr925j,4.0,1koc062
comment,msrnfzx,mcAlt009,,23,2025-05-17 09:22:38,,,,If it was a full Mac that I could develop with and my company paid for it AND it made me 50 more productive it would be a great investment Its not Its a heavy fragile device Most programmers at least a purality wear glasses That means I have to buy inserts or something Whatever Gets hot Battery is bad The Quest 3s does 90 of what it can for 300 At 300 I dont care if I end up putting it in a closet,msread6,5.0,1koc062

comment,msxekxr,mok000,,1,2025-05-18 09:08:59,,,,This comment probably doesnt belong here but the device really ought not rely on a screen in front of your eyes but rather draw the image directly onto your retina with lasers or something Then it would be able to correct for whatever it is the glasses correct The main problem with the device however is not how it works but that you feel and look like an idiot wearing it on your face,mssp3x9,7.0,1koc062

comment,mswavq6,eyeronik1,,1,2025-05-18 03:00:46,,,,The tech just isnt there yet Doing real work on the Quest 3 is impossible because the resolution is too low to read text and the price and fragility of the Vision Pro makes it a non starter Well get there in a few years,msrnfzx,6.0,1koc062

comment,msrqdpd,ProfessorFunky,,1,2025-05-17 09:54:21,,,,I dont know I think its more no viable market at that price point If it was 500 and I could do productivity stuff hooked to my Mac on it Id be all over it Or MacBook prices and with similar performance as a standalone thing My feel is that theyre aiming to replace the iPhone with it and I just dont see how it will ever do that,msqnvxg,3.0,1koc062

comment,mstlwbc,PrimeIntellect,,1,2025-05-17 17:17:58,,,,I dont know almost anyone who has or uses VR at all Theres one guy at my work who had it for a bit and we all tried it once to play some games and it was quickly forgotten While it was on my head it was pretty wild but also it seems like an even more soul sucking screen experience which most people want to do less of Like the last thing I want is more invasive digital things stealing my time,msqnvxg,3.0,1koc062

comment,mst7xu6,Intarhorn,,1,2025-05-17 16:02:47,,,,I think it could be very good for productivity Being able to move notes and files around the room and quickly get what you need without having to use a mouse or a touch screen might be a bigger improvement then most expect Also gives a lot more flexibility and ability to be creative I think Its just not worth that money tho it would have to be half that and probably even a bit more for it to actually be worth it for most people,msqk336,2.0,1koc062
comment,mst9fse,Albert_Caboose,,1,2025-05-17 16:10:51,,,,Yeah when it comes to virtual workstations the Quest 3 does a pretty great job of it for 20 the cost,mst7xu6,3.0,1koc062

comment,mt2x1xd,Rymanjan,,1,2025-05-19 06:24:03,,,,I got a quest pro and while I dont necessarily regret it I def dont use it nearly as much as I should to justify the pricetag Ill go on binges for a couple days where I remember its cool as shit then just stop using it cuz I get nauseous or tired and then dont pick it up for a few months,msqk336,2.0,1koc062
comment,msrcvu7,DontMindMeTrolling,,0,2025-05-17 07:29:26,,,,No thats way too expensive to manage Think about how they do it now You get 3D glasses a cheap pair at the start of the ride and drop them all in a bin after There are kids of all ages adults geriatrics to give them all a pair of 3500 equipment explain to them how it works hook it up for them none of it is economical,msqk336,2.0,1koc062
comment,mssiasf,Nesaru,,9,2025-05-17 13:38:36,,,,Disney used to have a ride at Disney Quest where you sat on this bicycle seat thing put on a vr headset and flew the magic carpet through Agrabah to help Aladdin defeat Jaffar All controlled by you leaning on the platform and looking around It was pure magic at the time Im sure it cost way more than 3500 each The Harry Potter store in NYC also had a broom flying experience that was the same deal Except you also had a wand that was motion tracked and you flew around fighting death eaters Theres certainly a space for this and I expect well see more of it Its just not what Apple intended with the Vision Pro,msrcvu7,3.0,1koc062
comment,mssj41r,DontMindMeTrolling,,-4,2025-05-17 13:43:43,,,,Bro youre talking about a one person experience we are speaking about scale and youre sure it cost more Im sure it costs money are you sure of anything else,mssiasf,4.0,1koc062
comment,mssji12,Nesaru,,4,2025-05-17 13:46:10,,,,One person This was a RIDE at DISNEY yes its a personal experience but thousands of people went through that line and rode that ride each day And yes even the simplest ride in Disney world costs more than 35k a seat And VR technology in the early 2000s was not a household expense Im sure about that,mssj41r,5.0,1koc062
comment,msrvdky,brianbamzez,,3,2025-05-17 10:45:08,,,,Well it cant be too expensive since a lot of these rides exist Europapark alone has a handful of them where people ride a conventional rollercoaster wearing 3d goggles cheaper ones though for sure no 35k apple goggle many of them are older kids rides too One of the rides one of their older hallmark rides is it Eurosat even has a virtual reality waiting lineentrance area where you walk from the entrance to the coaster wearing the goggles while walking through an intro action scene and even seeing the other passengers in VR You dont have to explain a whole lot about how it works since all you have to do is put it over your face and maybe tighten the straps a bit You dont have to hook anything up The goggles are collected by staff and disinfected after So this is very much doable,msrcvu7,3.0,1koc062
comment,mssc9nz,DontMindMeTrolling,,-3,2025-05-17 12:58:57,,,,Bro your own comment you started w saying it exists w cheaper versions ie this will never happen aka my point aka your reply is pointless af thanks for proving my point,msrvdky,4.0,1koc062

comment,mstrjmx,HaMMeReD,,7,2025-05-17 17:47:20,,,,Ie Doesnt need controllers is a really nice way to put it I think you meant to say Doesnt support controllers That first experience of Im in VR was good on a Rift DK1 and the resolution was shit the lenses were trash Things like better optics panel technology resolution are incremental nice to haves that improve across all products over time But the industry was well formed before apple came to market They knew what developers liked what customers liked and they were like naw future of computing and came out with this totally dystopian product like daddy is going to wear this at his 3yos birthday to get the 3d recording so he can replay it on loop when hes in elder care Apple is like the narcissist of all companies they are trying to reinvent the wheel just so they can be the revolutionaries and founders of the tech But better screens dont make you the inventor of VR,mssls24,4.0,1koc062

comment,mt1zgzx,Animanganime,,1,2025-05-19 01:59:33,,,,But it is though if youre into VR I have used Pimax Crystal Light Quest 1 2 3 and Pro PSVR2 Bigscreen Beyond and HP reverb G2 There are some headset like the meganex or bsb2 that is not out yet or the pimax dream air that is also not out yet that have somewhat comparable resolution and panel BUT theyre all wired to the PC,mt1l8tg,5.0,1koc062
comment,mt9equh,malachi347,,1,2025-05-20 07:54:47,,,,The dream air isnt wired no And Apple Vision doesnt have classleading FoV either so its not a gold standard If were talking VR for gaming that spec loading is even more subjective as its personal preference at the end of the day anyways if youre into sim racing or flight or space games wires are the last thing you car about anyways since youre seated and would rather have comfort and external GPU support,mt1zgzx,6.0,1koc062
comment,mtapl43,Animanganime,,1,2025-05-20 14:02:45,,,,It is wired And I was replying to 3000 of the 3500 is apple tax and other companies have comparable products for much less which are both factually wrong It is definitely not perfect but to say its cheap to build is just not true,mt9equh,7.0,1koc062

comment,msvicgv,Topikk,,1,2025-05-17 23:46:35,,,,The Quest 3 also can be used to play real games because it knows what it is and includes game controllers The Vision Pro thinks its a productivity tool but its just a bad game console,msqwfsw,2.0,1koc062
comment,mswbna6,Festering-Fecal,,1,2025-05-18 03:06:20,,,,All those headsets are a gimmick and it gets old fast for most people The tech is cool and all but once you are out of honeymoon phase its a 1 trick pony I think augmented reality is more realistic if they can get it into a pair of glasses that dont look cartoonish Imagine going shopping and looking at a food item and it pops up whats in it and if its healthy or not Imagine looking at something like a bottle of alcohol and it pops up whats in it and a warning because its posion Or having a heads up display for things The tech is there its just not at that stage were its cheap enough for the consumer,msqwfsw,2.0,1koc062
comment,mss9yjq,themanfromvulcan,,5,2025-05-17 12:43:06,,,,Everything Ive heard about it is that its so cutting edge it does live up to the hype However you have to be okay with the cutting edge price tag I think Apple sometimes is dammed if they do and damned if they dont They wanted to make the best VR set money could buy that wasnt say 20k I think they did this And in a few years they will come out with a cheaper version People have buyers remorse all the time for all kinds of things Im not quite sure if this is a news story just seems to be clickbait to me,mspr0pm,1.0,1koc062
comment,msqxsd1,cerberus698,,13,2025-05-17 05:03:42,,,,Ive been saying this about most gadgets like this including VR for gaming There will always be an enthusiast niche for stuff like this but for so long as wearables are perceived as equipment having to be anchored to their body it will remain something in the domain of niche interest Very few people want to strap a VR head set to their body to play video games despite how interesting the technology may be Similarly very few people want to strap a head set to their body to preform functions that their phone can do in a less impressive but more efficient manner I remember back in the early 2000s tech reporters were talking a lot about how in the future video calls would replace phone calls Instead texts largely replaced phone conversations and Id imagine the average person who doesnt regularly video call for work has one maybe once a year In the end people will adopt the technology that lets them preform the desired basic function with as little complexity as possible Most wearables only add complexity and abstract the basic function behind layers of additional interface This kind of technology in my opinion wont breakthrough to mainstream until its refined down into a package that is indistinguishable from a pair of sun glasses and has an interface that is at least as simple and undisruptive as a phone screen Until then it might be cool to watch a movie on something like this but most people are still going to prefer the firestick remote UI on their TV,mspr0pm,1.0,1koc062
comment,mss9ujc,TheOtherMeInMe2,,12,2025-05-17 12:42:18,,,,Im inclined to disagree with one point you made Video calls are absolutely used far more commonly these days than regular phone calls even mostly among the younger crowd Teenagers and very young adults do it all the time I think its a generational thing but if the trend continues moving forward you will almost certainly see a time in another 20 years where people default to video calls for real conversations relying on text for the more basic shit,msqxsd1,2.0,1koc062
comment,mssgrtu,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-05-17 13:28:50,,,,you will almost certainly see a time in another 20 years where people default to video calls for real conversations relying on text for the more basic shit I would be surprised if they have much existence by then instead replaced by calls in VRAR,mss9ujc,3.0,1koc062
comment,msup5v0,TheOtherMeInMe2,,2,2025-05-17 20:53:30,,,,Ah but thats the main point rolling around in this thread Will VRAR ever become so simple intuitive and economical for the average person that that can be the norm The tech for video calls is already in place and has been adopted by most whether they use it or not VRAR is still an expensive and niche thing that has a ways to go yet before as many people would even have the option Plushow would that even work Like literally speaking how do i talk to someone in VRAR without a whole ass hardware setup and digital environment to load in to,mssgrtu,4.0,1koc062
comment,msuqznm,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-05-17 21:03:39,,,,In 20 years I think were talking a normal pair of glasses that effectively reads your mind for controlling the interface via an EMG wristband and eyetracking Not technically mind reading but it would feel like it I expect that would be simpler than any phone If you want to talk to someone in AR youd just call them and theyd appear as a hologram in your real room For VR youd probably open a portal in your room that takes you to a shared virtual environment,msup5v0,5.0,1koc062
comment,mssw0uk,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-05-17 14:58:31,,,,Honestly I dont think even sunglasses type displays would make VR mainstream You couldnt even convince people to wear cheap light glasses for 3D movies TV I think nothing short of either holodeck or matrix jacking would gain a critical mass Of course both those things aint happening,msqxsd1,2.0,1koc062

comment,mstkd46,HaMMeReD,,1,2025-05-17 17:09:47,,,,Did you have a lot of VR experience before hand I also tried it in the store and it definitely had its strong pros But it also had strong cons Ie the puck the fact that usage was basically designed to minimize interaction sit and pinch is boring and I do not like eye tracking much and the fact that after I clicked around for 3 minutes or so I was pretty much done with nothing interesting Seeing things like ipadiphone games actually was kind of a negative Like its a really good feature but it feels very underwhelming like this is gaming on this thing Like I wont lie The writing on the wall was very obvious The barrier to entry was super high a lot of VR devs dont use mac in their development pipeline They arent going to spend 10kseat on macs and vision pros to port their titles to a platform that is demanding hey hand tracking only Edit If apple gets the next one down to 1500 well probably see more adoption They are going to have to drop a lot of that expensive crap and bad decisions though Ie no puck dumb external displays use some fucking plastic sorry metal and glass is shit design choice for a headset and incorporate motion controllers as an option VR gaming is better with something in your hand Apple really forgets that corething they deliver is technology and they waste time on cnc braided straps or milled titanium Just give me a VR headset that looks like a OG imac Im probably using the thing when Im home alone why does it need to look that good and youll always look dumb with a VR headset on making it titanium or whatever they use I dont care doesnt make it less dorky,mspr0pm,1.0,1koc062
comment,msttkxb,coltonmusic15,,1,2025-05-17 17:58:07,,,,I had an idea today about developing an app that realtors can purchase that would allow open house walkers to load their own furniture and images into a catalogue prior to walking homes and then put on the Apple vision goggles to walk through an open house and basically see it as if all their personal belongings were already setup in the home Just seems like people would be more apt to making a purchase of a lifetime if they could envision themselves in the space Im sure now someone will use AI to make the app and make that sweet sweet founder Remember me well,mspr0pm,1.0,1koc062

comment,mswup1e,BrainKatana,,13,2025-05-18 05:44:47,,,,Applications or lack thereof are the third biggest problem with HMDs right now The first two are ergonomics and socialization in that order An incredible app is irrelevant if using it is uncomfortable and I have to completely shut out the outside world to do so It has to be as lightweight as a pair of standard eyeglasses with a battery that lasts all day before it achieves the same amount of ubiquity as our phones,msqnuou,1.0,1koc062
comment,msz3y2m,LessonStudio,,3,2025-05-18 16:17:48,,,,100 agree Weight is the killer feature in that it is killing their widespread adoption But I would suggest that they dont have to get to a normal pair of glasses to get the adoption notably up Personally I would be OK with a slightly fat pair of glasses with a batterycomputer sitting on my neckshoulders I suspect they could do this right now If they gutted my present headset of its computer and battery and then went carbon fiber and maybe ultralight lenses that they could reduce the weight of the existing oculus 3 by 60 or more A this weight I would seriously consider replacing my monitor Especially for travel Ideally it gets down to a pair of glasses at some point in the future,mswup1e,2.0,1koc062
comment,msztnb1,BrainKatana,,1,2025-05-18 18:31:36,,,,I feel like if it was as simple as move the weight elsewhere then it would be tackled by now or at the very least there would be videos of people doing hardware mods on their Quests My guess is latency General bulk object center of gravity and overall weight also factor in Ive done some of the commercial stuff like The Void and they get by with a computer in a backpack but the visors are still rather heavy so I assume theres still quite a bit of hardware in the HMDs,msz3y2m,3.0,1koc062

comment,msy08ie,SoulNuva,,1,2025-05-18 12:27:58,,,,When I was studying and took a course for developing gamesapps in VR motion sickness was an issue that was brought up There were solutions to lessen the impact such as tunneling the users vision but ultimately its a biological issue that stems from our brain perceiving motion when our body is not Some ways developers got around this issue was by allowing users to point and click places to teleport to and I personally found that to be the most elegant solution that felt organic But of course this has its own limitations especially in action games Its been at least 5 years since Ive taken the course so I have no idea if theres been any advancements in this area I suspect that they have founds more ways to mitigate the issues as I see more VR games allowing users to walk around game maps But Im not sure if its because of improvements or devs just not being aware of the motion sickness problem,msw9y9t,2.0,1koc062

comment,mswnykb,LessonStudio,,1,2025-05-18 04:43:51,,,,Heres a tiny hint of where I suspect really lightweight ones would be killer I wear reading glasses I need them for things within about 4 feet After that I have very good vision This is a pain in the bottom as I have to put my glasses on and off when I am using them and lifting them to work on my monitor But I can read my monitor just fine with them on and see in the distance with them Except for the weird wobbly static thing they are quite good at AR this way Im not saying they are good enough but that it is cool to have perfect vision when they are on As for physical limitations Keep in mind the best ARVR hardware in 2025 will be yard sale junk in 2030 But with AR I can see some super useless stuff some very controversial stuff and some fantastic stuff Once AR can get past adding labels to stuff it will be the next big thing That said labelling things will be pretty cool too,mswi3ie,2.0,1koc062

comment,msp8gpl,AwesomePossum_1,,26,2025-05-16 22:02:46,,,,Mightve been the case 5 years ago but not today My PSVR2 saw me play Horizon COTM Metro Behemoth Alien RE48 GT7 this one is like 20 hours by itself All in all like 40 hours of entertainment at minimum and thats just the AAA games My quest 3 has seen lighter usage but I still enjoyed Batman Arkham Shadow Moss pcvr titles like HL Alyx and that space one forgot the name uhh vr videos Enough content for at least like 50 use sessions a year Aside from porn NONE of these madeforVR experiences are available on Vision Pro Not even pcvr games at this moment due to lack of a controller How does the 10x more expensive device have 10x fewer experiences No wonder people abandon it after using it 4 times,msp1zpl,1.0,1koc062
comment,mspa32x,stjohns_jester,,13,2025-05-16 22:12:08,,,,The motion sickness really stopped my using it I still see in all the VR subs that it is better but not fixed And the strapping a a thing to my face as opposed to just picking up a controller I like kind of flopping into the couch instead of moving my coffee table around and standing But it is cool to see it progress no matter where it ends up I would rent one if that were still a thing every now and again to see the changes,msp8gpl,2.0,1koc062

comment,mspbtjl,AwesomePossum_1,,-11,2025-05-16 22:22:19,,,,Its not getting better nor will it in the future Theres not much engineers can do to rewire your brain to not get sick when you see yourself moving with your eyes but your body isnt feeling the movement You can only get less sick if you just spend more time in vr Its like kids getting sick in cars Everyone gets over it with time In the same way EVERYONE feels sick in vr a first I recommend start playing simpler vr games like moss where you do not move in a space Eventually transition to a game with teleportation mechanics like HL Alyx or Horizon COTM Then you can move on to full motion Youre not special everyone has to go through this As for comfort dude youre literally stepping INSIDE the world of a video game playing INSIDE the game BEING the character yourself How cool is that Instead of watching it through your little tv hole using a controller to control a character Just remind yourself how amazing it is Certainly cool enough to play vr once a week as a special occasion sort of thing,mspa32x,3.0,1koc062
comment,msposff,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-05-16 23:51:25,,,,Theres not much engineers can do to rewire your brain to not get sick when you see yourself moving with your eyes but your body isnt feeling the movement Theres actually a lot that can be done to mitigate sickness with future advances Its unknown if you can fully solve motion sickness which is tied to movement but you can reduce it and eliminate virtual reality sickness which is the more general form of nausea caused by optical and latency limitations,mspbtjl,4.0,1koc062
comment,msred07,Kina_Kai,,3,2025-05-17 07:44:52,,,,Improvements can and will offset some of it but attempting to lie to your sensory input detectors is always going to have tradeoffs that vary from person to person Just like how some people are more aware of the flickering of CFLs and it gives them a headache There is almost certainly always going to be a significant percentage of the population that cannot use these for a meaningful duration without very uncomfortable side effects,msposff,5.0,1koc062
comment,mspujlp,AwesomePossum_1,,2,2025-05-17 00:27:33,,,,How What has been a single hardware improvement to reduce motion sickness in vr You can only hide it with vignette with static gameplay or passthrough video with gameplay that combines some kind of body movement with vr movement like swinging arms while your character is jumping and of course with good framerate,msposff,5.0,1koc062
comment,msq1vpr,AuryGlenz,,4,2025-05-17 01:14:08,,,,The good framerate does a lot of heavy lifting in your response The only time I ever got sick in VR was in a game that was chugging frames The Quest headsets have been getting higher framerate panels on subsequent iterations and things like spacewarp to make full use of that,mspujlp,6.0,1koc062

comment,mssgp90,fakieTreFlip,,1,2025-05-17 13:28:22,,,,A lot of VR games are still very pricey for what you get and the vast majority of it is nowhere near AAA quality Even the bigger titles like Batman Arkham Shadow and Assassins Creed Nexus arent true AAA games IMO theres only two games that are truly AAA quality and thats Asgards Wrath and HalfLife Alyx Those both came out over 5 years ago There are promotions and some good free games yes but thats only going to convince so many people to buy a headset Not nearly enough to really make VR as a whole take off,msqtugm,5.0,1koc062
comment,mssu081,CMDR_KingErvin,,1,2025-05-17 14:47:24,,,,Asgards Wrath 2 came out less than 2 years ago Why mention the 5 year old original game and not 2 Anyways I think the games are fine but personally a VR headset is pretty versatile and can do so many other things At 500 the Quest 3 is a pretty good deal and I dont think most owners feel any sort of regret buying it like the Apple Vision folks do,mssgp90,6.0,1koc062

comment,mt5mcq8,PrimeIntellect,,1,2025-05-19 17:33:36,,,,True but that is because people train basically their entire lives typing and using a mouse but communication has evolved quite a bit as well we used to just be using typewriters The keyboard isnt even design very well at all because if you typed too fast typewriters would get jammed up lol These days a lot of communication has become much more visualdigital with memes emojis video clips audio clips group chats etc and so I think there is still a pretty big field of new input related technology that could revolutionize how we interact with a digital system,mstpk02,4.0,1koc062

comment,mspgunl,andynator1000,,8,2025-05-16 23:02:27,,,,And Im sure the big expensive screen on the front that shows your eyes that you cant develop anything for is also for developers and also all the marketing that shows people sitting on their couch using it is probably just for developers Not to mention that if you are a developer they will just loan you a Vision Pro headset through the Vision Pro Developer kit program instead of making you buy one,mspes18,3.0,1koc062

comment,msu3zrw,andynator1000,,2,2025-05-17 18:56:11,,,,I would wager that 999 of people buying an iPhone 16 Pro Max are not professional photographers Most people either just want a better camera a larger phome with the pro features or they just want the best iPhone regardless of the features,mst4mv4,5.0,1koc062

comment,msqau3y,haahaahaa,,0,2025-05-17 02:11:45,,,,VRAR is dope The vision pro is an iterative hardware upgrade over what came before it But it comes with all the important limitations of the Oculus VR is probably close to what it will ever be A fun experience that requires a decent amount of space and not everyone can handle True limbhand tracking is about the only thing I can think of to make it better A more free experience AR seems to be what everyone thinks is the future Something that makes the promise of the HoloLens andor Google Glass a reality Wearable tech that you take everywhere and integrates into every part of your life This isnt that,,0.0,1koc062
comment,msqg2cw,DarthBuzzard,,4,2025-05-17 02:45:43,,,,True limbhand tracking is about the only thing I can think of to make it better A more free experience I would also say force feedback tactile haptic gloves BCI input lifelike avatars personal HRTFs full human field of view retinal resolution 200x higher brightness no optical distortions variable focus high quality passthrough high quality reverse passthrough sunglasseslike form factors and perfect dynamic foveated rendering,msqau3y,1.0,1koc062

comment,mspn22g,BigTonyT30,,2,2025-05-16 23:40:49,,,,I think they just came in way too hot with the 3K price tag That made it the most expensive VR headset and it wasnt even geared towards gaming like the vast majority of VR is Personally I think they shouldve kept this one limited to test units until they could present a more useful product at a way more reasonable price rather than a gadget to part rich people of their money,msp5aie,1.0,1koc062
