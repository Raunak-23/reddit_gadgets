comment,ly12uag,Nebulex,,9,2024-11-20 01:39:06,,,,I agree with this I just happened to get MGSV and the Steam controller at the same time and it was a fantastic experience Really sold me on the controller but I ended up never really finding that many games where I preferred this over an Xbox controller,ly0v794,5.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly8yaj8,SOULJAR,,1,2024-11-21 13:29:26,,,,Im having trouble understanding whats different about the controller as compare to the latest Xbox controller for example Could you please explain that part People are saying the games they like to use it for but not why,ly0v794,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly92mjn,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-21 13:56:43,,,,The big thing is sheer flexibility It has gyro 2 big trackpads with extremely advanced haptics and rear paddles then also normal face buttons and a solid left analogue stick shoulder buttons The big star feature is the trackpads they can be configured to be used like a pointer input or like an analogue directional input where you pull further to accelerate the pointer or view or a hybrid due to the way that PC controls work where you can use it like a precise trackpad inside the dead zone and have it accelerate outside the dead zone and hybrid with the gyro analogue like functionality so you can have the trackpad act like an analogue stick for controlling the camera and also use the gyro for precision aiming think Splatoon The trackpads are really phenomenal its hard to describe exactly how the haptics behave but you can really feel motion and position in the trackpad it has these varying levels of clicking vibrations it imparts to each thumb that lets you have an extremely tactile experience the left one has a ridged cross on it like a DPAD which actually helps a lot for use as an analogue stick Its big weakness IMO is that it does not have a real Dpad The left trackpad is not a good Dpad whatsoever it can be functional but it is just not at all good feeling as a Dpad I couldnt tell you specifically why lots of factors just feel off like the general size the click weight of it the inside curve isnt how I interact with Dpadsits just off It has the ridged cross in it that looks like a DPAD but its more useful for use as an analogue stick tbh They could have leaned harder into thetrackpad imitating analogue functionality thing by replacing the left analogue stick with a DPAD or 4 additional directional face buttons like the Switch joycons But for stuff where Dpad isnt a big factor its a genuinely phenomenally flexible device lots of community control setups for many games and its ultra customizable with the provides interface So there are many games that would be considered unplayable on controllers which become very conveniently playable on Steam Controller Eg Civilization Europa Universalis etc type games with heavy cursor input But its also awesome for many other kinds of games,ly8yaj8,6.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly95s29,SOULJAR,,1,2024-11-21 14:16:02,,,,If Im hearing you correctly the left side is a normal thumb stick so similar to the way I would normally play halo or COD or whatever And the right side which is typically to control what direction youre looking is a track pad instead Im still unclear on why moving the view needs a track pad or so much sensitivity and features that this trackpad acceleration you mentioned would offer Maybe Im thinking of the wrong games but for the games I mentioned its just the view direction and i find it difficult to understand how a track pad can somehow be better than the intuitive thumb stick Or is the answer that its more for games like civilization because you can allow for mouse pointer control and its the same or not much better for CODHalo etc In this case I suppose that makes sense if you really want to use a controller instead of a precise mouse,ly92mjn,7.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly9dt7i,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-21 15:20:58,,,,Just google steam controller and look up pics is easiest There are two track pads top left and right Then underneath there is a left analogue stick and right side face buttons They have advanced haptics so you can literally just use them exactly like an analogue stick if you want just slide your thumb along the pad in the direction you want If you want to use it for cursor control based games like RTS games etc thats also available with a trackball like feel The pads can also be clicked You can also use hybrids for games where precise aiming can be a factor as well as general viewlook So eg Lots of third person adventure games where there are some aim based weapons In general it is great for shooters when you are not trying to be competitive with MKB users for me playing shooters with just analogue sticks is a HORRIBLE experience cuz Im a mouse user generally The Steam Controller bridges the gap This is partly why it is so great for MGSV actually,ly95s29,8.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lyasyb4,SOULJAR,,1,2024-11-21 20:08:16,,,,Thank you I appreciate you sharing that info Im curious for the take of people who have used it like yourself How do you feel about it for usual look direction you have in fps games and many others like be it red dead or fall out or COD or Halo or Elden ring etc Is a track pad really good or better compared to a the right thumb stick that other controllers have Or is there some special thing it does that makes it more useful for this function Or is there special settings you got to apply to make it somehow better than an ordinary thumb stick It sounds like youre saying that yes its better than a thumb stick for quick and accurate aiming Is that right,ly9dt7i,9.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lyayfiw,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2024-11-21 20:36:19,,,,On a technical level the trackpad is fundamentally better because analogue sticks are generally a fundamentally poor control scheme for pointers in the first place as a basic technology With a trackpad or mouse your hand directly controls the position of the pointer a change in position of your thumbhand corresponds directly to a change in position of the cursor An analogue stick basically can only control the acceleration of the cursor or reticle It can only say accelerate the pointer in this direction This is why console FPS games provide ample subtle aim assistance methods like sticky crosshair magnet bullets and so on Halo series actually pioneered the application of many of these tricks In practice with these techniques you can still have quite a fun experience However on PC most of these controller aim assists usually arent present even if you decide to use a controller so it just ends up being a frustrating exercise in using raw analogue input which is just not so good,lyasyb4,10.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lyb0dl9,SOULJAR,,1,2024-11-21 20:46:16,,,,Very interesting and good points Thank you Last question are there types of games that you think this stream controller would be bad for and that you would prefer a standard controller with a right thumb stick,lyayfiw,11.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lyba4z0,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-21 21:36:18,,,,Anything where DPAD is important Like I said DPAD is its great weakness I guess games like platformers and adventure games etcs where aiming isnt a big factor a right analogue can be good,lyb0dl9,12.0,1gv6ad7

comment,lyyhwz6,Garbonzobein,,1,2024-11-25 19:58:24,,,,It lets you cast spells in exactly the places you want without using a mouse The touch pads work great for sorc or Amazon Personally it changed the game for my necro corpse explosion build on controller,ly8y465,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly15rn0,So-many-ducks,,6,2024-11-20 01:56:08,,,,I loved my 200hours run of the Witcher 3 with it The grip paddles were great for the most involved combat types crossbowgrenades if I recall the track pads made it super easy to track moving ennemies its the only time I felt like I had the comfort of a pad with the precision of control of a mouse and keyboard,ly0kh3d,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly1a75w,tactiphile,,24,2024-11-20 02:22:12,,,,Thing is customizing Steam Controller profiles is a whole subhobby in itself But when everything clicks its like nothing else,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly1cs0v,JumpInTheSun,,7,2024-11-20 02:37:35,,,,Its my VR controller you can map pretty much an entire keyboard to it its got gyro and it actually feels exactly like using tracked controllers when aiming because of it,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly1h2o0,Mr_PJC123,,6,2024-11-20 03:03:22,,,,Its perfect for older games without controller support Prey Max Payne Call of Juarez etc,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2e67b,pufpuf89,,2,2024-11-20 07:24:45,,,,You can basically customise everything to your needs I still dont like precise aiming with it but thats because I always aimed with a mouse but still comparing to a normal controller aiming is way more precise and the gyro also helps with that Also you can set your own combos So for example by pressing one button all other buttons will now have different functions,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2k4zc,Niarbeht,,2,2024-11-20 08:29:01,,,,Part of the issue with Skyrim and all the other games on that engine and a bunch of other games besides is that they either dont handle input from both controller and noncontroller inputs well or they straight up disallow it In the case of Bethesda its that it doesnt allow both controller and mouse input to coexist so you cant have mouse look on the right track pad and joystick move on the left thumb stick You either have to do mouse look with keyboard move or joystick move with weird joystick emulation of mouse look This isnt a problem with the Steam Controller its a problem with the games This problem has been around a while too I once tried to do mouse look and controller movement in Oblivion back in like 2008 didnt work,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly34m8l,starvald_demelain,,1,2024-11-20 12:03:53,,,,Titles that are designed to be mainly used with a mouse cursor Point and click adventures many strategy titles some simulations come to mind Steam Input is very customizable with normal controllers as well and the touch pads allow for more hot keys and macros with radial menus or zones for games that offer a lot of hotkeys,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly4nj1s,toeonly,,1,2024-11-20 17:26:58,,,,It is the only way to play XCOM Enemy Unknownwithin in ultra widescreen,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly4oace,Pythagorial,,1,2024-11-20 17:30:47,,,,Skyrim specifically doesnt play nice with the steam controller Bethesda games have crummy mouse acceleration and this weird thing where sensitivity is different for vert axis vs horizontal axis It also doesnt let you use a controller and mouse at the same time so you cant use the track pad as a mouse but rather as emulating a joystick which kinda sucks,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lybq7mx,Pennanen,,1,2024-11-21 23:03:06,,,,Takes a little time to get used to it Have been using mine since release and its still working flawlesly,ly0is08,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly24ore,Vetiversailles,,6,2024-11-20 05:54:11,,,,I love the steam controller So much better for shooters than a regular controller and so customizable Big fan,lxzgmk3,1.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly44i0c,PARANOIAH,,3,2024-11-20 15:48:42,,,,Is the dpad just a touch surface or does it move around ie pressable like a regular dpad,ly24ore,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly4fre0,Vetiversailles,,4,2024-11-20 16:47:11,,,,Both It is a touchpad and also a D pad which gives you a lot of options Im not really a fan of using it like a dpad though I wont lie I have most of my games that use them D pad buttons set to touch instead of press I personally find it more responsive that way Hell some games I swap the touchpadD pad for the left joystick so I have twin touchpads and then map the dpad controls to the left joystick like a directional selection Thats how I have Helldivers set up,ly44i0c,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly56pmg,PARANOIAH,,1,2024-11-20 19:03:37,,,,Ah I was thinking more along the lines of using it as a fightpad Something that doesnt exist but a large shallowish but still clicky dpad would be pretty great for fighting games at least in my head it does Bonus points if theres a lockswitch on the back somewhere that unlocks rotation on the dpad to allow it to be used in a wheellike manner for driving games,ly4fre0,4.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2ywhy,Shaky_Balance,,1,2024-11-20 11:11:55,,,,Do you have any custom mappings to help it work for shooters I cant get the default to work right for me With those settings I found myself needing to move my thumb across the pad multiple times to turn a bit while walking forward and turning 90180 degrees just cant happen as fast as shooters need you to,ly24ore,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly3l7cf,Warning_Low_Battery,,3,2024-11-20 14:00:20,,,,Depends on the game In CoD for example I had to turn up the Xaxis sensitivity in the controller settings inside the game itself to be able to turn quickly with the Steam Controller,ly2ywhy,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly4hcsd,Vetiversailles,,2,2024-11-20 16:55:18,,,,I wish I had some universal advice but I find it really game dependent Actually for that issue i generally find setting up the touchpad to respond as mouse or as trackball is far better than as joystick I think theres also a spin speed and another setting I cant remember that helps with a more fluid single movement also might be worth adjusting your trackpad dead zone Have you checked out the community layouts I use those as templates a lot,ly2ywhy,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly7vvqx,Sa3ana3a,,1,2024-11-21 07:26:11,,,,I sold mine to a fellow like you He was so ecstatic about the deal that he told me I made a mistake by selling it He was dead wrong about that and it always makes me chuckle remembering that But Im actually happy it went to someone that is going to actually use it,lxzgmk3,1.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly1xf6e,alidan,,2,2024-11-20 04:55:04,,,,the best controller with the worst software getting steam to see it and hook it into games was a nightmare when it didnt work when it did it was awsome but I got a wired xbox the first time it took restarting the computer 3 times and the game 20 to get it to hook in not to mention how bad the interface to configure anything was what I want is a seperate application for the controller not relying on steam hooking in and everything working right for that game really wish I could have used that controller more when it worked it was the best but when I needed it to just function it was barely competent,lxzgmk3,1.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2cyg6,danielv123,,5,2024-11-20 07:12:14,,,,Would also be nice if it wasnt so loud and felt so cheap Though I did get it for 5 so I guess it was cheap,ly1xf6e,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2gh95,alidan,,3,2024-11-20 07:49:15,,,,just gone mine out to feel it it keep most of the weight in its gripsits weight is with batteries that will recess in lower and add more weight to it it feeling cheap I m tring to bend the thing in my hands and am fairly strong I can barely get this thing to flex hell the only places that actually make noise on the thing is the back thats suppose to and the front track pads that are suppose to I can snap a playstation controller at least a ps3 era one in my hands cant do that with the steam controller now for buttons both track pads are fantastic you have any idea how rare it is for track pads to click evenly across their entire face with no zones that demand more pressure my current best controller is an 8bitdo 2c with hall effect triggers and thumbsticks even after its use the steam joystick is easily the smoothest to move I have ever used that had modern potentiometers as a basis the only things that are comparable in smoothness are really old still experimental controller designs the face buttons do feel mushy but I never remember them being particularly firm lb and rb are both press anywhere reasonable and its the same pressure to actuate the triggers are nice and smooth but also have a satisfying click when they bottom out I think the only thing close to this is the modern dualshocks with haptics but I never got to try those in a game to be sure im positive they are better but its still nice to feel that button press when you bottom out probably not the best in a racing game the only thing on the controller that makes it feel cheap is the glossy plastic on the face any kind of matte plastic feels higher end tldr it actually feels quite high quality but the glossy plastic on the face makes it feellook cheap,ly2cyg6,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2hggl,danielv123,,5,2024-11-20 07:59:43,,,,All the clicks feel heavy to actuate chunky and loud to me except the mushy buttons of course The rumble motor doesnt help Its not in the same league as a modern Xbox controller for example but then again it has touchpads I am looking forward to the next generation,ly2gh95,4.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly37vso,SnooRecipes1114,,3,2024-11-20 12:29:58,,,,Yea the clicks for me felt super hollow cheap and unnecessarily loud I am surprised how in the minority this opinion is It was incredibly blatent for me it really put me off the controller which is a shame because I liked the controller itself,ly2hggl,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2im8i,TheBaconBoots,,2,2024-11-20 08:12:16,,,,I know what you mean I turn off clicking on the pads as much as I can because its just not very comfortable and seems super loud as do the bumpers,ly2hggl,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly2s0b6,alidan,,1,2024-11-20 09:58:39,,,,ok I have a wired xbox next to me the 8bit do and the steam the buttons on the back are a little heavy but they are also buttons that you can press anywhere on the plate and are where you grip your hand and also have 23 fingers to press I dont have any of the elite controllers to compare to but I would assume the steam is a bit heavier face buttons my wired is a little sticky on the b key more or less the same on the 8bitdo but a bit snappier due to it being newer the steam is about halfway inbetween them on pressure needed but also the buttons are smaller so it feels a bit weird left and right button at least on my xbox I could accidently activate at the edge but also require 23x the force up closer to the center because of the design of the 8bitdo I cant accidently press them but it requires the same force anywhere on the button on the steam controller I cant accidently press them but there is also next to no travel to press them it requires roughly double the force of the 8bit do and ballpark the same force as wired xbox but the steam controller is a definite press same with the 8bit do while the xbox gives me false presses due to how easy it is to press the track pads in this could be a problem on the steam controller on the topic of rl3 it is probably a little stiffer on the steam controller compared to the other two but im also not fighting which way im pressing the direction to press down on it which ultimately makes it easier for the control stick itself feel wise steam is the best for movement 8bitdo is the best for how the movement happens and my xbox was fucked to the point I had to sand down some of the outer areas for the pots to fully read max distances no calibration worked I wont say your wrong but I also wont say you are completely right either let me put it this way the first xbox controller the duke is comfortable in my hands just for a point of reference so alot of how comfortable it is in my hands comes from that edited for wording,ly2hggl,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly38e10,SnooRecipes1114,,1,2024-11-20 12:33:50,,,,I dont think the controller itself felt cheap it was purely the incredibly clicky trackpadsbuttons felt really tacky and hollow imo and were incredibly loud They fixed this with the steam deck if the steam controller had the same type of mechanisms behind the buttonstrackpads as the steam deck itd be perfect,ly2gh95,4.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly3nbgl,alidan,,1,2024-11-20 14:13:19,,,,Just picked up my little brothers steam deck honestly I would hate that as a controller nothing has any travel to it so actually knowing you pressed things is harder it feels like a switch where they compressed everything on the sides so nothing feels good to use and what I remember of the track pads as mice was honestly a point where I would rather use a joystick and I cant stand using joysticks as mice a full controller may be better but it feels like everything is a compromise in a bad way on the steam deck,ly38e10,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly3rogo,SnooRecipes1114,,1,2024-11-20 14:38:54,,,,Well dont go saying that on the steam deck sub youd get torn apart for that lol Id say the steam deck controls are what makes it perfect as does pretty much everyone who owns one but I respect that All of the buttons besides the trackpads have great travel imo its all full sized the same as my Xbox controller at least Anyway what I meant was the steam controller to be the exact same as its always been just the same quietness as the steam deck The steam decks bumpers for example are still clicky but are much quieter and fuller which gives that premium feeling I wouldnt mind the trackpads being clicky still but given the same treatment as the bumpers Thatd be perfect for me I think I get some people just like the big loud clicky stuff though ideally thered be enough choices for everyone,ly3nbgl,6.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly4xih2,alidan,,1,2024-11-20 18:17:14,,,,back when he got the steamdeck he downloaded enough crap to it that it just refused to respond in any way so I had to go into the linux part of it and delete something to get it to work again that was an absolute nightmare with the controls given they are good if all you have access to is the steam deck but I would bring a secondary controller as they obviously made concessions to be more switch like for me I dont like quiet it usually means rubber domes and soft one that start to become complete mush over time I like that feeling of going over the pressure edge with a notable click and on the 8bitdo I have the snappy enough return to 0 that makes the face buttons click when you let go of them it helps me know that yes I did press the button and if I need to look closer at the output or not I have had a few that diedneeded full disassembly cleanings that just wouldnt register button presses anymore,ly3rogo,7.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly0tchs,cloggednueron,,13,2024-11-20 00:43:57,,,,More button options and a track pad for RTS would make it the greatest gaming implement ever A big issue with steam deck is that games that dont pose technical challenges for SD like paradox grand strategy cant be played due to button limits Fixing that would be amazing,lxzts91,2.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly2fcmm,Cutter9792,,1,2024-11-20 07:37:15,,,,I dont know if youve used the Xbox elite series 2 controller but it lets you lock the triggers to be clicks instead of analog or even half presses Might be partially what youre looking for Granted it doesnt have the trackpads or gyro but otherwise its solid if you can find a cheap one,lxzts91,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lznit5i,ilasfm,,1,2024-11-30 02:16:58,,,,Late reply but I was once considering one of those just for the triggers but Ive come to really love the two touch pads on the steam deck Managed some really wonky stuff with them The gyro is also pretty important to me even though a lot of stuff doesnt support it well I loved splatoon and mh rise on the switch and a huge part of that was the gyro aiming If Im going really crazy I would like all of the above but somehow with the 2 part controller style of the joycons It is honestly a really nice qol to just lay on a couch and not have my hands married to each other But something like that I would probably have to try and make as some kind of jank custom controller,ly2fcmm,3.0,1gv6ad7

comment,lya1i67,work_m_19,,2,2024-11-21 17:51:13,,,,Hey you may know this already but this is a case that a button chord would help If I remember cassette beasts you know ahead of time about fusions so you can prep this ahead of time by holding a button and then easily pressing another button when something comes up What I do Go to controller configs and choose the key you want as a screen shot Lets say you want to use Menu can be anything for screenshots Go to the Menu button and click Extra Button and choose the Take Screenshots button In the settings for the button gear icon click the one that says Regular Click or something and switch that to Button Chord Then go to the settings of the button again and there should be one that says button chord to None You can change this to anything in this example lets say you use Left Trigger Now if you want to take screenshots you can hold down left trigger wait for the Cassette Beasts Fusion to come up and then click the Menu button to take the screenshot This is definitely a bit more cumbersome but having button chords and action sets opens up a lot more inputs Hope that helps And apologies if you already knew this,ly7jzr4,4.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly1xyit,alidan,,10,2024-11-20 04:59:14,,,,what would be best is if it could be modular like I can slot in a joystick or I could slide in touchpads if only because I have always dreamed of a controller with just a brain where you slide that brain in like a memory card and it controls hardware that is sub 10 to make but costs 60 because the brain has a minimum cost,lxzj9ok,1.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly57qsu,emolga2225,,2,2024-11-20 19:08:52,,,,modularity adds unneeded complexity and costs they may as well make 2 controllers also theres been an uptick in modular controllers since the inception of the switch ex Dualsense Edge so they would have to dance around a lot of patents to pull it off My bet is on steam deck layout with better triggers akin to what the Wii U procon was to the Gamepad,ly1xyit,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly5ebcm,alidan,,1,2024-11-20 19:42:07,,,,imagine this you get a small 2 inch by 2 inch box that figures out inputs and does all the calibration and you plug that into any number of devices be it an xbox style controller a sony style an arcade stick and all its configurations ect ect and the controllers are just shells there are so many controllers made everywhere that you could easily make a shell for near the cost of plastic you could put all the buttons and sticks in for under 10 markup for profit and 13 off aliexpress maybe 20 off amazon and all you have to do is attach the brain to it if I remember right the current good controller for a fight stick is 100 with some worse ones being well worse but functional I have a zero delay thats likely good enough and im smart enough to be able to make my own with a pico pi but alot of people are still going to use those 100 boards imagine just getting the controller parts and plugging in a steam controller brain and it calibrates the inputs maybe it save a few calibrations on it or has near unlimited thats what im talking about the expensive part of controllers is what locks them to a specific device or locks them out of others,ly57qsu,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly5st6k,emolga2225,,1,2024-11-20 22:07:34,,,,theres a similar situation to that in the Guitar Hero community They discovered that the adapters for the NES Classic work with the guitars made for Wii since they both use the nunchuk adapter What they found out is that the polling rate was much higher on the Wii guitars so it allowed them to play notoriously hard sections much easier than on an X360 guitar nowadays people sell 3D printed arduino USB to Classic adapter boxes ex retrocultmods adapter that have the same shape as the Wii remote so itll fit in the guitar so its practically a brain for the controller,ly5ebcm,4.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly4k3k8,Isaboll1,,1,2024-11-20 17:09:26,,,,I use the right trackpad as a main input for the Deck In that case most of the actions were performed using the back buttons which is exactly the same way I used the Steam controller I map the grips and dual stage actions for the SC when using the touch pads The locations of the touch pads on the regular SC and how large they were made using the face buttons alongside awkward except for maybe the Y button which was the only one I used lol which is the same case for the Deck anyways If the next SC has both trackpads and joysticks thats no guarantee that itll be like the Dualsense much in the same way the Decks own controls arent like that,ly0qpex,4.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly4n0st,Isaboll1,,1,2024-11-20 17:24:24,,,,I got no problems using them although I shift how I hold the Deck in accordance since the grip in the Deck is large enough to do that while still having hold of the device The Dualsense touchpads in contrast are useless since you lose control over actions while using it due to the controller not having back buttons but also because of the touchpad being centered getting in the way when using both thumbs For a hypothetical SC2 though I can see them playing around with the layout a bit with the removal of the Decks screen to help make it more comfortable even if it were to result in a nontraditional controller design,ly4lt48,6.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly039fj,wicktus,,1,2024-11-19 22:17:15,,,,SD OLED is really great I wouldnt be interested in SD if it wasnt the case I think the next switch especially if it leverages DLSS may however be too close to the Steam Deck current performance With an ARM SoC and games really optimised with its SDK it may reach that level of performance with the stricter wattage restrictions Nintendo usually put in place if it gets strong third party supports with games like Elden Ring Fantazio Armored Core Dragon Quest XII I think I can easily wait for a SD2 I really cannot imagine Nintendo betting the next 78 years on a console that would already be struggling versus a 2022 Steam Deck but who knows SD2 it will probably leverage RDNA 4 FSR 4 with AIassisted upscaling already officialised and will be really focused on handhelds performance per AMD statements faster more ram etc So a really generational uplift versus SD and more complimentary of a switch 2,lxzug3j,2.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly0f1ku,wicktus,,2,2024-11-19 23:21:07,,,,Q3Q4 2026 yeah I think too Frankly I would have agreed with you if it werent for the LCD OLED version update Its far more incremental than a full fledged SD2 but I feel that this time around Valve is doing the more balanced thing and moving quicker whilst respecting SD1 owners Working hard on ProtonSteam OS which will be offered to more devices I read and giving more time for developers to work on SD optimisations Also worth noting Steam Deck rivals are popping from everywhere including at one point Sony and Microsoft Phil Spencer officialised a handheld console albeit it will take quite some time to develop The market is moving really fast It may push Valve to be slightly quicker this time around its a market they are leading for now and deservedly so,ly0c4rh,4.0,1gv6ad7

comment,lxzf4he,wicktus,,2,2024-11-19 20:15:34,,,,They said they are working on the next Steam Deck If its miniled or OLED Ill pick it up otherwise Ill wait I sure hope its dayone OLED Theres 0 information on its display the only official info is we are working on it and that they are waiting for more generational performance increase from AMD SoC,lxzeqey,2.0,1gv6ad7

comment,lxzjyan,drunkbusdriver,,15,2024-11-19 20:39:49,,,,They have already came out and said they dont plan on doing minor releases of it meaning they wont release one till there is some worthwhile improvement I dont see that happening in a year,lxzh702,4.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lxzlw1i,gummo_for_prez,,9,2024-11-19 20:49:26,,,,Yeah it seems unlikely well see anything before 20262027 The Steam Deck OLED is an incredible device that at the moment requires no upgrade If folks want one they should just buy it I have one Its awesome,lxzjyan,5.0,1gv6ad7
comment,lxzv486,pieter1234569,,0,2024-11-19 21:35:33,,,,Which doesnt necessarily mean long releases What it does mean is that the hardware the use needs to be significantly better Which is exactly what happens with these mobile SOCs Even every 2 years a significant increase in power comes out at a price point they can use in the new steam deck,lxzjyan,5.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly2zfnj,Shaky_Balance,,3,2024-11-20 11:17:07,,,,Roy is a character in Blade Runner a movie that was foundational in popularizing cyberpunk as a genreaesthetic Deckard is a separate peripheral by Valve also named after a Blade Runner character Fire Emblem is a first party strategy game by Nintendo it has a character named Roy who is in Super Smash Bros a fighting game by Nintendo so he is relatively well known as far as Fire Emblem games go So the article headline is clarifying that the controller is named after the Blade Runner character not the Nintendo one,ly0qa32,1.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly0sg9j,feverlast,,1,2024-11-20 00:38:45,,,,Yeah I should clarify I understood how to make it work but thought it was an inefficient and counterintuitive way to play because of the lack of biofeedback for the thumb For instance where the edge of the track pad is or losing sense of direction on the track pad or precise control of how fast its moving and being able to hold that direction while feeling like my finger was slipping off Everything about it was less manageable and less satisfying and less enjoyable than a thumbstick for me I bought the thing tried it and didnt like it its not bad tech its just not for me,ly0r6iy,4.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly0t92k,CodyCigar96o,,2,2024-11-20 00:43:23,,,,Do you find it counterintuitive that laptop trackpads dont have physical feedback where the edge of the track pad is or losing sense of direction on the track pad or precise control of how fast its moving and being able to hold that direction while feeling like my finger was slipping off Your description just sounds like you had the trackpad in joystick mode When used properly the trackpad will behave like a laptop trackpad Ie you swipe and your camera will move that amount swipe faster and it will move that amount but faster Theres no way to lose sense of direction its all just swipes,ly0sg9j,5.0,1gv6ad7

comment,ly0vkog,Fredasa,,-1,2024-11-20 00:56:48,,,,It would actually be nice to have something like what I currently use but with more buttons I am always running out of buttons If they can figure out a way to include fancy Steam pads without any of that actually getting in the way Im all for it Because it isnt a third party I could be reasonably assured about the devices quality which is definitely a top concern Maybe they can even lick the everpresent issue of steadily worsening stick drift There are very good reasons to chip in my vote for a controller that I would actually use For the record no something that meets my needs either doesnt currently exist or costs 200,ly0rdea,2.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly0wcfk,CodyCigar96o,,1,2024-11-20 01:01:12,,,,A DualSense is a normal controller with trackpads that arent in the way There are tons of affordable 3rd party controllers with extra buttons and your concerns about quality are overblown this isnt the days of madcatz Xbox controllers 3rd party companies are very good Plenty of affordable Hall effect controllers too that address your stick drift concern What is it about a valve controller specifically that you think would be better than all of these options,ly0vkog,3.0,1gv6ad7
comment,ly0yosw,Fredasa,,0,2024-11-20 01:14:57,,,,A DualSense has both analog sticks crucially including the primary stick at the bottom due to a legacy design stemming from when Sony tacked on analog sticks the only place a PS1 pad had room I dont blame them for not rocking that boat but the fact of the matter is that its not optimally ergonomic and I know from experience that my left thumb cant handle that position as well as it does the spot where the thumb rests naturally Even Nintendo threw in the towel on this item giving up their precious symmetry in favor of the blunt ergonomics Otherwise I do quite like the PS5 pad They finally moved solidly away from the more legacy angles and the silhouette is effectively an Xbox pad The top buttons are also much more to my liking than anything since the 360 pad There are tons of affordable 3rd party controllers with extra buttons Ive tried many Theres a reason I went way the hell out of my way to mention third party in my OP The quality isnt low in the sense that _this is the pad you hand to your younger brother_ but it is always invariably below the standard you get from actual console makers And this is important because Im even picky enough to critique the best thats available The XSX pad for example creaks too much when you twist ita problem the 360 pad never had but all Sony pads have shared What is it about a valve controller specifically that you think would be better than all of these options Im in it for the possibility that a company I can potentially trust to create a quality product may magically solve all my problems for me,ly0wcfk,4.0,1gv6ad7
