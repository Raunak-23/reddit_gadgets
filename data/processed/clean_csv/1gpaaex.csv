comment,lwps4le,Themasterofcomedy209,,15,2024-11-12 07:21:24,,,,And its pushing the definition of available in those chosen Asian countries too With the OLED basically all of Asia had to go through Japan so it was sold out basically all the time,lwoz4s1,1.0,1gpaaex

comment,lwpebnk,ArchusKanzaki,,10,2024-11-12 05:11:02,,,,While online stores vary Nintendo still does not have official Southeast Asia online store for example All of the mentioned have official local distributors that provide local warranty Valve does not even have official local distributors All available Steam Decks are sold asis and parallelimported Thats a massive disadvantages compared to ASUS and others who provide 2year local warranty,lwpdqa6,2.0,1gpaaex

comment,lwur2ef,Tomrr6,,2,2024-11-13 02:24:20,,,,Itll probably be a while Software leaks seem to show that their next VR Headset will come out first Itll play games without a PC using an ARM processor and a translation layer to make PC games run on ARM like how the Deck has a translation layer to play Windows games on Linux My money is on this being a test before making an ARM powered Deck 2 The leaks show Valve mostly testing VR games with their translation layer but also a ton of flat games Also for better or for worse Valve is a very slow company that doesnt feel pressure from competitors Their Index headset is ridiculously old and outdated compared to competitors but theyre still selling it at full price and people love it,lwqjdz9,1.0,1gpaaex
comment,lwvm4pt,internetlad,,3,2024-11-13 06:03:55,,,,Yeah Honestly the deck I have worked great for 95 of games Few I found fun poorly arent that big of a deal Mostly my own fault for cheating out and getting the LCD version instead of the OLED,lwur2ef,2.0,1gpaaex
