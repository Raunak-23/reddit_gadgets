comment,mra53xg,parisidiot,,6,2025-05-08 17:43:12,,,,idk my friend has had sonos through multiple versions for like 10 years and it always seemed significantly worse to me than networked amps the app has always sucked it is just even worse now there have always been really weird connection issues that are difficult to diagnose and fix we have them at work and theyre constantly dropping out and being strange,mr3z1pl,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr3bgqr,TypicalDelay,,29,2025-05-07 16:39:20,,,,For the average user their product works well I bought my soundbar and subwoofer two years ago plugged them in and set up the app Havent opened the app or though about it since really it just works with my tv and occasionally I play Spotify on it,mr39hkt,1.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr5tc11,pattymcfly,,13,2025-05-08 00:11:39,,,,Then you way over paid A regular soundbar would do that for you Plenty of wireless subwoofer soundbar kits out there for much less money and similar audio performance Sonos only is justified if you really want multi room insync audio And even THAT is less valuable now if you are willing to use google home devices I say this as someone who has 4 Sonos speakers a Sonos port and two Sonos amps,mr3bgqr,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr60p0j,TypicalDelay,,11,2025-05-08 00:54:58,,,,Ehh these days there are really good soundbars but mostly I dont care about chasing the tippity top of price to audio quality ratio also I got my beam 2 on sale and its very compact For the most part the Sonos ecosystem just works and delivers good audio quality with modularity and upgradeability,mr5tc11,3.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr5xzjq,pattymcfly,,8,2025-05-08 00:39:13,,,,Its still the best and most flexible option If all you are doing is a single room like a home theatre around a tv skip Sonos Its not the best audio quality for the money You can always add a port to a AV receiver later if you want to use the home theatre with the rest of your multi room Sonos network,mr5xh1d,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr70h0z,WrongUserID,,5,2025-05-08 04:46:21,,,,I agree and if someone is willing to pay the same amount you can even get better specs I still rock some of Chromecast Audio for multiroom sync They work very well,mr5tc11,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mrdaffo,thunderflies,,1,2025-05-09 04:35:37,,,,Most regular sound bars are uglier and Sonos gives you the ability to add wireless satellites later which is nice,mr5tc11,3.0,1kgxzif

comment,mrw9c5t,throwawaylawblog,,1,2025-05-12 11:24:51,,,,Im unaware of other wireless subwoofers and ecosystems that integrate with a multiroom setup and do so in an entirely wireless nature Also contrary to a lot of the comments in here I have not had issues with my Sonos setup for connectivity or otherwise I set it up 23 years ago and have never tweaked it again It took me 10 minutes to setup Ill gladly pay more for that type of convenience which is ultimately what I think Sonos is selling I am fortunate that money is not generally an issue but time is usually an issue Ill pay more to save time,mr5tc11,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr82w6i,Emergency_Hawk_6947,,0,2025-05-08 10:59:57,,,,Thats like telling someone who bought a luxury car or first class flight ticket to say they overpaid There is a price for everything If he had bought a Vizio soundbar for the price of Sonos then that would have been case of him paying too much This is complaining Apple to a cheap no brand android phone,mr5tc11,3.0,1kgxzif

comment,mrda1gc,thunderflies,,1,2025-05-09 04:32:27,,,,Yeah I have a Sonos sound bar I use the same way I really only picked it because it looked less ugly than the other options I saw the connected features dont actually matter at all I guess,mr3bgqr,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr6mvrr,zzazzzz,,0,2025-05-08 03:06:41,,,,ye but to do that you could have bought a soundbar for a quarter of the price and gotten the same experience you are not really using any of the features that make sonos,mr3bgqr,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr6pjm3,TypicalDelay,,4,2025-05-08 03:24:42,,,,Absolutely not Please find me a soundbar thats a quarter or even half the price of a beam 2 that even competes with it,mr6mvrr,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr6rdc6,zzazzzz,,1,2025-05-08 03:37:21,,,,Hisense AX5125H is half the price and you get 2 extra channels and a sub on top of it and if you go away from shitty sounbars and buy actual hifi stuff you get better sound with 2 20 year old dusty speakers on wire you can get those for a tenner on ebay,mr6pjm3,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr9uxbp,mecha_power,,3,2025-05-08 16:54:25,,,,They used to be good and were essentially the only game in town when it comes to network audio and easily playing audio from your phone and not using bluetooth But other companies have caught up and they were really trying hard to push for subscription revenue which I suspect is a reason for the big changes,mr39hkt,1.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr2j98g,Y34rZer0,,42,2025-05-07 14:22:04,,,,My father purchased one of their AU600 sound bars about a month ago It wouldnt start working until you set it up with the phone app which you had to do over your wifi after connecting it to the network Problem was that it was a pain in the ass to connect to WiFi and hes fairly tech savvy He spent half an hour total on the phone with their support with their advice being useless In total he was trying to get the thing to turn on for four hours I felt bad for him Also its just a fuing speaker I understand that it has other features that require network connection and that you would need to use the app to apply optimum settings but theres no reason that it shouldnt just output some sound when you plug it into your TV Plus the damn app had the balls to offer a Paid monthly subscription to get other features on top of all of this I dont think the sound is worth the price and its only got one damn type of input It takes optical audio in and THATS ALL One input it comes with a lead that is a HDMI to optical converter yes I know that puzzled me too but it works No HDMI No HDMI outputs so you can loop from it out to your TV like EVERY OTHER high end audio product Not even the red and white RCA stereo inputs Needlessly overly complicated product,mr2h5rx,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr2lcxz,Bleeezus,,24,2025-05-07 14:32:32,,,,If he wanted a soundbar you could just plug in and play whyd he buy Sonos The main appeal of the Sonos system is playing things over WiFi,mr2j98g,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr2rnmy,Great_Hamster,,25,2025-05-07 15:03:33,,,,Sonos packaging said I could play music from my phone It didnt say that this was only through a very limited selection of apps that had to be installed on the Soundbar itself Thats why I bought and then returned mine,mr2lcxz,4.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr5724v,notjordansime,,2,2025-05-07 22:05:17,,,,Yes Most non techy people do exactly that They trust the sales representative Everyone in my family does this and they end up with the Black Friday special budget edition of the product I always say wait until I have a day off and Ill go with you to buy but people usually just want the new gizmo now,mr3g7yq,6.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr3njko,the_simurgh,,3,2025-05-07 17:36:31,,,,So many people do People joke it takes me six months and three store trips to get any major purchase that isnt comic book art The thing is i get top of the line stuff for much less than anyone else because i do my research before buying,mr3g7yq,6.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr6lpfz,Great_Hamster,,1,2025-05-08 02:58:49,,,,Yes Id received a recommendation from another customer a year or two before and that along with the packaging made me think it would probably fit my needs Of course I also got it from a shop with a very good return policy I like to think I would have done more research if I was not buying it from that shop,mr3g7yq,6.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr2pts4,ErGo404,,4,2025-05-07 14:54:36,,,,Its no excuse for the setup hassle that came with the new app The old one wasnt perfect but it was usually reliable and the setup process was simpler,mr2lcxz,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr2mon7,Y34rZer0,,1,2025-05-07 14:39:11,,,,Honestly I dont know why he chose that one hes usually quite discerning with purchases and puts the homework in Hes already got one of those apple airport things so he can play music to his Marantz system which is a good brand btw from his PC or whatever Plus the whole point of a sound bar is to plug into a TV really Why Sonos decided to make this difficult escapes me I bet the size of their speaker RD department is a smaller than the department that designs their phone apps and other bullshit next time I buy a speaker im sticking with the Germans lol,mr2lcxz,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr5v6ld,wvraven,,1,2025-05-08 00:22:46,,,,When I bought my dad his it was for the voice enhancement At the time it was the best soundbar that could do it in the price range There are others now but Im not sure how they compare,mr2lcxz,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr4syjk,pwn_intended,,8,2025-05-07 20:54:20,,,,Not defending Sonos as a company because of the messed up stuff they do but you are wrong about the no HDMI input Unfortunately it requires that you connect it to an eARC HDMI port on your TV Not a problem for any TV made in the last 7 years and this is actually the preferred option over using the included HDMI optical adapter and the only way to get the Dolby Atmos option fwiw The main drawback is losing an HDMI input on your tv I agree with all of the hate about the app though I am very tech savvy and it took about 2 hours to connect my sub to my system Ended up having to factory reset all 8 Sonos products in my house,mr2j98g,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr3zxsc,HeartyBeast,,2,2025-05-07 18:35:07,,,,Hope he returned it,mr2j98g,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mregt5r,BalooBot,,2,2025-05-09 11:22:26,,,,I bought one of their Bluetooth speakers for a trip to Europe because I always listen to music in the shower Got over there and you cant fucking use it in Bluetooth only mode until you connect it to WiFi Cant even just use a hotspot because you must be connected to the same WiFi network All the hotels had a splash screen where you have to agree to the terms before connecting I wandered Europe for more than a month with a heavy ass speaker in my backpack for no damn reason,mr2j98g,3.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr38mie,koolaidismything,,1,2025-05-07 16:25:25,,,,Yeah at that price point I should be able to plug and play not download their stupid app then pay a monthly fee to unlock features I made a JBL Flip 5 work for years but I mostly watch stuff on a laptop or iPad,mr3812j,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr6cqs1,goblue123,,1,2025-05-08 02:03:27,,,,The whole point of it is that it tunes itself to your room It has no idea where you sit It needs a microphone where you sit to hear what it sounds like there That microphone is in your phone There are tens of thousands of speakers out there if you dont want the one specific product that works in this fashion I have never paid a monthly fee to Sonos,mr38mie,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr3j6xl,GrayDaysGoAway,,3,2025-05-07 17:15:59,,,,Do you have a link or anything where I could read about this I know they used to brick speakers for people using their recycling program for discounts on new speakers but I cant seem to find any google results about them doing so in other situations Im not doubting it happened Sonos is a dogshit company Just really interested to learn more,mr2h5rx,2.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr4sclo,thewolfman2010,,4,2025-05-07 20:51:29,,,,Literally not true and people love to mixup the issue and conflate it They did brick some speakers during their recycling fiasco and reversed course People gonna believe whatever fits their narrative Ive been in the ecosystem for over 15 years and have at least one of every device A lot of utter bullshit in these responses,mr3j6xl,3.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr53ttt,myasterism,,1,2025-05-07 21:48:07,,,,As someone with no dog in this fight happily in Apples ecosystem but not pushing my opinion Id be interested to read some sources that you feel accurately represent the situations in question And I do mean that sincerely and not as some sort of challengeI would genuinely appreciate your insight particularly considering you seem to have extensive experience with the platform All I really remember is that Sonos fucked up more than once and in damning ways that I never heard satisfying explanationsresolutions for Still thats really no more than a questionable vibememory,mr4sclo,4.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr5a0np,thewolfman2010,,1,2025-05-07 22:21:36,,,,Their two biggest scandals in the last 10 years in my opinion are the upgrade program offering where they initially traded discount coupons for older hardware and the rushed app overhaul to release their over ear headphones Yes they have had a rocky road in some decision making Theres no doubt about that Their hardware is not poor as other replies make it seem,mr53ttt,5.0,1kgxzif
comment,mrbedbz,wkavinsky,,2,2025-05-08 21:26:10,,,,I mean the Arc is straight up performance competitive with regular nonsonos soundbars in the same price range People get easily duped by this has more channels for half the price rather than the actual sound that comes out of the sound bar especially when youve done the onceonly audio set up for where it is in the room,mr5a0np,6.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr9weya,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-05-08 17:01:28,,,,I dont see anybody here suggesting that they have bad hardware Its all about them being anticonsumer assholes with shitty software,mr5a0np,6.0,1kgxzif

comment,mr3k05t,Jeffrey_C_Wheaties,,4,2025-05-07 17:19:52,,,,We have Sonos at the bar I work at the speakers constantly cut in and out disconnect etc The UI on the app is absolutely terrible and gets worse with every update Ill never own a Sonos product and complain to my boss to never buy more,mr2evox,1.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr33dl1,Playtek,,78,2025-05-07 15:59:51,,,,I loved their stuff for a long time I am way less in love with it these days Unfortunately its all over my house and would be prohibitively expensive to replace it all but I wont be buying any new Sonos products Their new app is one of the worst implementation of upgrade I have ever seen Practically unusable for the first year and just barely functioning after several,,0.0,1kgxzif
comment,mr3ctmc,peanutbuttercult,,42,2025-05-07 16:45:54,,,,The insistence on Sonos as both hardware and a streaming service is just horrible brand positioning Anyone buying speakers primarily to play music is already going to have Apple Music or Spotify and their superior catalogue and UX but Sonos Radio gobbles up so much real estate in the app that its killed the ability to quickly manage the speakers themselves All the Sonos app ever needed to be was a tool for quickly building out speaker groups and adjusting settings,mr33dl1,1.0,1kgxzif
