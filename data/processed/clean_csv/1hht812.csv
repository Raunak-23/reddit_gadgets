comment,m310p9z,munche,,14,2024-12-20 19:39:01,,,,How many more American companies will place a few campaign contributions to get their Chinese competitors labeled a national security threat People seem fine with the government just banning Chinese companies for imagined crimes because theyre Chinese Meta is gonna win big off of a small amount of lobbying congress about the dangers of TikTok Were going to see a lot more of this under Trump,m2ur9da,1.0,1hht812
comment,m35p6nj,Rhellic,,3,2024-12-21 16:54:37,,,,Yeah I mean not that China is innocent of this Or innocent of anything really But I think the portrayal as this uniquely evil threat is mostly just about economic interests,m310p9z,2.0,1hht812
comment,m37wx2a,Qjeezy,,2,2024-12-22 01:03:18,,,,Whats funny is that the govt left the investigation up to the govt to do So if no agency picks it up and completes the investigation dji is out of luck,m2ur9da,1.0,1hht812
comment,m2vjbnu,mr_biteme,,60,2024-12-19 20:24:11,,,,The biggest problem with this is that there are NO AFFORDABLE alternatives to DJI that are made here USA Its fair to reason that those USAbased companies were definitely pushing for this kind of a ban Its all about the money,,0.0,1hht812
comment,m2yhzwm,shitty_mcfucklestick,,18,2024-12-20 09:01:53,,,,The other factor is that none of the domestic ones are as good according to a YT video I watched that interviewed people about it Research exploration monitoring oil forestry etc would all be negatively affected without access to the tech they have now,m2vjbnu,1.0,1hht812
comment,m3208uj,AnotherBoojum,,18,2024-12-20 23:07:31,,,,Film DJIs have replaced the need for expensive helicopter shots and crane arm setups Ive even seen them replace a boom arm setup because a drone pilot is cheaper and more accessible Individual projects are being greenlit at much lower budgets than previously Were seeing a return tobthe midbudget feature and appropriately funded series Without drones expect to see a lot fewer sweeping dynamic shots,m2yhzwm,2.0,1hht812

comment,m2usq8y,ApathyKing8,,-13,2024-12-19 18:01:42,,,,They have video and audio recording The Chinese government could at any time push an update to bounce all recordings into a Chinese server bank Now you have thousands of recording devices sitting in American homes and businesses controlled by a foreign adversary They could also tell them to just stop working Imagine using them as search and rescue devices after a disaster and China decides they dont want Americans rescued What if they are part of a military operation and now we lose the ability to search and rescue our troops because China decided they dont like whatever side were on This is a bit extreme but they also require Internet connections for a lot of the functionality so now they have access to all of your network from across the globe without needing to crack a password or anything Whens the last time the average person updated their wifi security The Chinese government is untrustworthy and giving them a security audit isnt such a bad idea,m2u8p17,1.0,1hht812

comment,m2vi12z,qtx,,17,2024-12-19 20:17:14,,,,I dont think you understand technology Do you even know how much bandwidth is required to transfer live audio and video of hundreds of thousands of drones at the same time And since they cant use american ISPs they need to use satellites Drones are wireless you can intercept and track any signal using something like wireshark yet no one has ever found anything malicious Youre letting your fantasies run wild theyre not based on reality,m2usq8y,2.0,1hht812
comment,m2ykv9v,Teftell,,9,2024-12-20 09:36:34,,,,Fun fact politicians in general dont know how tech works but they know how to present lobbying as muh national security concern and muh children safety very well Source I live in Russia and they blocked YT entirely during Putins press conference while a high profile local bloger asked not to ban YT,m2vi12z,3.0,1hht812
comment,m2vk0li,ApathyKing8,,-7,2024-12-19 20:27:52,,,,You really think that collecting video remotely turning off drones or accessing poorly secured wireless networks is scifi Theres zero security threat from an adversarial foreign agency with one of the most advanced cyber teams on the planet owning what is essentially a flying computer that has permissions to connect to your phone and wifi No one said it is currently happening but its entirely possible with a single firmware update,m2vi12z,3.0,1hht812

comment,m7g9wvv,CMDR_ARAPHEL,,2,2025-01-16 14:08:27,,,,I agree with your last bit Technical hurdleals can be overcome and malicious gathering would get noticed but NOT without someone looking for it Feel how you want about Chinese products their actions and overall sense of ethics and morality is lacking Especially on a government level So no I dont trust a country where its both preferred and encouraged to finish off a pedestrian after an automobile strike With no standard of morality beyond profit the definition of right vs wrong can change hourly as we already experience in the USA I dont trust the USA government to dp whats right for OUR people nevermind the Chinese Vigilance matters,m2usq8y,2.0,1hht812

comment,m31o98x,red_vette,,3,2024-12-20 21:53:40,,,,Maybe DJI drones have progressed since I got mine a few years ago but they dont have an always on internet connection that uploads massive video files while flying Using a phone is optional over a tablet and many newer ones have a dedicated remote Users can submit content but beyond that having millions of drones streaming 24k content to servers in China just isnt feasible at this time Even the best ones they sell arent going to reveal anything new unless they are purposely flying over restricted areas and thats more of a user problem than a drone made by a Chinese company May just be unclear on what the perceived security risk is,,0.0,1hht812
comment,m2tstay,monologue_adventure,,25,2024-12-19 14:35:24,,,,Guilty until proven innocent because you are Chinese Chinese Americans we need to stay strapped in case we are sent to camps in the future if it comes to war Hard not to think that this would only go badly for CCP,,0.0,1hht812

comment,m2v5ggc,korodic,,-12,2024-12-19 19:09:52,,,,It is a legitimate concern when you consider how Chinas tech industry has incredibly close ties to their elite and how businesses are an extension of their government whereas the US has some separation through privatization Hong Kong no longer has that luxury,,0.0,1hht812
comment,m2wc6lp,control-room,,8,2024-12-19 23:01:50,,,,But many American companies have been shown to have close ties or have helped US law enforcement So would it be fair for other countries to ask American companies to prove a negative because of those actions,m2v5ggc,1.0,1hht812
