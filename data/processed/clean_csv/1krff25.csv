comment,mtcy9n8,towelracks,,783,2025-05-20 20:37:14,,,,I guess this will be approximately 75 of the price of a 5090 and 25 of the availability of the 5080,,0.0,1krff25
comment,mtet5hu,SpeedflyChris,,34,2025-05-21 02:56:26,,,,Are there still availability issues for 5000 series in the US I had a look the other day out of curiosity here in the UK there wasnt any part of nvidias lineup that I couldnt find partner cards for at close to MSRP Ditto the AMD cards Figured it might be in part stock getting redirected because of the tantrum tariffs,mtcy9n8,1.0,1krff25
comment,mtex1e7,NomadicSun,,41,2025-05-21 03:21:58,,,,You can get partner cards at microcenter for 3000 Getting a 2000 FE from Best Buy is essentially impossible,mtet5hu,2.0,1krff25

comment,mte13re,fafarex,,7,2025-05-21 00:08:35,,,,Last gen they did a price reduction and core count augmentation with the 4080 Super Their new strat is to ripoff early XX80 buyer and when the sales dwindle they refresh with the actual product,mte0gpe,4.0,1krff25
comment,mtebfhc,zenithtreader,,10,2025-05-21 01:09:46,,,,4080 didnt sell like at all Distributors had loads of them sitting around and nobody wanted to buy them 5080 got scalped to wazoo and back and there were still people willing to pay 1500 bucks for a card If they failed to rip off players with 5080 like how they failed with 4080 I can see 5080 super being really competitive price wise You got to offload unsold silicons before 6000 series arrive somehow As of now I dont think they have learnt any lesson this generation,mte13re,5.0,1krff25
comment,mtedwcg,fafarex,,9,2025-05-21 01:24:23,,,,5080 got scalped to wazoo and back because they where like 2000 of them available worldwide it didnt actually sell better than the 4080 there is a reason its only 037 of gpu in the steam survey,mtebfhc,6.0,1krff25
comment,mtfxs2x,Plebius-Maximus,,2,2025-05-21 08:53:38,,,,there is a reason its only 037 of gpu in the steam survey How high do you think the 4080 was 3 and a half months after release,mtedwcg,7.0,1krff25

comment,mvzqmt9,RevolEviv,,0,2025-06-04 18:01:59,,,,This is exactly what they will be FORCED to do nobody is gonna buy this at any higher MSRP at this point Too many flaws in the 5000 series and the initial buzz has gone At 989 the super would finally be a half decent GPU for the price and thats some Nvidia sorely needs now after getting their assssses kicked by AMD the rumoured upcoming AMD 90809090XT with 32GB VRAM at cheaper prices than what Nvidia would have LIKED to have sold the super at,mte0gpe,4.0,1krff25

comment,mtdjti7,fullup72,,73,2025-05-20 22:29:31,,,,yes but they learned their lesson from misnaming the 4080 12GB the previous gen This time they dropped the memory size from the name so that early suckers didnt know a larger memory buffer would soon be used,mtd0flc,1.0,1krff25
comment,mtdmurq,NorCalAthlete,,10,2025-05-20 22:46:41,,,,Whats the workaround at the moment Im keeping an eye on this debacle especially with the GN investigation to NVDA Thing is even if all gamers worldwide immediately stopped buying NVDA GPUs for gaming it would hardly make a dent in their revenue and they could probably just kill off the consumer gaming GPUs entirely and be fine at this point,mtd0flc,1.0,1krff25
comment,mte0y5k,CMDR_omnicognate,,25,2025-05-21 00:07:39,,,,Buy AMD cards or wait Currently theres nothing close to the 5090 other than the 4090 and they both have the same flammability issues as does the 5080 The 7900xtx has similar performance without RT to the 5080 but with 8 pins so it wont catch on fire theyre also cheaper but are getting pretty old now at 3 years old The 9070XT is good price competitive and 8 pin again but its closer to a 5070Ti in performance If you want raw power theres really no alternative to Nvidia beyond just waiting for amd to hopefully make something new with their next generation of cards or hope that Nvidia stops using their flawed 12 pin or at least adds a second connector to somewhat reduce the load on the cablespins,mtdmurq,2.0,1krff25
comment,mtecmtg,Jfigz,,2,2025-05-21 01:16:54,,,,Does the 5070 TI have flammability issues too Was thinking of getting that eventually,mte0y5k,3.0,1krff25
comment,mteffzj,Stubs_Mckenzie,,5,2025-05-21 01:33:29,,,,there are a few 5070tis with 2x612 pin connectors so dont buy those but most of them dont use the problematic power connector,mtecmtg,4.0,1krff25
comment,mtejsvo,OctopusKeep,,7,2025-05-21 01:59:14,,,,5070Ti also draws like 240250w max load shouldnt be an issue,mteffzj,5.0,1krff25
comment,mtgbpku,CMDR_omnicognate,,1,2025-05-21 11:05:59,,,,In theory yes the issue is with the 12 pin connector design as well as the pins on the board side though they will be a lot less prone to breaking just down to them using less power,mtecmtg,4.0,1krff25
comment,mtge2w8,Mhugs05,,2,2025-05-21 11:24:15,,,,There really hasnt been anymany issues with the 5080 and cables melting It uses far less power than the 5090 and a good amount less than 4090 too There was a melting cord tracking thread around here somewhere and last I remember all if not majority of the few 5080s on the list were not confirmed to be faulty cards,mte0y5k,3.0,1krff25
comment,mteblmm,Xetanees,,0,2025-05-21 01:10:46,,,,You can solder your own independent connections through a cable that can handle 700W Or you have to step down to the 5070 Ti in order to get to safe wattage,mtdmurq,2.0,1krff25

comment,mtewd4u,TheRabidDeer,,4,2025-05-21 03:17:23,,,,Dont even buy it if it doesnt use a 12pin 80 class cards shouldnt cost what a 90titan class card cost last generation Remember 2 generations ago the 3080 was 700 If they didnt stop making the RTX 4000 series the RTX 4090 wouldve been better performance for the same price The 7900XTX was nearly the same performance as the 5080 for less when the 5080 first launched NVidia is out of their minds with the prices they are asking and people just keep buying it,mtd0flc,1.0,1krff25
comment,mtf1e5v,Ok-Community-4673,,2,2025-05-21 03:52:55,,,,NVidia is out of their minds with the prices they are asking and people just keep buying it While I also wish things were cheaper that last bit is exactly why Nvidia is not out of their minds They are doing exactly what companies do maximizing profit,mtewd4u,2.0,1krff25

comment,mte1b7a,CMDR_omnicognate,,3,2025-05-21 00:09:50,,,,I think theres two partner board cards that have the 12 pin but double or triple 8pin cards are still the predominant cards I believe,mtdmqha,2.0,1krff25
comment,mtewx0y,TheRabidDeer,,1,2025-05-21 03:21:09,,,,Technically the 7900XTX from the last generation is the top end AMD GPU it does not use a 12 pin Though they might be a bit more scarce now I think,mtdmqha,2.0,1krff25
comment,mteyhdu,Terrible_Truth,,1,2025-05-21 03:31:59,,,,Yeah I know I almost used quotes around top end but didnt want to sound mean or boujee I was disappointed that there wasnt going to be an AMD at the 80 series level Oh well,mtewx0y,3.0,1krff25
comment,mtf3rij,TheRabidDeer,,4,2025-05-21 04:10:43,,,,I mean the 7900XTX IS at the 5080 series level though It just isnt a new card In rasterization performance it trades blows game to game with the 5080 still I am disappointed that they didnt release a current gen XTX though,mteyhdu,4.0,1krff25

comment,mtebr1n,_RADIANTSUN_,,4,2025-05-21 01:11:40,,,,The demand and thus value clearly exists that people want lots of VRAM even if the GPUs compute power is shitty for anything that could occupy that VRAM capacity Many people seemingly are fine with running some big models at shit token rates likeloeer than 20tks So it seems like a no brainer that one of the big players would start going vintage AMD on VRAM as their value strategy and why not Intel VRAM is relatively the cheap part Imagine if the C570 shipped with like 512GB VRAM People would buy the shit out of that to run impressive local LLM models even at shit token rates,mtdnxbw,3.0,1krff25

comment,mte4qqf,JarrettR,,8,2025-05-21 00:30:23,,,,The 48gb Intel GPU is just two separate 24 GB b580s on a single pcb not going to change much for the gaming segment when you cant use more than one of the b580s for gaming One gaming and the other running lossless scaling could be interesting though,mtdlzmj,2.0,1krff25

comment,mtiexan,BlastFX2,,1,2025-05-21 17:47:41,,,,4080 super was basically the same card as the 4080 There was like a 2 performance uplift The names dont mean anything In every metric core count RAM price the gap between the 5080 and the 5090 is absurdly large Combine that with the fact that the 5080 has the performance of what should be a 5070ti by every generational scaling metric and its clear the real 5080 is yet to be released and it should have 2025 higher performance 2024 GB VRAM and cost 1400 You could be right and this might not be the real 5080 yet but the timing and RAM are right,mti1bjt,3.0,1krff25
