comment,m8jvgiv,PabloBablo,,13,2025-01-22 15:42:05,,,,Ok then lets not read the article because its pointless Rage baiting has come full circle,,0.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jwqh4,garry4321,,7,2025-01-22 15:48:00,,,,I dont get it Is the outrage Technology keeps progressing and that scares and confuses me,m8jvgiv,1.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jxnre,wildddin,,4,2025-01-22 15:52:15,,,,I think its because no other computer hardware can actually make use of the data transference speed of gen 5 even meaning there is currently no use case for a gen 6 Youll pay early adopters rax for literally no benefit,m8jwqh4,2.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jyf0e,NorysStorys,,2,2025-01-22 15:55:46,,,,That and 99 of consumers will never transfer enough data all at once or often enough to even vaguely require the types of speeds gen 5 or 6 have It makes a load of sense for data centers editing and vfx rigs studio music production and those kinds of jobs but its just not needed for video gaming internet browsing data entry admin etc,m8jxnre,3.0,1i7dwnb

comment,m94nadb,The_JSQuareD,,1,2025-01-25 18:15:04,,,,The point the article makes is that theyre pushing the envelope in a way that isnt actually very productive Gen 5 PCIe drives tend to be bottlenecked not by the PCIe speed but by their own thermal throttling at least in large file transfers where you can actually make use of the extremely high consecutive transfer speed So rather than bumping the protocol to PCIe 6 it makes more sense to invest in controllers that produce less heat or improvements in heat dissipation Additionally as the article points out in real world scenarios the latency of the storage medium is now typically much more important than its readwrite bandwidth Optane was much better in this regard than NAND flash SSDs but sadly that technology is basically dead So rather than pushing on a metric that is likely to matter in the real world latency the drive developers are pushing a metric that is already near impossible to fully utilize bandwidth Of course technology makers are free to experiment with any technology they wish but its reasonable for tech journalists to point out the flaws in what theyre doing and to warn consumers about getting overhyped about a technology that probably wont benefit them,m8jwqh4,2.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jwzux,mark-haus,,3,2025-01-22 15:49:12,,,,Depends If it were more available on computers I use namely laptops and mini PC servers Id using them as cache disks and swap spaces with high memory swap as a pseudo tier between RAM and regular persistent storage If you had a top of the line ATX motherboard with this sort of thing or enterprise grade server systems you might be able to do this already or soon,,0.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jyhfd,polypolip,,2,2025-01-22 15:56:04,,,,How do the modern SSDs deal with frequent overwrites I remember it used to shorten the lifespan of SSDs but that was long time ago,m8jwzux,1.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8kdr3r,mark-haus,,2,2025-01-22 17:06:20,,,,Especially on desktop usage its an over exaggeration of a problem especially today Even on my database servers that receive the most writes I am at least a magnitude off the yearly writes the disk is rated for,m8jyhfd,2.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8kpio1,polypolip,,1,2025-01-22 17:59:00,,,,Ive had a regular gen 1 or gen 2 nvme that reached its lifetime write number or was close to Within 4 years of usage It had overheating issues though,m8kdr3r,3.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8ssx0v,MasterPong,,2,2025-01-23 21:41:38,,,,Wasnt this the idea behind Intel Optane or am I miss remembering,m8jwzux,1.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jzaku,NorysStorys,,1,2025-01-22 15:59:48,,,,But you just dont need that unless youre doing specialised work like video editing or other high data throughput tasks thats in the realms of high end desktop classification anyway its not something 99 of the market needs The use for these in servers and network storage sure thats a use case but as it stands right now the vast vast majority of people cant even saturate gen 4 for more than a minute,m8jwzux,1.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8k37k1,leandroc76,,2,2025-01-22 16:18:01,,,,Jeremy Laird clearly doesnt understand the difference between theoretical and real world There has NEVER been a full 100 bandwidth device EVERY storage device since inception has to interface an encoder In the PCIE 2 days the encoding scheme was 8b10b which had a hefty overhead penalty With Gen 34 and 5 the PCIE standard moved to a very efficient 128b130b encoding scheme so the overhead penalty is now less than 2 He also clearly doesnt know what the bandwidth is for And its not for gaming Believe it or not there are other uses for a computer If ANYONE has ever edited video or analyzed databases or even machine learning you would know that PCIE is the only standard for PC based computing that opens up bandwidth to Storage GPUs Networking and any data transfer device,,0.0,1i7dwnb
comment,m8jya94,smoothjedi,,1,2025-01-22 15:55:09,,,,That SiliconMotion SM2508 controller for instance peaks at 145 GBs and 14 GBs sequential read and write not the full 16 GBs Safe to say then that the new SM8466 wont hit 32 GBs This is a silly argument Sure maybe it wont hit 32 GBs but even if it keeps the same 78 ratio thats still 28 GBs double the previous generation Id be happy with that,,0.0,1i7dwnb
