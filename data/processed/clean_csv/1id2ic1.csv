comment,m9z8wdo,Abigail716,,11,2025-01-30 08:18:13,,,,My husband restores watches as a hobby the sapphire crystals are only about 5 each when buying them in sets of 20 You can get them individually for about 8 The strap is going to run you another 5 Not sure about the movement cost but individually those are going to run about 30 including free shipping so presumably the price will plummet fast if youre buying them in bulk The case itself is going to very significantly depending on quality what youre looking at anywhere between 10 and 40 depending on the quality for an individual case including shipping These look like a pretty basic design so Im going to guess theyre on the lower end of that scale I would say approximately 60 to 70 to make each watch Depending on how they got the movement to work that could add significant costs so another 20 to play it safe and you have a watch that costs no more than 90 to make on the high end You could achieve this price as long as youre making at least five since custom dials often have a minimum quantity order of around that much They made hundreds between all of the colorways so I would be shocked If this thing is over 60 plus the cost of the Watch box,m9x1hxd,2.0,1id2ic1

comment,ma0ozmw,Abigail716,,2,2025-01-30 15:02:32,,,,Only when he decides he doesnt like them Theyre usually restored to be added to his own personal collection Most of what he actually sells is stuff that he didnt do very well and he would rather just get rid of it and try again He will also sell watches that he restored just to practice his technique The only time he ever does really paying work is for servicing or repairing Patek watches He attended their watchmaking school and in order to stay in their good graces hell do work for them on occasion,ma0ghul,4.0,1id2ic1
comment,m9z9409,ThinkExtension2328,,-3,2025-01-30 08:20:22,,,,Yea thats perfectly awesome if your a watch maker most people dont want to mess with that stuff As your well aware your husband has allot of specialised equipment to build watches For most people that means something that wont scratch by simple daily use,m9z8wdo,3.0,1id2ic1

comment,ma2mwpf,ThinkExtension2328,,-3,2025-01-30 20:28:08,,,,It misses the point that for the end user its still a huge value add if you seriously think you can do what a watch maker does and they are scamming you power to you But youre significantly undervaluing their work skills and equipment,ma13bux,5.0,1id2ic1
comment,mayg0ga,thehatteryone,,1,2025-02-04 17:39:20,,,,No ones saying we can make an equivalent watch for 50 But they are showing a watch manufacturer absolutely can and all the tools easily amortise over the thousandsmillions of items made with them I cant make a smartphone with a 50 BOM itd cost me untold fortunes that doesnt mean that phone should be more then 150 retail,ma2mwpf,6.0,1id2ic1
comment,m9zmj1u,lickmylog,,1,2025-01-30 10:39:56,,,,What a great point The price point must be much higher for a business manufacturing these in larger volumes Its not fair to compare it with the expertise of a hobbyist and the price points available to them,m9z9409,4.0,1id2ic1

comment,ma78ir3,Alucard661,,2,2025-01-31 14:38:24,,,,Just because you can get one at that price doesnt mean thats what it should cost I can also get a automatic for 150000 doesnt mean I expect it to be 150000 I just paid 250 for an automatic bottom of the barrel seiko and I was thinking of upping it to a 500 Hamilton khaki those are bottom tier entry level automatic watches,ma73wrc,3.0,1id2ic1
comment,ma80mdx,Ab47203,,2,2025-01-31 16:55:30,,,,1100 for a watch made of materials grown in a lab is a ripoff Sapphire is no more difficult to manufacture than quartz Why is that a price hike then Marketing Automatic movements are no longer expensive to manufacture Why is there a second price hike Again Marketing Humans have a demonstrable effect of seeing expensive things as higher quality whether they actually are or not 1100 is just asinine for a watch of this caliber Other expensive watches are adorned with natural gems and precious metals What is the ACTUAL justification for this high price other than We wanted money,ma78ir3,4.0,1id2ic1

comment,ma88oy5,Alucard661,,1,2025-01-31 17:32:47,,,,Why do things people want cost money I can make this in 5 minutes Bro just say its too expensive for you and move on This watch is priced correctly based on the materials and movement of you dont think so thats on you dont buy it The fact that it sold out proves it was marketed right and priced correctly or maybe even too low,ma87j3s,7.0,1id2ic1
comment,ma8a6en,Ab47203,,2,2025-01-31 17:39:40,,,,60 in materials being marked up to 1100 for no reason other than marketing If me calling that out is enough to make you start calling people stupid then you seem like an incredibly petty person Why does it bother you I dont like seeing people getting ripped off This watch doesnt have features watches at the 1100 price range should have If the original price wasnt asinine then why did they discount it to less than HALF immediately Its the same shit that the polystone statues were They marketed so hard people didnt realize theyre essentially just epoxy resin marked up hundreds of dollars because of marketing If it bothers you that I call a rip off a rip off then move on If not then explain why this watch has so many markers of a scam stuck onto it,ma88oy5,8.0,1id2ic1

comment,m9x1g49,grendelone,,3,2025-01-29 23:40:45,,,,The entire ring rotates so it doesnt matter which part of the ring you use as a reference point as long as you always use the same one Given the design its probably easiest to spot the UFO on each ring But again you could use any reference point you wanted,m9wy9cr,4.0,1id2ic1
