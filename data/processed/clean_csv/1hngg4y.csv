comment,m42q4h2,chillmanstr8,,2,2024-12-27 19:12:21,,,,Yeah same I found the model a couple months ago but they seem to have discontinued it Was a great keyboard,m41f3s0,1.0,1hngg4y

comment,m42u8pp,-Dixieflatline,,40,2024-12-27 19:34:14,,,,I made this comment like a decade ago on a tech blog and someone with way too much time on their hands actually broke down the science in to a mathematical formula that showed it would require sustained high rate typing for lengthy periods of time to self charge to any real world degree I still have no idea if they were correct in their math and assumptions but I didnt feel doing that level of fact checking on a passing thought But that was 10 years ago Maybe technology has improved to where it is practical today Or maybe that person was full of shit,m429rqi,1.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43jiri,Thereelgarygary,,3,2024-12-27 21:51:30,,,,Idk man id be okay with a keyboard with little springs in the keys that I have to add extra button pushing force to Im picturing a winding sound or like an electric motor sound when you press it,m42u8pp,2.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43kw3u,-Dixieflatline,,11,2024-12-27 21:58:57,,,,The trouble is that even mechanical keys that have long travel are still 4mm max Theres not a lot of captured energy per 4mm finger keystroke where button actuation happens somewhere along that path potentially reducing the amount of kinetic energy applied to electric generation There are walking tiles being tested out in the world now that have only 510mm of travel but they also have the force of a human stepping on them My assumption is that the mechanical resistance is relative to the typical weight of a person plus more area or linear edge for the generator than a key cap,m43jiri,3.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43m94n,Thereelgarygary,,2,2024-12-27 22:06:33,,,,Im not talking about using direct force though throw it through a multiplyer like a windup toy I said spring earlier you know those kids toy cars that you push along the floor and it goes farther than you pushed that mechanism,m43kw3u,4.0,1hngg4y
comment,m4cmi7v,Grimnebulin68,,1,2024-12-29 13:24:50,,,,What about fart power Mine are preeeety potent,m43m94n,5.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43n1r8,Thereelgarygary,,1,2024-12-27 22:10:59,,,,Flywheels Thats what I was looking for Combined with magnets can generate energy it wouldnt feel like a normal key press though it would take longer to oress the keys as your charging the flywheel the amount of energy it would actually generate has to be negligible but maybee enough to power a keyboard,m43kw3u,4.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43r4s3,-Dixieflatline,,6,2024-12-27 22:34:10,,,,Thats all well and good until you consider the miniaturization required to either flywheel each key or gear the entire keyboard to operate one larger flywheel Either miniscule energy or a lot of lost energy depending on which path And dont get me wrong Im not trying to poopoo your inspiration Its the exact same thing I had But there are apparently a lot of real world physics that crushed my dream and Im just paraphrasing what I remember from 10 years ago,m43n1r8,5.0,1hngg4y
comment,m45y5sh,BMLortz,,2,2024-12-28 07:57:38,,,,Just make a kinetic charging pad that you pound on a couple of times full force Get that to market and send me my cut,m42u8pp,2.0,1hngg4y
comment,m44c2ko,shalol,,2,2024-12-28 00:39:51,,,,Nonsense Other than an idle power draw said keyboard wouldve consumed and generated a fixed amount of energy No amount of typing would have it turn from a net loss energy balance to a net gain Itd just be a fixed loss or gain At which point it probably is a feasible idea if not for annoyingly hard to press keys as selfgenerating wireless signal doorbell buttons are a thing that works,m42u8pp,2.0,1hngg4y
comment,m42yoi5,AlephInfinite0,,1,2024-12-27 19:58:13,,,,No idea of the mechanics or physics involved I nice thought though Maybe an OnoSendai rig would have this,m42u8pp,2.0,1hngg4y

comment,m43jog9,MrHodgeToo,,0,2024-12-27 21:52:22,,,,Yeah came here to say this is what would impress me We had solar powered calculators in the 70s Only took us 55 years to get to a keyboard Not impressed,m429rqi,1.0,1hngg4y

comment,m4a0sq6,istareatscreens,,2,2024-12-29 00:33:12,,,,Calculators were doing this in the early 1980s possibly earlier Im surprised this wasnt the default from day 1 of these things The lack of wires is nice but having a nonfunctioning keyboard due to no charge is a deal breaker to me Having had a bad experience Ive always avoided them due to that,,0.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43evqa,Q__________________O,,3,2024-12-27 21:26:12,,,,Thats not new try solar panels on laptops see how that works Go for ultimate efficiency eink display etc,,0.0,1hngg4y
comment,m4ahn7s,raptir1,,4,2024-12-29 02:13:07,,,,The problem is that laptops are often put in bags while not in use as opposed to a keyboard that typically sits out The best solar panels are around 20w per square foot A typical 13 laptop would only be 67 square feet so lets generously say 15W And with the angle of the laptop lid you wont be getting good light plus youre talking indoors You would be lucky to get 5W off of a laptop sized solar panel on those conditions That wont cover even a cellphone processor plus an eink display,m43evqa,1.0,1hngg4y
comment,m43iy2h,Zixinus,,2,2024-12-27 21:48:23,,,,Before reading the article I bet that they will advertise this but the keyboards own battery will be glued in there and not meant to be userreplaceable I also bet that that there is no option to connect the keyboard via keyboard either After reading the article no mention of the above but damn the AI set sounds scary Who wants an AI that which over they have no real control over other than issuing commands to monitor them all day,,0.0,1hngg4y

comment,n6pm2b6,err99,,1,2025-08-03 15:43:35,,,,Theres similar solar wireless keyboard by targus but it uses a 1600 mAh lithiumpolymer battery the lenovo one uses a fastcharging supercapacitor in place of a traditional battery Im not really sure what the difference is or howwhy a super capacitor might be better than the other type of battery,mwme6gv,1.0,1hngg4y
