comment,max58uo,2_bit_tango,,44,2025-02-04 13:44:12,,,,Currently most android with eink is too far behind in security updates to trust with phone stuff Plus the eink screens are slow and not really meant for what people use phones for It works great for reading in my experience not much else Not to mention screen fragilty most models have issues with And price tags on the devices So while I would be ecstatic for an eink phone it wouldnt be able to replace my current phone there would have to be some drastic improvements Even as a dumb phone id be hesitant,mawzupj,1.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mazuzu4,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,12,2025-02-04 21:39:56,,,,The price point is tough for what it offers 500 is a midrange phone not a minimalist eink phone with unupdated android I think boox sells some tablets including a phonesized one that are more affordable and bridge the gap between ereader and android tablet a lot better,max58uo,2.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mazvbua,2_bit_tango,,3,2025-02-04 21:41:32,,,,Ive got a boox Its fabulous for reading but really isnt great for anything else unless you go for their newer larger screen notepad type devices,mazuzu4,3.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mazw8b8,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,2,2025-02-04 21:45:52,,,,I was thinking about getting one for a minimalist writing setupwritedeck Basically just a bluetooth keyboard and boox running google docs I figure it would be cheaper than one of those freewrite digital typewriter things that sell for like 600,mazvbua,4.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0mlmq,fla_john,,2,2025-02-05 00:04:28,,,,Not much cheaper really But then youd have a really nice ereader and note taking device I have one of their 10 color ones and like it The color is nice btw but the monochrome is clearer and faster,mazw8b8,5.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0vdoh,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,2,2025-02-05 00:53:13,,,,The boox palma looks like it runs about 200 used so that and a 30 bluetooth keyboard Not cheap but the freewrites are running like 500600 now But as you say more versatile,mb0mlmq,6.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0z54s,fla_john,,1,2025-02-05 01:13:26,,,,Oh ok I assumed since you were talking about using it as a typewriter that you would be looking at the larger screen Youre right the Palma has a decent price,mb0vdoh,7.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb3o09n,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-02-05 13:27:02,,,,It looks like you get a lot with the bigger tablets but I have a android tablet and a kindle eink reader so I dont really want to get into that degree of redundancy I dont mind the small screen if it is being used as a focused writing firstdraft device The weird angle of the freewrite devices would bug me though,mb0z54s,8.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0n21x,TheWilburnness,,1,2025-02-05 00:07:02,,,,I bought the poke 4 lite for this purpose works great Its only a 6 screen which is really my only complaint Id recommend going large but I went with the one I did because it was only 140 brand new Add a 20 dollar Bluetooth keyboard and its made a pretty good setup Screen refresh rate is great too if you use the fastest setting I use the google docs app and its cursor probably flashes at a similar rate to an iPhones cursor,mazw8b8,5.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0w7ie,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-02-05 00:57:45,,,,Ive been at the Palma About 200 used but it looks like the form factor and battery life would be pretty much what Im looking for If it doesnt work out for writing it would at least be a good handheld ereader Ive also tried out an alphasmart and the viewing angle of the screen on the freewrites just wouldnt do it for me Im sure I can find a keyboard with a tablet stand pretty cheap though,mb0n21x,6.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb7fyfq,Bean_Juice_Brew,,1,2025-02-06 00:25:04,,,,I use a boox note air 2 for notes and reading and its honestly my favorite device If they made their mini ereader phone proportions with telephone capabilities I would be buying it,mazuzu4,3.0,1ihgg1u

comment,mb03eoz,SsooooOriginal,,1,2025-02-04 22:21:09,,,,Would bet it was lack of revenue These are niche devices for a niche market I ended up on the other end loving my galaxy notes until they put the damn curved screen and integrated battery Was too ahead of the times and people didnt like the size until apple started their max lineup,mazn8m2,3.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb05c3q,helbnd,,2,2025-02-04 22:31:00,,,,Quite possibly which is a shame I hear you on the Notes Im back on my old Note 10 after nothing but issues with my z fold 4 I feel like the Note 3 was peak Note,mb03eoz,4.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb08fa4,SsooooOriginal,,1,2025-02-04 22:46:48,,,,I agree unfortunately we are in a place where only the whales last and the minnows claim to shoot for the moon but most are really just hoping to be bought out Note 4 was peak for me Note 7 would have been the homerun had they not integrated the explosive battery Unfortunately battery integration is a unspoken mandate to keep our pocket spies 100 up At least that is my tinfoil More likely if not also it ensures obsoletion through a finite life of the battery My iphone mini has 86 bat health I am not even running it hard Having it as a gps for long trips has been the heaviest use it has seen The degradation is just from normal use over a few years Meanwhile my note 9 is still a battery tank with a shitty curved screen I saw the screen crease and decided to wait until that gets properly fixed But what I really miss is the OG motorola Droid Slide out keyboard with thumb trackpad headphone jack low light cam replaceable battery beta google maps expandable memory,mb05c3q,5.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb09ad8,helbnd,,2,2025-02-04 22:51:18,,,,Ah I skipped the 4 cause I was happy with the 3 Oh man if I could modernise any of my previous handsets the N900 would be WELL up there,mb08fa4,6.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0crlo,SsooooOriginal,,1,2025-02-04 23:09:52,,,,4 was really solid That looks like a predecessor to the Droid same form factor Only missing the thumb trackpad I really liked that for when the touch was acting up trying to edit text,mb09ad8,7.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0ef5k,helbnd,,2,2025-02-04 23:18:54,,,,It was amazing in its day I hate to think what a modern one would cost The N9 was its successor that dropped the physical keyboard and stylus and switched from Maemo Linux to Meego Still a nice handset but missing a lot of what to me made the N900 special Im not sure the droid ever made it to NZ I ran windows phone for as long as possible after the n900 haha,mb0crlo,8.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0ir5s,SsooooOriginal,,1,2025-02-04 23:43:00,,,,Oh shit it had a stylus I missed that part that was ahead of its time for sure Never tried a windows phone the few I knew with one absolutely loved them,mb0ef5k,9.0,1ihgg1u

comment,mazvgf3,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-02-04 21:42:07,,,,Even big phones now are smaller than receivers from actual telephones used to be Those had a design that worked really well for getting the microphone close to the mouth speaker close to the ear and giving you a good grip,mazc9jx,3.0,1ihgg1u

comment,max472u,Loafer75,,21,2025-02-04 13:38:00,,,,Ive wondered why eink display prices are high I would have thought they would be super cheap by now,mawvh6q,1.0,1ihgg1u
comment,max50js,narwhal_breeder,,26,2025-02-04 13:42:50,,,,They are niche compared to LCDs and have a complex manufacturing process thats prone to defects that can scrap the whole panel hence why its not a linear increase in price as screen size goes up just like nonlinearities in cost with die size in semiconductor fabrication Very small eink displays can go down to 3unit at volume so the patent and licensing costs cant be a huge cost driver,max472u,2.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mb0rerd,Peter_Nincompoop,,3,2025-02-05 00:31:18,,,,The answer of why theyre prone to defects is because the laminate was developed by former Polaroid engineers who left to join EInk as a startup You ever hit a Polaroid on its edge prior to developing It delaminates in a similar fashion but the laminate became more stable once the developer paste was spread through the laminate Neither the screens nor the undeveloped film were intended to be handled outside of their cases so they didnt see it as a big issue I know because I worked with the same engineers at Polaroid prior to the company shutting down and then again when I developed the distribution packaging for their 6 screens to travel from the screen plant to the customer who installs them into their devices At the time that was mainly Foxconn but some manufacturers were taking smaller scale screens as well like the Pebble watch,max50js,3.0,1ihgg1u

comment,maxf9pc,narwhal_breeder,,8,2025-02-04 14:41:20,,,,Its licensed by EInk the IP and trademark is licensed out just like it is for ARM EInk itself doesnt manufacture anything it even contracts out its demo panels That doesnt mean prices are artificially high There are many firms competing to lower cost of EInk licensed panels The license costs are insignificant compared to the manufacturing costs as evident by the very low costs of small displays,maxawob,3.0,1ihgg1u

comment,mawyib1,None,,15,2025-02-04 13:02:29,,,,Theres a market for this but as a secondary screen on the back side of the actual phone This way you can use it the same way to consume content Edit photos etc but when flipped it can be used as a simple distraction free ebook reader message Notification Center or even a cool wallpaper easy to know when user is intentionally touching the back panel ebook reader cuz theres a camera array already there,,0.0,1ihgg1u

comment,maxbsfg,thisischemistry,,3,2025-02-04 14:22:08,,,,This is where the idea of allinone devices breaks down At some point you stuff too much into one device and it becomes crappy at a lot of the functions A truly minimal phone should pair well with a great camera so you dont mind carrying both devices Do the picturetaking and editing on the cameratablet and the phone stuff on the much more compact phone I like the idea of a phone being a device to really only make phone calls and display some notifications and such then if you need to do more involved things you pull out a tablet Have the two pair together and not overlap much in functionality,mawu7xq,1.0,1ihgg1u
comment,maydgcx,JAlfredJR,,-1,2025-02-04 17:27:27,,,,thats an exhausting comment Here theres this Instead of the constant but ahccttaully this wont work and Ill keep being miserable you can try a little bit Just saying,maxbsfg,2.0,1ihgg1u
comment,mayjahe,thisischemistry,,2,2025-02-04 17:54:23,,,,Yes there are other products that are in that space My quibble is that they are making a device thats called Minimal phone that they purport is a minimal phone butits not even close to that If this device ticks the boxes that people want then thats a good thing but dont misrepresent what it is Its an eink tablet with other functions such as cameras and a phone The Light Phone is much closer to a minimal phone than the Minimal Phone By the way I also think the Light Phone is far too bulky and could be trimmed down quite a bit but it certainly is a very interesting device,maydgcx,3.0,1ihgg1u

comment,max71ir,narwhal_breeder,,3,2025-02-04 13:54:46,,,,Minimal as in software feature set Its supposed to be a good ereader If you want small minimal phone theres plenty of dumb phones still for sale that drop the eink display,max4sq1,1.0,1ihgg1u
comment,maxasp4,thisischemistry,,-1,2025-02-04 14:16:29,,,,If its minimal in software features then it probably should leave off the ereader aspect You can just get an ereader for that A minimal phone isa phone This seems to be in a very odd space where it has cut down physical aspects but still quite large It has a simple display but still has stuff like both a back and front camera It has a keyboard which takes up a large amount of room especially that huge navigation bar Not to mention the gigantic bezels It seems stuck between a modern smartphone and a large ereader tablet I think they could have gone much further in making it minimal and then they would have had a compelling product This is just a crappy smartphone without many of the benefits of being truly minimal I can get behind the eink and keyboard parts but drop the cameras thin the bezels make that nav bar more part of the keyboard drop the idea of it also being an ereader Someone who wants a true minimal phone would probably want it to be mostly a phone with a few extras rather than a ereader with a phone tacked on,max71ir,2.0,1ihgg1u
comment,maxizoh,narwhal_breeder,,2,2025-02-04 15:01:10,,,,Yes they could have but other companies already do this This isnt designed obviously for people who want the most minimal phone possible Its designed to support a featureset the creators and their assumptive customers consider holistic Messagingreadingmusicproductivity Its as wide as an iPhone Max while being shorter Not really a 7in EReader size That fits the desires of quite a few people as evident by their kickstarter backings,maxasp4,3.0,1ihgg1u
