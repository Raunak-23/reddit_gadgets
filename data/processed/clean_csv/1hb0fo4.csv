comment,m1xawdb,Sawses,,1,2024-12-13 21:44:33,,,,Reminds me of the Arthur C ClarkeStephen Baxter book The Light of Other Days The gist is that it becomes trivially easy to watch what anybody is doing at any time and theyd have to be watching you in order to know you were doing it Celebrities government officials your neighbors teenage daughter whatever Privacy is abolished within the space of a few years and governments cant really police it effectively People start taking precautions Masks showering in the dark bulky clothes etc One of the precautions is a sort of screencloth mask that lets you project different faces The point is to make you as anonymous as possible and to change it up randomly to make tracking harder And thats before they develop the ability to look back in time with the same fidelity to see what people did before they realized they could be seen,m1clknr,1.0,1hb0fo4
