comment,my8ppt9,MooseBoys,,383,2025-06-17 10:53:32,,,,I hate that fabrication process terminology has become completely divorced from reality The 2nm process has a metal pitch of 20nm ten times whats suggested by the marketing label,,0.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my8typ7,MultiMarcus,,144,2025-06-17 11:25:58,,,,Dont worry they are gonna make it even worse with the new Ångström chips,my8ppt9,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myaquh8,Affectionate-Memory4,,37,2025-06-17 17:25:52,,,,Thats what the A in A20 means This is an Ångstrom node but the pitch is 200Å not 20Å,my8typ7,2.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myauqk7,Killah57,,37,2025-06-17 17:43:15,,,,A stands for Apple in this case Its the iPhoneIpad SOC name not the manufacturing node,myaquh8,3.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myavm43,Affectionate-Memory4,,12,2025-06-17 17:47:11,,,,Ah Ive confused the chip and node names They have A16 coming as a node and I thought they renamed 2nm,myauqk7,4.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myb01t6,kayson,,74,2025-06-17 18:07:14,,,,It was never about metal pitch It was transistor gate length which is smaller The physical gate length and marketing dimension diverged a long time ago because no one actually cares about the gate length in an absolute sense What matters is the improvements in and tradeoffs between power performance and area When the device structure changes you can get a leap in improvement for the same transistor length No one in the industry really cares about this Theyre not trying to trick anyone and everyone understands what tbe number means,my8ppt9,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,mydwda4,CavemanSlevy,,1,2025-06-18 03:14:36,,,,I might be wrong but my understanding is that gate length only stopped being important around 2010 when we reached about 10nm and could really make it any smaller without running into quantum issues with electrons,myb01t6,2.0,1ldj5s0

comment,myus0zy,account312,,0,2025-06-20 18:18:56,,,,Its ridiculous to say that labeling them with a quantity and a unit when it isnt that is anything other than deliberately deceptive Yes experts in the field know that its not accurate but its just so obviously going to convey a false impression to everyone else that marketing departments whose job it is to be aware of that sort of thing surely intend it,myb01t6,2.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my8zelb,ItemFast,,42,2025-06-17 12:04:12,,,,The marketing label of a process node like 2nm no longer reflects the actual physical dimensions of the transistors as evidenced by metal pitches still being around 20nm you are correct However it signifies generational improvements in performance power and density the real determinants of chip efficiency lie in the standard cell libraries and design enablement Factors such as cell height track count transistor arrangement and routing congestion play a far more critical role in actual area efficiency and performance than the nominal transistor size Advanced architectures like GAAFETs may reduce transistor footprint but without well optimized libraries and physical design strategies those benefits cant be fully realized Moreover system level innovations such as chiplet integration and 3D stacking increasingly contribute more to real world performance gains than simple transistor scaling Ultimately a smaller transistor isnt inherently better what matters is how effectively its used in the design ecosystem and thats where the library and design tools make all the difference Samsung has the same metal pitch as TSMC but draws more power for the same level of performance If you count the market as not transistor but aunfortunately not standardized transistor type Cell library performance Power use age per mm2 per work done Than you will actually find that it tracks pretty wellcompanies like intel stayed stuck in 14 for that reason their libraries barely changed then they changed their name to fit better with TSMC which only IMO ruined what TSMC has pretty much standardized for itself and what you can expect,my8ppt9,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myaak62,ElectronRotoscope,,22,2025-06-17 16:10:41,,,,If it doesnt signify a physical measurement it could be literally any other term Letter grades generation numbers codes names of dog breeds anything else would be less confusing than using a specific physical measurement for if you look at the performance stats it has the vibe of as if it was shrunk to 2nm even though it isnt,my8zelb,2.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myecgi4,danielv123,,3,2025-06-18 05:11:31,,,,Sure but how long would it be before we got the ultra pro max mini node Any naming scheme is fine as long as you dont keep switching,myaak62,3.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myblbsp,sold_snek,,5,2025-06-17 19:47:52,,,,Yeah I agree Considering how long it was used as literal physical size I figured thats what it still was,myaak62,3.0,1ldj5s0

comment,myf4ro9,PaulR79,,1,2025-06-18 09:38:23,,,,Oh always bad joke 2nm process but a metal pitch of 20nm so my bad joke was that they made the new iphone the thinnest ever by making it 1 meter long,my9jtud,3.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my97xrn,TheSpatulaOfLove,,105,2025-06-17 12:57:36,,,,Im not sure Im ready for a foldable The ones Ive seen seemed to be a bit meh and Im certain Id trash it in short order,,0.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my9dww7,thelionsmouth,,152,2025-06-17 13:31:20,,,,Not trying to fanboy but Apple in the past has been able to take tech that hasnt performed well and make it user friendly and marketable Im hoping this is the case but Im not as 100 confident as I used to be,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my9p1o5,potatoboy247,,47,2025-06-17 14:28:58,,,,I know this isnt the Apple of old but i believe theyve stated they wont release a foldable until theres no crease in the screen,my9dww7,2.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myas987,snapplesauce1,,32,2025-06-17 17:32:07,,,,My buddy has a foldable galaxy Hes 2 years in and the screen is separating at the crease Like a big long bubble at the crease which looks awful To be honest I thought it looked awful before the bubble Just a giant line going through the middle of every video,my9p1o5,3.0,1ldj5s0
comment,mydtyak,MattBSG,,7,2025-06-18 02:59:27,,,,If its just air and maybe some debris he may be lucky if its just the screen protector theres one on from the factory to protect the softer flexible panel Lots of phone shops can replace that for you just a plastic piece Its a wearable part and it needs to be replaced everyone once and a bit,myas987,4.0,1ldj5s0

comment,myg6zfd,TheFaceBehindItAll,,4,2025-06-18 13:56:54,,,,My z fold turns 4 in August and have had this bubble a few times definitely just the screen protector The factory one lasted only around 8 months third party ones have been around 12 years before they start getting bad,mydudjv,6.0,1ldj5s0
comment,mygle5p,Userybx2,,2,2025-06-18 15:06:54,,,,Thats the screen protector not the screen The same happend on my Fold with the factory applied screen protector as well after a year I simpls removed it and applied a new one,myas987,4.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myedr9o,officer897177,,2,2025-06-18 05:22:04,,,,With extended use foldable as we know it just arent viable for the premium brand like Apple Anything folding on the market today looks and feels like cheap plastic Im interested to see what they cook up but they sure as hell arent going to take chances on a flagship iPhone,myas987,4.0,1ldj5s0

comment,mysnrcj,Curse3242,,1,2025-06-20 11:46:07,,,,Yeah and foldables being squarish also isnt great Thats why I keep saying the next big smartphone boom has to be extendable screens The ones that stretch out as needed Just turn my normal sized phones into a 169 tablet whenever I want for content Id buy that in an instant,myas987,4.0,1ldj5s0

comment,mz2k0a5,obi1kenobi1,,1,2025-06-21 23:58:58,,,,Its not even about marketing Apple typically waits until a technology is perfected or until they can introduce some twist to turn it mainstream before they jump into a new market For several years Apple was still making flagship phones with LCDs when the competition had switched to OLED and they didnt even introduce an alwayson OLED until a full decade after the competition but youve probably never seen an iPhone with burnin The Apple Watch was late to the market but now a decade later its the only smartwatch anyone still talks about The HomePod was super late to the market and admittedly that was an example where their tweaks and improvements to the smart speaker concept didnt really make it a success but people seem to like to use them as AirPlay speakers Even the iPod didnt come out until many already considered the MP3 player a dead fad but it was so fundamentally different from mainstream flash players and more sleek and user friendly than the few hard drive jukeboxes that predated it that it rewrote the entire rule book and now many people think it was the first MP3 player And of course the iPhone had been rumored for like half a decade before it was finally announced Nowadays theyre not quite as good at that strategy as they once were as the HomePod and Vision Pro prove Even when its technically superior than the earlier efforts by other companies that doesnt always matter and they seem to be really bad at marketing new ideas now that all the big visionaries have left the company But either way the reason Apple doesnt have a folding iPhone yet is because theyre not confident the technology is there yet and competitors products have proven that true Apple has never really cared about being first to market they want to be successful and ensure that the technology is viable,my9dww7,2.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my9jjbf,Rpcouv,,7,2025-06-17 14:01:27,,,,I loved my fold 3 and 5 I switched to an iPhone because of work Id be first in line for a tablet sized foldable iphone,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,my9k275,Bderken,,6,2025-06-17 14:04:10,,,,I have a fold 6 and yeah its meh Main phone is iPhone But no app support on galaxy foldable Even the default messaging app is horrible I wont get a folding phone for 5 years until every single aspect is polished Hopefully Apple does it,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myeastt,hweird,,1,2025-06-18 04:58:04,,,,Yea I buddy of mine has one of the Samsung foldable ones and he liked it for the first month or so but visually you can see the crease now and he said even physically you can feel it sometimes too,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myexulv,FdPros,,1,2025-06-18 08:30:03,,,,i had a z fold 4 and now an oppo find n5 long term durability is still a concern compared to normal phones but it apart from that it works well its as thin as a normal phone but with an option for a bigger screen anytime,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0
comment,myoo9lk,YUNoCake,,1,2025-06-19 19:37:57,,,,Did you see the latest Moto Razr models Ive tested a few in the store and I think that they look way better than the Samsung Flips The crease is barely noticeable feel pretty sturdy and somehow they are way cheaper for very similar specs Anyways Im confident that Apple will manage to step this up even further And probably like with the iPhone X the first foldable iPhone will be a bit of a failure but theyll learn from the experience and come out with great ones afterwards,my97xrn,1.0,1ldj5s0

comment,mylau3i,Sethithy,,2,2025-06-19 06:59:43,,,,It just depends on your use case if I could spend 2k and get the functionality of both and iPhone AND an iPad in one device that fits in my pocket that might be worth it Android tablets have always been inferior to iPads so it makes sense that foldables that run android have been lackluster for most people,mybna79,1.0,1ldj5s0

comment,myczf6y,TheGreatSoup,,7,2025-06-18 00:03:58,,,,I would love a foldable iPhone I been seeing foldable androids and the most recent ones I feel the crease as been minimal I can see it but as soon it light sup it just disappear A foldable iPhone would be at least feel more different that every slab iPhone,,0.0,1ldj5s0

comment,mycya4p,StefanSalvatoreReal,,3,2025-06-17 23:57:20,,,,It will not only depend on if they can make it right but also how they market it Personally I dont care about a regular iPhone that can fold into half its size What I would love is an iPad Minisized iPhone that folds into a regular iPhone Pro Max size give or take Considering the durability concerns as well as the fact that the iPad Mini sells well Im not really sure if the investment will be even worth their time,,0.0,1ldj5s0

comment,mybj6n1,krectus,,-5,2025-06-17 19:37:32,,,,no but they should stop making headlines like this seem like it is a big deal when it doesnt lead to any more improvement than the standard yearly improvements when they dont move to a smaller node size,my97swl,2.0,1ldj5s0
