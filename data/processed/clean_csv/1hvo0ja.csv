comment,m5zf0tp,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2025-01-08 02:22:40,,,,They have all the tools they need basically Shield Pro 2 could literally be same thing but with modern chipset even more comprehensive modern codec support maybe actually good specially for gaming AI motion interpolation and even better AI upscaling And it would be the best thing on the market,m5xmou6,2.0,1hvo0ja
comment,m63m7rd,TeutonJon78,,1,2025-01-08 19:36:35,,,,If they do it will just after the new Switch comes out since they use the same chipsets But likely they will decide that market isnt worth the silicon allotment which could be spent on printing money with AI focused stuff,m5xmou6,2.0,1hvo0ja

comment,m69fcv8,Drizznarte,,0,2025-01-09 18:03:51,,,,I think there might be an interesting change in gaming coming up due to AI in the next decade One where instead of an image being stored as 3d data textures and rendered instead every frame is hulcinated by generative AI This could lead to a revolutionary change It fixes a bandwidth problem with large games at some point the model to create the game world generativly will be smaller than the data needed to store the same world,m69arqo,3.0,1hvo0ja

comment,m5vd2z2,Muggaraffin,,27,2025-01-07 13:51:17,,,,I used Google last week and since I have no choice apparently the AI suggestions were at the top and literally both questions were as wrong as possible It was hilarious I was looking for a new phone SIM and I googled whether the SIM deal includes international minutes The AI suggestion stated This SIM deal does include international minutes But just to double check I went to the providers website and literally the top line even with the same formatting the AI suggestion was literally the same layout and format stated This SIM deal does NOT include international minutes It wasnt like I was asking for it to devise a life plan for me or to cure world hunger It literally got the most basic question wrong from a website that was the top link and the text was the top line And it did the exact same thing for something else I googled later that day cant remember what it was But something equally as basic,m5umc5t,1.0,1hvo0ja

comment,m5v8fs8,Terrible_Yak_4890,,4,2025-01-07 13:20:48,,,,Jensen Huang and Nvidia are every bit as much at fault for the hype as Sam Altman Eric Schmidt Mustafa Sulaymen Musk Hes hyping his hardware as being the best for running AI This is the second that Ive seen CES where he appeared on stage with a bunch of robots as props that do nothing and talking about how fantastic this years Nvidia products are and often in a language that is absolutely obscure to me given the jargon Hes got the trademark look that hes adopted for himself all black with a black leather jacket a riff on Jobs outfits Nvidia is riding everyone elses hype as well,m5upx7t,2.0,1hvo0ja

comment,m5uwuno,mcdithers,,15,2025-01-07 11:50:32,,,,Hes not wrong The current state of AI is artificial but hardly intelligent Its basically a souped up google search and companies are using it to make life altering decisions for the masses See health insurance grading college papers mortgagecredit decisions insurance underwriting and scamming CEOs into thinking its actually useful I could go on but I think Ive made my point Edit I forgot the most important reason it sucks It gives CEOs a scapegoat when shit hits the fan No human in this company made the decision It was the algorithm so we cant be held accountable,m5utdeo,2.0,1hvo0ja
