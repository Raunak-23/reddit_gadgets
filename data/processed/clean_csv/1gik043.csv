comment,lvarkr1,SonicPavement,,3,2024-11-04 04:12:15,,,,I remember there were two options for controls of the Sonic game One worked way better than the other for me and made the game playable is what I remember,lv60caz,1.0,1gik043

comment,lvako0s,obi1kenobi1,,4,2024-11-04 03:24:08,,,,I remember showing someone my brand new iPod Classic in college in 2007 I said it could even play videos and when I showed him I think it might have been Office Space or something like that he was blown away by how good it looked because in those days everyone just automatically assumed video on a portable device played at like 10fps,lv60mwc,1.0,1gik043

comment,lvlxg8a,OlsroFR,,1,2024-11-05 23:19:15,,,,Check this Even if you have only preserved games you can help at reducing the amount of distinct accounts to get all games which makes the syncing process more convenient for users,lv65vd5,1.0,1gik043
