comment,lxyxrca,need-help-guys,,4,2024-11-19 18:47:55,,,,I mean given the headlines coming out now this could be their way to hedge their bets kind of like Fuchsia was thought to have been a contingency plan if Google hadnt won against Oracle If Google is forced to give up Chrome or at least severely cut its ownership or control over it they might see a reason to actually beef up Android for other form factors now Chrome has been Pichais darling but he may not have a choice This also spells the death of Samsung DeX too,lxy0iq5,2.0,1gv07ie

comment,lxy71uh,zoobrix,,26,2024-11-19 16:36:53,,,,It will have the same problems that Android tablets do where many apps dont scale well to the larger screen they are often both ugly and dont take advantage of the extra screen space Plus it wouldnt have things like adobe software that a lot of people use for work on their macs So it wont look as good or be as useful as a MacBook but it supposed to rival a MacBook pro Ya no its not going to but clickbait gonna clickbait,lxxy4wf,1.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxyi749,Pantim,,10,2024-11-19 17:31:47,,,,Yeah Most likely But maybe it will force app devs to fix the scaling windows and other stuff also Hopefully At least fix all the stupid physical keyboard issues that still linger on both Android itself and apps I guess apps are currently in mostly in control of how physical keyboards work But Google could force the issue at an Os level with this android on a laptop move,lxy71uh,2.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxyjkfp,Buttersaucewac,,8,2024-11-19 17:38:31,,,,Weve been waiting 15 years for the scaling issues to be fixed on tablets Ive lost count of how many times Ive seen maybe this will be the thing that forces devs to fix scaling If it hasnt happened by now I dont think its going to happen,lxyi749,3.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxysfv5,BigLan2,,5,2024-11-19 18:21:51,,,,The Nexus 7 was supposed to fix it 10 years ago Samsung keep producing decent devices but nothing changes Googles had a few premium tablets in the last few years but nothings happened They just dont have the market share to make devs take notice the way the iPad does,lxyjkfp,4.0,1gv07ie

comment,lxzol6k,FastestSoda,,3,2024-11-19 21:02:50,,,,Full disclaimer Im posting this on a iPhone I never understood people who said Apple products just work I had spent my entire life using Android products which fucking suck and dont just work That is however my experience with every single software I use so I assumed that was the norm Some way or another I got my hands on a fully new iPhone 12 back when that was the latest product Excited to finally have an expensive device that doesnt require tinkering I booted it and it showed a menu for first setup It had a curious feature for moving from an Android to a iPhone called Move to iOS Excellent Except it didnt work The Android side of this downloading the app on the Play Store worked correctly as in it loaded but the iOS side was stuck on a loop Never mind then Ill just do it later except three days later when I thought maybe the bug was fixed I discovered that that process can only be done on first boot for some godforsaken reason so I had to factory reset my device After this I wanted to download the App Store specifically to download Whatsapp The App Store kept itself on a reboot cycle closing and opening again and again until I created an entirely new account Though I have never had anymore problems with my Apple phones Ive had 3 iPhones since then and NEVER has the Move to iOS option worked though those shocked me when the expectation was It just works,lxzgmgx,4.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly00viv,SexyOctagon,,3,2024-11-19 22:04:47,,,,Yeah theres always a bit of that Like I can control my Apple TV with my phone 95 of the time but theres always times when it just cant find the damn thing in the app Lately I had to factory reset my AirPods because the sound start out centered but would always move more to the right side after a minute or two And many times Ive tried to airdop something only for it to not work,lxzol6k,5.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxznbgz,pinkynarftroz,,-5,2024-11-19 20:56:31,,,,Apple is the perfect balance It can just work but in the chance you need to tinker you can always open the terminal and type sudo,lxzgmgx,4.0,1gv07ie

comment,ly0uy7y,MachinaThatGoesBing,,2,2024-11-20 00:53:10,,,,God this has been true since at least 2012 when I started a job working with iPads in a school This was a market they were specifically targeting and the MDM features they provided felt extremely halfassed for years Some still felt that way when I left in 2021 And more than any other platform I felt like I was always fighting the Macs we had as part of our mix This is true for a friend of mine who also works with these devices in a professional IT context too I get this feeling with my personal iPad too just using it at home I own it only because theres just not a good enough Android tablet with a long enough support window Apple designs for the 90th percentile which is common but their designs frequently feel actively hostile to those in the remaining population which is not as common For me at least there are other systems that come closer to just working while also accommodating my needs,lxzo016,6.0,1gv07ie

comment,ly2iw37,MachinaThatGoesBing,,1,2024-11-20 08:15:14,,,,Honestly I moved ours to AD at one point to solve some of the issues we were having with the everreduced capabilities of the Server app and some reliability issues with Apples printer sharing It was fine for logins but my god was it a mistake to try to do network home directories The fuckers slowed to a crawl just absolutely killing the network and server with all the constant chattering into the Library folder I had to put a stop to that But we still needed the kids to have access to their network storage And most of our Macs were at the elementary so I basically had to brew up a script to mount each kids network home automatically and put a shortcut in the dock I was doing so much shell scripting on them just to make things usable by the end The gift I left whoever replaced me though was finally winning the debate based on replacement costs and replacing them all with Windows machines the last summer I was there,ly1crvc,8.0,1gv07ie

comment,ly0r0dq,MachinaThatGoesBing,,3,2024-11-20 00:30:25,,,,Not anymore Drivers dont exist for all their custom silicon and other devices yet and theyre not keen on sharing with open source devs So while installable Asahi the only significant distro currently targeting Apple silicon has major deficiencies on most Macs Last time I looked which was a while ago not even sound worked reliably It seems the speakers are working now on most or all Macs but the mic isnt And while they contribute their changes and kernel drivers upstream it takes a while for these things to make their way into a Linux kernel release so stable releases from other distros are nowhere near this level of compatibility yet,lxypwjd,4.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxze0ps,daOyster,,2,2024-11-19 20:10:00,,,,You can already install a lot of linux desktop apps and access them with something like Termux if they have Arm64 builds available You can even use proot to give your android device a full Linux environment running your favorite distro if you want right now,lxypwjd,4.0,1gv07ie
comment,lyduzos,benanderson89,,1,2024-11-22 08:01:53,,,,Android is Linuxbased Not as you know it it uses the Linux Kernel but its not GNULinux so its a bit more effort than its probably worth,lxyk8tj,3.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly125bd,grambell789,,1,2024-11-20 01:35:02,,,,Considering how phone interfaces have been growing the scale up from phone to laptop isnt very big anymore Its pretty much just a switch from portrait to landscape which a lot of apps do when they auto rotate It would be a niche solution for a few years but its a good time to try,lxy71uh,2.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly0hfp2,big_troublemaker,,0,2024-11-19 23:34:47,,,,Currently using android tablet in both normal and laptop modes and the experience is better than with ipads pro I used previously so no thats not true,lxy71uh,2.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly0jhmn,zoobrix,,2,2024-11-19 23:46:40,,,,That wasnt the comparison though it was pitching a laptop using Android OS as a MacBook replacement not an ipad replacement An android tablet and an iPad are far closer as products And if the iPad doesnt have the android app you want the sure but having used both an iPad is better integrated with its keyboard and more apps look better and use the screen space more effectively I dont mean to say that Android tablets are bad but they can be a little janky at times And although I could see reasons for wanting an android tablet over an iPad an android laptop is not going to be a MacBook pro rival which is what the article pitches Not in terms of flexibility power or available programs,ly0hfp2,3.0,1gv07ie

comment,ly1gjz5,DigitalPriest,,4,2024-11-20 03:00:15,,,,Only after taking the Nexus line out behind the shed and putting two in the head Then after years of zero AOSP options and huge demand Google introduced the Pixel Google is just as legendary for Old Yellering hardware as they are their own apps Stadia Dropcam Chromecast Googles Achilles heel will always be their inability to commit to the consumer and it will always make them the last choice compared to Apple and I say that as a lifelong Android user,lxzl9o8,3.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly2ludf,caspy7,,1,2024-11-20 08:48:15,,,,Im not disagreeing with anything you said just pointing out this is specifically a Pixel branded laptop And that may have been done intentionally to communicate similar treatment as Pixel phones,ly1gjz5,4.0,1gv07ie

comment,lxze7l9,Marcellus111,,3,2024-11-19 20:10:58,,,,This was not about Google choosing to split from Chrome but the DOJ forcing them to sell itits been all over the news lately that the DOJ is considering forcing such a sale Yes there is the Chrome Browser and Chrome OS but Chrome OS is built around the browser as its central functionthe browser is the core component of the OS How likely is Google to keep an OS that they no longer control the core component of rather than transition to another OS where they have more control,lxzbtbw,3.0,1gv07ie
comment,lxzh9h7,None,,-1,2024-11-19 20:26:19,,,,Google pretty much removed extensions with their recent Chrome updates so I would say neither one is going to be sold They already have the control they need,lxze7l9,4.0,1gv07ie
comment,ly9ruha,Marcellus111,,1,2024-11-21 17:03:38,,,,News out today that the DOJ says Google has to sell Chrome Sounds like the judge will make a final determination in April so its not a done deal yet but it seems likely Extensions have nothing to do with it whatsoever Google has plenty of control youre right and thats why the DOJ is saying they have to sellthey have too much control of the market,lxzh9h7,5.0,1gv07ie

comment,lxz8a1z,danieledward_h,,3,2024-11-19 19:41:02,,,,I definitely think theyre trying to make a play at Androids desktop mode to flesh it out Personally as a professional Android engineer I dont like this approach Not because its not a good idea I actually think having one unified OS and potentially even one device that handles all computing needs for the typical user is the mobile future both Google and Apple are moving toward just have a phone that you plug into a desktop setup or a laptop or just use as a phone and it can handle all three use cases for the average user not necessarily power users Android though has too much fragmentation of OS adoption too many apps running on legacy code too many companies that only develop for portrait slab phone use cases too much SoC diversity etc If they go this direction I imagine users will officially be limited to specific apps that meet whatever desktop mode standards they put in place probably with some way to enable all apps via the dev menu or something else and will probably only be limited to Pixels which introduces its own issues since Tensor lags behind Apples M chips and Qualcomm chips in performance battery and heat management So end of the day I dont see Android desktop mode being really usable in the short term maybe even relatively long term unless you want to hard commit to Googles software ecosystem and a few close partners In the short term I do think Google needs a full blown desktop OS ChromeOS is not viable for most professional settings that require more than just email and basic computing and their penchant for making high end devices will always fail because someone who wants to buy a high end laptop likely doesnt want such a stripped back OS I just think they need to mirror Apples approach of just running on ARM processors and making Android apps usable on the device maybe through some kind of sandbox or something but not actually running Android as the main OS would likely be best to opt for some kind of heavily customized version of Linux the way Valve has had some success with SteamOS as a faux console experience,lxy654m,1.0,1gv07ie
