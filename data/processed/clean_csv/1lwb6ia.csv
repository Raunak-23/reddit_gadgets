comment,n2hsiaa,AgentDoty,,1,2025-07-11 04:30:35,,,,Theres no immunosuppressants with this How was the cure developed A team at Peking University Beijing China extracted cells from three patients with type 1 diabetes and reverted them to a pluripotent state from which they could be converted to different cell types in the body These induced pluripotent stem cells iPSC were then used to generate clusters of islet cells which would then be transplanted back into the patients Two and a half months later the first patient to receive the transplant was producing enough insulin to no longer need external injections she has remained insulin independent since for more than a year Deng Hongkui the lead scientist in the study states the results for the other two patients in the study are also very positive Those patients would have reached the oneyear mark in November it is hoped that when the results are published the trial could be expanded to more patients4,n2hqk27,3.0,1lwb6ia
comment,n2hti73,Bostonterrierpug,,1,2025-07-11 04:37:59,,,,Taken from the medical paper the news story was discussing Because T1D is an autoimmune disease an autologous islet transplant would likely still necessitate the use of immunosuppressants However this patient was already on immunosuppressants for a transplanted liver and this allowed the assessment of therapeutic capacity of CiPSCislets without adding to the patients immunosuppression burden but insight into potential autoimmune response was limited,n2hsiaa,4.0,1lwb6ia

comment,n2i0m50,DishRevolutionary593,,1,2025-07-11 05:33:51,,,,To this day having type 1 for over 20 years I have thankfully never needed to use glucagon But I always have it and keep refilling the prescriptions Have one in my travel kit car nightstand ect Having one implanted and not rejected by the body would be a comfort of relief that a nontype 1 diabetic would absolutely never understand,n2e72dg,1.0,1lwb6ia
comment,n2iewag,ASapphireAtSea,,0,2025-07-11 07:40:11,,,,Im skeptical Thats a small amount of glucagon and Im assuming its actually glucagon the same stuff we Type 1 diabetics get in the powder and saline syringes A four week wearlife is also much too short to be really worth it for the vast majority of diabetics I havent used a glucagon in 10 years for example though this might be geared more towards less stable diabetics I dont know how specific their proposed use case got Theres also the risk of it just breaking 3D printed polymer is really troubling Thats just cheaply made plastic with unknown toxicity Is it a resin print In which case how can they guarantee the plastic has no uncured resin You mostly cant Is it the more common layer by layer FDM print How can you be sure it wont snap in half Or degrade What plastic did they use PLA is very fragile ABS not so much also not so agreeable to the body though it doesnt seem to be an injectable capsule A step in the neat direction like the purportedly inaccurate yearlong eversence CGM but not really a significant aid for the vast majority of diabetics out there,,0.0,1lwb6ia
comment,n2j7n5y,RowFlySail,,3,2025-07-11 11:49:21,,,,Im a former paramedic now in engineering I fully agree with your concerns baout the medication Glucagon that we carried in the ambulance needed to be reconstituted in saline before administration because the powder was supposed to have a longer shelf life Maybe they have a more shelf stable liquid form now Im seeing Google results say 1836 months However this medication would essentially be stored at body temperature likely reducing its shelf life As for the 3D print aspect you raise valid concerns but professional grade 3D printing is probably pretty safe for this type of application Theyd use appropriately studied materials and have a QA process Or at least under a competent FDA they would have to,n2iewag,1.0,1lwb6ia

comment,n2dwio9,mjtwelve,,8,2025-07-10 16:07:57,,,,Um its the opposite Its a glucagon release system if your sugars go dangerously low it releases a hormone that triggers the liver to start generating energy from glycogen Its an insulin antagonist,n2dlgun,1.0,1lwb6ia
