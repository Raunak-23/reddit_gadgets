comment,m637cx0,cockyjames,,141,2025-01-08 18:25:13,,,,I hope lower price doesnt mean additional ads I have an AppleTV because its the cleanest streamer I will pay a premium for the OS to stay that way,,0.0,1hwlezg
comment,m63twig,None,,78,2025-01-08 20:13:48,,,,Its THE best streaming device and its not even remotely close Its in STier while the rest in is DF I truly hope they dont include ads,m637cx0,1.0,1hwlezg
comment,m66pdfl,IncapableKakistocrat,,17,2025-01-09 06:21:40,,,,Literally my only complaint with it is theres no web browser so the only way to cleanly use Stremio is to open it on my phone or iPad an mirror the screen,m63twig,2.0,1hwlezg
comment,m650jh1,Ruttagger,,-22,2025-01-08 23:49:17,,,,Apple TV aint best doesnt even passthrough all audio formats Shield Pro is still on top If the new Apple TV supporta all audio and allows me to install apps like Projectivy so I can eliminate all advertising and garbage menus and have the player launch what I want from startup then ya Ill give it a shot for sure,m63twig,2.0,1hwlezg
comment,m650q8i,None,,11,2025-01-08 23:50:20,,,,Thats a bit above my pay grade so Ill take your word for it Ive heard great things about the Shield not sure why I forgot about it,m650jh1,3.0,1hwlezg
comment,m667wvz,temp1876,,11,2025-01-09 04:05:09,,,,Shield hasnt been updated in ages the pass thru audio isnt a thing that affects 90 of users just those that stream movies from local storage systems and use higher end audio systems Ive seen someone suggest some valid sounding reasons why Apple might not want to implement this but honestly I dont know enough to say it was valid Only reason I know is because Its one of the only gripes about ATV,m650q8i,4.0,1hwlezg
comment,m693p40,GreenRocketman,,2,2025-01-09 17:07:42,,,,Hardware hasnt been updated in five years but Shield is still getting OS updates as recently as 2024 The fact the hardware is as dated as it is and it still outperforms every other device in most categories speaks for itself,m667wvz,5.0,1hwlezg
comment,m6aqpt0,temp1876,,2,2025-01-09 21:53:30,,,,The only area it Outdoes the ATV is audio passthru per owners of both Personally if youve invested the money in audio to care about audiopass thru owning both is not going to hurt your budget If you sank 8k in your home theater and are worried about the cost of a 150 ATV you are bad at math,m693p40,6.0,1hwlezg
comment,m6ar7eo,GreenRocketman,,2,2025-01-09 21:55:54,,,,This was more in response to the claim it hasnt been updated in years than saying its better than ATV It does still get updated and its still a topend device,m6aqpt0,7.0,1hwlezg
comment,m651bzk,Ruttagger,,4,2025-01-08 23:53:43,,,,Ah sorry to nerd out haha Apple TV is probably best for the majority ofnuser Netflix Hulu Disney etc It lacka a few keys features for people like me who run Plex and my own Media Server with a big home theater system It makes me mad because thr Apple TV has better internals for having a snappier UI and stuff like that I hope the new one has everything I need so I can give it a go,m650q8i,4.0,1hwlezg
comment,m660kw1,JoeyBigtimes,,7,2025-01-09 03:17:21,,,,Having all the advertising in the OS sucked the fun out of the shield for me,m650jh1,3.0,1hwlezg
comment,m66u6t1,Ruttagger,,-2,2025-01-09 07:06:44,,,,Ya me too but they all have ads now I installed Projectivy So now when I turn my Shield on it just launches right into Plex If I back out of Plex the main page is just a wallpaper and two apps Plex and F1TV nothing else Its the cleanest UI Ive ever experienced,m660kw1,4.0,1hwlezg

comment,m65xeef,cockyjames,,0,2025-01-09 02:57:46,,,,I actually tried out projectivity but it feels kind of hacky because the base launcher loads up then Projectivity on top of it If the launcher could be switched out entirely like mobile that would be best case scenario I will say Apps Only mode on Google TV gets closer to the experience of Apple TV Its bearable But I also dont know if Google will feel the need to pull it away eventually I get the passthrough audio thing for a very specific subset But it is pretty niche I collect physical and use my Apple TV for apps So I was always going to have compressed audio streaming And Im using actual physical media if I want uncompressed audio and best picture,m650jh1,3.0,1hwlezg
comment,m66ueyp,Ruttagger,,3,2025-01-09 07:08:56,,,,Oh weird I didnt have thay experience with Projectivy at all I have it setup so when I turn my Shield on ot goes right into Plex I dont see anything else If I back oit of Plex the main screen is just a wallpaper with two apps Plex and F1TV Its the cleanest UI Ive ever used,m65xeef,4.0,1hwlezg

comment,m61wyyb,chrisdh79,,47,2025-01-08 14:28:30,,,,From the article Bloombergs Mark Gurman last month reported that the new Apple TV and the new HomePod mini will be equipped with Apples own combined WiFi and Bluetooth chip Gurman said the chip supports WiFi 6E so that could end up being a key upgrade for both devices WiFi 6E extends the capabilities of WiFi 6 to the 6 GHz band enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router The current Apple TV from October 2022 supports WiFi 6 and the upgrade to WiFi 6E seems likely It is unclear if the WiFi 6E capability will be enabled in the next HomePod mini however as Apple has generally kept its HomePod speakers on older WiFi versions For example the current HomePod mini supports outdated WiFi 4 Unsurprisingly the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a newer Aseries chip for faster performance The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021 Apple has released several newer Aseries chips since then including the A16 Bionic A17 Pro A18 and A18 Pro The next Apple TV could have lower pricing Apple analyst MingChi Kuo suggested that the next model could have a sub100 starting price In the US the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for 129 and 149 respectively No major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV but Gurman said Apple has considered adding a builtin camera to a future model tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad If the Apple TV gained a builtin camera users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV,,0.0,1hwlezg
comment,m636nku,paco_dasota,,41,2025-01-08 18:21:55,,,,wifi 4 on a homepod isnt outdated its just a lower spec i mean for an appliance that is basically just a speaker i dont see what it gains from wifi 6 other than to stream more of your data back to apple quicker,m61wyyb,1.0,1hwlezg

comment,m63be5z,Mooselotte45,,12,2025-01-08 18:44:30,,,,They currently let you use 2 HomePod minis or standard HomePods for audio on your Apple TV Would love to have the opportunity to add more channels with more minis or combinations of HomePods and minis Could make a little 51 esque set up for fairly cheap used HomePod minis are basically free on FB,,0.0,1hwlezg

comment,m62weit,incubuster4,,5,2025-01-08 17:32:26,,,,Honestly that is not a bad idea I have purchased enough movies boxsets through appleappletv that I rewatch that I would love to be able to download for rewatching since my internet has data limits I would buy a 256G if they made one and allowed you to download your purchased movies on it If they arent going to do that they should just make it in a smaller version Hell they could make different AirPro versions,m62e0m0,1.0,1hwlezg

comment,m645lfe,Wamadeus13,,-3,2025-01-08 21:10:24,,,,Because Apple likes its products to be seen Gum stick style devices get put behind the tv and forgotten about A larger box with no good way to mount or hide it tends to get placed some where visible and can then with the higher price tag gets to be claimed as a status symbol,m63xms7,2.0,1hwlezg

comment,m6592r6,tooclosetocall82,,1,2025-01-09 00:37:11,,,,The remote doesnt require line of sight so you can very easily stuff it on a cabinet or behind something Im guessing they just dont see it as a core business and dont want to manage that many SKUs,m645lfe,3.0,1hwlezg
comment,m66tq80,ExoMonk,,1,2025-01-09 07:02:15,,,,Yup I have mine stuck behind my TV Have an LG C1 so the apple tv sits on top of that rear boxy thing those tvs have Completely invisible,m6592r6,4.0,1hwlezg
comment,m66yeck,deVliegendeTexan,,1,2025-01-09 07:49:10,,,,dont want to manage that many SKUs Ive been gone from Apple for more than 20 years now but I was there when they were simplifying their lineup coming out of the PowerMac Performa etc era and into G3 iMac iBook era This is close to the mark but not quite it Apple meticulously reviews usage down to the feature level They know how many people use different ports on their computers How many people perform certain kinds of upgrades And they know how much it costs them to engineer and manufacture those features I was there when they decided that internal PCI expansion ports were a pro feature and it really bothered me But when presented with the data it was hard to object they could show that like 95 of people never installed PCI cards and even those who do 95 wouldnt install one after initial purchase of the computer And theyd look at engineering design and manufacturing cost and be able to put a body count together with a number 100k people paid an extra 150 each for this computer so that 100 of them could install a PCI cards 2 years later I wasnt there for the soldered in RAM era but I 100 guarantee this is what happened It sucks I hate not being able to upgrade my RAM but I bet that in the grand scheme of things they realized that a bazillion people whod never do that were paying extra for me to have that ability Which is all to say I dont think Apple is necessarily trying to reduce SKUs just because But they know theyll sell say 300k of them total and it wont be an interesting revenue stream worth all the effort needed to boot up the manufacturing chain for it,m6592r6,4.0,1hwlezg
