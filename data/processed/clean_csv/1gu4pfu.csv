comment,lxy461m,_RADIANTSUN_,,8,2024-11-19 16:22:23,,,,Its a dot matrix printer The only good thing about them is that theyre crazy cheap and reliable Almost every POS terminal has one built in theyre more than proven as workhorses,lxvnqx8,2.0,1gu4pfu

comment,lxteuij,wappledilly,,4,2024-11-18 20:51:11,,,,Agree with the first half a little less on the second Simple upscaling does less to an images actual contents than a typical photoshop touchup that we know many do and those are not disclosed I think it would be a disservice to request disclosing the lesser of the two but not the greater,lxryjin,4.0,1gu4pfu

comment,lxucaxd,ZAlternates,,2,2024-11-18 23:49:59,,,,Be careful when buying anything Toshiba They are stupidly anal about their warranties You have to purchase from an authorized retailer and their idea of authorized is quite strict,,0.0,1gu4pfu
comment,lxvya5t,splittingheirs,,1,2024-11-19 06:04:13,,,,Depends on the country For instance in ours National laws mandate a minimum warranty period for new goods that almost always exceed the manufacturers warranty Which means you can take it back to your place of purchase and they will have to by law handle the warranty for you Which means it is now a problem for the retailer and not you,lxucaxd,1.0,1gu4pfu
comment,lxx6ff7,yepthisismyusername,,1,2024-11-19 13:12:10,,,,This seems absolutely horrible to me I can justify throwing a recalcitrant printer out the fucking window every day of the week and replacing it with a new one But if it has licenses and data on it Im going to put effort into fixing it Nope,,0.0,1gu4pfu
