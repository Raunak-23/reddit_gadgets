comment,lwqox0b,wkavinsky,,2,2024-11-12 12:53:51,,,,Heat rises and the top of the CPU is pointing to the aluminium top creating a column of hot air that the fan can move around Upside down that heat is rising onto the circuit board and not in a column thats in the fans direct airflow,lwo23wr,4.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwpzo1h,LBPPlayer7,,1,2024-11-12 08:45:15,,,,the cooling is engineered with hot air rising in mind and making it suddenly go down can cause it to not work as intended,lwo23wr,4.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwpyh07,AmusedFlamingo47,,1,2024-11-12 08:31:26,,,,If I had to guess they optimized the cooling for the orientation that is the most likely Flipping the device changes two key things gravity and natural convection suddenly go in the opposite direction This will likely affect the air flow and maybe cause inefficiencies Probably not a lot but Id like to see a comparison,lwo23wr,4.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwpr93o,qtx,,0,2024-11-12 07:12:09,,,,Because knowing Apple they RDd billions of dollars just to see what the most effective way to cool it was Im not an Apple fan but you have to admit they are masters of efficiency Just opening up one of their devices you can just tell how much thought they have put in designing their hardware,lwo23wr,4.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwqfl1z,ThisUsernameis21Char,,4,2024-11-12 11:38:22,,,,Just opening up one of their devices you can just tell how much thought they have put in designing their hardware Just make sure you dont open up it up too often otherwise youll kill the power cable that connects the display assembly because they made it a couple mm too short and it gets worn out with a regular amount of use An issue which persisted for multiple releases then was silently fixed all while Apple vehemently denied any wrongdoing on their part And make sure wherever you open it up at has zero humidity because they spent a gajillion bajiliion dollars on RD that has shown the most effective way to place a pin that connects to the 40V power line is next to a 5V power line pin that powers your display assembly so that it fries immediately,lwpr93o,5.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwqg9qs,mBertin,,5,2024-11-12 11:44:35,,,,you can just tell how much thought they have put in designing their hardware Like how the new iMacs are too thin to have an Ethernet port on the main chassis so they put it on the external power supply The Mac Pro 2013 was entirely designed around the concept of having a single fan cool the entire device While that obviously failed it only goes to show how much effort they put into making their devices look interesting,lwpr93o,5.0,1gp25fc

comment,m1egr18,IvanXQZ,,1,2024-12-10 19:00:50,,,,Full agree but desktop does at least provide you with the option of yanking the power cable which laptop does not That said you still need power button for Recovery and I cant think of a single good reason to have it underneath Apples protestations aside I think Apple indulges in a certain amount of wishcasting in which they design for if we lived in a perfect world in which everything always behaved like it is supposed to and that is amplified by an additional level of if Macs just behaved exactly like iPhones and iPads That latter has presumably informed design decisions like having all your windows reopen when you restart your system by default and always after a softwareinduced restart like a macOS update regardless of quantity and startup lag that might entail a laptop with only a single USBC port and having a few years of no startup chime for laptops leaving you with no way of knowing whether the computer had turned on or not during its prestart tests And possibly this decision too,lwxnm3f,9.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwro71n,SacredRose,,1,2024-11-12 16:23:16,,,,Keep it pressed and the device will shutdown So they can call it a pizza oven if they wanted it is still a power button,lwrmp9c,6.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwq6f2b,veniceglasses,,-10,2024-11-12 10:03:21,,,,This is pretty much bollocks These machines are manufactured entirely automatically then partially hand assembled The difference in button hole between top and bottom is minuscule and would be entirely dominated by design choices or interior choices They may well make design choices on the interior that make it cheaper eg logic board on the bottom without needing to route a wire to a separate location for one button but it has nothing to do with metal vs plastic Edit and it looks like there is a logic board on the top anyway so it would have been easy to put a button there This is a design choice,lwosqut,1.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwrkw8x,sigmund14,,2,2024-11-12 16:05:57,,,,Of course its a design by choice Choice to lower the cost of drill bits Drilling into plastic is easier on the drill bits than drilling into metal If the hole is not drilled making the molds with the hole is cheaper than drilling into metal too,lwq6f2b,2.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwrtwch,Moridin_Naeblis,,5,2024-11-12 16:52:37,,,,The plastic is injection molded and the cost would be identical with other without an extra hole The aluminum part is CNC machined and adding a single hole probably adds about 15 seconds to cycle time and would use probably less than 0005 of the life of a 50 dollar tool Its a design choice not a cost one,lwrkw8x,3.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwueijr,ggezboye,,1,2024-11-13 01:09:49,,,,Time is money this affects their maximum yield Tool life is money more lifespan less downtime that also helps increase yiled Its a _design choice related to costsavings that addup to Apples already high profitmargins_ because no Apple device have lessened its pricepoint because manufacturing made costsavings by optimizing design or by removing a hardware feature,lwrtwch,4.0,1gp25fc
comment,lww2285,veniceglasses,,0,2024-11-13 08:50:23,,,,Im sat here with my laptop that has 2000 microscopic holes lasered in a grid the only lasered part on the enclosure just to make the speaker grill look a bit less obvious The unibody enclosures internal shaping will take 10 100 times longer than any one hole on the outside So no I dont accept that a single hole using existing tooling makes any meaningful cost difference at all,lwueijr,5.0,1gp25fc
comment,lww2wq6,ggezboye,,1,2024-11-13 09:00:02,,,,Your comparison is just an example of a pure design choice not related to cost because in your case their only choice is that they have to do it With Mac Mini they have the choice of either to use the plastic part or the metal part for the hole They chose the plastic part because it is cheaper and easier to mold a hole into a plastic than to machine a similar sized hole into the metal,lww2285,6.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwwbu33,veniceglasses,,2,2024-11-13 10:40:25,,,,Thats obviously false They have a half a dozen other design solutions that do not involve lasering 2000 holes and are cheaper than lasering 2000 holes,lww2wq6,7.0,1gp25fc

comment,lws6ks3,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2024-11-12 17:57:28,,,,The older mac minis would have the ports in an injection molded plastic part in back probably for this reason However since theyre CNCing it and theyre already putting multiple holes in the case for USBC and HDMI ports it doesnt make a ton of sense to me I think its just a weird design choice It means that anyone who uses these in a server rack configuration will have to have them logodown but not a big deal for most people to pick it up for a second to turn off or reboot Its like the charge cable on the bottom of the magic mouse stupid design just to hide a cablebutton but ultimately not a huge deal,lwrkw8x,3.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwpw7hs,jamesonm1,,-14,2024-11-12 08:05:50,,,,The fact that you think it wouldnt add to machining costs says everything Would they need to charge more Of course not They could charge less than cost for the whole device if they really wanted to But they are in the business of maximizing profitability especially on whats almost definitely their lowest margin sku across the entire mac lineup Remind me again where was the power button on the previous gen mac mini Thats right on the back with the plastic panel Machining holes in the metalwork for all the other IO is an upgrade over the previous gen that had it all in a plastic panel This thread is also clearly full of a ton of nonmac users that really just dont seem to get how infrequently you press the physical power button on a mac mini Which is exactly why it was on the BACK of the device on the previous gen,lwpvf2l,3.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwnakn9,hishnash,,13,2024-11-11 21:31:55,,,,The reason it is on the bottom is that they moved to an extruded aluminum case rather than a milled case The bottom is plastic When you do an extruded aluminum shape doing cutouts like this is difficult and requires extra machine time after the fact to finish them costing If they had put it on the front or back as part of the case then this would have increased the cost of making the case by a few in machine time Putting it on the bottom plastic is much cheaper,lwmy20w,1.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwnj2m8,BehWeh,,4,2024-11-11 22:15:50,,,,Sure but thats not the reason they are giving Thats my whole point They are saying it had to be there in order to be this compact which is the part Im not believing Not with the engineering potential available Im fine with it being there to make it cheaper and easier to machine but thats not what was said in the statement I believe it was intentionally placed there to primarily make people talk about it,lwnakn9,2.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwp7roe,hishnash,,3,2024-11-12 04:20:03,,,,The power supply is very compact so it is unlikely they would have had enough space to have the needed internal attachment volume on the case at the power supply level to have a power button there The place they may have been able to have a power button is were the indicator like it but this is on the front of the device and apple does not want it there I believe it was intentionally placed there to primarily make people talk about it I dont the HW designers think like that remember within apple almost all choices are just made by engineers on the ground there is no large copriate structure that micro managers all the choices the fact it is on the bottom will have been someone in the engineering design team being told by the PSU team that there is not enough space up top on the back were the old button was an that adding another cut out for a power button will cost more Someone then replied in a slack thread what about just under the lip on the bottom right its plastic there and we have lots of void space,lwnj2m8,3.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwn0gbb,Straight-faced_solo,,27,2024-11-11 20:40:34,,,,I feel the second paragraph is more the reason than anything else They dont want you using the power button So apple designed it to be out of sight and mind Its reminiscent of the magic mouse charging cable Apple wants the aesthetics of a wireless mouse so they designed it to be unusable while plugged in and charging Same thing Apple wants a sleek device with no buttons but having no power button would actually be a problem so they do this instead,lwmy20w,1.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwn7gd0,Veranova,,9,2024-11-11 21:16:06,,,,That and putting it somewhere it could easily be pressed by a nearby object makes a convenient location highly inconvenient This thing is small enough youll throw it in places youd never throw a desktop maybe stack several units in a rack The cost of lifting the edge on the rare occasion you need it is lower than throwing something on your desk and hitting it,lwn0gbb,2.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwpnd3c,ungoogleable,,3,2024-11-12 06:32:59,,,,I heard a better explanation for the magic mouse The first version of the magic mouse took AA batteries that were in a compartment on the bottom When they made the rechargeable version the laziest option was to swap out the battery compartment for an internal battery with the charging port right on top of it leaving the rest of the design untouched They havent bothered to update the design in 15 years,lwn0gbb,2.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwpv9hz,Nick_pj,,2,2024-11-12 07:55:26,,,,I assumed its because they dont want people to actually turn the computer off just leave it on standby Theyre trying to force you to use the product the way they prefer like how they put the charger on the bottom of the mouse,lwmy20w,1.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwnju36,BehWeh,,0,2024-11-11 22:19:54,,,,Intentionally to make people talk about it This placement was not required to make it this small Also its not the same The button to physically and instantly cut power to the PC is not the same as the button to power said PC on or off which is typically on the front or top of the case The closest thing the Mac has to the PSU switch would be your breaker or unplugging the Mac,lwnbgyh,2.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwo4ftz,GreenFox1505,,60,2024-11-12 00:17:04,,,,Im convinced the magic mouse charger is because they know some people would just leave it plugged in and use it as a wired mouse and therefore they MUST design a way to prevent people from using an item in an unintended way To that end they dont intend you to turn off your Mac This is a well thought out design Its just a hostile well thought out design,lwn9v8p,2.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwohqbp,ThisGuyHyucks,,10,2024-11-12 01:35:19,,,,But magic mouse is definitely a purposeful explicit design that accomplishes one of Apples goals for their products minimal aesthetic since it prevents you from keeping a cable plugged into the mouse while using it youre unlikely to have a loose cable hanging around your desk 247 Dont get me wrong I think its dumb because I prefer function over form usually but Im almost certain thats why they did it Like the other person said Apple incorporates hostile designs to prevent you from using their products in a way that differs from their intention,lwn9v8p,2.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwp750i,None,,2,2024-11-12 04:15:27,,,,Yeah its obviously your fault if you dont charge your mouse If theyve been designing computer components for 50 years and dont realize a mouse is better suited to be able to charge while being used and that the user should be able to use the cord as a usb cable that is a dumb failure To act like nobody has ever let their mouse die and to act like a better solution isnt making it usable while charging but to make the user wait is going so far to make excuses I really dont get it You can like Apple and yet admit they make some mistakes And if their excuse is cost to change it just makes them worse For instance I have a Gpro from Logitech that I really like for editing gaming browsing The battery last forever I only charge it every few weeks But the thing that I think is absolute dog shit is that it takes a micro usb and even their revision does and Im still not sure if the latest one is on usb c yet Everyone hates that about that mouse pretty much and the revisions are pretty shitty to not have usb c I dont have any other device that takes micro usb and so its annoying to have one taking up usb space on top of that,lwp4smn,8.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwnsdm1,krectus,,3,2024-11-11 23:06:47,,,,Even if it is a button that isnt used that often its still bad design even if it is only mildly inconvenient its still bad design And no PCs dont force reboot once a week where you need to press the power button And yes if that power button was on the bottom of the back of a PC everyone would point out how dumb that was,lwndod1,5.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwnubbk,octocode,,0,2024-11-11 23:17:49,,,,your logic is backwards they moved it _because_ no one uses it it was not on the bottom of the previous generation its not like people will use it more or less now that just makes no sense and yes i wouldnt be surprised if the button is removed next generation its really a relic of the past on a modern device,lwnmt6t,6.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwprr3l,Phondrason,,1,2024-11-12 07:17:26,,,,20 of power would be one third of my power bill lmao No ACs over here and like I said in my other comment its probably just a cultural difference I certainly dont know anyone else who leaves their desktop PC on for those amounts of time,lwo1sto,3.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwmyvmj,vinse81,,-4,2024-11-11 20:32:34,,,,The real reason is probably some shitty design inside the box which doesnt allow the button to be placed anywhere else,,0.0,1gp25fc
comment,lwn046n,soupyjay,,5,2024-11-11 20:38:51,,,,Or some efficient design would be needlessly complicated by trying to relocate a power button which in the grand scheme of things is quite trivial,lwmyvmj,1.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwod899,Germanofthebored,,0,2024-11-12 01:08:39,,,,Who has ever said Gee I wish the Mac Mini was smaller Id put up with just about anything if the volume and the footprint would get smaller If anything make it thinner so that it would be easier to attach it to the back of a monitor or wherever Or to stack it on an enclosure for 25 or 35 hard drives to expand storage,,0.0,1gp25fc

comment,lwrr42a,rathlord,,-1,2024-11-12 16:38:30,,,,Ah yes being asked to restart during a diagnostic is exactly validation for saying everything they make is one giant memory leak and you need to shut down every single day You are exactly the mouth breathing idiot Im talking about in the post above and this utterly disingenuous argument is like a crystal clear proof of my point Appreciate that,lwred1w,4.0,1gp25fc
