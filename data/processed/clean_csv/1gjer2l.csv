comment,lvegn8q,EVMad,,8,2024-11-04 19:53:05,,,,Ive written my own C code to test the speed just like I did back when PPCx86 happened Back then Rosetta running PPC code performed around 10 of the speed of native x86 but for the most part this was hidden with applications due to native libraries doing heavy lifting This is why I used a simple command line test Doing that same test with x86ARM Rosetta 2 results in 90 of the performance of native ARM code Its a very different situation,lve76h7,4.0,1gjer2l
comment,lve0di5,None,,9,2024-11-04 18:33:13,,,,Same for me All software I use for work in design has been ARM native for a while now since like M1 chips The software we use past design into engineering development and production is also ARM native I guess in this guys case hes talking about the general corporate sense which is like excelalso mac arm native and stuff which this sort of performance doesnt even matter,lvdsizj,3.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvdw4ws,mister2forme,,-11,2024-11-04 18:12:39,,,,Its true which goes back to my original statement Most software runs on x86 People fail to realize that corp users far out number casual You can get by checking Facebook and Instagram just fine on a Mac But you wouldnt need an M4 Max for that so corp work is probably more applicable as a comparison for needing the grunt A special shout out for those who just want shave seconds off their Mac specific application times like Final Cut But thats not the point of the article that OP posted It was attention seeking to draw folks to single threaded benchmark numbers,lvdvetg,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lve80j9,somewhatboxes,,3,2024-11-04 19:10:29,,,,my sense is that among healthcare workers the issues with EPIC arent that the computer isnt fast enough or that EPIC is resourceintensive but that the software just sucks im not sure if it would make much difference for them to transition to ARM except that someone needs to come in with a broom and sweep up all the garbage in the software but a software team angling to fix up an EHREMR system is like napoleon saying hes just gonna go invade russia real quick it sounds a lot like workday tbh all this is to say that my hunch is the overwhelming majority of the time people spend on their computers mostly using a web browser mostly doing stuff in email would benefit dramatically from an ARM CPU and there isnt enough money in the world to make EPIC usable so thats a foregone conclusion,lvdw4ws,6.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvf988n,mister2forme,,-3,2024-11-04 22:15:47,,,,Im not a programmer I support an enterprise portfolio of applications Not just a single stack Look Im tired of apple fans getting upset because they feel Im slighting their apple silicon Im not I work for and with companies that have tens of thousands of deployed endpoints Im not out of touch just because your anecdotal app or apps work fine The world runs on different things The truth is simple If YOUR application requires Rosetta or parallels its not going to perform like it does on natively supported apps Thats it That was always my point but some people just cant bear to see something conflicts with their beliefs,lvf8iyr,5.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvfagpy,OverSoft,,2,2024-11-04 22:22:20,,,,I use HUNDREDS of programs both as a casual user as well as an IT professional who just happens to write applications for enterprises I dont run a single stack I run dozens EVERYTHING is ARM now except for niche proprietary business applications Your comeback by clapping back at Apple fans is pretty amusing since youre the one thats in a extremely niche use case meanwhile the rest of the world can easily 100 run on ARM Your point was that most desktop apps were x86 your words not mine and they just arent Youre wrong Get over it edit Really Blocking me LOL okay nuff said If you think the software your clients are running is most desktop applications then I just dont know what to tell you man Your world is extremely small in that case,lvf988n,6.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvfc6ff,mister2forme,,-1,2024-11-04 22:31:33,,,,Theres a whole world out there beyond you Im happy you like your Mac and it works fine If you cant understand or see beyond that then I cant help you My comment isnt for you Its for the person who needs applications that arent natively compiled for Mac That isnt you apparently That is a large contingent of people I work with every day You can argue on whether my clients are using the right tool but at its core its just you not fully understanding that business and other folks have different requirements It is what it is and I dont make those decisions I just help them operate Hell I had one guy on here tell me the financial and health care industries run on bloated spreadsheets Yet youre attacking me saying Im out of touch and apparently all those working with me who have these devices yearly for currency testing Just drop it youre not getting another response from me Hope your day gets better,lvfagpy,7.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvg4inv,jcdoe,,1,2024-11-05 01:10:48,,,,People arent getting defensive of apple silicon theyre getting frustrated because youre wrong and you wont hear them tell you that The switch to apple silicon happened 4 years ago Most software has gone arm native and Rosetta performs really well Its not noticeable Its not a fanboy thing Microsofts windows for arm uses some sort of emulation layer to run x86 windows code and it also runs great The cost of emulation is getting very small Just stop saying stupid crap that isnt true man,lvf988n,6.0,1gjer2l

comment,lve7lou,mister2forme,,2,2024-11-04 19:08:27,,,,The OP is comparing M4 to X86 Most of the world is Windows Not downing the Mac at all Apple silicon is great and Apple NEEDED to move away from Intel but if youre comparing the speed of M4 to the speed of x86 when one runs Windows and the other runs MacOS Im going to compare Windows,lve63r9,3.0,1gjer2l
comment,lve8ivc,huuaaang,,7,2024-11-04 19:13:02,,,,You said Also keep in mind this is best case scenario software that is native for arm Anything running through Rosetta will not perform as well The point is youre not running things in Rosetta on Mac The same application on Windows that is x86 will be native ARM on the Mac in almost all cases Talking about Rosetta is moot,lve7lou,4.0,1gjer2l
comment,lve968l,mister2forme,,-2,2024-11-04 19:16:12,,,,Thats just not true It may be true for the applications you use but theres a whole working world out there that doesnt use or optimize applications for mac Try MS Visio or MS Project You can run them in parallels but then youre doing two layers just to get them to run I respect that your apps run on Mac But again Im not talking about the random internet person Im talking about much larger user bases,lve8ivc,5.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvebi5t,huuaaang,,4,2024-11-04 19:27:40,,,,Try MS Visio or MS Project You can run them in parallels First of all I wouldnt be using a Mac if I had to run Windows native applications regularly in the first place I wouldnt recommend others do it either Parallels is available in a pinch but relying on it for day to day work is sub optimal seperate from CPU differences Second those arent performance critical applications anyway so CPU performance doesnt even really matter that much Where performance actually matters is in the professional tools like Davinci Resolve And those tools have Mac ARM native equivilents that we can make direct comparisons with between platforms I respect that your apps run on Mac But again Im not talking about the random internet person Im talking about much larger user bases And theyre not concerned with marginal differences in CPU performance anyway so why are we even talking about them Theyre not running Ryzen 9 9950X in their computers Most users of desktop applicaitons do not stress their CPU,lve968l,6.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvhklpt,mctrials23,,1,2024-11-05 07:14:23,,,,Its not a best case scenario its entirely normal because at this point nothing on my Mac is non native Perhaps instead of thinking that the problem is Mac fanboys entertain the idea that you are just wrong,lvdpqpg,2.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvfqa8x,ThePowerOfStories,,1,2024-11-04 23:49:01,,,,We didnt get an Ultra because the M3 was a stopgap generation that Apple knew would be replaced by the cheaper more energyefficient M4 quite soon M1 to M2 17 months M2 to M3 16 months M3 to M4 6 months,lve5cvr,2.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvf4evo,ExtraFirmPillow_,,0,2024-11-04 21:50:50,,,,Not if you need to dedicate 100 gigs to VRAM Since a m series Mac uses unified memory You can dedicate 16 gb to OS and everything else to your GPU which makes them monsters for running models But a 4090 will do great as well but is still going to be limited to its vram,lvev1h1,3.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvdetjc,MuTron1,,62,2024-11-04 16:48:41,,,,As per a comment I made below cost is a difficult one to compare when youre looking at Apple devices vs other manufacturers because youre not just buying a circuit in a cardboard box A MacBook Pro is actually pretty good value if youre looking at all metrics Screen quality build quality build materials aesthetics processor power battery life etc If you compare a M4 Max against a Razer Blade one of the few manufacturers trying to compete with Apple on their terms the price doesnt seem so bad A top specced Razer Blade has much better GPU performance but isnt really usable on battery even when its just performing light tasks,lvdcikg,1.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvdlpt4,CodeAndBiscuits,,27,2024-11-04 17:22:16,,,,Thats literally my point The article compares these to the Ryzen and Core Ultra as if they were actual options to choose between But thats not true When you go for an M series you are buying into the entire platform with every other decision Apple made as well Dont get me wrong I think my MacBook is a great machine But because you have no choice for everything else that goes along with it you are easily looking at 1000 or more increase over other options at this performance level Because of that I find pure performance benchmarks to be not very valuable Yes the performance is impressive But it would be only news to me if it wasnt For an extra thousand bucks or possibly much more I expect the thing to be a screamer By the time you get done upgrading your RAM and hard drive at triple the rates of what a hard drive costs anywhere else these performance numbers can actually start to seem a little disappointing Not to mention the fact that a lot of people who care about this micro a comparison to Ryzen also care about gaming and the Mac remains a uniquely poor platform for gaming I game on mine and its very frustrating only having access to a third of whats out there,lvdetjc,2.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvdsdwz,MuTron1,,17,2024-11-04 17:54:27,,,,For an extra thousand bucks or possibly much more I expect the thing to be a screamer But thats the problem Why do you think that all that extra thousand is buying you is computing power To turn the question around for the price of a Razer Blade for example why can I not get more than 4 hours of idle battery Why does it look like a 15 year old boys idea of cool Why is the finishing a bit poor and support abysmal Price per computing power is an awful metric when it comes to a mobile device All this benchmark is proving is that the performance is also there as well as thought about the design build quality battery life screen accuracy etc In this case users buying into the whole ecosystem premium design OShardware integration soldered on components etc is exactly why Apple can design completely bespoke architecture and afford to be cutting edge in terms of technology node and process Because they manufacture and sell you every decision they make on a given device instead of just selling you a chip that you can plug into any old motherboard with any old memory GPU and PSU and shove on your desk as a bare pcb The performance of the M4 Max is impressive with no context Its even more impressive when its designed to be the sweet spot between performance and power usage in a laptop,lvdlpt4,3.0,1gjer2l
comment,lve4z5s,hardolaf,,7,2024-11-04 18:55:35,,,,No one is seriously buying a Razer Blade as a professional machine Its marketed for and to gamers for gaming That highend dGPU draws more power than the entire rest of the laptop combined and GPUs arent exactly designed for low power consumption in any configuration for that device Meanwhile if you look at AMD Advantage certified laptops theyre all designed to power down the GPUs and are competitive with Apple laptops on battery life and performance except for mid cycle for AMD when they fall behind until the next generation releases,lvdsdwz,4.0,1gjer2l

comment,lveswlx,Pizza_Low,,3,2024-11-04 20:53:14,,,,Outside of gaming and some engineering and modeling software 2d or 3d graphics speed became unimportant around the time the s3 Virge chipset became obsolete in the mid 90s Back then manufacturers intentionally crippled 2d performance on consumer cards so those that needed 2d graphics performance had to buy the professional graphics cards Unfortunately Ive long since forgotten the name of the card from Diamond that a lot of engineering software relied on Edit It was the FireGL line of cards crazy expensive but ProENGINEER really did well for modeling parts that you could send to a cadcam system Edit 2 Remembered Matrox cards used to be really good for 2d rendering on CAD but absolutely sucked for gaming,lvefx00,7.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvetzeg,MuTron1,,4,2024-11-04 20:58:31,,,,That depends on what you want from your hardware Apart from the lack of upgradability Apples onchip memory and NAND chips soldered on the main board are technically superior to DIMMs and SSD drives and also allow for a more integrated design of the system board rather than having to design the board cooling and system bus to accommodate NVMe and a couple of DIMM slots Part of the reason no Windows laptop is as well designed as a MacBook is because they have to accommodate components that they have no control over And part of the reasons why Windows is such an inefficient mess is because it has to support such a diverse range of hardware So what do you value more something where the software is designed around the hardware which is designed around the form but is fixed to what you purchase vs something that is flexible but essentially a bunch of different commodity parts in a box and an OS that needs to stitch it all together,lvepmx8,5.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvexljr,Warning_Low_Battery,,2,2024-11-04 21:16:27,,,,So what do you value more something where the software is designed around the hardware which is designed around the form but is fixed to what you purchase vs something that is flexible I think you are missing a critical end to that sentence which would be vs something that is flexible and not prone to intentional throttling and power tampering via obscured manufacturer firmware updates meant push you to buy new hardware because Apple specifically engineered it to be COMPLETELY UNUPGRADABLE You cant just say Apart from the lack of upgradability as if that isnt a massive fucking issue for most computer owners,lvetzeg,6.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvez6ga,MuTron1,,6,2024-11-04 21:24:26,,,,I mean Im not aware of any planned obsolescence tactics used in MacBooks Generally theyre known for lasting a lot longer than plastic Windows laptops A MacBook purchased 10 years ago will perform the same as it ever did Of course old models dont necessarily get newer features but why would you expect them to Lack of upgradability isnt a problem for pretty much every computing platform except descendents of the IBM PC and has led to inevitable compromises in that platform a computer consisting of 6 or 7 cobbled together unrelated commodity components stuffed in a chassis isnt necessarily the best way of designing a computing device for all situations Also laptops have rarely been very upgradable and a lot of ultra book style laptops competing in the same space have the same soldered RAM and storage,lvexljr,7.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvhnse1,simon132,,0,2024-11-05 07:48:23,,,,The reason Windows is an inefficient mess is because its probably the only operating system where software as old as 30 years old can still run You cant even run your 2010 era Mac software on your flashy 3000 ewaste MacBook Im no windows lover I have no windows machines but windows does something that no other OS does as good which is long term support of software,lvetzeg,6.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvfhgmf,sCeege,,1,2024-11-04 23:00:21,,,,I think performance isnt a category that a MBP is competitive in flat out I understand where youre coming from a M4 Mac Mini with double the base stats literally costs the same as buying two whole base Mac Minis an insane price increase The other stats that everyone else is pointing is out is exactly whats selling an Apple device in that product tier the ecosystem the total cost of ownership etc If youre willing to shell out 2k for a laptop lets be honest the base model specs are trash I think value is the already first casualty Also if youre the only maker in a given market that everyone wants you kinda get to charge whatever the consumer is willing to pay Until Windows on ARM can get its act together or sort out this ridiculous game of chicken between Qualcomm and ARM Apple will continue to charge what they want and we just have no choice if were looking for a product in the pro laptop segment,lvdlpt4,3.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvgd9r6,sCeege,,3,2024-11-05 02:01:54,,,,wall of text warning here I want to push back and find a balance here I do think the pricing argument is justified maybe not the most value in the performance to price ratio especially in the mid range I think on the base model tier of their products and on the extremely high end we can see some merit there But thats not the only thing Apple is selling I think the preceding comments in this comment thread are arguing separate points 1 Yes the performance to ratio itself is a bit off compared to traditional x86 2 but that isnt the only thing to what makes an appliance good or bad for its price except you Airpods Max Both of these statements can be true Ill use my self as an example I have a M1 Max MBP with 64GB RAM In 2021 and to a certain extent even now there is literally no amount of money that could purchase an x86 laptop with the same performance size and battery life You basically pick two and lose on the third no matter how you slice it I think the closest would be Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads if you DIY the RAM upgrades but definitely nothing out of the box In addition I have an iPhone 13 iPad Pro and some AirPods Again there is no amount of money that could buy the seamless integration to my Apple devices How do I know this I also have a Samsung Galaxy Book ZFold 4 Galaxy Tab Ultra and Galaxy Buds Pro2 by all means premium pricing tiers in their own categories and the integration difference is just night and day The software experience just isnt there We wont even go for the low hanging fruits like the shitty touchpads and Windows OS The core usability of the devices is just so severely gapped In essence Apple can charge what they charge because no one else provides an alternative with the same functional performance I would argue access to such a top tier product is worth its price Yes ARM on Windows can show some promise but until their licensing dispute ends we wont find out Im a big supporter in having more competition in this space because I obviously want to see more competitive pricing on Apple products by the way weve already seen what the huge backlash has done to base model SSD performance and RAM specs in their most recent update so the market definitely pushes Apples to answer I hope for more of it in the future but until then there really is no alternatives besides shelling out for what is basically the best computers in their perspective markets,lvfoqrl,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvlmyxq,ExpectedEggs,,1,2024-11-05 22:23:13,,,,Flat rate 3 means theyre replacing something on the keyboard speakers or touch bar too Even replacing a single key means you pay Flat Rate 3 Apple stopped using butterfly keys around the end of 2019 so once again you are imagining a much worse scenario than the current reality Im gonna reiterate this to you this is my job I do this for a living Ive had to deal with more MacBooks than youve seen in your life Thousands over the last 12 years By the time the battery needs replacement you will be replacing the entire topcase Theres always a bad key Thats why you buy AppleCare so you dont have to pay out of pocket for it 15 years in the battery will start to see a diminished full charge and at that point anybody that types on that thing daily will have a wonky key or two,lvllzx9,8.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvdu6sh,Xeppl,,7,2024-11-04 18:03:08,,,,Everytime I see power users really liking Mac is because they do half their stuff with the terminal but if I wanted to do Linux I would have Linux A terminal is no Linux thing But your statement actually fits Windows better these days As a matter of fact they include a Windows Subsystem Linux that developers have the possibility to flee to a proper command line environment So basically the only thing left of this OS is to use MS teams and office stuff in Windows and a lot of the actual work happens in Linux Which is also the initial purpose of an OS developed for accountants So actually a lot of people are being forced to use Windows in their workplace but do as much as they can in the WSL Linux with the support of Microsoft as they realized they should integrate Linux in their OS for a lot of reasons this fits the but if I wanted to do Linux I would have Linux a little better I think An operating system that focuses on providing Linux out of the box The good thing is that smart MS developers really contributed a lot to the Linux kernel the last decade so win win I guess,lvd05gu,3.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvfdv1o,saposapot,,2,2024-11-04 22:40:43,,,,My point is that I dont want to use Unix terminal commands With modern windows I can tweak it and use it with only windows gui rarely I need to use command prompt for something My note is because in the past everyone says Mac OS has a better UIUX and so much easier to do things but then when I see my friends power users they all are using terminal to really be productive Its a bit ironic Again Im not saying one is better than the other What I can say is that modern windows for me is not a problem I know it inside out I know how to use it properly the tools I need to install etcetc for me I dont have any incentive to learn a new OS its just that Besides I still need windows for work and proper gaming,lvdu6sh,4.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvflery,Xeppl,,1,2024-11-04 23:22:01,,,,I think they are using the terminal to be even more productive But yes personal preference is personal preference and we cant discuss what is better for the other For the general part we have benchmarks memory consumption comparisons power efficiency and such metrics We have ads popping up in Windows everywhere until it will be just a big adbased SASS product at some point harvesting user data like shit But the discussion is somewhat exhausting anyway and everyone should be able to choose the OS themselves Therefore I get your point It is convenient when you know your environment Give me any Linux or macOS and I am ready to go in no time using like 95 of my dotfiles in any POSIX oriented OS But then give me Windows and Id do all I can to never leave the WSL and hope that I never need to open the registry or such shit Surely Id be extremely unhappy and ultimately quit the job that does force me onto Windows,lvfdv1o,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lveayuw,YeonneGreene,,1,2024-11-04 19:25:02,,,,I thought so Like I see so much praise being heaped on Apple for their M processors and it has puzzled me because there is nothing novel about them and all the gains come from things that are either outside their domain node or noshitSherlock packaging advantages weve been aware of for decades but happily sacrificed and often still do sacrifice for flexibility reasons They also control most of the software stack for Apple devices allowing for a degree of optimization that PCs cant quite match If AMD built a whole SoC we could probably watch the efficiency gap evaporate I suspect well start seeing this more on the mobile side as Qualcomm makes gains and puts the squeeze on the x8664 players,lve7qow,2.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvgfvg5,Edenz_,,8,2024-11-05 02:16:43,,,,You and OP have no idea what youre talking about The node advantage does not account for all the performance and power difference as you can literally compare M1 and M2 5nm node to AMD or Intels designs and see the huge power and significant singlethreaded disparity AMD get close in multithreaded The microarchitecture is just that good They have attracted some of the best talent in the industry and are not constrained in terms of cost that the incumbent players are These chips are massive there is no comparable chip to the Max SoCs in PC land as no one is willing to sell a chip that big in a laptop Just look at the cache configuration on the Apple Silicon chips the PCores share up to 32MB of cache before even considering that theres another 48MB behind that shared with the GPU but doesnt have to use it If AMD built a whole SoC we could probably watch the efficiency gap evaporate AMD do build SoCs they just arent as good Hell Intel even just released brand new powerefficiency first mobile chips and they still dont come close,lveayuw,3.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvgppv6,YeonneGreene,,1,2024-11-05 03:14:46,,,,You are not saying anything to contradict my impressions that the gains come from relatively straightforward solutions they used a better node inflated the cache and collocated the RAM and a big GPU ondie with the CPU cores Its an unimaginative approach that realizes the gains precisely through the mechanisms I mentioned above the processing pipeline itself is pretty hohum and nothing interesting AMD does not deliver any SoCs with ondie memory in the consumer or prosumer space outside the gaming console space where all are hilariously ancient Even the Z1 doesnt have memoryondie its LPDDR5 mounted to the motherboard with all the signaling penalties inherent to that design though it does get in range of the M3 and I wouldnt blink if it matched it blowforblow if it was a complete SoC Comparison is therefore rather uninformative because as you said none of them are attempting to do what Apple is doing I highly doubt that its because they cant and more because they dont yet think it is worth their while to design something so wildly outside the designs where they can leverage existing economies of scale unless a client specifically pays for it Well AMD anyway Intel is toast without a bailout Like I said above as the ARM designs from Apple and Qualcomm continue to show how much is being left on the table by classic discrete component architectures the x8664 players will change their strategy,lvgfvg5,4.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvhhzz9,Edenz_,,3,2024-11-05 06:47:53,,,,Okay Im going to be more specific then You claimed in this in your original post there is nothing novel about them and all the gains come from things that are either outside their domain node or noshitSherlock packaging advantages weve been aware of for decades but happily sacrificed and often still do sacrifice for flexibility reasons 1 All the gains do not come from node or onpackage DRAM This is just not correct As I said previously if we do an ISONode comparison from Apple to the x86 contemporaries the delta is still apparent Using notebookchecks data which is already problematic as they used cinebench R23 for a long time which is much worse for Apple Silicon vs R24 we can quite clearly see that the singlethreaded performance watt for the M2 silicon is as high as 171 pointswatt vs 25100 pointswatt depending on the IntelAMD CPU you pick This means a perfwatt advantage of 68x to 171x with no node advantage If you believe that it is the PoP DRAM then you can read here how even the Core Ultra 9 288V trails the M3 Pro by 266x in Perfwatt singlethreaded Also the memory is not ondie it is onpackage which is a significant difference Just look at geerkerwans data if you want more points of reference Its an unimaginative approach that realizes the gains precisely through the mechanisms I mentioned above the processing pipeline itself is pretty hohum and nothing interesting This statement is extremely reductive of what goes into CPU design that I dont believe you can see the performance and power delta I have presented and unironically believe it Squeezing every of IPC in a core design is extremely hard let alone paving the path forward They arent playing catch up The M4 core has a 17x higher performance per clock in specFP vs the 14900k thats hohum Doesnt really matter if AMD or Intel can build an equivalent ultimately they dont This is the same reason why the node advantage point is dumb because at the end of the day Im not buying a node Im buying a product If Intel or AMD wanted to they could also pay for a better node Apple has shown that the market wanted ultra low power high performance devices and blind sided the x86 guys with M1 Intel and AMD are getting better but it really just shows how bad the duopoly has been for so long,lvgppv6,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvhij5f,Edenz_,,3,2024-11-05 06:53:11,,,,You also said Apple is a node ahead of everyone else which probably accounts for most of the difference And on die memory is like X3D on steroids which accounts for the rest Both of which are not correct as Ive written out in the post replying to the other person in this thread I completely agree that it isnt the instruction set doing it its just good execution from Apple Just by the way the memory is onpackage not ondie like the X3D chips The X3D chips are a much more expensive and performant technology which is literally stacking die to die What apple uses is effectively what we have in smartphones which is the DRAM traces going through the package around the core die Its mostly a space and power saving advantage not really for extra performance as its functionally just LPDRR,lvgzcrl,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvfrduk,elsjpq,,1,2024-11-04 23:55:11,,,,Yea people talk about the Mseries like Apple are wizards and they do have some really smart people working on this stuff but still its not magic They just managed to get a step ahead and make different trade offs When they finally took that leap of faith from x86 to ARM they had all these advantages stacked up together so it looked like a very impressive uplift but that was a one time deal and in reality its just another step of incremental gains I bet if you put Intels architecture on TMSCs latest node and add AMDs X3D cache or some other kind of large ondie memory the performance of x86 could probably beat Apples M chips But I mean its still real performance so it deserves some real praise,lveayuw,3.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvgk31l,Edenz_,,2,2024-11-05 02:41:29,,,,But in terms of raw power its not even close to being competitive for most real world tasks Can you explain what real world tasks are Geekbench literally just runs a bunch of small tests like code compilation blender etc and makes a weighted score People just believe it pulls some numbers out of thin air to lie to gamers So I do actually trust that M4 chips have 30 faster ST performance than the best from Intel and AMD Also not sure where youre getting double the multithreaded performance from because the 14900k gets around 2230 in MT R24 while the M3 Max gets 1683 which makes it only 32 faster The Core Ultra 9 also barely moved the needle so fair to assume the M4 Max will make up some ground Given that I dont know how you justify this But as a desktop chip its kind of underwhelming tbh Given that youre getting almost all of a 250W Desktop chip in a 55W laptop design not sure I agree,lvfwygc,1.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvd8z6v,spaceneenja,,1,2024-11-04 16:19:02,,,,Nah Intel and AMD had viable products and windows manufacturers update more frequently because they compete with themselves Again to reiterate this news isnt just about SoC and laptops Apple has a bit of a captive audience for their products and mostly compete with themselves The lack of refreshes is a large reason why their margins are so high compared to windows device manufacturers,lvd5nps,4.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvddha8,roadmapdevout,,2,2024-11-04 16:42:02,,,,Im not so sure their margins are that high and they clearly do compete with other manufacturers they stand to gain much more by increasing market share at the expense of those other manufacturers than they do just selling to the same people A huge demographic for them is university students moving away from Chromebooks and Windows machines for the first time Many of their machines have many inherently more expensive components that competitors often cut corners with Particularly cases displays trackpads and the speakers In more modular computers like the Mini the Pro the prices have historically been much more comparable to other manufacturers than many people estimate Where they sacrificed value was in upgradeability which is now irrelevant with SOCs providing such advantages that upgradeability isnt as much a priority for anyone anymore Apple clearly wanted things that intel couldnt deliver or theyd never have transitioned away in the first place Their standards were just different to a lot of the other manufacturers in the PC market Theyre much more concerned with power draw and thermals and this wasnt being well catered to by intel Thats why iMacs used portable rather than desktop processors in their iMacs for so many years Im not sure it made for good products at the time but they wanted thinner machines and quieter fans Its a compromise they bet on those UX commitments over raw performance while with intel and it seems to be working out for them now that they can more easily do both To my understanding the slow rate of product refreshes had a lot to do with a high failure rate of intel chips which was compounded by Apple wanting to run the chips hotter than other manufacturers There was a constant push and pull between them on this issue throughout their partnership,lvd8z6v,5.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvez8ms,chaosattractor,,1,2024-11-04 21:24:45,,,,just stop digging lol who the hell outside Microsoft and their ecosystem runs dev VMs on Windows Anyone with a lick of knowledge about what Im talking about knows that these are primarily _Linux_ guests running on KVM ie a Linux host Id sooner listen to my friends and former professors who work at Google over someone on Reddit Its pretty clear that you dont understand what your friends do much as they probably dont understand what _you_ do And thats fine what isnt fine is being so confident in your assessment of a field that you very obviously dont work in Not that youd necessarily understand it but for example the build instructions for Chrome are pretty clear that a 20 core CPU with 64GB of RAM is the recommended system requirement to compile the project without taking ages A couple paragraphs down youll spot a reference to Reclient a tool which as I said distributes builds to remote workers and which as I said is recommended to Google employees to use to work with large projects like Chrome and AOSP which is why again as I said it doesnt matter what their _personal_ local machine is You can use even a Chromebook when the actual work is getting done by a different machine This shouldnt even be that hard for you to grasp given your profession have you never used a render farm before Its literally the same concept and equally as silly to argue that the work being done is trivial because the computer an animator is using to _control_ the render farm isnt the beefiest thing in existence As an aside there are plenty of heavy workloads that GPUs suck balls at just as CPUs suck at the things GPUs are good at Using GPUs as the holy grail of intensive compute makes no sense to anyone who does know how both components work They are designed to optimise for different things latency vs throughput one is not inherently more powerful than the other,lveozzc,7.0,1gjer2l

comment,lviab0r,chaosattractor,,1,2024-11-05 11:48:21,,,,I never had to use a render farm no because my computer has quite a capable GPU I mean no offence but that just sounds like youve only been really worked on smallscale projects To compare to a similarlyplaced industry giant people at eg Pixar and Dreamworks arent rendering _those_ projects on their personal computers no matter how capable because consumergrade hardware will simply not cut it As an aside Apple Silicon chips _have_ a GPU A pretty mid one as far as raw performance in certain applications gaminggamingadjacent goes but so do plenty of other actual workstations Dells Precision line for example doesnt exactly ship with RTX 4090s Back to the point you made the ultra has 24 coresthe thread ripper comes with 96 if you so choose Do youjust not understand computer architecture at all Number of cores as is the case with GPUs themselves increases _throughput_ As I have already said CPUbound workloads are those that are dependent on low _latency_ Making music ie realtime audio processing for instance is not a trivial workload by any means simply because you dont need a topoftheline GPU for it you dont need one because despite plenty of effort GPUs _suck_ at the highly sequential but also extremely low latency demands of DAWs There are some workloads that benefit immensely from both high throughput and low latency which is where processors like the Threadripper and Intels Xeon line come in but _those_ are the ones that are actually niche which is why they dont actually sell that well and are often used as hosts for multiple virtualised systems This is why CPU benchmarks measure both singlecore this is latency _and_ multicore this is throughput performance This CPU is behind because it has fewer coresthat CPU is ahead because it has a higher percore clock frequency is the opinion of someone who doesnt know much about both things,lvf03ws,9.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvelfb0,Iluvembig,,2,2024-11-04 20:16:38,,,,I can dedicate enough VRAM where rendering a whole 30 second animation in blender or a heavy keyshot scene can be rendered in less than half the time of the best Mac Studio available My coworkers with their M2 Ultra Mac studios send their work to me because I can render a image in 2040 seconds I remember once my coworker applied a sponge like texture with holes and all with a plastic cap on a product It took the Mac M2 ultra 13 minutes to complete the render And her computers fans were about to put the building into the stratosphere It took my computer 4 minutes My computer barely broke a sweat I also had fusion open photoshop several tabs open teams email and a few other programs Theres levels here The apple chips are great But when it comes to sheer performance there is little to no way you can beat a dedicated GPU Not a single benchmark in the world puts a Apple chip above a 308090 or 408090 Even games optimized for Apple run poorer than on a equivalent GPU on a windows PC You cant just up and break physics because you say so When Apple uses a DEDICATED GPU and not a GPU on a chip solution and not charge me 6k for the pleasure of doing so Ill take them seriously The craptastic Mac Pro cost 8999for a M2 Ultra and 64gb of ram and 4 tb of storage The same system cost me 3kand I have a dedicated GPU,lvejmb8,6.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvfl2vo,sCeege,,1,2024-11-04 23:20:12,,,,Unfortunately until the orders ship out you wont know for sure but given that the new M4 Pro is slightly faster than a M2 Ultra I would find M2 Ultra benchmarks on the things you currently do and try to correlate what the new numbers would be from a M4 Pro to a M4 Max It wont be a perfect prediction but itll be close The short of it is if you dont feel like what you currently have is slowing you down just keep it and wait Or if you can convince work to buy it for you that would be great to Im in the same boat I have a maxed out M1 Max MBP it would take a lot to convince me to upgrade to another M Max platform The new numbers are definitely tempting to me but Im kind of banking on the rumors of a hardware overhaul in 2026 I know its still a long ways away but I would really love to finally have an OLED on a machine that I paid so much for,lvenn09,1.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvfknlg,titanking4,,0,2024-11-04 23:17:51,,,,There are two prices I consider the end user price frankly irrelevant because its entirely determined by how much money a company wants to make value of their brand margins and demand The cost is much more important How much silicon area is Apple spending here and how much does it cost them to manufacture And of course the fact that neither Intel or AMD have managed to come anywhere close to this performance The only saving grace would be that Apple is spending a ridiculous amount of silicon area on this design to get that IPC and its something that Intel and AMD arent doing because they actually need to make money selling the processors whereas Apple can make lots of margin selling the whole system THATS the competitive threat And Ill tell you Apple has the best most power efficient SoCs on the planet which is to be expected from the largest top3 exchange spots often company on the planet The price is that because people are willing to pay for it And for a luxury product that nobody needs to buy there is no ethical argument against that pricing,lvfa6fv,1.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvdhmea,LeCrushinator,,1,2024-11-04 17:02:22,,,,Macs running into thermal throttling which will only happen on the MacBook Air because its fanless is generally going to be when doing things like video exporting or scene rendering like in Blender Most people with a MacBook Air a fanless base model of the MacBooks are going to be using it for things like web browsing or document editing Those people will never get close to being thermal throttled They could throttle playing intensive games but there are barely any of those on Mac they could be doing video editingrendering but most people that are buying Macs for that purpose are professionals that will be using a MB Pro that has a fan and therefore wont run into thermal issues,lvdgk49,5.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvdinui,Tipop,,2,2024-11-04 17:07:28,,,,Im dont know why youre explaining this to ME I own a MacBook Air with M1 He asked about the overheating problem Since the only time it overheats is when playing games thats what I mentioned Specifically the game Im thinking of is BG3,lvdhmea,6.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvdlgzk,LeCrushinator,,1,2024-11-04 17:21:06,,,,He was pointing out overheating when playing games and I responded with sure but its not a gaming laptop and then you responded with the assumption that he was playing games So we both agree that it thermal throttles when playing games and that he was likely referring to playing games which is why I made my original point about the Air not being designed for that and that there are many Windows laptops that arent either,lvdinui,7.0,1gjer2l

comment,lvcvsks,danielv123,,11,2024-11-04 15:10:46,,,,Lists multicore for same benchmarks as well The margin is just as large No the price is not similar and also hard to compare in a large part because we are comparing to desktop chips here You can make a build to get these benchmark scores for about 13rd the price but to match the other specs of the laptop you get decently close Unless you want more memory and storage than the base model mac has in which case it gets silly expensive,lvcss9m,1.0,1gjer2l
comment,lvdbb2f,MuTron1,,2,2024-11-04 16:31:06,,,,Where is the price comparison Are we comparing two system with similar prices Or is there a vast difference Prices are difficult to compare because one CPU is only available in a premium build laptop whereas the others are desktop chips So when looking at the 3k35k you need to drop to buy a M4 Max you cant buy the CPU without also buying a luxury design item with gold standard build quality,lvcss9m,1.0,1gjer2l
