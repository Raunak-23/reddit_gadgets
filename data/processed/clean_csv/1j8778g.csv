comment,mhb9qcz,jeffersonairmattress,,1,2025-03-12 01:31:17,,,,Like most watches ever made it has a chamfered bezel this one perhaps more broad than most and evocative of the graduated 1200s They could have milled little slider slots or engraved a silhouette of a tonearm instead of the incongruous use of it as hands Gross Not even a wee pocket for the 45 spindle,mh36yqz,1.0,1j8778g
comment,mh4skcw,None,,11,2025-03-11 01:51:26,,,,That looks nothing absolutely nothing like the 1200s,,0.0,1j8778g
comment,mh5b81f,branchfoundation,,6,2025-03-11 03:43:13,,,,Has nobody else noticed the fatal flaw in this design In this watch the tone arm originates at the spindle of the turntable and the stylus or needle extends radially outwards from it The goal of the stylus is to travel towards the center of the record This one does the exact opposite If it werent for this mistake Id think of getting one for myself,,0.0,1j8778g

comment,mh3rdea,coulls,,6,2025-03-10 22:33:01,,,,I like the idea The execution on the other hand is not worthy of SLanything be it 1200 1210 etc Now in all fairness inspired does not mean replicated I dont want to poohpooh the achievement but maybe just saying inspired by a turntable would have removed the impossible bar that a Technics inspired watch will naturally bring about for comparison,,0.0,1j8778g
