comment,mdxrjcj,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,442,2025-02-21 04:55:17,,,,As someone who works at a repair depot i find Lenovo to be the easiest OEM to get parts for and theyre extremely easy to take apart and put back together at least the thinkpads You can replace the whole bottom half of the laptop in 20 minutes which would take a good hour or so on an Apple A lot of their units have replaceable keyboards which you can literally swap out in 2 minutes if you take your time HP aint bad either however they have some ridiculously outdated serializating processes for their system boards etc Dell is by far by FAR the worst They use an AI chatbot to screen out our warranty claims and if you cant really get parts from them if the unit is out of warranty Fuck Dell,,0.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdxx0ra,charlie22911,,105,2025-02-21 05:33:10,,,,Toddler spilled my tea on my Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 8 saved it by immediately powering it off removing the back and disconnecting the battery Everything was fine after cleaning and drying the mainboard but the keyboard was absolutely cooked Whats sucks is the keyboard on this model is integral to the palm rest as is the trackpad It required purchasing the entire palm restkeyboardtrackpad assembly for nearly 300 and complete disassembly from the bottomup to get it done NOT fun But its as good as new and it now stays in my office away from the toddler,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdxxkdi,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,34,2025-02-21 05:37:09,,,,Yeah a lot of their models DO have the integrated palm restkeyboard style 300 isnt bad though if that were apple youd be paying 700 at least,mdxx0ra,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdzwemq,NoTearsOnlyLeakyEyes,,7,2025-02-21 14:57:35,,,,Just had to replace the palm rest on my Ideapad S34015API Spent 50 drop shipping the plastic palm rest from China just to realize the keyboard is heat staked to the palm rest Had to spend another 70 for the combo Other than that its really easy to take apart and there are a ton of replacement components even 5 years later However they fucking soldered 4gb of ram to the motherboard At least make it fucking 8gbSo now Im running 12gb on a 4gb and 8gb stick It came with a slow ass hdd too so I threw a SSD in there Ive also swapped out the screen for 100 because the stock one suuuuuucked That wasnt too difficult either but I did absolutely mangle the old screen trying to peel it off the chassis This is a 5 year old laptop now though I wouldnt be surprised if newer ones have more heat staked and glued in components If I hadnt bought it refurbished in 2020 for half price I never would have bought it I had to sink 200 into it just to make it usable and from what I hear their Ideapads havent gotten any better,mdxxkdi,3.0,1iuihb1

comment,me0uz0m,SamYeager1907,,0,2025-02-21 17:40:47,,,,Depends I would have Apple replace battery when the keyboard had an issue Apple charges 250 for the battery but replaced the entire body of the laptop which is fused with the battery So you get a brand new bottom case keyboard touchpad touchbar and battery for 250 Pretty sweet deal Apple only charges 89 for iPhone batteries too and their batteries are amazing I wish my Android had that my only options are shitty third party knockoff batteries that dont last as long and I have to replace it myself or in a third party shop tbf I have a OnePlus phone Im not exactly depending on their support for it,mdxxkdi,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,me10zh8,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,1,2025-02-21 18:08:24,,,,For us we are only able to get the customer the discounted top case price if the diagnostic tests tell us SPECIFICALLY that the battery is bad We cant just willy nilly say battery is bad discounted top case pls the Apple store most likely has a lot more leeway in this For us if Apple catches us doing stuff like that they will charge US for the part a few months later when they dig into our repairs,me0uz0m,4.0,1iuihb1
comment,me11vbh,SamYeager1907,,1,2025-02-21 18:12:31,,,,There are multiple ways to get around this tho I knew an AASP that would do it and a lot more shady stuff on top than helped the customers at the cost of Apple But if you wanna be a straight shooter you can do mail in repair basically say your battery life sucks and theyll replace it with the discounted topcase They dont seem to check much on the mail in repairs Apple store is a hit or miss depending on the manager who sets the tone some are lenient others strict,me10zh8,5.0,1iuihb1
comment,me15ymv,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,1,2025-02-21 18:31:19,,,,there are ways around it of course but for us not worth the debit memos that Apple sends every month or when you get audited 10s of thousands of dollars of fines isnt worth the trouble,me11vbh,6.0,1iuihb1
comment,me1a0c6,SamYeager1907,,1,2025-02-21 18:50:02,,,,Have they always been this strict with audits Because 20192021 I used to have an AASP mass replace broken screen or very damaged Macs with new screens and bodies citing existing recalls It was a shady setup yeah and they obvs told me not to tell anyone who was doing it for me but it benefitted us both Then Apple stopped the screen recall but I was still getting bodiesbatteries replaced,me15ymv,7.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdxse7l,username_elephant,,62,2025-02-21 05:00:55,,,,Gotta remember Lenovo makes considerably more non ThinkPads than ThinkPads though At least more lines Not sure about more units but theres probably a fairly bimodal distribution,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdxt5a6,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,28,2025-02-21 05:06:00,,,,Yeah i understand We get their ideapads now and then and theyre quite a bit chintzier Most of our clients are corporations so we deal with the enterprise stuff for the most part,mdxse7l,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdyrlsr,mark-haus,,5,2025-02-21 10:14:19,,,,I wonder if framework computers will enter enterprises more since theyre very easy to replace parts for and they have a parts marketplace I imagine they dont manufacture them at a high enough volume yet though,mdxt5a6,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdzbkva,Throwaway-tan,,4,2025-02-21 12:58:42,,,,Repairability is more of a consumer and SME thing For large enterprise theyll usually just have a service agreement with whoever is supplying them and that company is responsible for repair or replacements Framework are also not a particularly established brand a lot of businesses would be wary of entering long term agreements with any business that could shutter at a moments notice,mdyrlsr,4.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdxzgqi,Ghozer,,11,2025-02-21 05:51:33,,,,Except at least in my experience Lenovo repairs are incapable of completing them properly and actually cause more issues than you originally sent it in for then screw you over when you complain so you end up with an unrepaired useless expensive broken laptop and say it was reported stolen so they are sending it back unrepaired,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdy04uk,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,6,2025-02-21 05:56:43,,,,lmao yeah their official repair depots can be awful were a 3rd party authorized depot and dont really run into problems like that the biggest issue IMO is sometimes they send techs used parts that may have been in a liquid spill situation they clean the boards up hopefully replace any burnt parts and send it to be reused so you install it and it now fries a whole bunch of other components and youve made troubleshooting it now almost impossible and these PC OEMs only want you to replace 1 part 5 parts if you have accidental damage coverage you cant shotgun a bunch of parts into it Apple will actually let you shotgun like 10 parts under warranty if you really make a case for it and every time you perform repeat service within 30 days it affects metricsbonus payouts so they are financially incentivized to at least stall you for a month if you keep having repeat issues Again Dell is the worst theyve sent us i dont know how many liquid damaged corroded and sticky residue having system boards expecting us to install them we just send them back,mdxzgqi,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdz5uff,ToMorrowsEnd,,3,2025-02-21 12:18:57,,,,Dell on location repair techs always have used parts Had my work laptop repaired and the dude swapped out 4 motherboards until it worked not a single one was sealed or even in a static bag,mdy04uk,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdy1lr5,Ghozer,,1,2025-02-21 06:08:27,,,,Yeah I do repairs myself to an extent Unless they are under warranty obv and I just dont bother with Dells I have worked in authorized service centers before too and know what you mean about that D The lenovo repair I was talking about wasnt one of their branded mainline stuff either it was Medon which they own but it should still have been covered but they just wiped their hands with it annoyingly if I hadnt sent it back I could have probably fixed it myself but what they sent back and I ended up with was in a worse condition biggerworse fault than I originally sent,mdy04uk,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdy3z0s,Pantim,,1,2025-02-21 06:27:51,,,,Well great Im waiting for a refurb Leveno Legion to show up at my door I was assuming that it being refurbished meant that they went over it with a fine tooth comb and made sure everything was on top shape,mdy04uk,3.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdy43xy,sayko666,,3,2025-02-21 06:29:01,,,,This My daugbters ideapad ruined because of the hinges They got hardened as time passed to the point breaking the screen from inside I learnt that from another brands technician it is a known issue but since the screen is broken the first thing they said was it is broken because of user error user hit the screen Thats a 900 laptop and they want 400 to fix it It has 7 months of guarantee remaing Bought laptop 15 years ago so it sucks We bought maybe 2025 lenovo monitors for office Only 1 of them was faulty and got replaced pretty soon But never buying a lenovo laptop again,mdxzgqi,2.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdxs61v,tifosiv122,,14,2025-02-21 04:59:25,,,,Agreed I find Lenovo very easy to repair and find parts for Had issues with their ssds but they arent the manufacturer of them so its hard to blame them,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdxsr1i,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,12,2025-02-21 05:03:21,,,,biggest issue i find with the thinkpads are the usbc ports crapping out and a lot of times theyre not removable and are soldered on yes i know you can resolder new ones but we have to do stuff by Lenovos book One they need to recess and protect the ports a little better using the chassis of the laptop like the Dell XPS and Macbook Pros do and two they need to make them easily removable They do on the X1 Carbons but only the X1 Carbons and im not sure why Apple you can just replace your IO boards and theyre only 15 a pop not even any serialization needed,mdxs61v,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdxt7dj,tifosiv122,,4,2025-02-21 05:06:23,,,,X1 carbons are the best IMO rock solid machines I know what you mean the XPS and MacBook Pros have the metal body,mdxsr1i,3.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdy70id,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,2,2025-02-21 06:54:18,,,,not much the LCDs and system boards though are probably worth selling if theyre higher end and in good condition check out ebay we can find used parts all day im talking OEM refurbished parts Lenovo and HP will gladly sell you whatever at least for a few years Dell for whatever reason tells you to pound sand for most things,mdxzuwe,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mdzbkgk,redzaku0079,,3,2025-02-21 12:58:37,,,,Dell used to have really good warranty coverage At least for their business machines I heard they had gone to shit but didnt believe it was this bad,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,me0gwbt,H0vis,,2,2025-02-21 16:35:54,,,,Random opinion on the Internet Ive had to deal with them a few times in the UK Theyre usually prompt and pretty good Had one where the guy asked me to install the replacement part myself and to be fair it was a CPU fan so I let it go another where the guy put the computer back together but it had some shit hanging out Had to tuck its guts back in that wasnt great Usually fine though,mdzbkgk,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,me0k756,redzaku0079,,2,2025-02-21 16:51:10,,,,I dealt with them a lot about 15 years ago Their business warranty was fantastic It had to be for the amount of machines we were returning each week At one point they simply started sending us new machines as we got off the phone with them We were told to send back the faulty ASAP but we could send them after the replacements arrived,me0gwbt,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,me0mtcu,H0vis,,1,2025-02-21 17:03:15,,,,We had a bit of that too before I started there Business 101 is that if youve got a customer ordering machines by the hundred you play the long game you want to be the people they call when those hundreds of computers need replacing in a few years Thing with business laptops is they are fast dirty expendables maybe with a decent spec and features but theyre not needed to last As long as most of them work most of the time its not a big deal,me0k756,4.0,1iuihb1
comment,me0x1lq,redzaku0079,,2,2025-02-21 17:50:16,,,,My longest lasting machines are my business machines You know which machines really suck for durability and ability to repair Consumer models Those are seemingly disposable computers There are some that are better than others sure But when it comes to a laptop I want to use for a long time I would much rather pickup a used business machine than a new consumer machine most of the time,me0mtcu,5.0,1iuihb1
comment,me0zb7r,H0vis,,1,2025-02-21 18:00:34,,,,I tend to agree but I would point out that for every business computer that seems happy to live forever theres always bunch that probably never quite worked right from day one and gave their IT teams constant trouble or others that dumpstered themselves after two weeks and needed to be replaced and loads that seem to have an innate sense for their warranty expiration and then start falling to bits,me0x1lq,6.0,1iuihb1

comment,mdzk2hh,rtb001,,1,2025-02-21 13:50:46,,,,Dells are also oddly designed too My workplace gave me a couple of AIOs which were super slow but I had to remove the hard drive so they can dispose of the work data Turns out they were super slow because they were essentially laptop mobo RAM and crappy 5400 rpm HDs stuffed into an AIO chassis and now work much better with some additional ram and SSDs But anyway it takes me a good 20 minutes to take apart the first AIO screws all over the chassis some sort of screwed on bracket inside screws in the hard drive caddy etc Then I started working on the second AIO which looks almost identical to the first and it is COMPLETELY tool less disassembly Pull a couple of tabs on the bottom and the whole thing just comes apart nicely Even the HD caddy was tool less Well why arent ALL of their AIOs designed like this then,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1

comment,me3y51b,Healthy_Jackfruit_88,,1,2025-02-22 04:10:03,,,,Really depends on the product line for instance I bought my wife a ThinkPad from on of Lenovos refurbished enterprise resellers and it works like a beast with some great upgrade options and only paid 250 She wont be playing modern games on it but it works for what she needs it to do for her Buying from resellers that have enterprise contracts is kinda the way to go because with some minor exceptions those laptops have seen light duty and are amazing for the price,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1

comment,mec8l12,SandKeeper,,1,2025-02-23 13:46:55,,,,To provide another perspective on Dell I work for my colleges IT department managing 40005000 Dell machines across campus While warranty claims can be tedious finding parts outside of warranty isnt an issue Dell has a parts lookup tool by serial number and we regularly source parts for 45 year old devices through their site or Amazon before sending requests to procurement So saying you cant get Dell parts out of warranty is just wrong Heres an example of an older AllinOne system with available replacement parts Old All In One Also Dells driver tool is awesome and they do a much better job on bios update tools than other brands in my opinion TLDR Dell parts are available well beyond warranty through a third party or themwe order them all the time Their driver tool is great too,mdxrjcj,1.0,1iuihb1
comment,medikhx,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,1,2025-02-23 17:47:42,,,,Ok Now try finding the parts for this Other than generic parts like SSDs and network cards you can buy anywhere actually looks like they have the battery available there at least Gets to be a pain in the ass Whereas Lenovo they basically have everything listed on their website in plain view easily found I was exaggerating a bit when I say you cant find parts you can we use Parts People all the time but that just introduces more possible failure points as you get used parts that are sometimes defective,mec8l12,2.0,1iuihb1
comment,mefcdao,SandKeeper,,0,2025-02-23 23:13:44,,,,This is a motherboard option for that particular laptop link If you dont type in an exact serial number to dell support It wont show you unit specific parts There are a lot of revisions of different models for dell so you have put the serial number in to get results I do understand though Its frustrating because it isnt simple from a user standpoint as Lenovos is for sure I believe Dell is culling their entire current lineup in favor of 9 skus only for their laptops and 9 skus only for their desktops This should hopefully simply their system a little Its going to be Dell Dell Pro Dell Pro Max With then their being an optional additional identifier with the plus and premium Rounding it out to give 9 total Then its just dependent on the year I do agree though that I wish Dell had a better system for checking for parts They do exist but they wont show without a specific serial number,medikhx,3.0,1iuihb1
comment,mefpsqz,UnnamedStaplesDrone,,0,2025-02-24 00:28:41,,,,I input specific serial numbers on a daily basis and am given barely any options for parts Its not a oneoff Its just Dell wanting their users to buy new systems rather than repair A lot of our customers buy 34k laptops so if you can buy a new system board and install it for them for around 800 its well worth it to them That system board in your link isnt even the correct board for that model,mefcdao,4.0,1iuihb1

comment,me60q0d,inwerp,,2,2025-02-22 14:17:31,,,,From the componentlevel repair perspective Lenovo is a piece of garbage 1 Some devices use internally programmed USBC controllers If you dont have the firmware you cant flash a clean one to fix a very basic charging circuit repair which is easy on most PC laptops and all Macs 2 Modern devices tend to use Lenovo ThinkEngine as an SIO chip which means if it dies you need to find a donor to fix it 3 WORST shit They have been using lowtemp solder for a few years now with a melting point of around 138C It is fragile as shitit dies if the mainboard bends it fucking bends as you type on the keyboard or grab the laptop by a corner This leads to all sorts of ripped BGA issuesmemory CPU SIO and inrush MOSFETs literally soldering themselves off the board which has become a signature problem on certain Lenovo devices 4 Even worse shit Compound Because of point 3 Lenovo decided to glue chips onto the board with an extremely hard adhesive Its way tougher than on iPhones Macs or even automotive devices On newer devices it hardens further when heated This makes trivial repairs extremely difficult Some adhesive variants are thermally unstable which means you solder a GDDR chip near the GPU keep everything around it as cool as possible but remember the 138C solder You finish the job and now the chips around it need reballing too because the solder popped out from the compound Removing chips on some devices is extremely challenging I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9 here which just needs a simple SIO reballing it only turns on if you press on the chip which is a 100 easy fix on any device except Lenovo Most likely I will have to drill it away since pulling it under heat would likely damage the PCB and rip off lots of pads So instead of a 30minute job including disassembly it becomes a hard case simply because of its manufacturing design I happen to know someone who has access to Lenovos internal remanufacturing kitchenLenovo themselves have no adhesive removal method If they need to remove a CPU from a board they CNCdrill it away To sum it upyes Lenovo is the shittiest brand to fix if you do componentlevel repair,,0.0,1iuihb1
