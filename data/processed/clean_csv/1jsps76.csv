comment,mlob7ug,Joshawott27,,385,2025-04-06 09:25:18,,,,I like how Nintendos first party option gives a more minimalist option whereas HORI are like But what if you had a personality Im not sure that Ill ever use the camera but I do like how cute the Piranha Plant idea is The only thing I wonder is what the difference in camera quality will be as HORIs is like 20 cheaper,,0.0,1jsps76
comment,mlodfs8,MultiMarcus,,102,2025-04-06 09:49:30,,,,I have a feeling its unfortunately going to be quite a bit worse especially if theyre able to have that price while also getting the Mario licensing stuff,mlob7ug,1.0,1jsps76
comment,mlotg0e,One_Minute_Reviews,,85,2025-04-06 12:22:33,,,,Did you watch thr stream That Official Ntendo camera looked pixelated and low saturation Not sure how it could look worse than that,mlodfs8,2.0,1jsps76
comment,mlowzbz,MultiMarcus,,36,2025-04-06 12:49:31,,,,It definitely could Also I would assume that is going to be mostly due to compression artefacts Even with a 4k webcam zoom meetings still look bad due to real time compression being meh,mlotg0e,3.0,1jsps76
comment,mlp7rao,zamzuki,,1,2025-04-06 14:00:36,,,,Youd be surprised When youre using your webcam in 4k it is not sending it in 4k Its not the compression its just the bit rate,mlowzbz,4.0,1jsps76
comment,mlp86d6,MultiMarcus,,14,2025-04-06 14:03:08,,,,Well its a bit of both In order to fit all of that data into that limited bit rate they are compressing stuff Which leads to compression artefacts and youre obviously right in the sense that the limited bit rate is the biggest issue,mlp7rao,5.0,1jsps76
comment,mlpak54,zamzuki,,-6,2025-04-06 14:17:09,,,,Yeah I work with 4k video its HUGE Unless youre on a direct fiber line with almost 300MPS upload youre automatically only broadcasting at 720 maybe 1080 if youre broadcasting to a server with a slight delay ie twitch This isnt because youre camera is compressing anything its because the sheer size of the information a 1080 video is consistent of 1920 pixles 4k has over 8 MILLION Do You Really Need a 4K Webcam its a great little article that goes further into it Its not artifacts at all youre just not able to send that much information,mlp86d6,6.0,1jsps76
comment,mlpb6r7,MultiMarcus,,11,2025-04-06 14:20:45,,,,Oh thats interesting I wouldve thought that some sort of compression algorithm was used to send the data but I guess it would add too much delay Just to clarify 1080p video is not 1920 pixels Thats the width of the screen but its about 2 million pixels total,mlpak54,7.0,1jsps76
comment,mlz54jr,Brachiomotion,,2,2025-04-08 03:13:32,,,,No you were right they apply compression real time The processors have the algorithms baked into the IC You are also correct that these compression algos are a big cause of the video quality issues,mlpb6r7,8.0,1jsps76
comment,mlotpg1,Morguard,,11,2025-04-06 12:24:39,,,,I dont think that was due to the camera but more so the data transfer,mlotg0e,3.0,1jsps76

comment,mm1bymg,pekosROB,,1,2025-04-08 14:09:10,,,,dude at 720p that would have been an instabuy for me just cuz its cute and shit and it looks like you can plug it straight into the Switch 2 instead of using a stand the nintendo cam might be able to do that too not entirely sure but at 480p thats a pass ill probably get a camera just because i like that stupid tech but ill probably end up never using it like my kinect 360 kinect xbox 1 ps4 eye lol,mm1asfw,3.0,1jsps76
