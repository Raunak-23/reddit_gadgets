comment,mcy3av0,None,,20,2025-02-15 19:10:39,,,,The real question is how do they handle burn in Every display that I am aware of where each individual pixel is a set of some type of emitter has had burn in issues Its always come down to the pixels dimming at different rates depending on usage since the back light doesnt really exist and instead is each pixel,mcwsiu4,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcy8esy,bfilippe,,43,2025-02-15 19:36:40,,,,A theater in Culver City California has Samsung Onyx MicroLED movie screens Burn in is possible but they dont need a brightness limiter like OLED since there is no organic matter that can be denatured Theyre brighter and more resistantno downsides aside from cost for now,mcy3av0,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,md1ob5m,Onsotumenh,,7,2025-02-16 08:54:30,,,,Its not only OLED every LCD display can develop uniformity and image retention issues Its not only the emitting side that can cause these problems People seem to forget that Today OLEDs have come so far that the wear on cheaper LCDs is often worse than on cheaper OLEDs Edit For example just look at the rting burn in test They also tested LCD displays and the results are not flattering for them,mcy3av0,2.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcza8xu,droppinkn0wledge,,4,2025-02-15 22:53:24,,,,The risk of burn in for modern OLED panels is almost nonexistent Its wild to me that people continue to pearl clutch about this I have 2k hours of the same MMO on the same OLED panel with zero burn in This is a problem that simply doesnt happen to people who practice the most basic level of OLED care,mcy3av0,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,md0hlvz,EijiShinjo,,6,2025-02-16 03:05:29,,,,Some people unplug their TV set after watching it which prevents the pixel refresh from running,md0fhe5,6.0,1iq2eu6
comment,md17zw4,TrptJim,,1,2025-02-16 06:16:22,,,,Thats the short maintenance refresh On my LG CX it is set to run automatically after 4 hours of continuous use but only when the display is next shut off If you keep the screen on it will never refresh until the long maintenance popup after 2000 hours When I first got the CX I kept it on for a week until noticing the screen retention being obvious Now I just turn it off every day after around 1218h of use no image retention at the end of the day even though that should technically have had 34 short refreshes instead of just the 1,md0hlvz,7.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mczv8ff,hellomistershifty,,7,2025-02-16 00:51:40,,,,To me the two most basic things are to use a black desktop background and set your taskbar to autohide I have a 55 LG CX so the monitor is big enough that I pretty much just randomly place windows and rarely fullscreen things I got a Best Buy warranty that covers burnin so I even turned off the auto logo dimming feature Despite 165k hours of usage there is no noticeable burnin,mczdqcm,4.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mczw8zg,BrunoEye,,8,2025-02-16 00:57:25,,,,Taskbar window borders common UI elements and frequent use of side by side windows are enough to lead to noticeable burn in For now Im happy enough with my 4K 144Hz fast VA panel that only cost me 325 Maybe in a couple more years prices will finally be low enough,mcza8xu,3.0,1iq2eu6
comment,md0drrp,TrptJim,,7,2025-02-16 02:41:24,,,,Theres really two things here that are being combined into one If a display is designed with good wear leveling burn in should not be an issue Temporary retention is possible between maintenance periods but is usually not an issue unless you keep the display on andor skip screen refreshes What you will definitely get over time though is a gradual dimming if your display as the wear leveling brings your max brightness down to the dimmest pixels That said I have put my OLED through hell and there is no noticeable burnin 22065 hours powered on over 52 months used mainly as a PC monitor for work but also for PCPS5 gaming and media consumption I would think that my case is at least a decent worst case scenario even as a single data point,mczw8zg,4.0,1iq2eu6
comment,md20hpw,BrunoEye,,7,2025-02-16 10:59:36,,,,Monitors Unboxed are doing a long term real world burn in test and have shown noticeable but not distracting levels of burn in after 6 months Interestingly it seems to not have gotten much worse at 9 months but Id still be a little worried about what itll look like after 23 years,md0drrp,5.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcy16av,TrptJim,,13,2025-02-15 18:59:53,,,,I dont see consumer models having the modular panels for most sizes A single panel would weigh less and avoid module alignment and seam visibility concerns,mcwsiu4,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcyae21,JoeyBigtimes,,2,2025-02-15 19:46:44,,,,Nah Those are both easily solvable problems Just design issues I wouldnt assume the consumer version of this tech would be exactly the same as the pro version,mcy16av,2.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcytby4,TrptJim,,4,2025-02-15 21:24:11,,,,The tolerances you are dealing with to align things pixel perfect are pretty small and become increasingly smaller with larger sizes and more panels Would be a nightmare to ship as a whole unit while staying aligned and could require professional installation if packed as separate modules Its not to say I dont welcome such a possibility It would be pretty cool to decouple dpi from screen size and just go as large as the display controller can handle I just dont see it being the normal thing sold to the mass market and hence wont sell in the numbers to be affordablesuccessful,mcyae21,3.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcxp2it,None,,-27,2025-02-15 17:59:13,,,,8000 for a 75 inch top of the line tv is incredibly reasonable What are you talking about 49900 for a 162 inch screen That literally was 500000 a couple years ago,mcwsiu4,1.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcy46tu,CallousChris,,1,2025-02-15 19:15:09,,,,I remember when my parents bought a 60 Sony flatscreen LCD TV this was brand new and tube TVs and large screens projector TVs were still very popular I think they spent around 8000 on it back then 23 years later I got an LED one for 2000 A few years later they were under 1k for larger sizes This will likely be the case for these and the OLEDs that are currently top of the line,mcxqoh7,4.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mdamew3,flowersweep,,1,2025-02-17 19:00:44,,,,Its really incredible Projectors have advanced a lot but not nearly as quickly as TVs have,mcy46tu,5.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcxprv1,None,,-3,2025-02-15 18:02:42,,,,What are you basing that on LG sells an oled 77 inch for 60000 right now 8k for a micro led is incredible,mcxpb3s,3.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mczsnlb,None,,1,2025-02-16 00:37:03,,,,You dont think 8k is comparable to 5k This would have been 60000 for the 77 micro led two years ago,mczq55n,5.0,1iq2eu6

comment,md9tzhh,Spanky2k,,3,2025-02-17 16:49:49,,,,How does any new tv tech improve life Its just nicer Its the stuff that people like to spend disposable income on OLED looks incredible but it cant be left on with a static image all the time The Samsung Frame lets a tv blend into a rooms environment so that you dont have an ugly black void on the wall I want to have both MicroLED will bring that Thats why I want it I currently have both an LG OLED and two Samsung Frames,md9h6uh,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcx5xuh,itsaride,,70,2025-02-15 16:22:07,,,,Its not just broadcast equipment I dare say American TV companies are mostly 4K capable its the bandwidth used by it one 4K channel 3 or 4 HD shopping channels and you dont want to lose those,mcwre5k,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcxbyiq,TeutonJon78,,36,2025-02-15 16:53:07,,,,It also doesnt help that ATSC 30 stalled out due to greed of the broadcasters going for licensing fees and DRM They shouldnt be allowed to DRM public airways Edit LG never implemented ATSC 30 just like Samsung wont implement Dolby Vision over fees And Samsung had 23 generations with ATSC 30 and pulled it from all but the top end of their 2025 line,mcx5xuh,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mu1hgxl,CautiousHashtag,,1,2025-05-24 17:35:35,,,,Dont bail them out like that its definitely the equipment as well Companies like ESPN have been the same shitty 720p for 15 years now They do maybe 4 games a year in 4K but theyre too cheap to invest in that equipment for more Theres 0 reason the CFP shouldnt have all been in 4K,mcx5xuh,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,md1iwyd,im_thatoneguy,,5,2025-02-16 08:00:13,,,,You have to take codes into account though DVD was MPEG2 Amazon is probably h265 On an apples to apples quality basis 12mbps h265 probably matches MPEG2 And Bluray was h264 so once again 15mbps h265 is in line with 30mbps Bluray,md0cuhw,2.0,1iq2eu6
comment,md3c18l,IAMA_Lucario_AMA,,6,2025-02-16 16:23:17,,,,very true and very good point cant believe i forgot to account for that thanks that still leaves amazons 4k streams at sub1080p quality on average which while nowhere near as bad as i made it out to be is still pretty unacceptable IMO especially in visually busy content like Flow which genuinely looks worse on amazon streaming than some 720p remuxes,md1iwyd,3.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcy2iqm,Fredasa,,3,2025-02-15 19:06:42,,,,Whats funny is that I think I have reached 95 of the way to all I want on the TV scale already There are only two things that bug me a bit with my QDOLED Burn in Honestly that concern has proven very manageable Like I wouldnt pay more than 10 more cost to dispense with my lingering burnin concerns I do think QDOLEDs response time spectrum needs work During a slow pan especially in anime high brightnesscontrast areas scroll with a visible stutter compared to low brightnesscontrast areas because the pixels are taking longer to reach their new targets in those areas I am _not_ convinced that MicroLED is burnin proof Ill _be_ convinced after theyve been in at least 10000 hands for a year And I sure as heck dont know if MicroLED fares any better in pixel responsiveness It could be worse We dont know,,0.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcy9kjh,Xesyliad,,12,2025-02-15 19:42:32,,,,MicroLED burn in Uhhh okay I mean ordinary LED tech has proven it doesnt suffer burn in and OLED has burn in because of the organic component Tell me why exactly you would think MicroLED would have burnin I mean thats one of its core traits it doesnt suffer burn in like OLED MicroLED solves all the problems of OLED burn in responsiveness etc,mcy2iqm,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mczwzcd,aitorbk,,3,2025-02-16 01:01:39,,,,Leds lose lumen output with ours of operation This is how it is Therefore microleds will have burn in Any technology that has single pixelssubpixels that lose luminance with use will suffer from burn in CRTs had id plasma had it oled had it and MicroLed will have it Microleds are supposed to last more hours than oleds so we should expect less burn in proportional to the effective hours of operation Simplyfing the problem Microleds are amazing The response time Is effectively instant if they dont use phosphors I want my next computer screen to be MicroLed,mcy9kjh,2.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcyctvl,Fredasa,,3,2025-02-15 19:59:17,,,,I mean ordinary LED tech has proven it doesnt suffer burn in How so There arent any TVs in the normal consumer market that use LEDs as pixels You seem to have a misunderstanding of the tech Tell me why exactly you would think MicroLED would have burnin Because I have a LCD TV from 2010 that developed burnin It took a while about 4 years under PC conditions but it happened The risk with LCD is low but it isnt zero What this _does_ mean is that when people say it cant burn in this is potentially fudging reality And that means claims about MicroLED arent worth much Whatever testing theyve conducted to reach a level of confidence about burnin _has not been proven by hardware in consumers hands for an extended period of time_ The only display technologies ever created which are truly immune to burn in are all non selfemissive Even CRTs develop phosphor burnin,mcy9kjh,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mczxevf,aitorbk,,2,2025-02-16 01:04:09,,,,Why If you have that backlight you might as well triple the leds and dont use filters You are dividing the required light by three making the panel thinner and the electronics simpler Also the lcd panels are quite slow and have angle issues,mcyrknr,4.0,1iq2eu6
comment,md0yruj,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-02-16 05:01:08,,,,I imagine a single large microLED can be brighter and last longer than the comparable RGB subpixels as is the case with LEDs at any size So you can simply get the same level of pixel perfect brightness control as an OLED with a regular LCD display matrix probably much greater brightness and contrast than any other technology with per pixel dimming,mczxevf,5.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcyxknz,Fredasa,,3,2025-02-15 21:46:15,,,,You asked a question my dude Is that really ample reason to go all ad hominem If MicroLED very quickly reaches OLEDs price levels then I will be pleasantly surprised Keyword surprised The problem it faces is that it isnt solving any major flaws or bringing any meaningful benefits that actually matter to 99 of consumers so adoption is going to depend almost entirely on whether it can outdo existing tech in price Even I as a consumer aware of what theyre buying wouldnt spend a great deal more on MicroLED than QDOLED if I had both in front of me,mcyqwzm,4.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mczmph3,CosmosExplorerR35,,3,2025-02-16 00:03:26,,,,Honestly one thing I think microLED will solve that I see QDOLED struggle with is brightness I have an Alienware AW3225QF QDOLED and when its displaying a pretty bright picture for example my desktop a bright scene in a game or movie I notice it doesnt seem as bright as my old LCD monitor So thats one reason I would choose microLED over QDOLED Just a note Im not speaking about peak brightness when the monitor can reach like 1200 lumens of brightness because 90 of the screen is darkblack Im talking when its displaying bright colorswhiteness in more than 70 of the screen and it doesnt get as bright as LCD,mcy2iqm,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mczpdab,Fredasa,,1,2025-02-16 00:18:37,,,,To convince consumers theyll have to set things up in a very particular way For starters it wont really work in a Magnolia style dark room All youll be showing off is that theres such a thing as too many lumens So itll need to be an AB comparison specifically between OLED and MicroLED in a brightly lit area Theyll probably want to pass on comparing it to QDOLED since its the brightest OLED tech there is right now So that means LG And the video footage itself will need to be essentially only daytime outdoors shots Anything high contrast would give the OLED display a chance as it would suffer less from its dependency on brightness windows But I feel like by the time MicroLED starts reaching a consumerfriendly price range OLED tech will have drastically addressed its own lumens issues making the fight that much tougher Furthermore MicroLED displays _do_ generate heat and its an easy guess that while it wont necessarily be as constrained as OLED displays will be designed to keep overall brightness on a curve just like OLED displays,mczmph3,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcwnvkx,MultiMarcus,,16,2025-02-15 14:44:34,,,,I think you might be missing something here TV manufacturers are well aware of that situation which is why they are aggressively pursuing ways to make low quality streamed content look better on their TVs From on device AI upscaling to better colours and lighting That is why OLED is a fairly large TV quality leap over LCD panels Unfortunately OLED has its own set of issues from bad light levels to inevitable burn in MicroLED is hopefully able to do all that an OLED can while being immune to burn in and very bright,mcwlaii,1.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcwy59x,Spanky2k,,3,2025-02-15 15:41:14,,,,Ive been using an LG C2 42 OLED TV as my main computer monitor for two years now I use it all day for work and several hours at night for gaming Most of that gaming is WoW which has static action bars I have zero burn in I do a few things to lower the chances of burn in for work I use a Mac and I have the dock and menu bar set to auto hide and I rotate between backgrounds every ten minutes or something I also dont maximise anything full screen I always like to use floating windows on MacOS especially on a high res monitor I really thought Id get some burn in by now so had assumed Id only keep the tv for a couple of years but its still perfect My point is that with minor precautions OLED burn in really isnt a big deal The automatic dimming protections when static stuff is on screen does its job if you ever bugger up and leave something on it,mcwpfvq,3.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcx04bg,WhenPantsAttack,,6,2025-02-15 15:51:42,,,,It wont be a big jump in image quality but it will be a big jump for well lit spaces and longevityburn in OLED wins in picture quality but fails in brightness and and the organic substrates arent very robust both of which traditional LED TVs excel in Micro LED TVs are basically the end game because it has all the benefits of both types without their either of their weaknesses The only problem with MicroLED is that its really hard to miniaturize the technology into a traditional TV size at a high resolution We could probably have a 1080p MicroLED TV today but that would be a questionable trade off with upscaling tech as it is and likely a fail in marketing when compared to the 4k and 8k OLED and tradition LED TVs so we wait until the technology matures,mcwmyuh,2.0,1iq2eu6

comment,mcx6h60,LargelyInnocuous,,2,2025-02-15 16:24:53,,,,microLED is like OLED but with less of the issues of OLED degradation So there is a long term consumer benefit even if the resolution doesnt change They probably just want to package it with a move to 8k because durability isnt a compelling marketing point for most of the market and selling 50k TVs is the best strategy when your manufacturing capacity isnt scalable yet,mcwlaii,1.0,1iq2eu6
comment,mcwr50q,thisischemistry,,3,2025-02-15 15:03:15,,,,So the main thing right now is brightness and contrast ratios Eliminating the backlight and going with emissive elements allows much better contrast ratios the problem with using OLED is that the organic layer tends to degrade over time To combat this they are often driven more gently and have lower brightness levels than they could have if they didnt degrade A MicroLED array tends to be much more durable than OLED and ticks most of the boxes well The major thing holding it up is the price of large displays if they can bring that down then its probably a significant upgrade over OLED This doesnt mean that OLED is bad or immediately useless but youd rather have MicroLED if the price point is similar,mcwlaii,1.0,1iq2eu6
