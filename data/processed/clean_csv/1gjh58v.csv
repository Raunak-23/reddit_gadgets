comment,lvdpux8,wicktus,,7,2024-11-04 17:42:16,,,,I am on Ryzen 5 3600 lmao so will build a PC around it when RTX 5000 releases early 2025 I think the 7800X3D is awesome but its quite expensive in France and RTX 5000 to which Im upgrading from a RTX2060 is hitting stores early 2025 anyways If I had a 7800X3D I would keep it its a beast that thing puts to shame the strongest intel CPUs in gaming and even some ryzen 9000 with ridiculously low wattage,lvd3k0s,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvhoiu9,miso89,,1,2024-11-05 07:56:22,,,,Well if you do decide you want one let us who actually need the upgrade buy one first,lvd3k0s,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvd805o,DigitallyDetained,,1,2024-11-04 16:14:12,,,,It does sound good but I wonder about heat Ive got my 7800x3D in a SFF and I dont know about cooling the 9800,lvd3k0s,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdsi7u,wicktus,,1,2024-11-04 17:55:02,,,,I think ryzen 9000 is cooler than ryzen 7000 its more efficient and they moved the thermal sensors positions but no idea for 9800X3D vs 7800X3D They clearly made the 9800X3D quite powerful fully overclockable etc so dunno,lvd805o,2.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvgclcj,huyanh995,,3,2024-11-05 01:57:58,,,,They moved the 3D cache to under the CCD So basically there is no blanket over the CCD and that opens a huge thermal dissipation capacity,lvdsi7u,3.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdd8ot,link_shady,,-8,2024-11-04 16:40:51,,,,I have my pc in the bedroom my wife is always cold so she pushes me to play when she gets really cold lol Yeah this thing runs hot,lvd805o,2.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdfoph,danielv123,,9,2024-11-04 16:52:55,,,,Really The 7800x3d is one of the lowest power alternatives for gaming The temps you get are high because they have had issues with thermal conductivity through the cache die Apparently that is one of the major improvements for the 9000 series x3d chips that allow them to clock higher and probably consume more power,lvdd8ot,3.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdppe2,link_shady,,2,2024-11-04 17:41:32,,,,First gaming pc I have had in over 10 years also a 4070 ti super no idea why if its the cpu or the gpu only but the tower does give a lot of heat And the cpu does reach around 70 or 80 c while gaming maybe my cooling is just not enough,lvdfoph,4.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdwz8n,Danne660,,3,2024-11-04 18:16:47,,,,The cpu is built to be fine running much hotter then 7080 c sounds like your cooling is more then enough,lvdppe2,5.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvejt55,danielv123,,3,2024-11-04 20:08:38,,,,Its expected to give off about 300w of heat For a smaller case like yours that will definitely be noticeable Most of it will go to the motherboard and misc stuff 50w ish and GPU up to 285w some to the cpu 80w in all core synthetic loads The competing intel chips will do 300w under a similar all core load,lvdppe2,5.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvez3tg,Kanguin,,2,2024-11-04 21:24:04,,,,As someone with a 14900k I dont think you know what running hot is,lvdd8ot,3.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvfeuev,amdpr,,-2,2024-11-04 22:46:06,,,,I completely understand you should upgrade and ditch the old stuff Ill take care of the old stuff for you let me send you the shipping label You are welcome,lvd3k0s,1.0,1gjh58v

comment,lvdhn5l,MarkJFletcher,,3,2024-11-04 17:02:28,,,,Whats the lift over the 5800x3d 33 maybe,,0.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvfyhjg,dark_sable_dev,,5,2024-11-05 00:35:47,,,,More than that Dont forget youre jumping to a new platform with DDR5 too The 7800x3d is 20 faster than the 5800x3d already,lvdhn5l,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdz59u,carrot1401,,6,2024-11-04 18:27:16,,,,Wonder if its worth jumping over from a 5800x3D,,0.0,1gjh58v
comment,lveb5eq,jfgjfgjfgjfg,,11,2024-11-04 19:25:56,,,,Youd have to also replace the motherboard and RAM since its AM4AM5,lvdz59u,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lveb82v,carrot1401,,3,2024-11-04 19:26:19,,,,Yeah I know wondering if its worth the outlay,lveb5eq,2.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvi6zrr,gerard2100,,1,2024-11-05 11:18:37,,,,It could be more efficient to upgrade to the 7800x3d because it will for sure go down when the 9800x3d gets out,lveb82v,3.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdapl3,deka101,,2,2024-11-04 16:28:02,,,,Im looking to build a new PC mid next year is AMD coming out with a new socket soon with new chips like Intel,,0.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvdklgw,XenitXTD,,11,2024-11-04 17:16:52,,,,AMD has made it clear that they intend to use AM5 till 2027 minimum with the intent to use it longer to have a long life like the AM4 socket did So I dont think there is anything to hold out for until 2728 at least,lvdapl3,1.0,1gjh58v
comment,lvh32qv,Tokishi7,,1,2024-11-05 04:41:05,,,,Sounds good on my end Hopefully that means the 7800x will have time to get flooded or maybe some crazy 9800x deal appears lol I would like to upgrade from my 3600x in the next year or two and go to 36gb of RAM as well But idk the self aging signs are there Could be the last upgrade for some time,lvdklgw,2.0,1gjh58v
