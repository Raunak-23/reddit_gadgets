post,1kkyrtt,chrisdh79,Bike-mounted sensor could boost the mapping of safe cycling routes | Studies have shown that many people don't commute by bike due mainly to a fear of being hit by cars.,1187,2025-05-12 17:40:35,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1kkyrtt/bikemounted_sensor_could_boost_the_mapping_of/,78.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mrykfb3,AlexHimself,,111,2025-05-12 18:51:51,,,,Neat idea but mostly useless without mass adoption TLDR They have a custom sensor that plugs into the end of your handlebar while you ride and it collects data like how closefast cars are to you when they pass you and then give bike paths a safety rating Current safety ratings are based on number of reported crashesso you have to have a bunch of people get smoked by cars to learn something isnt safe,,0.0,1kkyrtt
comment,mrz3waz,jaymemaurice,,27,2025-05-12 20:29:23,,,,This is just a bad idea from the onset The distance cars pass you is not what is killing cyclists Cyclists are getting killed by vehicles turning So many dedicated bidirectional bike lanes are getting their white bike after millions spent on dedicated infrastructure yet we still do things based on feeling rather than data and practicality,mrykfb3,1.0,1kkyrtt

comment,ms1v8ip,Isotheis,,8,2025-05-13 06:57:17,,,,Please only if done right Here are some bad examples from my experience NO border or drain separation I need to be able to go on and off the road if there are obstacles NO barrier or plant separation I need to be able to see and to be seen Unless youre making it a proper separate road even for crossings of course YES continuity Its completely useless or outright dangerous if you just drop me off at the next crossing YES markings No one can tell its a bike lane if you dont make it the whole way Putting a sign at the entrance is useless Its in fact detrimental stresses me out having to hunt for the tiny signs far off the road NO mixing with pedestrians Youre just adding pedestrians to the death counter while not even protecting cyclists cars dont expect cyclists on the sidewalk NO tiled cycle path In a few years the tiles get uneven and dangerous Especially with nature around Bad infrastructure is worse than no infrastructure It gives a feeling of safety while things are in fact more dangerous 100 of my accidents occurred while on cycle paths or trying to get onoff,mrz1s61,1.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms491l8,toaster404,,3,2025-05-13 16:41:29,,,,I was on a committee evaluating bike infrastructure Most of these points came up and were dismissed The resulting infrastructure caused crashes I actually hit a pedestrian darting between parked cars Wide outer lanes looked to be more effective than mere paint and hope That was in 1973 and were still making the same mistakes because theyre cheap Im pulling for elevated 4 lane cycle highways with clear on and off ramps With cover hosting solar cells Ideally enclosed with wind driven system to ventilate with a tail wind Imagine how many would commute then Instead we have the painted lane and marks where we dont need them which dump us into kill boxes with no directions on how to proceed Motonormativity Meanwhile there are so many places I cant get to safely even as a highly experienced rider with pretty good urban skills Now we have the evehicle issue so my typical weekend ride contains autos fast ebikes slower ebikes weaving fast sporty cyclists slow nonsporty cyclists runners joggers random people wandering across escooters moving and abandoned people rolling their luggage to the airport tourists blocking both directions potholes gravel mud sections sometimes crankdeep water from the high spring tides drunks muggers double parkers moving trucks police cars parked in my lane garbage cans drainage grates caltrops you think Im kidding broken glass I still have a good time Imagine what it would be like without these entertaining hazards,ms1v8ip,2.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms57nda,Isotheis,,1,2025-05-13 19:27:14,,,,Im also part of a cycling advocacy association I am a bit special compared to the others due to my extremely long commuting distances No one else would take the cycle to go to the hardware store 20km over nevermind volunteeringworking 40km over They just use the car But I want to believe living without a car is possible Unfortunately my city is essentially bankrupt There are many projects on the table and no money to actually pay for anything Theres a bridge reconstruction project coming soon but thats only because its paid for by the train company as they fear itll collapse on their rails Still our job to chime in and ensure the new bridge is better adapted to cycles and pedestrians I got hit by cars twice while walking than the old one Within my town its mostly chill The main issue is people walking dogs without a leash or trash bags left onto the cycle path Delivery people too but rarely parked cars Close passes are rare too people frequently go all the way onto the opposite lane and I give a big thumbs up in return every time So its mostly intercity travel I want to focus on places where cars can be found going 90kmh And connecting our stores to our cycling infrastructure a bit better But to be fair theres not even a sidewalk there either construction guys cheated on the plans and nobody went to check before it was finished,ms491l8,3.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms5crqx,toaster404,,2,2025-05-13 19:52:26,,,,I look at the US Interstate Highway system and cant help but contemplate a median trail system connecting cities All that wasted space Would cost nothing compared to adding an extra car lane Here in the metro Washington DC USA area we have lots of fragments of excellent infrastructure connected by wishful thinking,ms57nda,4.0,1kkyrtt
comment,mrzmqr2,Thats_a_YikerZ,,-16,2025-05-12 22:06:49,,,,yep nice idea but in the end it comes down to trading out a car lane for bike lane which simply adds to more congestion,mrz1s61,1.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms01fsw,8days_a_week,,11,2025-05-12 23:29:38,,,,Cba to look it up but generally adding more lanes generally leads to more traffic while fewer lanes single lane actually keeps traffic moving better Could be wrong Happy to ready studies to contrary if you want to post Discuss if you want or dont I just want dedicated bike lanes,mrzmqr2,2.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms0krxq,alidan,,-1,2025-05-13 01:20:23,,,,depends on where you are and how good traffic follows the rules if you have a forward and left lane and then a right only traffic should be smoother and flow more but then if you have more than 1 lane it was a road that already heavily used removing one of the lanes makes that road less trafficked sure but if every road now has 1 lane and the traffic isnt dealt with you now have half the space for the same volume of cars poorly implemented bike lanes I believe one in san francisco caused what use to be a heavily used by somewhat fast traffic road to become a 15 minute wait to get down and the bike lane went unused because it was a make work project to feel good about what they were doing with the area to hell with who lives there people had to move because if they required an ambulance they were dead you then either have to cannibalize side of road parking which if its a residential area is likely free for residence who now have to pay a parking pass and inconvenience themselves by walking to where they can park or cannibalize a lane for traffic which honestly just breeds resentment bike lanes are good when the city is planned around them not when they are retrofitted into existing cities personally I think bike lands should eat into side walk space and not road traffic,ms01fsw,3.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms0qg30,8days_a_week,,3,2025-05-13 01:53:24,,,,Mostly fair points I dont particularly feel bad for the residential street parkers as I dont think the public roadways should be for your free car storage Inclined to agree with bike lands eating into sidewalks especially in my city where sidewalks are legitimately like 1520 ft wide,ms0krxq,4.0,1kkyrtt
comment,ms0v5cq,alidan,,-1,2025-05-13 02:19:50,,,,for the most part parking on the side of the road is the expected norm in a residential area especially in cities where they may not have a garage attached to where they live I dont think taking that away from people for bike lanes is a good thing in all honesty I think ebikes and traditional bikes should be treated different I think ebikes should be driven with cars in city traffic they shouldnt require a drivers license but maybe a minimum age in a city ebikes make the most sense to use outside of bad weather I think actual bikes should be eat sidewalks ill put it this way the worst I have ever seen in america a sidewalk get is still able to have a bike drive down it and in a city where they may need scaffolding either detour to the outer left perimeter or walk the bike and stay on the right if it ends up eating into the bike area I think city planning going forward should make bike lanes either eat sidewalk space or if its new plan for bikes from the outset and not a painted line an actual car cant cross with out potentially fucking the car up barrier the only time a bike lane should eat into actual traffic lanes is if the route is the only one a bike can realistically travel lets say a bridge where sure there is a more open route but its 2 miles out of the way on a car that would suck but doable on a bike that a massive amount of effort and you should be incentivising bikes over cars ideally in a city,ms0qg30,5.0,1kkyrtt
