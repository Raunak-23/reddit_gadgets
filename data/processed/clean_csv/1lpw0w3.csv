comment,n15ffcb,somewhatboxes,,5,2025-07-03 16:18:51,,,,i took an old computer i had and got some direct attach storage enclosures and some refurbished HDDs server part deals i think direct attach storage is almost exactly the same as network attached storage in form factor but the interface on the box is USB so it has to plug into a computer hence direct NAS units are a little steep in price because the enclosure basically has a computer in it which is fine if you need that but if you happen to have a computer on hand anyway even a laptop if youre totally done using it then you can cut that cost out and save a ton of money on DAS enclosures and HDDs in my case the stack happens to be baseline m1 mac mini a bunch of HDDs various direct attach storage enclosures,n11c9nc,2.0,1lpw0w3

comment,n10uko7,kenman345,,54,2025-07-02 22:18:17,,,,Yea I think what theyre doing is fine if youre enterprise gear only Having people use your gear with validated expensive options is kinda normal They shouldve just made a press release stating they are enterprise only and dropped a few lines when they did the refresh and then its on consumers that are using pro grade gear for that expense But they didnt and this is entirely anti consumer Everyone knows WD makes a perfectly good Red Pro drive and Seagate has the IronWolf I believe that also do well we dont need to be upsold on drives They,n107l0a,1.0,1lpw0w3
comment,n1a0m21,NoobensMcarthur,,3,2025-07-04 09:18:41,,,,This is a dog shit value for money proposition for enterprise as well Any project I have to deal with needs to come with quotes from multiple vendors Any company that looks more than surface deep will see this is a rip off How can you possibly justify the value Its not like theyre 365 where they actually have the business by the balls,n10uko7,2.0,1lpw0w3
comment,n1cbulm,kenman345,,1,2025-07-04 17:45:47,,,,Cant argue for the value proposition of enterprise but at least I could understand the move if they were trying to say this is because theyre enterprise only now,n1a0m21,3.0,1lpw0w3

comment,n15e5l0,somewhatboxes,,2,2025-07-03 16:12:44,,,,i strongly encourage it i had a base m1 mac mini that i wasnt using for much else so i got some DAS enclosures and some refurbished HDDs and now it quietly hums along as a media server and basic automation machine in my home if youre not in the macOS ecosystem you can get a lowpower PC for about the same price might not do encoding as well but i havent been following that side of things for a while and you can grow or shrink various components as your needs call for,n11f8sb,2.0,1lpw0w3
