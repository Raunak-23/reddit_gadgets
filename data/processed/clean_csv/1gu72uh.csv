comment,lxrs1cv,mobrocket,,1537,2024-11-18 15:53:07,,,,My guess is Current or former employee who still has network access Or someone who is able to log in as an employee due to name a reason My guess is ATT is like many companies who view good IT security just as an expense and not as a necessary asset,,0.0,1gu72uh
comment,lxrsxyp,VagSmoothie,,531,2024-11-18 15:57:55,,,,Its definitely internal fraud Someone on the inside has access to tracking and passes it off to the thieves for a cut Banks are quite good at tracking this kind of thing logging which employee accounts are accessing which customer accounts and doing a trace back to find the culprit I doubt that telecoms have ever really needed to do this type of thing so its gonna be a while before they can put a stop to it,lxrs1cv,1.0,1gu72uh
comment,lxsduex,akaender,,208,2024-11-18 17:44:45,,,,I built an integration to their backend API a few years ago for an internal company portal so that employees could selfservice manage their employee paid mobile plansdevices I ran into an issue where the integration was failing against their test environment that they had given us credentials for to test ordering devices etc without actual transactions happening So I escalate and eventually end up on a call with a lead developer on their side and he says oh yea the test environment has been broken for years and no one knows how to fix it Just test in production which is not a good idea so I challenged back If I run these test transactions through production wont that result in charges being applied to our account and devices shipped how do I flag them as test transactions so that this doesnt happen to which he confidently replies Just use this fake address to the North Pole we have this hard coded in production to automatically cancel the order This is how we test internally I take this info back to my management and told them no fuckin way was I going to use my own corporate pcard to run these tests against their prod because I had zero confidence in that working out well for me My manager thinks itll be fine though so gives me his pcard and Im like okay whatever you get to deal with the fallout of this You can probably guess what happened next I ran a small test batch of 10 device orders We received 4 cancel emails and 6 YOUR ORDER HAS SHIPPED emails My boss gets 6x iPhone charges on his pcard for devices shipped with tracking numbers to a fake address at the north pole They were unable to cancel those orders because the address was invalid yet the billing and labels had been printed somehow and the devices left the warehouse never to be seen again Fortunately since they never showed as delivered we were able to charge back the billing All that to say their backend is likely compromised in so many ways that this article doesnt surprise me at all,lxrsxyp,2.0,1gu72uh

comment,lxtb356,rebbsitor,,15,2024-11-18 20:32:15,,,,The opposite actually If someones not there to sign for a package FedEx will redeliver it or hold it for pickup Or worst case return it if no one ever gets it but at least they dont lose the phone A company is legally responsible for delivery of a product to the customer not their doorstep If it gets stolen off a porch the company has to file an insurance claim for it or eat the cost They may try to convince someone its their problem but legally the seller is on the hook for it Pretty much every other company does signatures on items like that for this reason ATT is the oddball here,lxt53tg,4.0,1gu72uh
comment,lxwzock,edvek,,2,2024-11-19 12:23:25,,,,That wouldnt stop much unfortunately When you order directly from Samsung they always require a signature One time through FedEx I had to go pick it up at their center because I missed it as I was at work The other time it was UPS and the guy just dropped it off and left Wasnt a big deal as I was home but he didnt even attempt to get my signature even though the shipping and all that clearly stated a signature was required Lazyemployees who dont carestill using COVID rules will just drop the package and leave If they have to take it back that means they have to return again to attempt delivery Why come back when I can just come once,lxsyu1i,3.0,1gu72uh

comment,lxslkab,tubezninja,,12,2024-11-18 18:23:30,,,,Without a doubt its gotta be disgruntled ATT employees most likely working retail Their pay is based heavily off commissions and they have increasingly unrealistic quotas and metrics they have to meet The system is heavily skewed to force motivate store salespeople to make sales If you go into a brick and mortar cell carrier store for help with your account or to just get a new SIM card youll discover pretty quickly that none of the staff there will want to help you unless they can sell you something If you walk away from the store without buying anything it counts negatively on their metrics And its not enough to just sell you a new phone Doing just that is also a negative They also have to try and push a a new line of service on your account Device insurance Their family location tracking addon Pet and car trackers that also require separate lines of service Accessories like chargers screen protectors cases and cables all of which you might already have or can get cheaper somewhere else Each sales employee has to sell a certain number of these If not they not only miss out on commission but they could be shown the door if they dont hit their quotas If you notice every once in a while people will post on rATT rVerizon or rtmobile about how they left a store and discovered they got got charged more than they were told and their account has addons and lines they didnt ask for this is why The customer probably needed something basic and the employee had their back to the wall because theyre required to upsell So they crammed what they could onto that customers account maybe confused the customer with a bunch of doublespeak and hoped they wouldnt notice long enough for it to stick to their metrics TLDR When you already have to be unethical to keep your job its not that far of a reach to start selling out customer data you have access to so someone else can go for device thefts This is why I tell people to avoid going into a brick and mortar phone shop unless theres some reason you absolutely have to If youre buying a new phone buy it unlocked direct from the company that makes it if you can like the Apple Store or direct from GoogleSamsungwhatever It sucks for anyone working at these shops who maybe dont have any other choice but going in there puts you in a grift thats a pain to get out of and your personal data is also at risk too when youre on the employees radar and they have reason to access it,lxrs1cv,1.0,1gu72uh
comment,lxtjj06,mikka1,,3,2024-11-18 21:14:39,,,,And its not enough to just sell you a new phone Doing just that is also a negative They also have to try and push a a new line of service on your account Device insurance LOL we had a recent story in one of the local immigrant groups from a guy who left a bit puzzled after he visited ATT office just to get his first line in the US and left with 438mo services 4 lines etc etc,lxslkab,2.0,1gu72uh

comment,lxspce1,FrenzalRhomb1,,7,2024-11-18 18:42:28,,,,Heres my thoughts on this as someone that orders iPhones from ATT for work a lot When you place the order you get an email confirmation with the address and Fedex tracking number the only way to know the address is thru this email the tracking number when checked on fedexcom just says the city and the approx delivery time of by 530 pm for example I suspect these theives have access to Fedexs internal systems and can see the sender is ATT and obviously the recipients address they would also have more info on the drivers route to know more closely the delivery time so they dont have to sit in front of a random house for 8 hours the package label doesnt say it is from ATT its just some random address Also I was accepting a large iPad delivery from a Fedex driver at work and I said to him yay the iPads finally arrived and he told me to never tell a Fedex employee that as some of them will steal valuable items,,0.0,1gu72uh

comment,lxu5gh8,Hottentott14,,2,2024-11-18 23:10:18,,,,Can someone explain to me an ignorant European why porch deliveries of packages are seemingly so extremely ubiquitous in the US despite all Ive heard about it for the last ten years being rampant porch piracy Im lucky enough to live in a country there this seemingly isnt that big of a problem though theres been an increase the last few years And thus fewer people are using that delivery method as there are 15 other options without that risk Why hasnt the US simply moved away from unguarded deliveries Whenever I hear about it its presented as a law of nature with absolutely no solution And thats just not the case,,0.0,1gu72uh

comment,lxum2p8,Straight-Ad6926,,1,2024-11-19 00:46:37,,,,Porch deliveries are very common in the US and there are a few reasons for this One major factor is convenience Many people prefer having packages delivered directly to their homes rather than having to pick them up from a central location or locker The sheer size and population density of the US make centralized delivery points less practical in many areas While porch piracy is a known issue there are several measures being taken to combat it Some people use security cameras or video doorbells to monitor their porches Others have packages delivered to secure lockers or use services that allow deliveries to be made inside their homes or garages Some delivery companies are offering more flexible delivery options to minimize the risk of theft Its not that theres no solution but its a balance between convenience and security and different people and areas are adopting various strategies to address the problem,lxu5gh8,1.0,1gu72uh
comment,lxvaru3,incubusfox,,0,2024-11-19 03:12:03,,,,Another reason is just how many packages are delivered each day My UPS hub had 57k volume on Friday across 4 delivery centers and its only a medium sized hub covering the northern section of a major city ranking the top 30 by population theres a center covering the downtown area and another center on the other side of the city covering the southern expanse of this area All told its about 180 drivers in my building I believe each driving anywhere from 100250 stops though a good amount of those are to businesses To do what youre suggesting would truly be a paradigm shift And to be honest youre hearing a ton about porch piracy but in most of the country it isnt actually a thing,lxu5gh8,1.0,1gu72uh
