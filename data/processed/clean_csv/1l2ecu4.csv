comment,mvveu3x,tablepennywad,,4,2025-06-04 01:01:12,,,,Phone tech was so wild in those days I remember tiny phones becoming the rage they got so tiny with the nokia i think 82xx series something like that What i wanted was polyphonic ringtones i think mostly japanese phones had that Then color but backlit color was a real luxury ala gameboy color had no backlight can you imagine Razr became peak fliphone and was like 500 which was nuts when most phones were free I return it after the HTC Blue Angel branded SX66 came out as it was one of the first slide phones running Windows CE of some form and has Wifi AND bluetooth on a phone My last windows phone was the HTC Diamond which had GPS Back then gps was always a monthly cost feature similar to how every text cost a few cents Can you imagine if thats still the case,mvsnlyz,3.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvvldf4,Oops_I_Cracked,,1,2025-06-04 01:39:21,,,,The first slider phone was actually a 1996 Nokia with a monochrome screen The slider form factor predates color screens but yes it didnt get popular until after color screens I think people tend to forget how quick tech was changing back then relative to today In the 00s it was normal for a company to launch new flagship level devices 23 times a year,mvsb1yb,2.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvtlk2b,Kichigai,,2,2025-06-03 19:15:58,,,,Series 60 baby The problem with the NGage was its target market at the time didnt have money for a smartphone or cellular Internet And it was doomed in the American market because they didnt partner with a carrier most Americans didnt know you could just stick your SIM into any unlocked phone Also half the country couldnt use it because only ATT and TMobile used the GSM network Verizon and Sprint subscribers were locked out,mvsi6gi,2.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvscq2s,jayclydes,,33,2025-06-03 15:38:37,,,,Ive been using my PSP Go religiously and never looked for an upgrade or replacement If the price isnt ludicrous Id gladly give this a go I think the only blunder of the PSP Go not considering its real time issues of going fully digital before the market for that was there was the lack of two thumb sticks I just hope they dont make it like 800 dollars Stereo sound 2 thumb stick IPS display PSP Go is a dream come true for people like me that never found something that scratched the same itch The dimensions also seem really really appealing,,0.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvsrrvo,Cm1Xgj4r8Fgr1dfI8Ryv,,22,2025-06-03 16:48:53,,,,Im confident thisll come in below 300 Anbernics generally stayed on the lower end of the retro handheld market and this appears to be similar or slightly worse specs than their RG 557 250 or RG406H 160 The largest issue youll face is that Anbernics Android software hasnt been wonderful but the community usually has a few custom firmwares that provide a debloated and improved experience,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvtfa6j,shadowwolf151,,9,2025-06-03 18:36:08,,,,IMO the real blunder of the PSP Go was not having real battery monitor the battery level icon that showed on the Go was purely software and time based It has no idea what the charge level of the battery really was,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvtxxo8,Neo_Techni,,4,2025-06-03 20:16:54,,,,And Sony did that deliberately cause the batteries on the regular PSP were an attack vector for hackers I shit you not PSP was hacked via its smart battery features,mvtfa6j,2.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvuc3fu,Kichigai,,10,2025-06-03 21:25:45,,,,I just hope they dont make it like 800 dollars Anbernic devices have generally been reasonably priced but the real bugaboo is Liberation Day,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvt6y3e,lolno,,8,2025-06-03 17:57:22,,,,The real blunder of the PSP Go imo is the micro M2 card at least as far as using it today is concerned So annoying,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvt80rs,jayclydes,,3,2025-06-03 18:02:11,,,,Ive an SD card adapter hasnt been an issue for me It is remarkably annoying when the very slight bump the adapter gives makes it incompatible with controller grips and other original accessories made for it You can solder a specially made SD card slot in place of the M2 slot but that isnt in the scope of most people,mvt6y3e,2.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvuu4xu,lolno,,1,2025-06-03 23:02:24,,,,I remember looking years ago and seeing that mod but I dont recall seeing any actual adapters just the ones for the full sized M2 the regular PSP uses Ill have to check that out my PSP Go has been collecting dust for a minute lol,mvt80rs,3.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvve6n0,DomLite,,2,2025-06-04 00:57:20,,,,Honestly if you managed to grab a Switch before they did the small hardware revision referred to as Mariko it was incredibly easy to jailbreak it and put custom firmware on it I did so and I have literally thousands of retro games playable on it via emulators ranging from all the way back to the OG NES up to PS1 N64 and PSP Given hardware limitations mean that some of the PS1 stuff can get a bit laggy from time to time if it features intense 3D animations and lots of particle effects but thats a small price to pay for Legend of Dragoon on the go with a screen the size of the Switch plus the entire Switch library itself These dedicated retro handhelds tend to have smaller screens or dedicate themselves to replicating a specific retro handheld like that one thats basically What if we just remade the Gameboy in 2022 and those factors just put me off If Im going to drop money on a device dedicated to playing video games on the go I want something with a big screen and the processing power to play whatever I want on it within reason of course This thing having a 43 screen means modern stuff with widescreen support is basically DOA and while it boasts that I could play PS2WiiDreamcast games on a screen that small UIs that were designed to be viewed on a television are going to be difficult to readnavigate Honestly the Steam Deck is about as close to an ideal portable gaming machine as Ive seen but I know it has its own limitations and the larger form factorweight makes it a bit less portable than the Switch so neither is exactly perfect Plus ya know kinda hard to get your hands on a Steam Deck Overall a hacked Switch is my sweet spot at the moment but if we get a revised Steam Deck or something similar to it with a bit more power and a bit smaller that might hit peak for me Basically if we land a handheld PC thats capable of running PS3 emulation and has a nice sized screen thats all Ill ever want for retro gaming on the go especially if it can dock to be playable via TV as well so I can resume my gaming when I get home TLDR These bespoke retro handhelds tend to be way too pricey and far too narrowly focused Hacked Switch does it great right now and Steam Deck is almost perfect but needs another pass for more power and less size to get there,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4
comment,mvwka5h,Snipedzoi,,1,2025-06-04 05:42:14,,,,Research the retro handhelds market This is the power of a really old phone so itll be about 200 max,mvscq2s,1.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvs6cn8,chrisdh79,,2,2025-06-03 15:08:58,,,,From the article Anbernic is used to playing on our nostalgia and to be honest that strategy seems to be working Just last month the company released its Anbernic RG34XXSP which is a Game Boy Advance SPlike retro handheld that somehow crams your love for Game Boys and the GameCube into one very affordable gadget My millennial lust for gaming nostalgia is tingling just thinking about it Now Anbernic is taking that same strategy and applying it toward another retro gadget you may not have had on your retro gaming bingo card2000sera sliding phones Anbernics RG Slide is the companys newest handheld in a very long stream of handhelds that somehow seems to be getting longer and longer The slide has a TPS IPS screen that comes in a 43 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1280 x 960 pixels The display unlike my iPhone 13 supports a 120Hz refresh rate has a contrast ratio of 12001 and has a max brightness of up to 500 nits Emulationwise Anbernic says this sliding handheld will be able to play PS2 Wii GameCube and Dreamcast games at a 640 x 480 resolution Itll also emulate PS1 and N64 games at a 320 x 240 resolution I think the headlining feature of this handheld isnt what it emulates or how good or bad the screen is its the form factor The RG Slide as you may have guessed from the name has a sliding screen that pushes up to reveal two thumbsticks a Dpad ABXY buttons and a start and select button in the middle That design might be evocative of a couple of things but for me it has 2000sera phones written all over it Yes its also got big Xperia Play energySonys gamingcentric smartphone from 2011but my mind goes back even further to the days of sliding phones from LG or Nokia What I would pay to slide open my LG Shine Slide one last time,,0.0,1l2ecu4

comment,mvt4ceb,Grady300,,1,2025-06-03 17:45:50,,,,Ive been dying for a phone like this Current biggest drawback for me is the retro style A 43 720p screen and tiny form factor doesnt seem like its doing this many favors I want something with the form and power of a modern iPhone Bonus points if it could dual boot into Steam OS or Linux,,0.0,1l2ecu4
