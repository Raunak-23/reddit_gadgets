comment,mtnn4bp,Durahl,,273,2025-05-22 13:59:26,,,,Lets be VERY honest for a moment While cool this wouldnt be necessary if Nvidia simply ditched their atrociously underspecced 12VHPR Cable for something akin to an XT6090 with matching Cable diameter used in the RC Hobby Making the switch to a 2Wire large diameter Silicone sleeved Cable instead of that rats nest of a dozen thin diameter Cables would IMHO also massively improve the aesthetics inside a Case,,0.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtp5alr,CaptainRogers1226,,52,2025-05-22 18:20:34,,,,Seriously like why should this be a problem that has to be solved in the first place Almost like the tech version of orphancrushing machine,mtnn4bp,1.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtyv752,kayl_breinhar,,7,2025-05-24 06:22:00,,,,Dont forget that nVidia is also learning a horrible lesson here We dont need to change anything because everyone else is fixing our problem for us,mtnn4bp,1.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtyvnn3,akeean,,2,2025-05-24 06:26:30,,,,They could just have load balancing specced as required as some cards have them and do not suffer from the issues of single cables overloading The component cost at scale for a shunt resistor for each pin is probably a few dozen cents at most nothing compared to the ridiculous MSRP of the card never mind the actual retail price NVIDIA designed those 600W cards in a way that it cant tell how much power it is drawing through wich cable and if there is the a slight difference in resistance in a cable which can happen from manufacturing defects mishandling simply on the inner side of a pack of cables when bent as a group heat or varying cable length in a group more power will go through one strand potentially enough to go multiples above spec Seasonic is selling a broom to swipe up after NVIDIAs repeated misconduct,mtnn4bp,1.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtnxk48,The_JSQuareD,,5,2025-05-22 14:51:33,,,,I imagine 8 AWG would be quite hard to bend and route in the constrained space inside a computer case But yeah this is totally on nvidia and they should have known better,mtnn4bp,1.0,1ksqzce
comment,mto1ojb,viperfan7,,44,2025-05-22 15:11:34,,,,Silicone insulated stranded core is extremely flexible to the point its damn near usable as rope Its significantly more flexible than whats already in use,mtnxk48,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtr2s5b,anapoe,,7,2025-05-23 00:24:03,,,,Like what uviperfan7 said it totally depends on the individual strand gauge of the wire and to a lesser extent the material of the insulator For example welding cable which uses 30 awg strands is extremely flexible,mtnxk48,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtp0l6x,Durahl,,2,2025-05-22 17:58:03,,,,Brah I think you could power an entire PC with 8AWG Cables,mtnxk48,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtq8rtx,The_JSQuareD,,8,2025-05-22 21:34:23,,,,Depending on the voltage sure The required wire gauge is related to the amount of current carried not power The connection from the PSU to the GPU is low voltage high current DC The connection from the wall to the PSU is higher power but also waaay higher voltage and AC so lower current So the required wire gauge from the wall is actually way lower To put numbers on it 12VHPWR carries up to 600 W at 12 V duh meaning up to 50 A A standard US power outlet can handle up to 15 A so much lower Even thats only for peak loads though for sustained loads it shouldnt exceed 12 A Of course thats at a much higher 120 V so total power is higher up to 1800 W peak and 1440 W sustained,mtp0l6x,3.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtrpvxj,Hafnon,,6,2025-05-23 02:43:27,,,,To add onto this the power dissipated in the cable is equal to I2 R where I is the current through the cable and R is the resistance of the cable So more current means quadratically more heat produced in the cable per unit time Many people are more familiar with the formula for power dissipated as V I where V is voltage While technically this is correct to calculated the power dissipated by the cable you need to use the voltage drop across the cable Since the source voltage is split between the cable and the load according to their relative resistances you cant know the voltage drop across the cable without also knowing the loads resistance So in this case its better to think about how much current the load will require to meet its power demands and since that current must be carried by the cable Kirchoffs circuital laws you use the formula I2 R instead,mtq8rtx,4.0,1ksqzce

comment,mtnssu9,ABetterKamahl1234,,-14,2025-05-22 14:28:08,,,,if Nvidia simply ditched their atrociously underspecced 12VHPR Cable Its not underspecced as a cable It electrically easily can handle the loads The fact that theyre not doing proper load balancing on the supply and card ends is where that problem is You can spec anything to anything but if youre pushing out of spec things through it you get problems Literally the PCIe pinouts are the exact same fuck up your load balancing and you get fire Also you can just sleeve a cable tons of cables are already literally that most RC hobby cables are just bundles under that silicone anyways Stranded carries far more power Fun fact defects in any stranded cable can result in this problem too on a technical level and solid cables are inflexible and need to be even thicker,mtnn4bp,1.0,1ksqzce
comment,mto1v09,lordraiden007,,8,2025-05-22 15:12:26,,,,It is underspecced relative to the other power connectors used in PCs though 8pin cables are rated for the same amount of amps per pin 4something Amps but they can safely handle nearly double that amount 12VHPR cables are rated at the same Amps per pin but can barely even deliver that over long periods of time without issues arising and NVIDIA seems hellbent on pushing these things to the max practically 100 of the time 12VHPR cables are also more prone to manufacturing errors are less tolerant of defects and have serious design issues to this day Its a shitty spec that needed probably another 45 years just in design before initial testing much less an industry wide rollout,mtnssu9,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mto026b,jason_abacabb,,7,2025-05-22 15:03:44,,,,They werent suggesting solid wire large gauge stranded wire that is rated for the load In any case solid wire has a higher current capacity for any given gauge just look at the effective cross sectional diameter The reason would not used is because it is more prone to breakage from handling and vibration,mtnssu9,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtnxgk2,Durahl,,14,2025-05-22 14:51:04,,,,I get what youre trying to say but if a Connector is capable of going underspec because something wasnt load balanced not fully inserted Connector broken Cable etc then in my books Its underspecced And please dont lecture me on Sleeving I was there 3000 years ago when sleeving had to be done by yours truly,mtnssu9,2.0,1ksqzce
comment,mtoq4xz,snakeoilHero,,44,2025-05-22 17:09:23,,,,I will not buy a 12VHPR GPU until it is safer My credit card would probably cover a manufactures defect But then nvidia or retailer might blame the PSU to avoid accountability This article enables the blame shift by creating a feature for the bug Standard Practice Your PSU didnt have this magic failsafe just invented so our exploding GPU is your fault,,0.0,1ksqzce

comment,mtnwbhy,jaweinre,,8,2025-05-22 14:45:31,,,,At this point Im sure Nvidia is discouraging gamers from buying GPUs by selling overpriced scalped disappointing specced GPUs and then burning their PC if they insist on buying them for good measure to increase their GeForce Now business Makes sense lol,,0.0,1ksqzce
