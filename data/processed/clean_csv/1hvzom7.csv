comment,m5x7x2j,sometipsygnostalgic,,69,2025-01-07 19:32:35,,,,the only thing the lenuvo had for it was the joycons and the big screen nothing else makes it better than the rog and especially the steamdeck which is cheaper than this,,0.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5xbu17,None,,10,2025-01-07 19:51:23,,,,Did the others function as full on pcs as well I never used one just have a legion go,m5x7x2j,1.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5xcxsg,SolfenTheDragon,,8,2025-01-07 19:56:39,,,,They all ran windows SteamOS can also function as a full PC just kinda restricted a little bit,m5xbu17,2.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5xeoqc,drmirage809,,46,2025-01-07 20:05:09,,,,The big thing here is that SteamOS is a customised Linux distribution Really lightweight and fast It runs games using a translation layer called Proton Proton is also ripping fast with games sometimes being faster through Proton than they are on Windows As for using it as a full on PC your Windows programs wont work but theres a well stocked app center and so much of what we do on a PC happens in web browsers,m5xcxsg,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m60ale4,yashdes,,-16,2025-01-08 05:54:08,,,,Main benefit of steamos should be battery life the windows version is definitely more capable gaming or otherwise,m5xeoqc,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m60rjvr,JimmyRecard,,17,2025-01-08 08:38:40,,,,There is near universal agreement that Windows is not a good handheld OS It does work but it is bloated the onscreen keyboard is trash and the games do not always reliably open in full screen Windows has the advantage of being supported by manufacturers and anticheat developers but aside from those Windows is a subpar choice for handheld gaming,m60ale4,5.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5zaf7o,audigex,,17,2025-01-08 01:55:56,,,,Its not restricted at all You can fire up the desktop mode and use it like any Linux PC I used mine a couple of months ago to compile some software when a friend couldnt get it working and I didnt have a laptop with me You can plug a keyboard mouse and monitor in and even use it as an actual desktop It isnt Windows sure but that isnt a restriction just a different OS,m5xcxsg,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5zrir0,raptir1,,7,2025-01-08 03:37:00,,,,Its not that Linux is restricted its that steam OS has some stuff locked down like the file system being RO by default,m5zaf7o,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m61woin,drmirage809,,3,2025-01-08 14:26:50,,,,The file system is read only but can be unlocked if you wanna go there Your home folder isnt however And thats where your files and programs live The read only nature is a good thing here Its very hard to break things in SteamOS And if you do you can just replace the entire file system while leaving the home folder untouched,m5zrir0,5.0,1hvzom7
comment,m626q8r,raptir1,,1,2025-01-08 15:22:32,,,,It still limits some stuff ie installing packages from AUR which can be important since many vendors ship deb and rpm and thus you cannot readily install them on Arch without rw root access,m61woin,6.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62p400,Pauly_Amorous,,1,2025-01-08 16:54:40,,,,Its also a pain in the ass to get and keep the Microsoft wireless adapter working Or at least it used to be I havent messed with it in a long time,m626q8r,7.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62pq6r,raptir1,,1,2025-01-08 16:57:46,,,,Ive been using Linux as my only home OS for 18 years so I havent bought any Microsoft hardware but I could see that if you have a Windows laptop and a Linux gaming handheld,m62p400,8.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62qgi5,Pauly_Amorous,,1,2025-01-08 17:01:56,,,,ut I could see that if you have a Windows laptop and a Linux gaming handheld Or a Series X controller that you want to use with the Steam Deck in docked mode You can use bluetooth but the latency is quite atrocious if you play twitchbased games,m62pq6r,9.0,1hvzom7
comment,m634y9j,drmirage809,,1,2025-01-08 18:13:48,,,,Used Linux as a daily driver for two years and honestly havent had any real issues with peripherals RGB lighting is a bit of a pain but something I dont care for anyway Only tough thing was having to manually edit a config file to get a really funky Bluetooth adapter going,m62p400,8.0,1hvzom7
comment,m635lvy,drmirage809,,1,2025-01-08 18:16:56,,,,SteamOS provides Flatpak for installing programs outside of Steam With Flathub set up by default as the remote And Flathub is pretty darn well stocked with just about everything you might need unless you wanna run a server from your Steam Deck or something silly Check it out for yourself,m626q8r,7.0,1hvzom7
comment,m63g06q,raptir1,,1,2025-01-08 19:06:35,,,,Im well aware but not everything is on Flatpak Boosteroid for example provides a deb and rpm but is not on flathub,m635lvy,8.0,1hvzom7
comment,m614d4k,Aidoneuz,,4,2025-01-08 10:54:26,,,,Its only operating system files that are readonly not the whole file system,m5zrir0,5.0,1hvzom7
comment,m7595xp,namisysd,,1,2025-01-14 19:15:11,,,,SteamOS is an immutable variant of Arch Linux the expectation is that you use layer on containerized apps like flatpaks instead of changing the OS itself this keeps users from soft bricking the unit and requiring OS recovery,m5zrir0,5.0,1hvzom7
comment,m61mly5,SolfenTheDragon,,1,2025-01-08 13:23:58,,,,Thats not what I meant by restricted Im familiar with Linux and how it works The desktop instance of steamOS has guide rails that valve has put in place to keep users from messing with critical components Docker doesnt work for instance If you try to install something outside the package manager it will sometimes not work correctly because of the restrictions Valve put in place Ect,m5zaf7o,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m65vbfd,QuickQuirk,,1,2025-01-09 02:45:19,,,,Sure but you know this is being sold as a handheld gaming device and not as a general computing device SteamOS is excellent for that purpose and those limitations help keep it simple and reliable for non tech savvy users If you want it unlocked just go ahead and install windows or your favourite linux Theres nothing stopping you Just dont complain that its doing what its being marketed as being Especially when there are plenty of other devices that suit you more and you can also install whatever OS you want if it matters to you,m61mly5,5.0,1hvzom7
comment,m66miy1,SolfenTheDragon,,1,2025-01-09 05:56:38,,,,Lmao Im not complaining Im explaining my statement of it being slightly restricted as a full fledged computer I love my steam deck You took my comments the complete wrong way,m65vbfd,6.0,1hvzom7
comment,m6b3cir,QuickQuirk,,1,2025-01-09 22:58:54,,,,Got it thanks for the clarification,m66miy1,7.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5zwghx,adrian783,,-11,2025-01-08 04:09:05,,,,but that isnt a restriction cmon dude,m5zaf7o,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m607llf,Alastor3,,6,2025-01-08 05:29:43,,,,Hmmm Im not entirely familiar but I thought the Legion Go was slightly more powerful than the Steam Deck,m5x7x2j,1.0,1hvzom7
comment,m60ojvl,mnvoronin,,12,2025-01-08 08:06:41,,,,slightly As in able to run games in 2560x1440 at about the same framerate as Steam Decks 1200x800 Battery life sucks though But thats a tradeoff Im happy to make not saying that everyone should the screen size and resolution were the deciding factors for me,m607llf,2.0,1hvzom7
comment,m6116de,DatTF2,,3,2025-01-08 10:22:03,,,,From the benchmarks I have seen both the Ally and Legion all had better highs but the Steamdeck had much more consistent frames not dropping as low as the two devices It was speculated that that could be because of bloated Windows 11 Id like to see if SteamOS increases performance,m60ojvl,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m613e3c,sometipsygnostalgic,,3,2025-01-08 10:44:43,,,,The benchmarks did shock me by revealing even the Rog Ally X did worse than Steamdeck on some games when both were running them at 720p The battery drains much quicker than it should too,m6116de,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m65vzxb,QuickQuirk,,1,2025-01-09 02:49:24,,,,yes but correspondingly weaker battery lifelow power performance Im really interested in seeing a device based on one of the other Z2 chips they announced With the same older generation Zen and RDNA2 cores as the steamdeck but with a 4core 12CU CPUGPU instead of a 4core 8CU cpuGPU Which should get us similar low power efficiencyperformance as the steamdeck less CPU cores but with up to 50 more GPU performance for when you need it Might be a real sweet spot APU when it comes to the batteryperformance trade off,m607llf,2.0,1hvzom7

comment,m5xmiwu,HippityHoppityBoop,,24,2025-01-07 20:43:01,,,,If only we could get a Steam Deck 2 OLED with double the performance and same price so I could play Flight Simulator 2024 but alas it looks like I gotta wait till 2026,,0.0,1hvzom7

comment,m5yd0n0,None,,54,2025-01-07 22:52:35,,,,So the battery dies mid flight,m5y39bt,2.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5zavbe,audigex,,17,2025-01-08 01:58:28,,,,If you like flight sims why wouldnt you Flight sims are quite well suited to gamepadjoystick setups when youre playing casually Obviously I prefer my actual yoke pedals throttle autopilot and radio setup at home but its not super portable,m5y39bt,2.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5zemgt,None,,5,2025-01-08 02:20:19,,,,I just thought that the purpose of sims like that is to be as immersive as possible which is hard on a small device,m5zavbe,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m611d54,GepardenK,,2,2025-01-08 10:24:02,,,,Thats part of the purpose MS Flight Simulator especially is more of a sandbox with a variety of use cases Many people use it exclusively as a atmosphericmeditative scenery swimmer to calm down and get some time to think,m5zemgt,4.0,1hvzom7

comment,m5xssh7,internetlad,,6,2025-01-07 21:12:42,,,,Not sure if this is good or bad The Deck is the Definitive Edition for me and I couldnt imagine using a handheld that doesnt have touchpads Opens up so many more games as options when controller support sucks or the track pad just works better None of these other manufacturers bother to putting one on If Valve doesnt bother to make a Deck 2 and just focuses on licensing software as they seem to be moving towards I guess Ill be saving money on new handhelds,,0.0,1hvzom7
comment,m5z58yz,IIILORDGOLDIII,,26,2025-01-08 01:26:46,,,,They arent licensing SteamOS they are giving it away for free Valve makes money selling games on the marketplace Even the Steam Deck was a loss leader to get customers into the Steam store That being said Valve wont make another handheld until there is a generational leap in compute apparently the new Z2 processors arent it So you wont be seeing a SD2 anytime soon,m5xssh7,1.0,1hvzom7
comment,m6061i4,Meeii,,2,2025-01-08 05:17:37,,,,Legion Go have touch pads so there are other manufacturers that add them as well,m5xssh7,1.0,1hvzom7

comment,m613ava,duschendestroyer,,5,2025-01-08 10:43:50,,,,its not a fingerprint reader its a tiny touchpad,m60gfol,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62s9cc,internetlad,,1,2025-01-08 17:11:56,,,,Oh weird Id have to try one honestly Not sure if baby touchpad will have the same vibe If so it could be a good fit,m613ava,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m61zrsy,ob_knoxious,,-3,2025-01-08 14:44:42,,,,Personally I would never by another handheld with touch pads The ones on the deck are atrocious and I never use them the device is incredibly ergonomically compromised,m5xssh7,1.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62s1xa,internetlad,,2,2025-01-08 17:10:53,,,,I could not disagree more Ive got multiple SBM handhelds multiple first and third party controllers and the one I keep going back to is the Deck because it has touch pads and damn good ones with tactile feedback at that Being stuck in a game because I cant get to a menu item and just Turning on the touch pad to move the mouse cursor to it is reason enough for me,m61zrsy,2.0,1hvzom7
comment,m63ep8o,ob_knoxious,,1,2025-01-08 19:00:18,,,,If I just need a quick cursor for something I will use a touchscreen Tried many games of many genres and didnt find a good use for the touchpads ever,m62s1xa,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m63jbji,internetlad,,1,2025-01-08 19:22:36,,,,I like the cursortouchpad a lot for strategy games XCOM Civ ONI TD games stuff like that,m63ep8o,4.0,1hvzom7
comment,m62wm4m,Cheezewiz239,,1,2025-01-08 17:33:28,,,,Yeah I never used them personally I just use the touch screen if I need any kind of temporary mouse use in game,m61zrsy,2.0,1hvzom7

comment,m68scsp,Optimus_Prime_Day,,2,2025-01-09 16:12:27,,,,TouchPad is important to me also it really works well on steamdeck Trying playing factorio without a TouchPad and its a huge pain in the butt to control for example,m68qc7q,3.0,1hvzom7
comment,m6206yk,ob_knoxious,,-4,2025-01-08 14:47:03,,,,Steam Deck touch pads are not that great they really compromised the ergonomic of the device for them Even for the big fans of them Ive never met someone who uses two touch pads I would swap my Steam Deck for this in a heartbeat,m608dmr,1.0,1hvzom7
comment,m68q71o,throwninthefire666,,1,2025-01-09 16:01:38,,,,Nah for me they are unremovable I play a lot of RTS games that were built for mouse and keyboard Mapping every button is impossible without it and using a trackpad as a mouse is the only way,m6206yk,2.0,1hvzom7
