comment,muyl7gf,ednerjn,,832,2025-05-29 21:45:42,,,,Its possible that the existential threat from SteamOS which on paper delivers better gaming performance than Windows 11 itself What do you mean on paper,,0.0,1kymoy4
comment,muyqcxr,Rezmir,,435,2025-05-29 22:12:26,,,,After the Lenovo using SteamOS it is quite clear it is not on paper It is a real big difference,muyl7gf,1.0,1kymoy4
comment,muzljrs,CMDR_omnicognate,,147,2025-05-30 01:06:31,,,,I dont really see why it wouldnt be since steam OS is basically just stuff required to make steam and its games work correctly with Linux underneath should you want to use a full OS The amount of stuff constantly running in windows 11 in the background because it assumes its a normal pc will definitely cause a noticeable performance decrease I wonder if Microsoft might refine their gaming mode thing so that it basically runs a slim version of windows like steam os runs a slim Linux distro or if it might be seen as a security vulnerability,muyqcxr,2.0,1kymoy4

comment,mv3qkhv,VikingBorealis,,3,2025-05-30 17:28:49,,,,Xbox already runs full windows The kernel runs at the core and then the Xbox version of Windows runs on top lik a hardware VM And this could just as easy switch and runs full desktop windows instead if needed,mv0i74k,4.0,1kymoy4

comment,mv2gk7w,Iggyhopper,,4,2025-05-30 13:51:15,,,,Totally fine argument for an actual PC But also they did come up with Pro and S versions and I think a little more effort can be had for a gaming mode And I meant gaming handheld PC but you get it,mv1vyfb,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv2qlm2,PalmSizedTriceratops,,1,2025-05-30 14:40:21,,,,It is for me lol I use a Mac at work and at home day to day The only reason I have a Windows PC is exclusively for gaming Im positive Im not the only one However were talking about handhelds which I also have And steamOS is phenomenal Much less hassle than Windows,mv1vyfb,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,muznm14,Rezmir,,33,2025-05-30 01:18:33,,,,I wish they did that Microsoft could make buck if they could make windows have a gaming mode Since there is no difference between w11 on Lenovo or a pc if they sell that or whatever I can see way to many people buying it,muzljrs,3.0,1kymoy4

comment,mvmm9e6,competition-inspecti,,1,2025-06-02 17:59:43,,,,My browser is taking up over 2Gb for some reason A tab from permalink of your comment takes 91 Mb in Vivaldi on old reddit and 336 on new And considering that a good chunk of apps you mentioned are made with Electron and therefore launch separate Chrome instances just for themselves thats bound to pile up quickly,mv2nuy5,6.0,1kymoy4

comment,mv1dgpe,clockworkpeon,,14,2025-05-30 09:21:24,,,,they can and did its called Xbox System Software the original Xbox OS was Windows 2000 with like 95 of the shit cut out 360 also ran on modded Windows 2000 Xbox One started on Windows 8 and now the One and the Series both run on Windows 10 what they need to do is stop thinking about optimizing windows 11 for handhelds and work on optimizing XSS for handhelds and expandimprove on XSS functionalityfeatures,muzp0eh,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv1ho96,FireLucid,,3,2025-05-30 10:00:53,,,,At least one of the xboxes had 3 OSs A hypervisor and a VM running a game OS and another VM running the Xbox OS menus etc Are they still doing that for the current Xbox,mv1dgpe,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv1j2pf,clockworkpeon,,3,2025-05-30 10:13:34,,,,yeah thats the current OS hyperv with one VM for the game and one VM for the OS and other apps,mv1ho96,6.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0561y,hyperforms9988,,7,2025-05-30 03:01:16,,,,The idea that they havent done that yet is absolutely absurd given they actually run a proper shop on their own OS I dont know that Id like to see this restriction because I dont buy games through their store but it would be a compelling argument for people to buy games on it if you could boot into a mode that is expressly designed to run games off of the Xbox app and little else whether thats Game Pass or games youve purchased on it On a PC that might be a bit of a drag but were they to come out with their own handheld that would be practically required given how bloated Windows is for the sake of both performance and battery life,muzljrs,3.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0ic6f,Iggyhopper,,10,2025-05-30 04:34:03,,,,You say that and yet Windows 8 AND Windows 11 designs were choices,mv0561y,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0zdar,GolemancerVekk,,4,2025-05-30 07:02:33,,,,Microsoft hasnt been taking gaming seriously for a while now Theyre scrambling now because SteamOS is threatening to steal the entire PC market from them,mv0ic6f,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv3b76v,hyperforms9988,,1,2025-05-30 16:17:12,,,,I feel like they have to commit to something If they still want to run their own console platform have a PC handheld etc etc etc then it behooves them to do more on the OS end to encourage people to adopt and stay within their own ecosystem They can just as easily let go of all of that shit get out of console gaming still have their own shop on PCs and shit and just be happy being a publisher and a developer for the other consoles and for PCs Theres nothing wrong with that now that they have so much more muscle behind the software production end of things than they used to and they seem to be adopting the idea of putting their games on Steam on Playstation etc Theres something to be said for trying to do everything and trying to be everywhere at once but that can work against you where youre just spread too thin to seriously compete with just about anybody else who is far more specialized in specific areas They seem to have an issue with commitment If you want to release a music player like the Zune then fucking commit Dont try it for a little while and then give up on it If you want to do Windows Phone then stay in that shit Games for Windows Live Keep going and support that shit properly instead of abandoning it and then royally fucking up every game that was designed to use it when it no longer functions,mv0zdar,6.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv1hwwj,FireLucid,,1,2025-05-30 10:03:04,,,,8 was terrible 11 is mostly just a slight UI tweak with extra security under the hood vs 10,mv0ic6f,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv18a5v,poisonous-leek-soup,,3,2025-05-30 08:29:48,,,,Honestly its probably a lot of work to unfuck windows They have to undo years of spaghetti made by random teams with constantly changing workflows They have to make sure all the games and anti cheats work built on this spaghetti still work and that future windows updates will also work,mv0561y,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv342ac,irqlnotdispatchlevel,,1,2025-05-30 15:43:37,,,,The idea that they havent done that yet is absolutely absurd given they actually run a proper shop on their own OS And also Xbox runs on a modified Windows You can also get a slimed down version for Windows Server All the building blocks are there they just need to be financially motivated to build it,mv0561y,4.0,1kymoy4

comment,muys0ps,Randommaggy,,87,2025-05-29 22:21:18,,,,Zero of the games Ive AB tested on my HX370 64GB GPD Pocket 4 between my Windows and Bazite installs have run better on Windows Zero If not for virus level anticheat locking some games to Windows I dont see any reason for a computer that is primarily used for gaming to run Windows,muyqcxr,2.0,1kymoy4
comment,muzyr0i,mouse_8b,,14,2025-05-30 02:22:07,,,,I dont see any reason for a computer that is primarily used for gaming to run Windows Not sure how old you are but thats a relatively recent phenomenon Back in the 90s Microsoft made DirectX which gave developers a common API for graphics cards This directly led to the graphics card arms race that is still playing out today This meant Windows was the only option for games with cuttingedge graphics These days Unix systems have more options for graphics I dont know that they can match Windows for cutting edge graphics but maybe they can At least now there is enough capability that most games can run fine on either platform,muys0ps,3.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0k9bv,Randommaggy,,7,2025-05-30 04:49:04,,,,Im in my late 30s so I know the early DX shitshow times It was fun having to uninstall DX to install an older version to play some of my older games since the backwards compat prior to DX 9c sucked These days Linux is a better platform for smoothly experiencing the Windows back catalogue than Windows since Wine and Proton is of such high quality,muzyr0i,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv13ekl,GolemancerVekk,,1,2025-05-30 07:41:50,,,,All of the highest performance graphical rendering runs on UNIXlike systems The gaming situation on PC is Microsoft artificially restricting weak stuff to Windows and game producers playing along because they dont want Microsoft to get mad at them and card manufacturers not giving a shit because they get money either way,muzyr0i,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,muytxc0,Rezmir,,38,2025-05-29 22:31:39,,,,I am not even talking about computer Just handheld Lenovo is the first one that has one for windows and one for SteamOS and all the hardware is the same it is a huge difference You can check out videos comparing,muys0ps,3.0,1kymoy4
comment,muz57e8,archefayte,,13,2025-05-29 23:33:29,,,,The Lenovo GO is a computer is likely what they were referencing Regardless of the difference there are some games you just cant play due to anti cheat on SteamOS,muytxc0,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,muzorwz,SpeedflyChris,,15,2025-05-30 01:25:23,,,,For now With handhelds like the steam deck growing in popularity and SteamOS being unquestionably better for that application devs are likely to consider it in future when developing cheat detection systems,muz57e8,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0jwuh,kitliasteele,,5,2025-05-30 04:46:20,,,,Can confirm For example some anticheat policies will explicitly check for Steam Deck hardware if it detects the game is running in Wine If it finds its on a Steam Deck itll run less strictly and run on a Steam Deck compatible profile instead of refusing to run In other cases itll run with full Linux compatibility thanks to the Proton layer I saw a new game launch last week Fantasy Life that uses Easy Anti Cheat that is Verified to run on the Steam Deck So really all we are held back by are developers that either havent updated the games to run on Proton with their anticheat or developers who refuse to implement it like Epic Games with Fortnite,muzorwz,6.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0zsu2,GolemancerVekk,,1,2025-05-30 07:06:41,,,,They refuse to implement it because of backstage agreements with Microsoft Theyre basically Windows exclusives but its simpler to say anybody using Linux is a cheater than to risk being accused of anticompetitive practices,mv0jwuh,7.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv1lz82,ToMorrowsEnd,,2,2025-05-30 10:38:32,,,,the answer is simply dont play those games and force the game makers to stop that stupidity COD claims they need it and it has done nothing to stop cheaters same with Apex they also are unable to stop cheaters at all despite of their kernel level anti cheat so its proving that it is not needed and doesnt actually work,muz57e8,5.0,1kymoy4
comment,muz6bzh,Rezmir,,5,2025-05-29 23:39:45,,,,That is indeed true But the difference is absurd in performance,muz57e8,5.0,1kymoy4

comment,mv1wvre,realusername42,,2,2025-05-30 11:57:43,,,,And some do not run on Windows at all anymore either if its too old you are better served by LinuxWine,muzizjz,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv0j7x7,Randommaggy,,5,2025-05-30 04:40:54,,,,Unless its publisherstudio is actively constraining it thats basically not a thing anymore With RT mandatory there are now even games that will only run under Linux on the same hardware,muzizjz,4.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv19qmp,sCeege,,1,2025-05-30 08:44:26,,,,For what its worth Windows is still the one click solution to get 99 of games working without tinkering Besides KACs theres also Xbox game pass which only runs on Windows I have two headless Windows machines in my home dedicated to running Windows as a gaming platform my Mac and Linux just remote to them via SunshineMoonlight When I travel I just accept the smaller library on my MacBook via CrossOver,muys0ps,3.0,1kymoy4
comment,mv1bmxk,Randommaggy,,4,2025-05-30 09:03:15,,,,In the last year my experience has been that Linux actually has been less messy to get games working than Windows especially when running games from the older part of my steam library and for games that install too much third party crap on Windows I do use ApolloMoonlightArtemis from my 4090 laptop but only for games that my Linux machine and Macbook Air M1 are too weak to run,mv19qmp,4.0,1kymoy4

comment,muyvptm,Inetro,,8,2025-05-29 22:41:30,,,,Proton is not emulation it is a compatability layer Unlike emulation where you are faking a piece of hardware and how they interact with other pieces of hardware that are nonexistant in the PC Linux knows everything in the PC and it works very similar to how it would running Windows The drivers are similar the storage is similar the CPU is similar The compatibility layer just translates a call a game would make in Windows to instructions that work the same in Linux There are games with native Linux releases that work better on Proton The biggest issues with Proton are lack of support for anticheat which have unique requirements to pass verification and new features utilised by newer AAA games since those calls dont have translations in Proton at launch,muyrr3l,2.0,1kymoy4
comment,muz04u6,silentcrs,,-1,2025-05-29 23:05:45,,,,I corrected my original word choice I was typing quickly I understand what a translation layer is Theres still a performance hit in the process Not to mention the majority of games on ProtonDB are playable or unsupported not verified Many playable games have graphics glitches So its not like a just calling a VTx instruction Theres a lot more to it,muyvptm,3.0,1kymoy4

comment,muzurua,Neo_Techni,,14,2025-05-30 01:59:00,,,,how could it be that hard wooo boy Even Nintendo is having some trouble with getting Switch 1 games running on Switch 2 In particular its the damned shaders issue that plagues gaming The shaders are compiled specifically for Switch 1s hardware so Nintendo has to decompile and recompile them since they dont have access to the source code And this process is not perfect its also why Vita hasnt been emulated well yet Now S1 to S2 is a hardware upgrade so there are resources to spare towards the conversionemulation process XBOX Series to a portable would not have that advantage the hardware would likely be weaker than XBOX Series S as a portable would have to use less power than a device plugged into a wall That makes it even much harder to get the software running on it Sacrifices have to be made ie resolutionframerate Now MS has worked on emulation in the XBOX Series to run OG XBOX360XBOXone games at higher resolutionsframerates so they could turn those hacks backwards to lower requirements but they dont have such a system for Series games But like Switch the shader issue will be there,muysjbz,1.0,1kymoy4
comment,muzye1u,Dt2_0,,18,2025-05-30 02:20:00,,,,The bigger difference is the architecture of most gaming handhelds and the Xboxes is very very similar Apparently there was some serious hardware issues with getting Switch games on Switch 2 Xbox is already a Ryzen APU with Radeon Graphics system with unified RAM just like most of these gaming handhelds The Xbox also already runs a modified version of Windows,muzurua,2.0,1kymoy4

comment,muykxe1,Chickat28,,-11,2025-05-29 21:44:16,,,,I suspect they will only release one box next gen With increased silicon costs PS6 will likely be 600 at launch so I think Nextbox will be a little less powerful than PS6 and only 499 Then they will release the Xboy handheld in the middle of the gen around 2031 It allows mobile silicone to mature more It will mean a handheld probably on par with Series X and PS5 instead of Series S at best if they released it sooner,,0.0,1kymoy4
