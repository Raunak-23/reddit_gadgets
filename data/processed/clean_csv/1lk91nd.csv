comment,mzptmal,Shoelebubba,,490,2025-06-25 15:53:28,,,,Back when 21 released they forced a label that clearly stated that this cable meets the 21 standard and it worked fine if you bought one with the holographic sticker just like they are with 22 Then the HDMI Forum watered down the 21 spec to where people could slap the label onto cables that had some of the 21 features and instead you had to look for the 48gbps bandwidth of the spec list Heres hoping that doesnt repeat and that the implementation in AVRs and TVs isnt as buggy as it was when 21 released,,0.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzqkitg,mlorusso4,,88,2025-06-25 17:56:19,,,,Or they can overcharge for shitty cables People will go looking for a 21 cable see the real 21 is say 20 and the lesser 21 cable is 18 So theyll buy the 18 one thinking its the same but a little cheaper Whereas if it was labeled as say 205 they could only sell it for 15,mzq04sz,2.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzsr0jc,angrydeuce,,20,2025-06-26 00:31:54,,,,Dude I remember working at compusa back in the day those 100 monster cables we paid like 3 for them If theyre able to sell them to a retail chain for 3 a piece and still be in business that tells you how little they must have cost to make in the first place100 fuckin dollars those retailed for lol Imagine how cheap they can make the like 2030 dollar cables its got to be like pennies a piece This is also precisely why every electronics store always hounded the shit out of you to buy cables and accessories They probably make more money in total for the HDMI cable then they do for the 90 4K HDR TV,mzq04sz,2.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzt1krq,angrydeuce,,6,2025-06-26 01:31:59,,,,Basically yeah Margins on big ticket hardware items are at least were my knowledge of retail is out of date by nearly 20 years now next to nothing because thats what brings people in the door This is also why they push the extended warranties and addon skus so hardthats where all the money is The extended warranties are almost 100 profit for every person that actually makes use of it after they buy there are 4 or more that dont so thats literally free money right there which is why they really lean on those in big box electronic stores But all that incidental stuff that people would buy around a major hardware purchase thats where they got their money Someone wants a new 300 printer Better add on the 25 USB cable cost 117 a full set of ink cartridges for 35 bucks each cost 746 a couple 499 reams of paper cost 87 cents maybe some really fancy high end 30 for 20 sheets of photo paper cost 947and of course the exceptional value of the 6999 3year extended service plan that you probably will forget you even bought when it dies a year and a half from now Online shopping is a much bigger player these days than it was then of course so things may not be the same as they used to be back then but while the margin might not be as crazy as it was back in those days due to the increase in competition Im positive theyre still making more profit as a percentage on the dinky shit than they ever were on the big ticket items,mzssj8p,4.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzsp2t1,UpsetKoalaBear,,1,2025-06-26 00:20:51,,,,People say this but the thing is the average person doesnt care much for HDMI 22 Literally the only reason youd care about the bandwidth of the cable you have purchased is because you have a specific reason for getting a higher bandwidth capable cable In which case youre going to check the spec sheet to see what the bandwidth actually is Your average person is just going to see HDMI and plug that in They dont particularly care Its not like USBC where you might have a ton of cables lying around and a load of devices that support it plus you only really buy a new cable if one breaks of whatever else Most people just buy a HDMI cable when they need it or just use the one that comes in the box for a certain product and the odds of it breaking are incredibly low because people arent constantly unplugging and replugging a HDMI cable,mzq04sz,2.0,1lk91nd
comment,mzstjgq,igby1,,2,2025-06-26 00:46:14,,,,Perhaps I mistakenly projected my own cable overbuying on to the rest of humanity The only thing Id add to what you said is the average person will pay more attention to HDMI cable specs if their old cable isnt working with a newer device,mzsp2t1,3.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzr9hwl,Wakkit1988,,6,2025-06-25 19:55:03,,,,Theres a big push right now to try and make all consumer electronics use USBPD if possible It allows for a singular product design globally that only requires a local universal adapter to provide power for the device I would not be shocked if we see wall outlets with PD and regular sockets together in the very near future With batteries used in conjunction with PD there are very few devices that cant be powered in this manner Having your media connector also power the monitor reduces the number of power connectors required by the setup potentially reducing the total number to one just for the device processing the media This is an excellent cost and spacesaving improvement,mzr7z7l,4.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzq8l0h,RyanK_Cs,,2,2025-06-25 17:02:45,,,,Doing 72 to 144 all native 1080p for me as an example occasionally during a jump cut or quick scene switch youll see it morph from the previous to next shot which is very quick but still noticeable And at very high motion like a dragonball game things might look a little odd sorta like the smoothing effect some televisions have sometimes it confuses things like the cross hair or very close parallel lines like a shipping crate or fence But in 90 percent of use cases as long as its around 60fps and no lower than 35fps it usually comes out pretty great 72 to 144 usually comes out fantastic If you have a card that can handle 4k 6072fps stable with a bit of overhead left for FG youll get good results out of the box bear in mind though if a game has dlss and youre on a Nvidia card that will just objectively work better overall LS is good for literally any video content or program that doesnt have fg features though its results come pretty close just eyeballing it,mzq3bx1,5.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzpr603,chrisdh79,,14,2025-06-25 15:42:11,,,,From the article Following the standards debut at CES 2025 HDMI 22 has now been finalized by the HDMI Forum The full spec confirms much of what we heard six months ago including doubling the maximum bandwidth of HDMI 21 to 96 Gbps more than DisplayPort While using HDMI 22 does not require a new connector taking advantage of all its best features requires a new Ultra96 cable a reference to its maximum bandwidth 96Gbps is double the 48Gbps max bandwidth of HDMI 21 and is more than the 80Gbps supported by DisplayPort 21 That amount of bandwidth will allow for some monstrous resolution and refresh rate combinations including 4K at up to 240Hz and 8K at up to 60Hz in 444 format at up to 12bit color depth It also supports 12K120Hz and 16K60Hz with DSC Display Stream Compression Following the issue of HDMI 21branded cables not meeting the standards spec the Ultra96 cables themselves will clearly be labeled with the name and manufacturers will be required to test each one individually The cables will also be certified by the HDMI Forum Buyers of an Ultra96 Certified Cable can use the HDMI Forums labelling program to confirm its the real thing by scanning the QR code on the box HDMI 22 also introduces Latency Indication Protocol LIP This improves audio and video synchronization especially for multidevice systems such as those with AV receivers or a soundbar LIP could be especially useful to those whose systems cant seem to precisely synchronize the dialogue being heard with the actors mouth movements HDMI 22 is backward compatible so the cables will work with anything featuring an older HDMI port The first HDMI 22 devices are expected to arrive during the final quarter of 2025 AMD is rumored to support the standard in the next Radeon UDNA GPUs though they might be limited to a maximum of 80Gbps according to prolific leaker Kepler,,0.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzqrkfz,CrumbsCrumbs,,6,2025-06-25 18:29:12,,,,You want the standards set ahead of the demand so that once 16K monitors are being sold the early adopters will be sure that the new cable works with the new monitor etc,mzq2jg2,1.0,1lk91nd
comment,mzvmf0j,swarmy1,,0,2025-06-26 13:17:43,,,,For regular consumer hardware the demand is probably very low but there are plenty of business or specialized applications where having higher resolution would be convenient The standards also need to be set long before the hardware is on the shelves,mzq2jg2,1.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzq3rpq,sump_daddy,,8,2025-06-25 16:40:38,,,,HDMI 22 also introduces Latency Indication Protocol LIP This improves audio and video synchronization especially for multidevice systems such as those with AV receivers or a soundbar LIP could be especially useful to those whose systems cant seem to precisely synchronize the dialogue being heard with the actors mouth movements sure lets not bother solving this with devices that just work consistently lets expect two or more devices to start using this new standard and then they can talk to each other to explain how fucked up theyre going to make the whole process sounds lovely,,0.0,1lk91nd

comment,mzq7khq,Persellianare,,0,2025-06-25 16:58:08,,,,Since we dont see in resolution its easier to demonstrate through megapixels the human eye can see up to about 576 megapixels and 16k res is about 132 megapixels,mzpzqt1,1.0,1lk91nd
comment,mzq9jqi,shpongolian,,0,2025-06-25 17:07:09,,,,Does that include our entire periphery Cause even if our brains are taking in signals at that fidelity were def not comprehending anything outside of focus at that resolution Is it just based on the total number of cones in our eyes each cone being a subpixel,mzq7khq,2.0,1lk91nd
comment,mzqdf79,thisischemistry,,3,2025-06-25 17:24:28,,,,Its complicated A 576megapixel resolution means that in order to create a screen with a picture so sharp and clear that you cant distinguish the individual pixels you would have to pack 576 million pixels into an area the size of your field of view To get to his number Dr Clark assumed optimal visual acuity across the field of view that is it assumes that your eyes are moving around the scene before you But in a single snapshotlength glance the resolution drops to a fraction of that around 515 megapixels So if you can scan your eye around a little then you get close to that theoretical maximum However a quick glance is more like 10 megapixels Also While 4K resolutions provide a very detailed image for average viewers 16K resolutions exceed the detail the human eye can perceive at typical viewing distances Therefore most people may not notice significant improvements with higher resolutions like 16K,mzq9jqi,3.0,1lk91nd
comment,mzqe8nw,Persellianare,,1,2025-06-25 17:28:08,,,,Good question and also a difficult one to answer since you cant really compare megapixelsresolutions to human sight in a 11 kind of way since we dont see in megapixels but is the closest example to use I would assume it probably doesnt include our entire periphery because the wider you go the bigger the reduction would be I came across this link from a reddit that breaks down the math I didnt read too far into it because its a little beyond my understanding,mzq9jqi,3.0,1lk91nd
