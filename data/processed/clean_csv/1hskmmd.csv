comment,m5692md,Drizznarte,,41,2025-01-03 12:36:00,,,,GPU power running through the motherboard sound like a terrible idea No Asus we dont want to be forced to buy both your gf card and your motherboard This is not a industry standerd Its a bespoke connector so rich people can pay more for the same product,,0.0,1hskmmd
comment,m56ke41,Durahl,,17,2025-01-03 13:56:43,,,,Its not like the routing goes across half the Motherboard At worst itd probably be like 510cm along the edge through a stack of thick Planes being Viad together to mesh them together into almost forming a Busbar potentially being less of an issue than what we currently have to work with really why theyre not just using something akin to a bespoke XT6090 connector in combination with two thick Wires instead of the old and new PCIe Connectors is beyond me That being said ASUS can fuck right off any of my purchase consideration lists,m5692md,1.0,1hskmmd

comment,m5d2ol6,Drizznarte,,3,2025-01-04 15:18:05,,,,The BTF standerd was created and developed by Asus Thats what this team is developing and they did it on an Asus board The design standard was developed and promoted by ASUS,m58i074,2.0,1hskmmd

comment,m587hmq,trainbrain27,,18,2025-01-03 19:06:48,,,,Nope Nope to 15 kilowatts through the motherboard and nope to 15 kilowatts in general Thats a space heater Not thats as much power as a space heater Thats 15 kilowatts of heat because thats what the power turns into while it pushes data around There are applications that need that but most of it is going to waste and bloat,,0.0,1hskmmd
comment,m58br3f,Affectionate-Memory4,,20,2025-01-03 19:27:55,,,,Its also the max amount a north American 120V outlet can provide unless it is on specific dedicated circuits with a highcurrent breaker,m587hmq,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m58fzym,trainbrain27,,13,2025-01-03 19:48:54,,,,The National Electric Code says you should only use 80 continuously which is why most space heaters Ive seen hit 1500w at max power If youre using the full 120 volts at 15 amps its 1800 watts and some things like hair dryers claim 1875 12515 if you can get it Dad still calls mains power 110 which was historically accurate but in the US its 120 permitting variance between 114 and 126 The vast majority of devices will take a good range so they can work around the world which generally gives them excellent tolerance My desktop claims to work between 100 and 250 volts and my laptop charger is even wider,m58br3f,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m58qhfp,Affectionate-Memory4,,1,2025-01-03 20:42:19,,,,Yup 1500W should be what applies to a PC A miltihour gaming session pretty quickly gets into that continuous load territory,m58fzym,3.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5cb2qi,danielv123,,6,2025-01-04 11:54:56,,,,Do they really In my experience I dont even get close Depends on the game I guess,m58qhfp,4.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5eiddc,Affectionate-Memory4,,2,2025-01-04 19:51:04,,,,No PC should be right now but if were going into a world where 575W GPUs exist we inch closer to that limit 1500W is a safety limiter imposed on devices connected to North America 120V outlets A typical 15A circuit is good for 1800W and the continuous load limit is 1500W 80 of the maximum,m5cb2qi,5.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5erdy9,danielv123,,3,2025-01-04 20:39:37,,,,No I mean I dont get close to pulling the rated tdp continuously while gaming I dont see why that would change with 575w or 1500w GPUs,m5eiddc,6.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5eu2za,Affectionate-Memory4,,-1,2025-01-04 20:54:15,,,,That heavily depends on what the computer is doing Your situation is not universal I regularly see my 7900XTX sit at its full 355W for up to an hour running the right workloads In gaming it usually tops out around 330W if Im GPU limited A GPUs TDP is how much power it is allowed to pull If it is rated for 575W you can bet there is a scenario where it pulls that much power and those conditions can exist for extended periods In my case thats been fluid simulation recently but even 330W 93 of TDP would still translate to 535W on a 575W card 205W more I do not mean that my setup is currently anywhere near 15kW When I said a multihour gaming session is in continuous load territory I meant that you should be following the 15kW limit not the 18kW maximum,m5erdy9,7.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5f2j4v,danielv123,,3,2025-01-04 21:40:16,,,,Fluid sim sure my training runs generally also keep it close to maxed Thats not gaming though,m5eu2za,8.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5f4dja,Affectionate-Memory4,,1,2025-01-04 21:50:11,,,,Im using that as an example as was a long gaming session as a common sustained load I also see games pretty regularly approaching or hitting TDP Like I said Cyberpunk 2077 pushes a bit over 330W with spikes up to full TDP 355W every so often Alan Wake 2 is similar What Im trying to say here is that as TDP increases you get closer and closer to being able to max out an outlet regardless of what your chosen load is It doesnt matter if thats a fluid sim or AI stuff or a particularly heavy game for the GPU load is load and with enough you hit TDP,m5f2j4v,9.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5cqhbx,ACanadianNoob,,3,2025-01-04 13:59:58,,,,My computer build is specd to pull 400W for a reason and I undervolt it to pull more like 330W My room gets so warm in the summer and I need my window unit AC to keep up Where I live is also an old place the 15 Amp circuit my computer is on is also shared with quite a few things including the air conditioner Most people do not need halo tier products and shouldnt be shopping for an i9 14900KS and RTX 4090 They should be buying a Ryzen 5 7800X3D and RTX 4060Ti and saving as much as they can on their home utility I also want to be able to run my PC on solar power eventually either in a camper or at home,m587hmq,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5tqw52,akindofuser,,1,2025-01-07 04:59:54,,,,A 12VHPWR plug supports almost 700w of power too That doesnt mean your 2070 super is pushing 700w Its just a ceiling you want the plug and the cables ceiling to be high for safety Its a neat imho,m587hmq,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5ts9d8,trainbrain27,,1,2025-01-07 05:10:09,,,,supports If you google it the first picture is melted Im not wishing that on anyone just noticing that it happens with some regularity It sounds like its more likely to melt if its not plugged in securely andor that wire adapter is poorly made,m5tqw52,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5tu5e4,akindofuser,,1,2025-01-07 05:24:44,,,,So what Several first gen 12VHPWR plugs melted too,m5ts9d8,3.0,1hskmmd
comment,m59ftbw,Cymbal_Monkey,,5,2025-01-03 22:53:21,,,,Up to just means most people will have plenty of overhead which is a good thing I personally welcome PCIE and mobo standards catching up where the real world usage of these products has been for the last two decades I work for a company that puts a lot more power than this through PCBs all the time in 3 phase Its not a hard problem in fact its a pretty easy and very much solved problem Balance your amps and volts properly step down the volts at the card end and your traces dont even need to be that huge Bigger than signal lines sure but still very manageable weve been doing this in other industries for decades,,0.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5tpvtl,akindofuser,,1,2025-01-07 04:52:29,,,,Ya I dont get why people are going off the deep end on this You want the ceiling to be high 12VHPWR plugs support up to 600w power too That doesnt mean your 2070 is always pushing 600 watts The number of people claiming to know how much power should go through a motherboard is comical Who would have known we had all the worlds brightest PCB architects right here on reddit,m59ftbw,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m56fmzk,positivcheg,,2,2025-01-03 13:24:50,,,,I bet early adopters of this shit will pay a lot to be beta testers and find lots of problems Thanks for a good lesson Asus and 7800X3D with that experience I will never ever be early adopter and will only buy a matured system,,0.0,1hskmmd

comment,m58o9qp,dertechie,,4,2025-01-03 20:31:05,,,,Motherboard makers like to juice default voltages and frequencies to win benchmarks because at this point theres not massive differentiation between boards otherwise Basically playing chicken with the chips limitations to sell more boards The problem with playing chicken is eventually you crash There X3D chips are more sensitive to voltage because of the extra cache memory The voltages that ASUS and a few other manufacturers were feeding Zen 4 X3D chips were enough to kill them and not slowly Im not sure how that made it past QC The issue was fixed pretty quickly but was egg on the face of several companies This is also part of how 1314 Gen Intel started degrading so much though there were other issues with parts of the chip demanding more voltage than intended and destroying the delicate circuitry One of the first things Intel tried to fix it was forcing board manufacturers to implement their default power profiles rather than juiced ones as default,m56vt7a,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m56xa6x,positivcheg,,2,2025-01-03 15:13:52,,,,At launch there was the shit about motherboards pushing too high voltage into 7800x3d then even Asus added a disclaimer that using their bios updates that potentially fix that problem void warranty and stuff like that,m56vt7a,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5f6fgs,ishook,,1,2025-01-04 22:01:23,,,,Just built a PC w my son and we put in a modest gfx card an RTX3050 I was pleasantly surprised it didnt require a power cable,,0.0,1hskmmd
comment,m56egqe,drmirage809,,-2,2025-01-03 13:16:35,,,,As much as I like the idea of delivering power through the motherboard to make cables easier to manage I also dont like how power hungry things are getting You cant just keep throwing more watts at the PC to get more power,,0.0,1hskmmd
comment,m56njzz,IolausTelcontar,,26,2025-01-03 14:16:55,,,,You cant I thought that is exactly how it works,m56egqe,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5893i1,ark_mod,,8,2025-01-03 19:14:42,,,,That is exactly how it works ignore drmirage In his response to you hes trying to make a more nuanced statement Going into power density and performance His original statement was you cant keep throwing more watts at the PC to get more power A watt is a unit of power So his statement is in effect you cant throw more power at a PC to get more power This is incorrect in several ways More power enables you to run faster clocks resulting in more power,m56njzz,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m58omhi,drmirage809,,8,2025-01-03 20:32:55,,,,I mean you totally can keep pushing more watts to get more power But eventually youll hit a wall Theres only so much power you can get from the outlet The more power youre pulling in the more heat youll have to cool away Eventually you gotta start using the watts in a more effective manner Its something thats happening Smaller transistors are more power efficient and architectural improvements happen every generation but not fast enough Were still looking at higher power consumption every generation,m5893i1,3.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5cbtbs,danielv123,,2,2025-01-04 12:02:03,,,,Power for the same speed drops a lot every generation A 9700x is 50 more power efficient in blender compared to 7700x for example,m58omhi,4.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5tqosz,akindofuser,,2,2025-01-07 04:58:25,,,,These people are kind of dumb You are absolutely correct There is absolutely a ceiling IDK maybe these idiots are down to wire 20amp circuits into their home PC Personally Im tired of every new PC doubling down as a room space heaters And yea these people arent wrong we can throw more transistors power and speed at the problem But there is a ceiling and IMHO this is a lazy way of expanding the potentiality of modern computing,m58omhi,4.0,1hskmmd
comment,m5908og,IolausTelcontar,,1,2025-01-03 21:31:51,,,,Thank you that is what I was getting at,m5893i1,3.0,1hskmmd
comment,m57a8ck,Edward_TH,,3,2025-01-03 16:22:07,,,,Its not Component ARE getting more efficient but also smaller so they cram more and more into the same size die to get more performance per surface area This is the problem though were still using kinda the same architecture as lots of years ago so with every step were getting maybe 1015 more efficient than the last but the market expect also an increase in performance so what do they do They squeeze more and more stuff into the die so temperatures increases and resistance goes up so they just increase the power limit and get more performance Thats why if youre conscious about your power budget the parameter you need to look for is performance per watt And guess what Most high end GPUs have worse performance per W than lower end ones,m56njzz,2.0,1hskmmd
comment,m59b23m,dead_fritz,,3,2025-01-03 22:27:31,,,,If I get 30fps at 700W going up to 1400W will obviously give me 60fps s,m56egqe,1.0,1hskmmd
comment,m58fmxc,fedexmess,,-1,2025-01-03 19:47:06,,,,I wish theyd just freeze pixel pushing horsepower for a couple gens and concentrate on power efficiency The size and power draw is getting nutz Id love for them to do away with the GPU power cable from the PSU and just add a separate power brick that plugs into the back of the gfx card,m56egqe,1.0,1hskmmd
