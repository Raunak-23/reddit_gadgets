comment,n6k6qds,Mordoch,,22,2025-08-02 17:45:07,,,,The problem is effectively caring for caged rabbits in the middle of the Everglades to lure the pythons when they are all spread out properly There are also probably some animal cruelty issues involved By contrast with the stuffed animals they can effectively set it and forget it with no concerns about the rabbits dying and the like If the trap is set to send out a signal if triggered researchers wont normally have to check traps or do anything with them until they have successfully trapped a python It also is probably easier to deal with nonlive rabbits in terms of things like keeping enough in stock in storage and avoiding them accidentally escaping or biting a researcher or the like,n6k574w,4.0,1mfvulg
