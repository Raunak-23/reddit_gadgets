comment,n3ti9nt,itinerantmarshmallow,,1,2025-07-18 14:07:48,,,,Yeah the issue another issue raised would be if you ever needed to repeat the process when the cloud is gone If for example your Home Kit account or Home Assistant had issues and you refreshed it all,n3thlo4,7.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n3tohqf,Stinedurf,,2,2025-07-18 14:37:54,,,,For the newer ones the homekit code is written on the label of the device so I wouldnt expect that to be a problem On the older ones without the homekit code it could be a problem The Wemo app gave me homekit codes for the older ones but they didnt work when I tried to import them directly to the Home app For those I needed to tell the Wemo app to push them into HomeHomekit,n3ti9nt,8.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2p7zh3,shitty_mcfucklestick,,8,2025-07-12 09:13:21,,,,Im confused I thought they discontinued the line a few years ago when they shut down their online service Also these devices work on the local network still You can get an app called Control which just lists them and lets you shut them on and off This doesnt depend on the cloud as the devices expose themselves on the local network completely openly Not the most secure thing locally but it may let you use them longer,n2k0kdo,1.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2oo624,Eruannster,,11,2025-07-12 06:02:09,,,,The article mentions that Belkin stopped selling these devices and was reconsidering what to do with their smart home lineup back in 2023 so I guess we could have sort of guessed back then,n2lg8yk,3.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2lk9yz,drae-,,24,2025-07-11 18:51:37,,,,Well they stopped making smart home devices and announced they were reconsidering their smart home strategy months ago They have a history of selling off divisions to other firms which then transition away from Belkin software The one Im most familiar with was their pc peripherals I owned an n52te before belkin sold their peripheral division to razer The firmware app was succeeded by synapse which dropped support for legacy products Some of their mobile accessories had app support dropped early too If youre buying Belkin youre just asking for this kinda thing,n2lg8yk,3.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2luak7,Dhegxkeicfns,,28,2025-07-11 19:41:13,,,,Easy to say when its something you dont want The real answer is dont buy them when they use proprietary protocols and require contacting a central server We need these to be autonomous and work locally if the central servers are gone,n2k3bbc,4.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2k9xdt,Kurappu,,17,2025-07-11 15:14:11,,,,I agree with you That said there are devices that dont require a service provider for them to work You just need to put a bit more work in,n2k3bbc,4.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2r0jng,Higira,,1,2025-07-12 16:25:54,,,,Why do the consumer need to have so much foresight When you buy something shouldnt you expect it to work Its YOUR product Its shouldnt be a corporate decision to cut off something you use when you bought it with your hard earned cash That should be the companys problem Hence regulations,n2omlcj,8.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2r1e0k,Bob_The_Bandit,,-1,2025-07-12 16:30:20,,,,Ok And said companies have the full right to stop selling shit they deem is unprofitable and if they need to refund everyone when they wanna shut the servers down no one is gonna ever bother selling them Would you,n2r0jng,9.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2kplss,S_A_N_D_,,24,2025-07-11 16:27:39,,,,So the solution is to only buy smart devices that have fully local control You can set up your own Home Assistant server to control and automate them Objectively at this point it not hard to do I would say at this point is easy enough that the average person could figure it out Rather it just takes a little time and effort Basically people are going with the convenient option at this point and the downside is what we see here where youll be tied in to the company for support and longevity For context I have all the standard smart devices that people have except there is no such thing as no longer supported because theyre all tied into my local server and will keep working in their current capacity as long as I want,n2k0ujl,3.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2m1v5y,iiiinthecomputer,,3,2025-07-11 20:18:59,,,,So I did this with early Philips Hue Theyve since forced the use of previously optional cloud accounts and tried to lock the home base station down so its only controllable via their cloud service They forced a firmware update by making the mobile app disable itself until the base stations were updated For your security of course Just because you buy something you can control locally doesnt mean itll stay that way Yes I couldve blocked its Internet access and used it exclusively via Home Assistant or similar But FFS all they had to do was not break what was already there,n2kplss,4.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2m2gy4,S_A_N_D_,,4,2025-07-11 20:21:55,,,,Just because you buy something you can control locally doesnt mean itll stay that way Fully local means its not tied to their cloud This means there is no way for them to disablenerfbreak it Sounds like this wasnt fully local Or if it was you could have just not updated and everything would have kept working as intended Yes I couldve blocked its Internet access and used it exclusively via Home Assistant or similar But FFS all they had to do was not break what was already there Edit yup This is the price of convenience So it was fully local and could still have been This is precisely why I block internet access and tie everything into my own HA server Just on principal I disable internet access There is no need for them to have it,n2m1v5y,5.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2m6zwx,iiiinthecomputer,,5,2025-07-11 20:44:03,,,,No The catch is the mobile app upgrade treadmill The mobile control apps for most of these things phone home to check for updates and will disable themselves if theyre too old or are told to So the devices themselves were fully local But became unusable with the official mobile app I wouldve just switched to a 3rd party app but my partner was not willing to Oh well The point is that I bought a device that was fully capable of wifi only operation and worked that way for years The vendor then changed the deal 5 years after I bought it I hate that they can do that Its also worth noting that you cant be sure that a seemingly fully local device doesnt have a time bomb embedded I expect three will be devices that seem to operate fully locally then after a few months they complain that they are overdue for their mandatory security update checking schedule and disable themselves for your security You can lie to them about the clock but this might make them much less useful for the intended purpose and the clock may be impossible to set without first unblocking the device,n2m2gy4,6.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2m7lcq,S_A_N_D_,,3,2025-07-11 20:47:00,,,,But thats not fully local then Youre still relying on their web servers for the device to work I dont need any of the manufactures mobile apps for any of my local devices I have local control and rout it all through my HA app which I serve myself If it needs a proprietary app to function and that app needs internet access to work its not fully local even if all the app is doing is pinging a server for permission to work,n2m6zwx,7.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2l3iws,Aqualung812,,1,2025-07-11 17:32:10,,,,What are you doing for batterysolar EV chargers robomowers and cooking devices These are all things I have that time trying to get local control of,n2kplss,4.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2laohe,S_A_N_D_,,6,2025-07-11 18:05:11,,,,There are lots of implementations for solar and battery monitoring and control The key is you need to plan it out ahead of time when you purchase and install it so that you use components that are compatible Lots of people route all of that through HA though to the point where its actually part of the core implementation of HA There are a ton of options for this one with setups that just monitor to setups that have full control I wouldnt know where to start because it would depend on your system and what you have installed already but google will be your friend in this one RoboMowers is not one that youll find good support for that you got me Seems like the Husqvarna ones can be monitored and controlled trough HA but you still need to connect to their cloud service Robomowers though are still pretty new and arent all that common yet so I expect eventually there will be some local only options Large appliances are somewhat hit and miss Lots of them integrate but need the cloud as a middleman and there are some active projects designed around eliminating the cloud component but I havent tried them to see how well they work and those I wouldnt categorize as easy as per my original comment It also depends on what youre looking for If its power monitoring and the ability to cut power in an emergency there are lots of options If its the smart features that came with the appliance you wont find much for completely local control as the cloud is often still needed as a middleman Youll be able to route them and control them from HA but you will still be reliant on the cloud I guess I should say my original comment was more aimed at the smart devices on the same level as what was being discontinued with Belkin More about the smaller iot devices like switches sensors alarms cameras etc Appliances are an issue and niche things like the robomowers will take time before there are local only options and I would say that is still niche because its relatively new and doesnt have a ton of adoption though I doubt it will be forever Personally I dont see a use for a lot of the smart features in appliances I see them as a security vulnerability and if Im cooking Im in the kitchen so being able to control it from my phone is somewhat of a gimmick Ive looked into them from time to time and never seen anything of much interest and most people who have ones with smart features in my experience rarely use the smart features For example my dishwasher has smart features but I never use them and they really offer me nothing of value so Ive just ignored them If anything its more of an annoyance because a few things that should just be a simple button or indicator are only available through the app About the only things that are good is the ability to see if something was left on or if a door is open etc and all of that can be implemented externally in other ways,n2l3iws,5.0,1lx7rfi
comment,n2lfn70,Aqualung812,,0,2025-07-11 18:29:10,,,,Yeah Ive already got local control in HA for the basic stuff Im looking for smart kitchen appliances because I want to be able to preheat remotely start dishes from bed when I forget or really the most important feature I dont want to have to set the damn clocks on my oven microwave every time the power flickers The privacy stuff is a nonissue when you have local control I already have a IoT VLAN that I can block to the Internet Ive just got a lot of things that arent quite there yet Ecoflow for my solar batteries because cost was a bigger factor than local when I bought them ChargePoint for my EV chargers same reason The dishwasher is a Bosch which seems to be a Matterfriendly company I hope theyll do Matter as an update but as you say kitchen devices arent musthave for IoT so Im not going to be devastated if I dont get it Dont have the smart robomower oven or microwave right not BECAUSE Im making local control a nonnegotiable I could maybe try to use my circuit monitoring to tell if the oven is preheated but it takes quite a bit of trial error to tune the alerts Matter connectivity would just make it all easier,n2laohe,6.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2kle8j,famousxrobot,,3,2025-07-11 16:07:34,,,,Agreed You can choose what companies you support Personally I avoid smart products that require an app The devices I have are either open to AppleGoogleAlexa better still not ideal by any means or are cheap enough that I dont care if the app support ends a few smart bulbs that if the app stopped working they still function as normal light bulbs Even my smart door lock works locally with a keypad or Bluetooth even if wifi module or app fails and it has a physical key as a final fallback,n2k1bxr,4.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2kshfs,S_A_N_D_,,0,2025-07-11 16:41:25,,,,There probably could be a way to do it For example the licences would probably still be valid Whether its someone on github writing the code or someone in their own company the landscape doesnt change because the licensing fee has already been paid for that device Basically as long as its not being used for a new device then it wouldnt necessarily violate the spirit of the licensing agreement and no harm comes to those to own the licence and the law could effectively just take that into account It might violate some current agreements the way theyre currently written but the law could just require that this be an option and therefore any clauses that prevent it are null and void More importantly they dont need to fully opensource all the code and firmware Rather they just need to implement some sort of open protocol that lets another server control the device Lots of smart devices already do this where the firmware is proprietary but its implemented in such a way that it can be pairedcontrolled with any server and isnt limited to the manufactures cloud provider Basically you dont need to give people the ability to write their own firmware rather you just need to let people continue to use the device using their own server instead of the cloud provider if theyre so motivated It essentially needs to be how old software was handled before everything was a subscription service You didnt lose access to the software rather it just stopped receiving updates If you wanted to keep using it that was up to you and there might be inherent risks due to security flaws but you werent denied anything Eventually it would stop working because it was incompatible with the current OS but usually by then the software was so old that few people were using it anymore and those that did want to still use it could usually set up a VM to run it,n2kcgep,3.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2medph,lunasdude,,2,2025-07-11 21:21:07,,,,Im in the same boat pinned all my smart home products on WeMo When I got my email from Belkin after cussing them heavily I jumped on and started doing some research Almost all of my WeMo products are either Smart switches or smart plugs so since I have several Amazon Alexas which are used to control my Smart switches I came up with Amazons smart offerings which covered everything I needed and a bonus theyre on sale right now because of Amazons prime week It really sucks so because I liked my WeMo products they worked pretty well bastards,n2k6oqf,1.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2mchfl,lunasdude,,1,2025-07-11 21:11:24,,,,I could not agree more which is why I have avoided Google products in general their phones theyre smart products etc Although like most humans on this planet I do rely on Gmail and a few other Google products but overall especially when it comes to hardware theyve killed way too many things for me to trust them at this point I thought wemo was a pretty good bet because they have been around for quite a while and when Belkin bought them I thought it was even a better fit but obviously I was stoned dead wrong I have several smart plugs and wall switches from wemo and after doing research decided to go with Amazons branded devices I already have several Amazon ALEXA devices which is what I use to interface with my Smart switches so for me and since Amazon is such a large company hopefully that will work for me in the future Another plus right now is Amazon devices are on prime days specials so I was able to replace multiple smart plugs and wall switches for a very good price,n2kc0i8,1.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2mon3f,lunasdude,,1,2025-07-11 22:15:31,,,,Agreed and theres the catch if you want the cool features of a smart home such as telling Alexa or Google to turn on your lights monitor you washing machine etc or you like the remote capability of being able to turn on your heating or AC remotely before you get home then you have to have either a homebuilt internal server which I did many years ago and trust me it is a pain in the ass to maintain or you have to rely on a company to maintain its servers This is one of the cautionary tales of what happens when they abandon those very servers Youre stuck with a heavy manual paperweight,n2mlto1,3.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2m569n,iiiinthecomputer,,3,2025-07-11 20:35:07,,,,Probably yes Try disconnecting your Internet service temporarily or adding a block in your router to stop them using the Internet Most likely they wont work Most of these things call out to Internet based servers then back into your home rather than using point to point communication over wifi,n2kn0zn,3.0,1lx7rfi

comment,n2mbh7v,lunasdude,,3,2025-07-11 21:06:15,,,,Theyre not going to be disabling them remotely Whats happening is they are stopping their support through their cloudbased computers so what that means to you is that while your device will still connect to your WiFi they really wont be able to do anything unless you have a manual server on a computer or you have Apple HomeKit which will support a few of the devices not all of them What that means to most of us is that they will essentially neuter the devices by not supporting them so no voice activation by ALXEA or Google and no remote functions whatsoever You will still be able to press the physical button on the wall switches and on the plugs etc and it will function as a really expensive dumb switch,n2kcvih,1.0,1lx7rfi
