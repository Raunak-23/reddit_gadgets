comment,mg66x00,TheJasonaut,,10,2025-03-05 16:42:35,,,,Im probably gonna die on the hill that is AR glasses will never be even close to mainstream Unless there ends up being some unforeseen crazy useful feature or a niche like the vision impaired everything seems to make navigating the world overall worse and more dangerousAnd Im someone who thinks VR is pretty cool,,0.0,1j46fif
comment,mgfitoj,enutz777,,3,2025-03-07 00:55:32,,,,If youre looking at the regular world youre missing everything Then when the next pandemic hits the AR program will monitor as you clean and any place not cleaned will have a neon glow on others glasses with the app You cant walk around the world safely without it Even talking to someone without AR proving theyve been taking all safety precautions will be dangerous Theyre just glasses to make sure people are safe from a deadly virus those not using it will be a danger to us all You will like them they will make you safe and protected from the dangers you cant see by letting you see them Youre not one of those selfish people we need to round up in order to protect children and the elderly are you,mg66x00,1.0,1j46fif

comment,mg7rndk,UboaNoticedYou,,2,2025-03-05 21:05:14,,,,Im of the opinion that AR has a place in industry and few other places I think people will always be resistant to putting things on their face that they dont need,mg66x00,1.0,1j46fif
comment,mgdcytp,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2025-03-06 18:21:36,,,,Like half the human population needs to put a thing on their face already though They already wear glasses Those that dont need to daily still a lot of them wear sunglasses occasionally The idea here is for tech to enter the glasses space Most likely getting prescriptions put in is the easiest part,mg7rndk,2.0,1j46fif
comment,mg62qnj,phantopia,,6,2025-03-05 16:22:47,,,,What would they put in that puck that wont be integrated in future phones anyway Basically everything that can be done with glasses can also be done maybe less ergonomically so with a phone So any special AI Hardware will be build into phones anyway for people who dont want the glasses,,0.0,1j46fif
comment,mg6n9ib,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-03-05 17:58:46,,,,AR is about holographic projection You cant project 3D holograms with a phone,mg62qnj,1.0,1j46fif
comment,mg78530,HarmlessSnack,,4,2025-03-05 19:35:20,,,,No dude youre misunderstanding their comment What theyre saying is Why build a special Puckshaped pocket PC the thing in the article you posted to handle the computing when a current gen iPhone Android could likely achieve the same thing with an App Hes not suggesting the phone would replace the part you wear on your face just the part that goes in your pocket EDIT maybe he is suggesting the phone could just do AR too thats actually already a thing so they arent wrong Especially since the type of techenthusiast that would buy something like this almost certainly already has a high end phone,mg6n9ib,2.0,1j46fif
comment,mg7oqmn,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-03-05 20:52:02,,,,Ahh well in that case eventually hardware like this could be built into a phone but as of now this is really expensive custom stuff that would price any phone out of the market The puck does need to exit with these glasses because no phone today could handle the thermal and battery requirements that AR glasses require Even with this puck youre only getting 23 hours of battery life when the end goal really needs to be 8 hours If powered by the most efficient phone out there Id wager maybe 30 mins at best and then the phone itself is out of battery which would be really inconvenient,mg78530,3.0,1j46fif
comment,mg86obw,HarmlessSnack,,2,2025-03-05 22:14:12,,,,Its really interesting that theyre drawing that much power and the thermal load is so high I didnt see any of those data points mentioned in the article though Are you pulling from some additional source,mg7oqmn,4.0,1j46fif
comment,mg87wcu,DarthBuzzard,,3,2025-03-05 22:19:59,,,,Its talked about more in Metas blog Theyve also talked about the constraints of compute for AR glasses in the past,mg86obw,5.0,1j46fif

comment,mge03pr,phantopia,,1,2025-03-06 20:09:38,,,,Tech like that can only be economically viable if enough people can use it So my guess would be that any function that requires this amount of computing power will only be widely used when it is possible to do so without additional devices Otherwise anybody who eants to use the AI features though their phone instead of the glasses would need to carry the puck and the connected phone all the time,mg7oqmn,4.0,1j46fif
comment,mgdz3af,phantopia,,1,2025-03-06 20:04:52,,,,Thanks for clarifying That was exactly what I meant,mg78530,3.0,1j46fif
comment,mg8jn7t,-domi-,,2,2025-03-05 23:18:58,,,,We start getting into the limits of physics That means nothing Literally almost every time youre trying to maximize the performance of a piece of electronics you push up to the limits of physics,,0.0,1j46fif
comment,mg8ublz,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-03-06 00:21:00,,,,In fairness there is no consumer electronics category that has ever been as deterred by the laws of physics as AR has It was easier to make the first personal computers cellphones etc,mg8jn7t,1.0,1j46fif
