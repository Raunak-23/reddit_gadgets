comment,lws1yho,DrBhu,,3,2024-11-12 17:33:59,,,,Subtitle of the Article An Apple Home camera would fit neatly into Apples smart home ecosystem and could leverage Apple Intelligence says analyst Buying a most likely very much overprized security camera which would improve Apple AI with the collected data from your home sounds a bit dystopian And I am pretty sure they would get some serious problems if they use data which was collected in customers homes to train their AI model They just completely overslept the whole AI thing Their actual strategy to compete seems to be to get as much trainingdata as possible to catch up with the big boys In this particular area,,0.0,1gpq0fz

comment,lws5nzx,IronHeart_777,,1,2024-11-12 17:52:52,,,,For better or worse Ive been a hardcore google fanboy since my first android phone back in the donuteclair days I have probably 8 googles homes of varying models mini home hub normal size multiple google cameras the nest learning thermostat the doorbell etc While they havent crashed and burned the quality of service certainly has Every Google home I have randomly activates at random times sometimes in dead silence My cameras continually have connection issues even though Ive spent a fortune on my home network ensuring theres no dead zones anywhere I just recently made a post over on rHue about how my google homes have all seemingly forgotten how to control my lights correctly If I werent so heavily invested Id love to switch to a different smart home setup but I have huge issues with Amazon just enabling their sidewalk function and it being opt out instead of in Edit The crash and burn comment made by separatespend may be in reference to google discontinuing their nest security system but I believe that was done around the time they decided to partner with ADT I have a ring security system but havent used it since offloading all of my ring cameras since it was found out that ring employees were watching camera streams when they shouldnt have been,lws3xd8,3.0,1gpq0fz
comment,lwsit0m,SeparateSpend1542,,2,2024-11-12 18:59:30,,,,I mean exactly what you describe They abandoned products and stopped updating the firmware so now the systems dont work right and Google shows no signs of investing in the ecosystem It used to be competitive if not superior to most smart home systems on the market but now its barely usable since it lacks reliability which is a key feature for something you give control of your home Unfortunately smart home systems arent something you can just replace like a phone So you get stuck with a bunch of cameras that no longer work that you bought to integrate with your Nest yes I speak from experience My advice to anyone thinking about setting up a smart home dont use Google They dont support their products and youll be stuck with thousands of dollars of junk,lws5nzx,4.0,1gpq0fz
