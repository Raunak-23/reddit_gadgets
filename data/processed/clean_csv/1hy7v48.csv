comment,m6f6mfl,chrisdh79,,194,2025-01-10 16:10:37,,,,From the article Identifying which USB standard is being used can be a pain for users looking to purchase cables or docking stations Terms like USB 32 Gen 2 leave people scratching their heads due to their ambiguity Thankfully those names are finally being phased out thanks to a new USB labeling system The USB Implementers Forum USBIF has rolled out updated logos that ditch the perplexing nomenclature according to a report by PCWorld offering more straightforward speed ratings For instance if you spot a USB4 hub labeled USB 80Gbps on the side of the box youll know youre getting the latest and greatest USB technology with a blistering 80 gigabits per second transfer speed A step below that will be marked USB 40Gbps which is still quite fast The approach also extends to older USB specs so you might see a USB 20Gbps logo for USB 32 Gen 2x2 devices or USB 10Gbps for USB 32 Gen 2 gear The new labeling extends to cables too the new logo will indicate both data transfers and charging speeds which will go up to 240W Thats exactly the kind of power youll need for massive 500W bricks capable of charging five laptops at the same time Furthermore laptop manufacturers are expected to start printing these labels across their devices USBIF representatives informed PCWorld that Dell may begin to label its USB ports,,0.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6f86df,dead_fritz,,257,2025-01-10 16:18:15,,,,So they fucked up the branding for USB so bad theyre just changing to directly putting the rated speed on the box instead Absolute genius move from these guys Who would have thought that making the branding actually clear as to what it means was the right way to do things,m6f6mfl,1.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6fk3gv,QuidYossarian,,50,2025-01-10 17:15:43,,,,I had to read it twice before understanding their first move wasnt just labeling the product with its capability,m6f86df,2.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6k3irv,alidan,,34,2025-01-11 10:35:51,,,,their first move was to make usb 1 2 and then 3 which were perfectly fine but then 31 32 and usb c effectively muddied everything to the point its unidentifiable at a glance you have any idea how hard it was to find a usb c extention cable that could take 1080p60 video and power while also functioning as a usb between devices,m6fk3gv,3.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6fydca,Roadside_Prophet,,22,2025-01-10 18:23:56,,,,theyre just changing to directly putting the rated speed on the box instead And that STILL wont stop the confusion when people plug their 80GBPS cable into a USB1 port and dont understand why they are only getting 10GBPS Or when their phone doesnt charge as fast as the labeling says because their phone and or charger doesnt actually support that speed,m6f86df,2.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6gkfcx,trainbrain27,,19,2025-01-10 20:10:41,,,,USB 1 was 15 Mbps or 12 Mbps FullSpeed USB 2 was 480 Mbps HighSpeed USB 3 started at 5Gbps SuperSpeed and then they started doing generations which are incredibly stupid at least to the consumer They should have just used USB 3 X Gbps until there was some advantage to calling it USB 4 USB 4 had to start with Gen 3 because USB 3 ended in Gen 2 and resetting would cause further confusion At least were nearly down to one universal reversible connector The original standard had A B MiniA MiniB MiniAB MicroA MicroB and MicroAB some of which were introduced because companies were making up their own ports that were all different Before C there were even USB 3 versions of the regular and micro ones with the extra wires stuck next or on top of the original,m6fydca,3.0,1hy7v48

comment,m6h2cyq,Fidodo,,4,2025-01-10 21:39:17,,,,Yes the problem was that the specs were flexible meaning you could have 2 cables branded as USB32 with totally different capabilities,m6fkfmg,3.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6kf2qs,I_just_made,,1,2025-01-11 12:30:53,,,,Branding is fine here while we normally associate brand with a company the term action is more about creating a distinctive label or category For instance you might hear something like that person was branded as a heretic in a movie or something,m6fkfmg,3.0,1hy7v48

comment,m6fdk84,AdarTan,,31,2025-01-10 16:44:11,,,,To be fair for years now the USB IFs standing on the technical link names like USB 32 Gen2x2 is that they shouldnt appear in consumer branding The reason the average vaguely technically inclined person has even heard these terms is because the USB IF releases the technical materials with an accompanying press release before finalizing the consumer branding and releasing that with a press release two months later During that interval between technical document and marketing document all the tech influencers scramble to talk about the new standard months before there will be any devices that support it and to do so they and by extension their audience latch on to the terminology of the engineering document that was never intended to be read and understood by the general public Since at least 2022 the USB IFs stance has been that the term used for an USB connection should just be USB Rated Speed no mention of USB 32 USB4 Version 12 or the like Before that there may have been SuperSpeed USB Rated Speed but even then terms like USB 32 etc were discouraged,m6f6mfl,1.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6g1bon,Zixinus,,12,2025-01-10 18:38:06,,,,The issue is that there is no other distinction attempted and that the ambigious naming should never have been made and is what made ambiguity present in the first place Just as there is no mandatory color scheme or symbols on the heads to indicate what cable you have or port you are plugging into I would go so far as to even say that the issue is pushed by manufacturers that WANT ambiguity in USBC cables so they can sell the cheaper ones more easily and clear that stock before moving on to higher grade cables,m6fdk84,2.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6lelyu,lordraiden007,,6,2025-01-11 16:19:46,,,,Thats all well and good in theory The problem is that people want to know what the hell theyre buying When purchasing a USB cable what ability do you have to know exactly what it supports if they just use the generic name Why would a producer only put USB 3 X Gbps when they put in the money to support the higher power throughput as well This also doesnt help in cases where the producer simply markets incorrectly The USB 4 interface on our drive supports up to 80 Gbps Maximum drive performance is 80 Mbps HDMI and DP have similar issues with a majority of the specs being optional features that the user has virtually no way of verifying support on until theyve bought the cable The simple fact is that they need to either A put in a massive table or list indicating every single feature and optional feature supported or B remove optional parts of the spec and make all cables carrying their branding universal or C ignore everything like theyve been doing up until this point This middle ground simply isnt working anymore for people who actually want to know what their products are capable of,m6fdk84,2.0,1hy7v48

comment,m6h1dc2,MooseBoys,,32,2025-01-10 21:34:20,,,,The issue isnt just the naming scheme The issue is fundamentally due to all the orthogonal optional features present in USBC You can have a TB4 port that charges at 65W but supports DP alt mode with MST You can have a USB 20 port that supports 240W PPS charging You can have a USB 40 port that supports 100W PPS and 40Gbps but only supports 20Gbps when using display,m6f7i78,1.0,1hy7v48

comment,m6hv589,Flimzes,,0,2025-01-11 00:15:38,,,,This statement makes no sense For PD to work all parts of the chain must support it then the device will request it from the charger If any of these requirements fall short the charger vil provide 5v as usual and the device will be limited to that voltage and will have to decide whether it should just turn off or if 5v is enough to run None of this is damaging to any of the components,m6g2lru,1.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6hvihh,whistler1421,,1,2025-01-11 00:17:43,,,,It didnt get damagedit just constantly rebooted due to it not getting enough voltage The guy I sold it too replaced the cable with the proper one and said it worked perfectly,m6hv589,2.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6hvy6n,Flimzes,,1,2025-01-11 00:20:09,,,,I understand now Well the alternative is that the pd spec didnt require an etag in the cable and just sent 5A down the random cable which 10 minutes later catches fire USB suffers from legacy more than anything else the cables made 20 years ago didnt have etag or specs written on them to handle situations they never imagined,m6hvihh,3.0,1hy7v48

comment,m6fxgxo,KungFuHamster,,2,2025-01-10 18:19:38,,,,Gbps and Watts are the only relevant measurements Thats like saying the 70 mph speed limit sign isnt intuitive Not knowing what those terms mean demonstrates complete ignorance of what they are for,m6ft1l1,1.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6g1kxm,sagarassk,,-2,2025-01-10 18:39:22,,,,Grandpa doesnt need to know the speed or the wattage to charge his phone They could have simplified the naming schema to USB1 USB2 USB3 etc Hey what cable do I need to charge my laptop and move files from my phone to the laptop Oh you need a USB3 or higher Done If youre a little more tech savvy and are interested in the specs they can google the USB standard and figure out USB 3 can support up to 240W and transfer at 80Gbps,m6fxgxo,2.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6i4h5h,Syrairc,,3,2025-01-11 01:08:22,,,,Oh you need a USB3 or higher This is only marginally simpler than you need a usb 200W or higher except it conveys less information,m6g1kxm,3.0,1hy7v48
comment,m6gfksg,KungFuHamster,,2,2025-01-10 19:47:06,,,,Sure USB1 and USB2 would have been nice but its too late those labels have been ratfucked already So youd have to go with different labels that are even more abstract and confusing BTW microwave ovens have a WATTAGE rating And frozen food comes with instructions based on that microwave WATTAGE Not some crap label standard like MWAVE 32 Why wont someone think of the grandpas Oh the humanity,m6g1kxm,3.0,1hy7v48
