comment,mnm71vu,thenerfviking,,32,2025-04-17 17:10:25,,,,If youre at all interested in running your own server the cost has literally never been lower Unless youre personally running a several hundred person Minecraft server or building your own MMO out of your basement theres been shockingly little relevant progress in computers for like 5 to 10 years depending on what your goals are Those hacked up Russian X99 boards coming out of China are insanely cheap Im running my home server on a used 5 year old Threadripper I got with a mobo for like 250 and its frankly overkill for what I do with it,mnm55h5,2.0,1k1halv

comment,mnq1qwi,snajk138,,1,2025-04-18 07:30:46,,,,Exactly Im thinking about going solid state and passively cooled to make a completely silent server I live in an apartment and dont really have the space to keep a notsilent server running anywhere and even a pretty quiet one is loud enough to be annoying,mnmst5s,5.0,1k1halv

comment,mnmncxc,Knut79,,7,2025-04-17 18:28:26,,,,Just because a cpu CAN use a lot of power doesnt mean it have to But when it needs to trsnscoding multi streams wiring to hard drives running server etc it has the reserve power to use it Yes the cost is a little bit higher idlenpower than a RPi or similar but it allows a lot more flexibility and future proofing,mnm9rx2,4.0,1k1halv
comment,mnq19cu,snajk138,,1,2025-04-18 07:25:40,,,,Sure but there are lower powered options that doesnt compromise much on performance nowadays I have a mini PC with a Ryzen 7 5700U for instance 8C16T and never draws more than 30W and thats while playing pretty demanding games and it was available with a 5825U for even more performance It only has room for one SATA and one m2 though and it isnt exactly silent but thats because its a mini PC But it is modern enough to be able to use the APU for hardware acceleration of encoding and stuff That APU with passive cooling and an external PSU in a case with room for a few drives would be a great serverNAS If using SSDs it would be completely silent and its definitely powerful enough for any home server duties I have used for testing the application I develop at work its a micro service app with 32 docker containers and two windows VMs for third party things Its demanding enough that they had to upgrade our work machines to 64GB just to be able to run it in debug but it runs better on my mini PC with 32 GB though without debug,mnmncxc,5.0,1k1halv
comment,mnq227x,Knut79,,1,2025-04-18 07:34:05,,,,Trsnscoding multiple 4k streams is pretty intensive afd in a download manager on top and personal cloud and maybe a Minecraft or some other game server Or what about remote gaming on your iPhone or non gaming laptop Also a mikipc is terrible for a NAS as upu vant get a nice clean single case system but need an external storage rack solution adding on costs,mnq19cu,6.0,1k1halv
comment,mnq53s9,snajk138,,1,2025-04-18 08:05:56,,,,Yes you can obviously find tasks that would tax any server if you want But I have no need for transcoding multiple 4K streams or streaming multiple or taxing games at the same time And I have a gaming PC if I want to game I would use that streaming or local since thats what its there for My server is used for server things running a bunch of containers for home automation media streaming git and other tasks and as a NAS obviously And Im not saying that you should use that mini PC just that the performance from that is really good not just for the power consumption and that it would probably be better at a lot of server tasks than a ten year old Xeon or something and use a fraction of the power doing it The downside is as mentioned above that it doesnt have room for many disks and that its a bit loud when pushed at least But there are barebones systems coming out now that basically is a mini PC with room for a bunch of 35 drives There are chassis for ITX and barebones with a Celeron Pentium or a lowpowered Ryzen with bays for 28 drives that are much cheaper than a Synology NAS and likely cheaper than a used real server Some support ECC if you need that some have multiple NICs if you want it to be a router as well and so on For instance K7 ITX chassi with 8 hotswap bays NASync barebones NAS n100 with two 35 bays and 2 m2 slots Motherboard ITX with n5105 4 NICs 6 SATA ports,mnq227x,7.0,1k1halv

comment,mnqtof0,snajk138,,1,2025-04-18 11:56:52,,,,This is a discussion about NASes and I responded to someone talking about the cost being so low with X99 motherboards and five year old Threadrippers pointing out that maybe something less power hungry could also cover most peoples needs for about the same money upfront and using much less power Transcoding multiple 4K streams simultaneously is something I would consider to be an edge case not something most people would have any need for especially not someone considering an appliance like a Synology Streaming modern AAAgames from my own server and not my gaming PC is even more in to enthusiast territory Cost wise you could get a modern computer with a powerful but lowpowered CPU and a handful of disks for less than the cost of the electricity alone for a smaller regular server over a couple of years Im all for reusing old components and utilizing leftover parts but thats because I like doing that sort of thing Environmentally as well as financially it wont be that good of a choice though even if you get the parts for free and unless you have very specific needs you wont really get any benefits from the potentially higher performance you might get in some cases,mnq6wu5,9.0,1k1halv
comment,mnrn9zd,Knut79,,1,2025-04-18 14:50:47,,,,Dude He literally said he used it as a server in addition For home use a single purpose server makes no sense unless youre Linus even then Im not sure it really makes sense Trsnscoding multiple streams is only an edge case for anyone that dont live alone So no its absolutely not an edge case Also Electricity isnt that expensive and in many places it very very cheap,mnqtof0,10.0,1k1halv
comment,mnruin6,snajk138,,1,2025-04-18 15:26:45,,,,Who said anything about single purpose That tiny PC easily runs 3040 containers and a few VMs And I dont live alone still transcoding isnt something my server does Everything on my server is in 4K or 1080p and all devices we watch things on can handle that I dont really stream much video outside my home though but my phone can also handle 4K and 1080p Electricity is also cheap here but say 150W constantly for a whole year and thats pretty low for a server is still over 1300 kWh a year for me that would cost about 200 My mini PC on the other hand draws no more than 20W unless gaming on it and I dont game on it so thats about 175 kWh per year or about 25,mnrn9zd,11.0,1k1halv
comment,mnmbzk4,MrStrul3,,2,2025-04-17 17:33:46,,,,Yeah thats overkill I just only recently started getting into recording with an action camera so I was just looking for something quick like the Sinology which was an option because I thought why not get something good from the get go well an external drive will be able to handle that amount of data for the time being,mnm9rx2,4.0,1k1halv

comment,mno0wi9,AnalTrajectory,,8,2025-04-17 22:41:33,,,,I had strongly considered buying one of their NASs after seeing so many good reviews about their software Ultimately the premium on their models was just too high for what you get I built my own in a Jonsbo N2 with a low power i5 and 30GB of drives with far greater value Edit I meant 30TB Its been a long day More info you dont care about Im running a TrueNAS vm on top of proxmox,mnm55h5,2.0,1k1halv

comment,mnpirz9,SupremeDictatorPaul,,5,2025-04-18 04:29:24,,,,Im savy but I went with Synology on my most recent build because I was tired of troubleshooting weird issues and dealing with drivers firmware broken upgrades etc with Synology it just works and I dont have to worry about it Which is nice It definitely cost more money though For my next build I may build my own again using something like Unraid and with 12 bays Its hard to say but I am still years out from that point so anything is possible,mnnrdf0,3.0,1k1halv

comment,mnog56r,MachinaThatGoesBing,,10,2025-04-18 00:10:04,,,,It is as yet unclear what drives will be certified for new units And Synology has been slow andor negligent about certifying drives When we were looking to upgrade storage a number of perfectly good currentmodel CMR WD Red Pro drives did not appear on the officially supported list for some of the NASes we own at work So I wouldnt count on this just being a qualityofoperation assurance thing with no impact on what you can buy,mnmhqb3,2.0,1k1halv
comment,mnpjlo1,SupremeDictatorPaul,,4,2025-04-18 04:36:17,,,,I havent looked recently but last time I had Synology hadnt certified a new drive in years I searched around for people saying they were successfully using the years old drive model I was considering in my model before I bought the drives I wanted 20TB drives and they didnt have any 3rd party drives that size certified I paid like 280 per refurb drive instead of whatever ridiculous price they wanted,mnmhqb3,2.0,1k1halv

comment,mnnu3vo,this_dudeagain,,1,2025-04-17 22:03:13,,,,You can buy a Dell NAS from Dell but youre going to run into the exact same thing Synology is trying to do now All hardware has to come from them which is pretty standard in enterprise settings to get support,mnm4ktb,3.0,1k1halv
comment,mnm5umm,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,-5,2025-04-17 17:04:40,,,,You dont have to go used like that if you are selling to a business They have other options For businesses you could buy all new parts to build a PC and use something like TrueNAS Unraid or HexOS to build something more resilient Even a basic 4 bay NAS from Synology costs 500 before you even buy the drives Something with 8 bays is 1000 or more You could buy a nice PC for those prices,mnm4ktb,3.0,1k1halv
comment,mnm744d,DaStompa,,3,2025-04-17 17:10:44,,,,I bought one of their 4 bay nass for 300 last year if you have infinite time the value is always there for DIYers A couple hours of setup and then figuring out web accessbackendaccess stuff really wasnt worth saving like a hundred bucks,mnm5umm,4.0,1k1halv
comment,mnm82kg,None,,5,2025-04-17 17:15:17,,,,Its not easy for most people Besides that old optiplex isnt efficient as 4560w idle is terrible electricity prices vary a lot Yes you can buy something better for the price but thats it,mnm2g1b,1.0,1k1halv
comment,mnnunft,this_dudeagain,,1,2025-04-17 22:06:11,,,,Thats still pretty cheap power wise and you get way better performance if you run a mediagame server If youre using a lot of drives youre still going to be using a fair bit of power regardless,mnm82kg,2.0,1k1halv
comment,mnmas31,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,1,2025-04-17 17:28:04,,,,Theres more power efficient ways to do it The Optiplex was just one example You could go with a mini PC and a USB RAID enclosure Or even just get a few external drives and hook them up to USB It would cost more but youd save on power The point is that there are various options you could explore No one solution has to work for everyone Ive tried a few different purpose built NAS boxes and I found that they often had issues They didnt make things as plugandplay as they should If Synology is only going to allow their own drives thats a major problem because it means I likely cant just go pick up a drive from the store when a drive dies Its important to replace a drive as soon as it dies so you dont lose any data,mnm82kg,2.0,1k1halv
comment,mnmdeem,None,,2,2025-04-17 17:40:26,,,,I personally run a 4 stick nvme NAS board based on a Rockchip SoC cant get more efficient than that But most people are dumb and cant go beyond plug and play Yes what Synology is doing is bullshit but competition will catch up and mop them eventually so I say let nature run its course,mnmas31,3.0,1k1halv

comment,mnm96xc,bakerzdosen,,2,2025-04-17 17:20:34,,,,Im not sure I get the backlash here This is only on their higher end line where this sort of thing is common Sure not many customers are going to be on the fence between a NetappPureHPE3ParDellEMCwhatever product and a Synology but selfbranded drives are expected for enterprise storage The storage system vendor eg Synology wont really build or control the hardware but they typically will have their own firmware on the drives Personally Im not in the market for this type of storage but if I was running a smallish business and wantedneeded robust enterprisegrade storage without paying for one of those other vendors products and public cloud offerings just didnt fit my needs I dont see any reason why I wouldnt consider a Synology Plus system They have other nonPlus systems that havent been affected by this change for home use,,0.0,1k1halv
comment,mnmqwu1,heepofsheep,,2,2025-04-17 18:46:14,,,,Yeah every enterprise shared storage Ive used comes with an explicit list of supported drives though it doesnt matter that much since replacement drives are typically covered under annual support,mnm96xc,1.0,1k1halv

comment,mnn0dsi,theo2112,,0,2025-04-17 19:33:49,,,,Did anyone read the short article youll lose several critical functions including estimated hard drive health reports volumewide deduplication lifespan analyses and automatic firmware updates The company also restricts storage pools and provides limited or zero support for thirdparty drives Other than whatever restricts storage pools everything else you lose is just a feature of the hard drive itself The NAS will work exactly the same but these perks that Im sure are difficult to maintain for a huge number of hard drive possibilities will just go away In fact Im pretty sure some of those things have always been unsupported by hard drives not from a major manufacturer All this looks like to me is Synology saying that if you want the experience youre used to you need to have a certifiedbadged hard drive If not basically everything will still work but it becomes a little more use at your own risk Also it mentions that theyve already done this for enterprise hardware saw how well it worked by limiting edge cases Im sure and are just rolling it out to the next hardware tier,,0.0,1k1halv

comment,mno1olr,nybble41,,1,2025-04-17 22:46:01,,,,The health reports and lifetime analyses are most likely just access to the SMART monitoring interface which is broadly supported across most drives Volumewide deduplication is a software function as are firmware updates for the NAS not the drive and storage pools Theyre disabling features which would work with just about any drive in order to promote their own inhouse and partner brands Withholding support for any issue plausibly related to use of a noncertified thirdparty drive would be one thing but preemptively disabling unrelated functionality is a step too far,mnn0dsi,1.0,1k1halv
comment,mnp53ev,theo2112,,1,2025-04-18 02:47:20,,,,Unless theyve seen that most of the issues users have are caused by drives that are not high quality and this is a way to get ahead of that My take on this is that synology has crossed from something only nerds know about to a more consumer friendly brand But with a product like a NAS where users are 1 counting on it working and 2 responsible for buying and installing half of the system the drives theres a lot that could go wrong if the user buys cheap off brand hard drives To me this is almost about brand protection Telling the user that feature XYZ will not be available is better than them thinking it is and the the feature not working leading to lost data If you think your drives will self monitor and the system will alert you to issues you can be careless about checking yourself If the system says hey these drives are not compatible youll have to keep an eye on them at least the user is aware before its possibly too late,mno1olr,2.0,1k1halv
