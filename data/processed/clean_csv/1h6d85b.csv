comment,m0hraca,Du3zle,,1,2024-12-05 04:52:43,,,,Im a steam deck guy myself But these have better specs and I think the majority of pc gamers are fanatically loyal to Windows,m0hgn29,1.0,1h6d85b
comment,m0htdlm,None,,11,2024-12-05 05:08:42,,,,Its not fanatically loyal to windows its just that most of the PC games are on windows as Apple sucks for games,m0hraca,2.0,1h6d85b
comment,m0htwf8,Du3zle,,3,2024-12-05 05:12:46,,,,Well my point was that the steam deck is Linux and thats less familiar to people Nothing to do with apple But I stand by my point that given a choice most gamers will pick windows over anything else and that justifies the existence of windows based competitors to the steam deck,m0htdlm,3.0,1h6d85b
comment,m0prlhi,resil_update_bad,,2,2024-12-06 15:01:23,,,,I think its more about game compatibility if anything,m0htwf8,4.0,1h6d85b
comment,m0jnlf0,LevianMcBirdo,,2,2024-12-05 14:53:17,,,,Its not just loyalty but still often necessity I love my steam deck but I also dont play a lot of games with anti cheat which pretty much require Windows,m0htwf8,4.0,1h6d85b

comment,m0k6n6h,RubberPuppet,,2,2024-12-05 16:34:54,,,,Its not about loyal to windows its about being able to play any of my games not just the Steam ones I can also use it for work while on the road even docked my legion go for 3 monitors like it was a normal laptop If Im paying that much as many options as possible is better for me I have games on GoG Battlenet gamepass the streaming gamepass games is great at home on my legion go,m0hraca,2.0,1h6d85b

comment,m0ilqpr,Tupperwarfare,,0,2024-12-05 09:51:32,,,,Im not buying a system based solely on specs The breadth of games intuitive user interface and stability are as important if not more so,m0i7p2k,2.0,1h6d85b

comment,m0iolzm,BrotherRoga,,1,2024-12-05 10:23:18,,,,In fairness you could probably install SteamOS on one of these so the interface breadth so on wouldnt be as relevant,m0ilqpr,3.0,1h6d85b
