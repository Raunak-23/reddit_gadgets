comment,m2ng5d8,chrisdh79,,105,2024-12-18 12:52:41,,,,From the article How do you fit 32 terabytes of storage into a hard drive With a HAMR Seagate has been experimenting with heatassisted magnetic recording or HAMR since at least 2002 The firm has occasionally popped up to offer a demonstration or make yet another around the corner pronouncement The press has enjoyed myriad chances to celebrate the wordplay of Stanley Kirk Burrell but new qualification from largescale customers might mean HAMR drives will be actually available to buy as physical objects for anyone who can afford the most magnetic space possible Third decades the charm perhaps HAMR works on the principle that when heated a disks magnetic materials can hold more data in smaller spaces such that you can fit more overall data on the drive Its not just putting a tiny hot plate inside an HDD chassis as Seagate explains in its technical paper the entire processheating writing and coolingtakes less than 1 nanosecond Getting from a physics concept to an actual drive involved adding a laser diode to the drive head optical steering firmware alterations and a million other little things that engineers spent countless hours developing Seagate has a lot more about Mozaic 3 on its site Drives based on Seagates Mozaic 3 platform in standard drive sizes will soon arrive with wider availability than its initial test batches The driver maker put in a financial filing earlier this month PDF that it had completed qualification testing with several largevolume customers including a leading cloud service provider akin to Amazon Web Services Google Cloud or the like Volume shipments are likely soon to follow,,0.0,1hh0wr7

comment,m2slsqm,danielv123,,3,2024-12-19 08:10:28,,,,Just like SSD new models are launched at equivalent or lower cost per tb as last generation because otherwise the market would just buy the last gen even with fancy technology The manufacturers know this nobody pays extra for not being proven just a small premium for density,m2pffbs,4.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2t05f4,Racxie,,-1,2024-12-19 10:53:18,,,,Of course and by the time the price of this comes down so will have the price of the larger SSDs making this less competitive Yes HDDs still have their place but with existing cheaper technology and maybe smaller businesses or enthusiasts but the bigger capacities speed and reliability will mean that larger entities are far more likely going to start picking SSDs over HDDs driving the price down even further,m2slsqm,5.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2tdfku,danielv123,,0,2024-12-19 12:53:23,,,,If the trend continues we may get price parity by 2030 That assumes we continue to see minor gain in HDD capacity though which hamr changes with promises of 50tb drives The multiplier has been about 5 since 2016 so I dont think SSD will overtake for quite a while yet,m2t05f4,6.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2pggxd,Derwinx,,6,2024-12-18 19:41:30,,,,I mean if youre looking to spend 50000 on a drive then yes theyre behind but for the consumer market the standard HDD drive size just hit 24TB so its a pretty big jump,m2oyd8s,2.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2nzt6b,asianlikerice,,31,2024-12-18 15:01:39,,,,Worked in the industry MAMR and HAMR were always a materials sciences problem and was always years away from being commercially viable We can get it to work for maybe a couple of hundred cycles but the heads always eventually burned out due the constant heating and cooling,,0.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2oh139,zeppanon,,7,2024-12-18 16:36:16,,,,That was my question thank you I have to imagine intentionally adding heat to the process would inevitably cause more rapid degradation ofsomething but Ill be honest Im an amateur as to the particulars lol Couldnt any materials breakthroughs that would allow for any product viability in this space also be used to increase the longevity of current drives Like I dont see the usecase of having more storage with drives more prone to failure but Im probably missing something,m2nzt6b,1.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2oi10a,asianlikerice,,12,2024-12-18 16:41:32,,,,The use cases I can see is that they use the drive for longterm storage for limited writes The work around was have two heads one for writes and one for reads and in the case of eventual write head failure you can still recover the data Again its been years since I was in the industry and it could have changed a lot since then but I didnt see any longterm viability based on what we had available at the time,m2oh139,2.0,1hh0wr7

comment,m2nlqlb,KrackSmellin,,14,2024-12-18 13:32:44,,,,So there is the problem A large cloud provider trusts and uses this Its consumers are not individuals its cloud Why does that matter Because they are known for large storage arrays that are built in climate controlled data centers massive airflow regulated power with a distributed file system that spans multiple drives and arrays for redundancy If a drive inevitably fails they replace it and nothing is lost No catastrophe no crying you lost the only digital copies of personal documents and pictures you scanned before you lost them in a fire none of that So I ask again Does the backing of a major cloud provider who already buys their hardware on the cheap from what others dont want to put into their cloud matter to me if theyve tested or certified it Not even in the slightest The reason is their use case and serviceability is VERY different than me as a consumer who relies on things to be VERY reliable and trustworthy as Im not charging someone else thru the teeth for hosting their data,,0.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2nnem9,tastyratz,,26,2024-12-18 13:44:03,,,,Those are reasons why cloud can afford to have failures more than consumer but cloud makes a great first step for field testing in bulk When they run thousands of drives out of a lab and start returning some of those on warranty those failures can be analyzed to make the technology more reliable further At the same point that doesnt have to mean those drives make sense for a consumer just like shingled drives never truly made sense for almost all end user use cases The trade offs just made the juice not worth the squeeze Of course I wouldnt go putting these in your desktop just yet even if for no reason other than Seagate holding up the rear on most all Backblaze reliability reports as a brand Id say this is a start in the right direction though,m2nlqlb,1.0,1hh0wr7

comment,m2nonoj,RunninADorito,,5,2024-12-18 13:52:25,,,,High drive failure rates are terrible Labor to fix broken drives is very limited If you have drives breaking at unexpectedly high rates you start running out of labor to keep up Cant have stuff randomly breaking at high rates and just call it ok Broken drives are a pain the in ass Then you have to try and wipe them which takes FOREVER with disks this big,m2nlqlb,1.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o1ceq,Pizza_Low,,2,2024-12-18 15:10:34,,,,Depending on the drive and what its storing you dont have to wipe it Massive file systems on drive arrays have no meaningful information as to what is stored on there The fat table or its massive file system equivalent is stored elsewhere on the drive arrays You cant even remove the drives and reinsert it in a different spot If you really need to they have degaussers and drive shredders And for massive data storage systems like Google or facebook have they dont even bother replacing a lot of failed drives Shut down that drive and leave it there till its time to replace the whole array,m2nonoj,2.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o3wtu,RunninADorito,,2,2024-12-18 15:24:59,,,,If youre a major days centre like were talking about in this thread you absolutely have to wipe it You have to write all 1s then all zeros It takes a long time Degaussing and just drilling a hole is not compliant with all sorts of regulations,m2o1ceq,3.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o4sxp,Pizza_Low,,2,2024-12-18 15:29:59,,,,Not drilling a hole and a failed drive you cant DOD wipe so it goes to a drive shredder,m2o3wtu,4.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o5cxv,RunninADorito,,1,2024-12-18 15:33:05,,,,Taking something to the drive shredder is even more work Lots of manual work and the custody chain proof and videos is tons more work than an online disk erase,m2o4sxp,5.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2qs0bb,--KillerTofu--,,1,2024-12-18 23:59:32,,,,Thats why they contract vendors who take drives in bulk provide certificates of destruction and recycle the materials to offset the costs,m2o5cxv,6.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2qs6n7,RunninADorito,,2,2024-12-19 00:00:36,,,,That had proven to be incredibly unreliable and doesnt meet certain government and fin regulations There are a surprising amount of escapes from those providers,m2qs0bb,7.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o54qn,ElusiveGuy,,2,2024-12-18 15:31:49,,,,The fat table or its massive file system equivalent is stored elsewhere on the drive arrays Sensitive data can be retrieved from unencrypted drives without any kind of external metadata Quite literally you can look for a BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY string and pull private keys from a data dump Even in striped layouts a lot of sensitive data is small enough to fit within a single The real defences are transparent disk encryption so the data actually written to disk is always encrypted and therefore completely randommeaningless without the keys and physical destruction the degaussersshredders as you mention The filesystem layout is a bit of a red herring for data security,m2o1ceq,3.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o3h7c,Starfox-sf,,1,2024-12-18 15:22:34,,,,If the drive is broken its not going to be wiped Large drive with selfencryption made wiping as simple as overwriting the onboard encryption key meaning the resulting data is useless esp if part of RAID56 array Any competent mfg has FFA Field Failure Analysis team to determine trends on why something broke,m2nonoj,2.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o4zt9,RunninADorito,,2,2024-12-18 15:31:03,,,,This is completely incorrect and violates all sorts of rules that data centers have for all sorts of customers Single encryption key deletion is specifically not permitted as they are issued by the drive manufacturers and inherently insecure Dual crypto with key deletion is going to be a thing but no major cloud provider has that in production yet,m2o3h7c,3.0,1hh0wr7
comment,m2o6rux,Starfox-sf,,1,2024-12-18 15:40:53,,,,I mean back before they standardized securitysecure erase they just put the drive through degaussers For some industries its more cost effective to ruin the product than it costs to resell it after following EOL But rules only matter when its followed Weve heard stories of buying eBay stuff containing previous users data,m2o4zt9,4.0,1hh0wr7

comment,m2q4ler,ungoogleable,,1,2024-12-18 21:45:34,,,,The reliability requirements for consumer products are much lower actually Manufacturers routinely dump drives that fail qualification with big customers on consumers because they know consumers wont notice Consumers barely use their gear in comparison to a data center If the drive slows down after 1000 hours of constant IO youll never notice but a data center will If you have to turn your computer off and on again every once in a while its not annoying enough to even bother figuring out the problem is the drive The rate of uncorrectable read errors might doom the data centers efficiency with constant rebuilds but doesnt affect you because you dont write enough data to hit it And if the drive failure rate jumps to 50 after 5 years of power on time it doesnt matter because consumers dont leave their drives on constantly and its long after the warranty has expired anyway That said I wouldnt be surprised if this never makes it to consumers Consumers barely buy hard disks anymore Flash is better overall cheap enough already and will only get cheaper HDDs are becoming a niche product with declining sales which will drive a feedback loop of increasing prices,m2nlqlb,1.0,1hh0wr7
