comment,mp0qbvv,RealPutin,,15,2025-04-25 19:07:06,,,,Honestly that specifically is why a lot of tech companies want local hardware that can run basic AI features Theyre bleeding money on cloudbased AI systems right now Basically in their mind they have evidence that consumers are using AI but they also know they cant bankroll that forever and theres a lot of research into lightweight AI systems I do remain unconvinced however that in the next few years well see a big uptick of NNs that need dedicated Neural processing units and cant just run on CPUs but arent too big to run locally on consumergrade devices Thats sort of the bet that these companies are making and I havent seen tons of evidence to substantiate it in the nearterm outside of maybe computer vision applications,moyr8j0,3.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mp0zee1,Loud_Ninja2362,,3,2025-04-25 19:53:14,,,,Were already building that for tons of applications Its an incredibly active area of research and development in a ton of industries Check out Executorch Apache TVM etc its being applied to more than just basic computer vision tasks even LLMs or other transformer architectures are being run on edge hardware,mp0qbvv,4.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp1r03l,TooStrangeForWeird,,6,2025-04-25 22:17:26,,,,Ive never heard of this before and I generally keep up pretty well but its a decent idea The only thing is that I dont see a ton of savings on the cloud side Sure your local device has the tokens but the main processing power is running the main model However with the sheer number of people using it it could actually add up a lot Just moving voice recognition alone to edge devices reduces a lot of load for both compute and bandwidth You may be onto something,mp0zp9r,5.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mp2svpc,Tired8281,,2,2025-04-26 01:57:43,,,,Out of the mouths of children I dont actually know what I am talking about I just always thought it would be cool if we could share compute resources between the cloud and whatever devices I have on me Sometimes I just have my potato phone on me but other times my laptop is idling in my backpack,mp1r03l,6.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mp7u7rb,TooStrangeForWeird,,2,2025-04-26 22:06:17,,,,Cluster networks are a thing and as far as phone laptop thats kind of a thing with remote gaming I have my gaming PC upstairs but normally just pop my phone into a controller and play games in my living room while using my PC to actually run the game So I can hang out with my wife while she crafts or watches a movie Theres no reason phones couldnt do that sort of thing to a laptop in your bag its just kind of niche Plus battery life issues of course,mp2svpc,7.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mp7wo2c,Tired8281,,1,2025-04-26 22:20:20,,,,I was thinking of it more as a paradigm Were increasingly surrounded by compute resources nearly all not optimally used for the benefit of everyone Itd be cool if we had less friction involved in sharing between them It could be useful for everything from offloading usage to edge devices to not having to worry what type of video stream I need to send to a strangers TV,mp7u7rb,8.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mpkxlnt,AkirIkasu,,0,2025-04-29 00:57:29,,,,I dont think thats why theyre trying to make less computationally expensive AI systems I think that these companies are more than happy to run those queries for you because it means that they will never run the risk of anyone getting their hands on their stuff and reverseengineering it or pirating it They just want them to be less resource heavy to make more money,mp0qbvv,4.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mpmghoa,barfplanet,,1,2025-04-29 07:40:35,,,,AI companies are very interested in shifting some of the compute onto customer machines I dont think these chips are going to be running open source local models nearly as much as handling the easy Copilot tasks so Microsoft can save on their power bill,moyr8j0,3.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mozmlkj,zushiba,,13,2025-04-25 15:54:36,,,,Besides for AI to be of any real use it has to be cloud hosted Local AI is good for a very few select operations and none of those are consumer facing Companies dont know how to market AI They see it as the next big ad platform instead of the tool it should be Its like Windows Search only they skipped the part where it was once good,moykfzy,2.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp0r06x,CocodaMonkey,,3,2025-04-25 19:10:34,,,,Personally I just turn off all internet search options in Windows itself I do agree that tying web searches to some local search boxes is annoying but the way you searched for files in Windows 7 and the way you can search for files in Windows 11 without using internet search is the same and will yield the same results You had do it it from file explorer in Windows 7 and it still works the same in Windows 11,mp0nojh,5.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp0sgkk,CocodaMonkey,,0,2025-04-25 19:17:56,,,,I turned off internet search years ago via registry edit in Windows 10 Ive upgraded that straight through to the current version of Windows 11 and internet searches have never been reenabled for me Ive had issues with other features being flipped back on but not with internet search Although its kinda moot for this discussion as internet search isnt part of file explorer so its still feature parity with Windows 7 as far as searching for files,mp0s0ug,7.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mp1rg36,TooStrangeForWeird,,2,2025-04-25 22:19:56,,,,Personally I just turn off all internet search options in Windows itself And this is why its better You had to modify it Sure its just a settings change but its NOT the default Windows Search The default that almost everyone uses is horrid You had do it it from file explorer in Windows 7 and it still works the same in Windows 11 No you did not It was included in the start menu You could just click Start and type something,mp0r06x,6.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mpil4wi,CocodaMonkey,,2,2025-04-28 17:28:26,,,,This is just getting even sillier MS DOS didnt even have a way to search for files at all You could print a list of all files and then parse it manually In fact the exact same search method is still possible today with the only change being its much faster then it was back in 1993,mpa2s63,5.0,1k7ihyx
comment,mpinudc,Freedomoffunk,,1,2025-04-28 17:41:27,,,,Fair point You are correct my friend That is just my memories playing up with age it seems God though I really dont remember earlier windows versions search being so inconsistent,mpil4wi,6.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp55798,ACanadianNoob,,3,2025-04-26 13:25:28,,,,At the end of the year we will get products with the Z2 Extreme processor Its essentially an HX 370 without AI cores so it will be priced a little cheaper Still has the Radeon 890M though My recommendation though is to just pick up a used ROG Ally with the Z1 Extreme for under 400 if you can find it either locally on FB Marketplace or shipped on eBay and add a 74Wh battery mod The 890M is only about 815 faster than the 780M in that You can also mod in a full size M2 2280 SSD if the SD card slot is broken on the used Ally and you need a storage upgrade and still spend much less than buying a new handheld right now I got an Ally X because I had someone gifting it to me but for anyone being budget conscious thats what I would recommend Also heads up sometimes the thumbsticks on the Ally and Ally X get wobbly and you have to add Teflon tape under the caps to get them to fit firmly again But otherwise its a great handheld,moz1khf,5.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp1q74n,TooStrangeForWeird,,5,2025-04-25 22:12:51,,,,I wish they would let you power down the NPU completely I know its probably not feasible to do without some sort of tradeoff theyre not willing to accept like an extra delay when using it because it has to pass a physical onoff gate or multiple but it would be cool Literally and figuratively cool since even at idle a core gives off some heat if its powered on So it would cool it down And figuratively cool because it would be neat I wish theyd just fucking knock it off already tbh stop wasting die space on bullshit hardly anyone uses Sure go ahead and research it make it available even But shoving it into EVERY processor is just a waste of everyones money,mp0riv9,3.0,1k7ihyx

comment,moyijcg,Edward_TH,,41,2025-04-25 12:24:15,,,,What big tech CEOs REALLY dont want to understand is that most AI tasks are divided in two categories menial stuff and hardcore stuff The former is what most end users do with AI the latter is experimental stuff research training and server end model running Hardcore stuff requires expensive very powerful dedicated hardware thats generally tailored to such uses and thats what AI data centers uses They do not benefit our even care in the slightest if a consumer piece of hardware has some parts optimized to run a bunch of AI related algorithm because the do not use them So an AI core on a desktop CPU doesnt sell to them Menial stuff can be either computationally not that intense and can run on general purpose hardware or computationally intense and so is mostly done remotely on the servers mentioned before which is what most people do So to them they present the choice of a cheaper CPU thats powerful for everything or a more expensive CPU thats marginally more efficient at something the user almost never does and less powerful across the board Integrated AI cores on desktop CPUs are useless marketing garbage Wanna justify the cost of development of those cores with a broader market Develop a PCIe daughter board or similar dedicated to such tasks for those that asks for it Oh wait those already exists its called ASICs Or GPUs if you wanna spend a bit less arguably and have something with a broader use,,0.0,1k7ihyx

comment,moytkb1,Edward_TH,,9,2025-04-25 13:29:20,,,,Thats my point either you want to do easy crap and you can easily do that on regular cores or your want to do hard shit and in this case no amount of desktop AIoptimized cores would fall in the consumer grade and price range These AI cores are built kinda like ASICs and as you see in the consumer market theyre either affordable but borderline useless CPU integrated cores or very expensive and still pretty underpowered for actually demanding algorithms for example nVidia Tensor Cores Right now if you want to run your AI you either do it locally on regular but very high end hardware with super limited capabilities and long and tedious training for the models do it locally on cheap CPU AI Cores with basically useless capabilities using super trimmed models that you didnt train anyway or you use a cloud model that you didnt train and have almost 0 knowledge of your local data but its capable and run on the proper hardware,moynu9n,2.0,1k7ihyx
comment,moz1oce,m0rogfar,,2,2025-04-25 14:12:39,,,,While you arent going to be running anything like ChatGPT on them the builtin NPUs arent useless due to a lack of usecases Theres been plenty of usecases for small purposebuilt models on phones and some of them also make sense on the desktop as seen on macOS The big issue that makes them worthless on a PC is that the PC software ecosystem excluding macOS has nothing that uses them because theyve never been there before and most PC software isnt brand new projects that target only the latest hardware I am somewhat sympathetic to the idea that you have to put new technologies into the chip before people use them to break the chickenandegg cycle though,moytkb1,3.0,1k7ihyx

comment,moz9xew,Edward_TH,,5,2025-04-25 14:53:27,,,,There is a usecase which is running certain type of algorithms Those that techbros vaguely call AI Those algorithms are actually pretty simple so a processor can be made to be able to run ONLY those calculations pretty efficiently and a fair bit faster by stripping a regular core structure of anything that is not used for them and reinforcing the parts that get stressed more Im over simplifying So why are those AI Cores so garbage in real world usage that people avoid them like the plague Because AI is much MUCH more than the simple set of base instructions What these cores lacks are DATA and TIME the algorithms are not static code but its code that takes data and a goal and tweak itself to achieve said goal by looking at the data it has This is called training and for these algorithms to be able to do what YOU want they need to be fed by you And this training is an iterative process every time you run it with new data it gets a little better at achieving the goal assigned but to reach a point where it at least gets close enough to the goal you need to run it over and over again because the tweaks are basically changing a variable a bit and trying again So you either run it sequentially or in parallel sequentially youre limited by the time needed to actually run it and in parallel youre limited by how many cores you can run at the same time so its both These consumer cores arent plentyful since they need to fit into consumer hardware enough to do the job alone so 999 of the work is done on data center hardware anyway And that would be acceptable but the more you want your model to be fluid and accurate the more variable it needs to take into consideration when it runs That usually is done by the algorithm itself by creating new layers on its own to more precisely tweak itself like you get a car to learn to drive At first you only have a switch as an accelerator so you either sit still or floor it so you put in a second 4 ways switch and next time you try your car you can sit still or go with the first and with the second tweak to 255075100 power so you have a bit more control Next time you add a third switch that can halve the actual power so you have now 3 layer with even finer control AI training works roughly like that but the more tweaks you have the longer it takes to complete a single run so these cores rely on trained model that have most of their granular control taken away to be able to run in a reasonable time These cores have use cases but right now theyre sparse super low capabilities cores that cant run ACTUALLY useful model on their own because they are vastly too demanding for them So they run models that are vastly overshadowed by cloud ones so people uses cloud ones because they work MUCH better And people that try and run those same botched models but on general purpose cores or on GPUs found that they run basically identically with only a minimal hit to efficiency So these cores serve no practical application as they stands CPU AI Cores will be useful once they either will able to run models way too complex for general purposes cores efficiently or be VASTLY faster and more efficient with current botched ones than GP cores are Once an AI core can run better with models that are 100200 times than what GP can run we can talk Right now theyre a waste of space and a detrimental marketing gimmick,moywp25,4.0,1k7ihyx

comment,mp3icd6,ShubhamDeshmukh,,1,2025-04-26 04:48:05,,,,Intel is limiting its losses by vastly limiting production of Meteor Lunar Arrow Lake because these are costly on TSMC They are still driving volumes on Alder Raptor because they are flooding the manufacturers with those low cost options for volume Intel 7 former Intel 10nm began with 9th 10th Gen CPUs hence selling since 2019 Basically Intels volume production cycle of latest nodearch is now vastly skewed compared to old times They marketed these new nodearch only to save their reputation in face of competition while this still being low volume very high prices Manufacturers hence are forced to sell older Raptor Lake due to the price difference Also Intel brands preference among public Its not that they cannot sell well And it has nothing to do with AI that is coincidental,,0.0,1k7ihyx
