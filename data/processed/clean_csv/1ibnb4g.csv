comment,m9mkzu3,None,,-2,2025-01-28 12:43:32,,,,I mean serious damage could be done with 180 A Pi and any DualShock 345 controllers and a sdd sell for a lot less As someone whos been emulating since snes9x the price point seems absolutely ridiculous for a console whose library is mostly already available on PSN or recently remastered I feel this is for someone who wants to pay 180 to plug in their old controllers to play Tomba For 180 Id probably crack or buy a cracked ps3,m9k89eb,1.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9nf1nd,sqparadox,,23,2025-01-28 15:35:04,,,,I tend to agree with you but retro gaming tends to fall into two camps modernizeimprove and exactly as it was Emulators are the modernizeimprove branch they suck at exactly as it was if for no other reason than they are emulated they will never be the same as real hardware This is very much for the exactly as it was people and they tend to be willing to spend more because the alternative is usually old consoles that are now rare and more expensive I think this is cool just for the fact theyre using an FPGA I see posts about all the hardware thats just running emulators and cant help but think whats the point I could do that myself,m9mkzu3,2.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9tp4cf,None,,3,2025-01-29 14:16:12,,,,I agree with exactly how it was until we get to the 3D era games like legend of dragoon look like crap,m9nf1nd,3.0,1ibnb4g

comment,m9pz3cd,zebrasmack,,2,2025-01-28 22:42:20,,,,Im guessing you arent a fan of console mods and would prefer to just emulate,m9mkzu3,2.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9tp70q,None,,1,2025-01-29 14:16:37,,,,I would love a modded 360 or ps4,m9pz3cd,3.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9q1wq5,zebrasmack,,17,2025-01-28 22:56:23,,,,For those that dont know this is not emulation Not in the way people understand it emulators basically take the code given to them by the game and translates that code to something modern your computer can understand Its essentially taking one language and converting it to another best as they can This is why some emulators struggle with certain games or aspects of the game like maybe the sound is messed up or theres not a slowdown where there was one originally Its an imperfect process Still absolutely brilliant what people have pulled off with emulation but it isnt the original hardware or software This is an FPGA FieldProgrammable Gate Array With an FPGA you can reprogram the chip to work however youd like as often as youd like Which means you can reprogram the chip to replicate and operate just like original game hardware and their various chip architectures in FPGA land we call these cores instead of emulators because they dont emulate the code they replicate how the hardware and chips worked in the original console So when you load a game using an FPGA you arent translating youre just playing the original game natively Now I glossed over a few things here and there but thats the gist of it,,0.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9qpwwn,SirPancakesIII,,6,2025-01-29 01:01:19,,,,This person FPGAs I use FPGAs all the time and never really thought about their application in console development Normally they arent used much because of the extra expense of them but can see the use case for something like this,m9q1wq5,1.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9sz1dy,connor42,,2,2025-01-29 11:15:47,,,,If this is the first youre hearing about gaming applications have a look at Analogues range of FPGA based consoles Also the very budget FPGBC FunnyPlaying GameBoy Color,m9qpwwn,2.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9zwgl8,Green-Salmon,,1,2025-01-30 12:08:30,,,,Would it be possible to change cores on the fly Kinda like retroarch can change its emulation core to emulate pretty much everything,m9q1wq5,1.0,1ibnb4g
comment,ma03ybu,zebrasmack,,2,2025-01-30 13:02:10,,,,yes the OS of the MiSTER lets you switch to a different core with a few button presses a far far faaaar easier to navigate menu than retroarch this particular fpga the MiSTER uses can only do up to the playstation the n64 and sega saturn The chip is not powerful enough to ever play ps2 or gamecube or dreamcast games so just be aware of its limits sega saturn support is playable but not 100 yet but should be in time but it can also do things like arcade machines and snes and older stuff provided someone has put in the major effort of developing and releasing a core this psx fpga is a modified version of his other product MiSTER Pi This product doesnt have a SNAC port but has a permanent psx SNAC ports which basically means zero latency when using psx controllers like original hardware,m9zwgl8,2.0,1ibnb4g
comment,m9jszkx,drmirage809,,11,2025-01-28 00:13:59,,,,Gotta love it having a design very reminiscent of the original PlayStation That thing was a bit of a clunky grey box but it worked The optional CD drive is very cool too Allows you to easily play your original games I can imagine that the motors in the original CD drive might not be in the best of health after 30 years,,0.0,1ibnb4g

comment,m9wz1oe,nicetriangle,,2,2025-01-29 23:28:20,,,,Was probably a Playstation Classic Sony released a mini PS1 that has like 20 games baked in and doesnt use discs You can buy one right now Its basically an emulator box with 20 roms officially sold by Sony,m9n4pas,3.0,1ibnb4g
