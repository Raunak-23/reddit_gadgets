comment,lxsvzt5,_gordonbleu,,23,2024-11-18 19:15:39,,,,I would pay 1000 dollars for a 4k TV with Apple TV integrated doesnt even have to be OLED or anything fancy Im tired of all the smart tvs that are absolute shit after a few years because the software is dogshit LGs webOS is probably the best and even then its mediocre There are zero smart TVs with decent software after 2 years Apple TV is a solid platform that gets updated and stays quick enoughnot laggy year over year Mine is 3 years old and doing fine Im sure there are many older that are doing fine All the android fanatics like to shit on Apple but if theres one thing they can do is build a platform that while possibly missing some features will operate year over year without massively slowing down or outright becoming unusable Roku is the worst example,lxsln7f,1.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxsy5u7,None,,27,2024-11-18 19:26:31,,,,What advantage is there over just buying any TV never connecting it to the internet and plugging in an Apple TV box that you can replace and upgrade over the life of the TV,lxsvzt5,2.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxt1wtb,Tasty-Traffic-680,,19,2024-11-18 19:45:26,,,,You underestimate how much people will spend to integrate the functionality into the TV and have a single sleek device Thats why smart TVs took off to begin with You have a single remote you dont have to worry if a device is plugged into the right slot no mess of wires no muss no fuss,lxsy5u7,3.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxtbwzu,TheUmgawa,,2,2024-11-18 20:36:28,,,,Yeah but Im not a fan of integrating the box because theres always an endoflife for the software upgrades where the processor cant handle new features Ive never used any of the smart features on my smart TV and it boots directly to HDMI 1 which my Apple TV is plugged into And when that Apple TV hits EOL Im buying a new model just as soon as they introduce any features that are worth having The model I have cant do Sing mode in the Music app but thats not a big deal to me and Im not replacing it for that But imagine if its something you do want and you cant have it because you bought an integrated system Now you have to replace the 1000 TV instead of the 150 box,lxt1wtb,4.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxtdos5,Tasty-Traffic-680,,3,2024-11-18 20:45:24,,,,What previous experience with apple would lead you to believe theyre going to prematurely abandon or nerf the product And what would stop you from just using an external donglebox once its deprecated You have an apple TV box You have a TV Why not an Apple manufactured TV Its going to have to compete and sell on total value not simply being an apple product,lxtbwzu,5.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxteng3,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-18 20:50:14,,,,Its not a premature thing Its just something that happens You know like how your iPhone 8 cant run the current version of iOS So unless the display was better than any other display I could get for the same price there would be zero reason to get an Apple integrated television Even Steve Jobs knew the TV market was a bad one to be in His exact words were The margins suck Apple makes 30 percent margin on damn near everything To compete in the TV game theyd have to make a third of that margin and theyd still be overpriced which would limit sales to Apple enthusiasts at which point a retailer could make more money by putting any other TV in that wall space TVs are just a crappy business to be in and Apple shouldnt be in it,lxtdos5,6.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxtgls5,Tasty-Traffic-680,,4,2024-11-18 20:59:58,,,,Its not a premature thing Its just something that happens You know like how your iPhone 8 cant run the current version of iOS So unless the display was better than any other display I could get for the same price there would be zero reason to get an Apple integrated television So what is any different with the TV you have today Like I said they would still need to be able to present a value to the market It would have to be competitive or better than other manufacturers for anyone to even consider it Even Steve Jobs knew the TV market was a bad one to be in His exact words were The margins suck Respectfully youre not arguing the same point anymore,lxteng3,7.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxttr5u,TheUmgawa,,-1,2024-11-18 22:06:33,,,,Because I do t have to pay twentyfive percent more plus whatever markup Apple would slap on it for having the Apple TV functionality built in for the same display I could get a really nice Sony for 800 or I could pay 1150 for an Apple unit where Id have to replace the box in three years Why pay the extra 200 Branding,lxtgls5,8.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxtutfg,Tasty-Traffic-680,,2,2024-11-18 22:12:11,,,,Then youre not the target market Its not even a real product Again THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPETITIVE ON PRICE AND FEATURES TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE I dont know how many times I need to say it,lxttr5u,9.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxuc0kk,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-18 23:48:19,,,,THEY WOULD NOT BE COMPETITIVE ON PRICE Seriously did I have to say that part in sign language or something The only way they would be competitive on price would be if they cut their margins to near zero and then you started complaining about me talking about margins Youre living in some kind of fantasyland if you think Apple would do that,lxtutfg,10.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxufcnq,Tasty-Traffic-680,,2,2024-11-19 00:07:38,,,,Based on what They currently have one of the best entry level desktops you can buy for 500 They make 30 of every app and media purchase It doesnt matter what the hardware costs to make as long as its not so far out of the ballpark that nobody can afford it like apple vision,lxuc0kk,11.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxujvpl,TheUmgawa,,0,2024-11-19 00:33:53,,,,Yes Im sure the 600 not 500 Mac mini will finally be the thing that causes the masses to buy Apple computers Surely it will be the thing that puts Macs in every office in America as well Oh wait that wont happen because people will say But does it play this game I want to play Does it run this software I need for work No Well then its kind of a paperweight isnt it And I dont think you grasp how people buy televisions They pick a size because they have limited space and then they shop based on cost Its a very different market from the rest of tech and youd know that if you ever sold them People dont pay retail price for TVs and they wait for TVs to go on sale Apple doesnt really do sale pricing so now the other TVs look even more attractive to the person who shops based on price Seriously go to your local big box retailer and ask them how many people they get who shop for quality who buy TVs when theyre not marked down a couple hundred bucks That guy will call his supervisor and then ask you to repeat the question and then theyll both laugh at you Also consider this Ive owned an Apple TV for about two and a half years How much money have I spent on it Zero But Apple gets thirty percent of your you might say but they dont because rational people do their subscribing on websites to avoid the Apple tax Hell isnt Disney or somebody taking out the option of inapp payment rather than take the 30 percent hit on their alreadytoosmall margins Theyll inconvenience people before they say Fine Well bill you an extra 30 percent because thats confusing to consumers and its really hard to explain to those people why their bills went up whereas just saying This is how its done now inconveniences the consumer for about five minutes So we can put that Sell it for no margin and make thirty percent on the aftermarket idea to rest If they want to make thirty percent theyre going to have to do it on the hardware,lxufcnq,12.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxukd1x,Tasty-Traffic-680,,2,2024-11-19 00:36:43,,,,Its already on sale for 500 from various retailers Either way they seem to be doing just fine without your money,lxujvpl,13.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxv1qmn,TheUmgawa,,-1,2024-11-19 02:17:38,,,,Yes because we should judge 90 percent of the retail year by what happens during Black Friday season And if you only knew how much of my money Apple has But just because I buy Apple products that doesnt mean Im a cultist who has lost all view of economic reality Thats your area Never mind that the lowest Ive seen the M4 mini going for is 549 which is 10 percent higher than 500 but weve already established that you have a loose grip on numbers,lxukd1x,14.0,1gubh8m

comment,ly1ga4o,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-20 02:58:36,,,,The only retailer that makes money in tvs is Walmart by selling the onn tvs Those suckers are supposedly stealing market share from tcl and Hisense 88 bucks for a 32 inch Cmon It is a steal,lxteng3,7.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly28tlq,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-20 06:31:50,,,,Walmart bought Vizio back in February for 23 billion dollars Youd think that a TV company as ubiquitous as Vizio would go for more money but the margins suck,ly1ga4o,8.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly3ry1r,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-20 14:40:26,,,,If Walmart gets approval to buy Vizio they will have the largest market share of tvs in the US Supposedly Vizio and onn rokus combined will have 65 percent market share in the country The margins for Vizio right now are very thin but if Walmart buys them out they instantly get logistical and marketing vertical integration Everybody always talks about manufacturing vertical integration at the hardware and software level but Walmart controls the delivery and the fees in the sales floor and its website Vizio and onn will be made by odms and I guess Roku will handle the software while all the costs associated with the delivery and fees will be reduced to nothing by Walmart Retailers charge money to sell product their stores Vizio doesnt have to worry about that with Walmart anymore Tcl and Hisense will just be colonies that design the blueprint for onn and Hisense tvs I cant wait for even cheaper tvs from Walmart Edit apple can make tvs if they want but realistically I just dont think they be can number one anymore ever in tv market share,ly28tlq,9.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly3xu47,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-20 15:13:12,,,,Being number one should never really be any companys concern if it means a line isnt profitable enough to be worth the trouble Macs have never been number one but the margins are high enough that its worth doing On TVs I cant see how that would ever happen because Apple could make displays with more pixels and charge a premium but its not like their 5K studio display because theres no content for a 5K TV and that would basically have to be a custom panel which is the reason the studio display costs five times what my 4K monitor does despite the fact that my 4K is 40 percent larger by area The studio display wouldnt be worth making at all if it wasnt something that video professionals could just expense when buying a Mac Studio or Mac Pro So they take that and then make it a million times worse because now theyre in large retail channels most of which wouldnt sell 1500 TVs Even if theyre five times better most people would still rather buy five inferior TVs or one TV and wait five years for the inferior ones to hit the point where theyre as good as the superior TV and then spend 300 on that,ly3ry1r,10.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly5nkgc,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-20 20:58:05,,,,The only only markets that apple has succeeded are in categories where there is an exclusive apple feature or a technology handicap or a duolopy If tsmc didnt rule foundry and if we had a 3rd or 4th mobile oses apple would not be as dominant as they are Smartphones are the center of most consumer electronics Speakers tvs cars smart homes desktops are not as tied to the smartphone,ly3xu47,11.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly61ivt,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-20 23:44:06,,,,If wishes were horses wed all be eating steak Alternative OS phones have come and gone over the years and so nobodys going to do it ever again Even Microsoft is never going to dip its very large toe in that water ever again If a chip foundry didnt cost ten billion dollars just to set up let alone deal with things like environmental regulations we would have more than just TSMC So you can dream What if but I try to confine myself to some semblance of reality,ly5nkgc,12.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly78f50,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-21 04:08:39,,,,Not many people paid attention to foundry a few years ago until maybe in 2022 I actually do expect more competition in foundry by 2030 The 3rd mobile can exist with more antitrust legislation,ly61ivt,13.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly7edki,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-21 04:50:47,,,,Theres going to be no antitrust legislation in the next four years so thats off the table at least in America and I think companies that would be broken up by the EU should respond by pulling sales and services from the EU It would be a massive hit to their revenues but it beats a breakup And as for chip foundries you have to hope theyre online by 2030 which I doubt is realistic because Chinas going to invade Taiwan ten or so years from now No matter which way that war ends theres not going to be any more chips coming out of Taiwan at least not for the western world,ly78f50,14.0,1gubh8m
comment,lyrs582,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-24 17:47:31,,,,My final conclusion is if google is forced to break up I can see Samsung fragment itself a part of Android and just follow the Huawei route and go in house on OS development I think Samsung having just Samsung apps and software is its destiny I have used Samsung email find find my device and browser and they are functionality great The problem is that Google has pre installed apps on their phones so why even bother with Samsung software Samsung needs to go all in on software and os development,ly7edki,15.0,1gubh8m
comment,lytfve9,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-24 22:57:48,,,,Sure until their OS gets so big that people moan that Samsung should have to divest itself of that part of the business courtesy of the very same people who caused it to come into being So no they really dont have to do that because whenever a company makes something really good people complain Why cant everybody else have that,lyrs582,16.0,1gubh8m

comment,lytu9ti,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-25 00:22:31,,,,Why would your device be killed Worst case Android would get spun off of Google and theyd have to raise the royalty per unit sold Really not a big deal,lytt34u,18.0,1gubh8m
comment,lyv7qk3,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-25 06:01:14,,,,Too many what ifs with Google Samsung at least is committed but they dont control the Os,lytu9ti,19.0,1gubh8m
comment,lyv9taf,TheUmgawa,,1,2024-11-25 06:20:26,,,,And theyre not going to for the reason I listed above And because its a money sink with little potential financial upside If they just fork Android theyre still going to have to pay a licensing fee for every phone If they build their own OS from scratch or just from the pure Linux kernel it would take years billions of dollars and then they have to try and get app creators to make apps for yet another OS and they need a lot of apps ready to go on launch day or the whole thing fails like the Windows phone meaning those billions of dollars were completely wasted And then theres sunkcost where users will be angry because the money they spent on the Play Store for years Thats all gone Its just a bad idea,lyv7qk3,20.0,1gubh8m
comment,ly3syvi,Realistic-Nature9083,,1,2024-11-20 14:46:14,,,,Walmart is a sleeping giant The logistical vertical integration is enough for them to take on anybody in consumer electronics Im surprised they havent made android phones or wear os watches They can really undercut the competition like Motorola and Lenovo,ly28tlq,9.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxtv2y4,_gordonbleu,,1,2024-11-18 22:13:35,,,,Thats essentially what Ive done now but there are still disadvantages with that The shitty tv software means it sometimes take a full minute before the tv actually turns on or god forbid I wanna chance inputs thatll take an additional 30 seconds If you push the wrong button it tries to pull up all the apps and shit and slows the whole thing down Most people I know have had an apple tv longer than their current tv,lxsy5u7,3.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxsx6ns,TylerInHiFi,,7,2024-11-18 19:21:37,,,,Its not that Apple is charging double its that the overall market is charging loss leader prices because theyre scraping your usage habits and using that data to generate revenue Its the same thing that console manufacturers have always done They sell you the console for less than it costs to make because theyll make their profits on every game you buy Except instead of games the TV manufacturers are selling ads Samsung has fucking banner ads built into all but their most expensive models Realistically Apple would sell a TV at roughly the same price that Samsung LG or Sony sell their more expensive sets which are still artificially cheap because they collect usage data to resell to advertisers Theyd also assume that a lot of people buying a TV made by Apple would also be paying for iCloud or AppleTV or Apple One and that would be the secondary revenue stream that subsidizes the TV itself Apple relies more heavily on selling subscription services than they do on scraping and repackaging your usage habits to sell to advertisers like the rest of the manufacturers of the products you mentioned Amazon loses money on every single Echo product they sell Google loses money on every Fitbit sold They do so because they know that more people will choose a lower upfront cost and that the larger their market share the more they can make from ad revenue and subscriptions Apple is a hardware company that offers subscriptions Amazon and Google are advertising companies that offer hardware Samsung is a data collection agency that offers hardware at least as it pertains to things like TVs,lxsmdnj,2.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxsnxmc,oboshoe,,21,2024-11-18 18:35:21,,,,i remember thinking the same exact thing about phones when it leaked that apple was working on a phone my thought was what could they possibly do better than what motorola is doing that question seems silly now but phones had plateaued for awhile back then i cant think of much to add to TVs either but if the industry was limited to my imagination we would be somewhere in the 90s,lxsm5eh,1.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxspbof,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,-3,2024-11-18 18:42:22,,,,Maybe you were just being a little shortsighted then Plenty of people were using full on PDAs with applications and touch screens and way more functionality than you could get form a phone at the time It was just a matter of time until someone merged PDAs Phones MP3 Players etc into one convenient device Sure Apple still gets appreciation for doing it well But its not as if it wasnt going to come in some form or another Maybe someone else would have take a few more years but it was bound to happen,lxsnxmc,2.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxstv7n,3600CCH6WRX,,6,2024-11-18 19:05:02,,,,Before the iPhone yeah devices like it already existed There were touchscreens PDAs phones cameras MP3 players and web browsers all rolled into one But what Apple nailed was the experience The iPhone was simple and intuitiveno stylus no tiny keyboard just a clean multitouch screen that actually worked well Other smartphones back then They felt clunky and overcomplicated Apple made something anyone could pick up and just get I dont think this was just something that was bound to happen eventually It wasnt just about the technology being there It was about the concept Apple didnt just build a better phone They completely reimagined how people could interact with one Thats the revolutionary part,lxspbof,3.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxsrc76,oboshoe,,4,2024-11-18 18:52:25,,,,Obviously yes I was one of those people using full on PDA and touch screens back then I was using a Palm 7 with wireless email all the way back in 1999 and I had been using a cell phone since 1987 Ive been an early adopter my whole life The case for a combined phone camera email mp3 player web browser just wasnt that obvious My Palm 7 Flip phone laptop mp3 player and pager all had their designated spots on my belt and laptop bag Its VERY easy to look back on things and say wow that was so obvious But usually its really not until someone comes along and makes it I wonder what will be obvious 20 years from now,lxspbof,3.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxt4z1p,None,,3,2024-11-18 20:00:53,,,,Yes TVs are one of the things that capitalism has managed to optimize the cost and delivery and even the processors inside Its all fucking cheap considering their size weight and components Monitors are not there yet Apple Displays are usually more expensive than their competitors they are also mostly better or have an unique offering But a 27 inch monitor despite being so easy to ship can cost the same of the same quality 4k 55 inch TV thats difficult to ship The differences on the low end have grown smaller with time However on high end equipment the difference is big A 32 inch Samsung OLED monitor is roughly the same price as a 65 inch OLED However when OLED or Mini Led monitors started coming out they were 2000 dollars and more expensive than their TV counterparts Price comes with innovation so in that sense the latest tech in Monitor comes later and you pay innovative prices for it even when its common on the TV market,lxt1gw6,3.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxt699d,None,,0,2024-11-18 20:07:29,,,,They dont need a TV but turning TVs into much more robust and interactive platform is a ridiculously huge and mostly untapped market Apple TV and Nvidia Shield or game consoles are only scratching the surface of what a 4k TV in most homes could really do It boggles my mind that the world most popular entertainment platform keeps getting overlooked since the computerinternetsmartphone boom After smartphones and cheap multcore chips flooded the market they should have been all over the TV platform vs thinking smartphones and VR are the future A TV has far more ergonomic and long term use potential than tablets or smartphones or even computers meaning you can get the users to sit there ass in front of it for far more hours per day on average,,0.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxtbk4y,IdealIdeas,,0,2024-11-18 20:34:39,,,,Why not just make an apple stick that can just make any tv act like an apple tv when plugged in It could just hijack all the tv features like settings volume wifi connectivity Bluetooth ect Like so long as you have the apple stick plugged in you could literally throw away the original tv remote and still have full and complete access to what the remote would have offered This even could be useful for people who have a tv that has a bricked OS but otherwise would work just fine,,0.0,1gubh8m

comment,lxszeav,MHWGamer,,-2,2024-11-18 19:32:42,,,,it is funny how many here think that apples costumers play in the same league as costumers for other brands It is literally the point of Apple to be a desireable brand first and foremost If they do a 20003000 Tv so many people will buy it just because apple is on it They can sell basically anything consumer tech related and succeed with the only exception being the vision pro ultra niche market for an ultra high price targeted mostly on consumers The problem is probably that it will be too much effort to cooperate and work the fab stuff when they just have to add another button on the iphone and everyone buys the new one,,0.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxuojgq,Straight-Ad6926,,1,2024-11-19 01:01:02,,,,Consumers are becoming more discerning and valuedriven Not everyone is willing to pay a premium just for the Apple logo especially when there are highquality alternatives available at lower prices The tech market is highly competitive and even Apple needs to innovate and deliver real value to maintain its market position The success of a 20003000 TV would depend on its features performance and how it compares to other highend options not just the brand name,lxszeav,1.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxuqk6w,MHWGamer,,1,2024-11-19 01:12:54,,,,that is such an insane take that I actually have to lol Like nothing against you but the sentence Apple needs to innovate and deliver real value to maintain its market position is irony gold with apples current iphone runup The iphone 16 is literally so not inovative that even apple fans say it is really lame this year And I bet that apple makes more margin than ever 23k high end tv at like 77 is pretty normal so Ive even gone that route for apple and not the 1000 bucks monitor stand route In a world where us teenagers still think that if you dont have an iphone you are broke you seriously come around and speak of apple people are valuedriven,lxuojgq,2.0,1gubh8m
comment,lxvv72r,Straight-Ad6926,,1,2024-11-19 05:37:29,,,,Dude even if the iPhone 16 isnt groundbreaking Apples innovation isnt just about hardware Theyve been focusing a lot on software and services which are areas where they continue to add value The ecosystem theyve built keeps users invested in their products So while the latest iPhone might seem underwhelming the overall value proposition of Apples ecosystem still holds strong for many users,lxuqk6w,3.0,1gubh8m
comment,lyi0g6o,MHWGamer,,1,2024-11-22 23:55:45,,,,what a cope lmao Havent read your answer completely before and extra went back after mkbhds new video about apple ai being ok but nothing special but that wasnt even your argument Who the fuck is talking about apples ecosystem the topic was about releasing new hardware without much innovation and people still mindlessly will buy it Iphone 16 as the literal prime example Hence Apple can just sell good tvs and they will sell with minimal innovation double oled like in the ipad might be a good call Again why do you go off talking about its ecosystem software and services when we all know it is good and doesnt CONTRADICT my statement A tv would literally broaden that ecosystem and is the thing that would make it so easy to sell the tv for a 500 special apple tax you are literally helping me by coping so hard that the iphone is lame af this year,lxvv72r,4.0,1gubh8m
comment,lyiyie1,Straight-Ad6926,,1,2024-11-23 03:40:29,,,,The point about Apples ecosystem is actually very relevant The reason people buy new Apple hardware even with minimal innovation is because of the seamless integration and the overall experience that Apple offers The ecosystem is a major selling point and it adds value to every new piece of hardware including the iPhone 16 People are not just buying a phone theyre buying into a system that works flawlessly together This is why even a TV with minimal innovation would still sell well cuz its not just about the hardware specs but the added value of being part of the Apple ecosystem That fact that you think it might seem like a cope to bring up the ecosystem just shows how uneducated you are when it comes to understanding why Apple products continue to sell so successfully,lyi0g6o,5.0,1gubh8m
