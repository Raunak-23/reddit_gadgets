comment,msyzt9t,GrynaiTaip,,1,2025-05-18 15:55:43,,,,I use M705 with my laptop its the best mouse ever because battery lasts for 23 years of daily use The first one has that same problem after about 5 years so I bought a new one That one lasted the same 5 years but now I bought new Omron switches instead of replacing the whole mouse,msxkwcm,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,msxsifh,Quithelion,,9,2025-05-18 11:26:50,,,,Meanwhile I periodically needed to pry open these Omron mechanical switches to rebend the metal piece so it become springy again and doesnt double click on single press I got fed up and bought Razers mouse with optical switches Works great with a few hiccup of not registering click Then the effing scroll wheel acting up because of its mechanical design which will rust or clogged with dust instead of Logitechs optical scroll wheel that worked well These mouse makers need to make up their effing mind when their gaming mice are now cost as much as mechanical keyboards from 10 years ago I dont need 1 million DPI I need a painless working mouse for the price I paid,msx8d0r,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,msy8zjr,crochettankenfaus,,2,2025-05-18 13:27:05,,,,you can replace the metal piece with one from a new switch so you dont need to solder a new switch in switches are 1 on aliexpress,msxsifh,2.0,1kpefz8

comment,msyozes,TrptJim,,1,2025-05-18 14:57:46,,,,At least Logitech is good on their warranty and lets you keep the old mouse I get a brand new replacement and then repair the broken one I have three G Pro 2s and only bought the first one,msxsifh,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,msy74k7,LOGPchwan,,3,2025-05-18 13:15:09,,,,Do you need solder or anything to replace mouse switches Ive had a 50 equivalent of local brand wireless mice for almost three years Its working very well so far but if the time comes and I dont want to switch I would like to know if soldering is necessary,msx8d0r,1.0,1kpefz8

comment,mszf9m1,iamacannibal,,2,2025-05-18 17:17:14,,,,Soldering is required to replace switches on almost every mouse There is hot swappable switches now but its still new and nothing mainstream has that ability I only know of one mouse that does Its super easy to replace switches though a 15 solder kit from amazon would have everything needed Each switch will have 3 pins You need to desolder the pins and most kits will come with 2 ways to do that either a plunger type thing that sucks the solder off once its hot or solder wick with is basically woven copper that the solder sticks to really well Both are easy to use Its a really good beginner project for soldering since its easy and you can learn a few different things when doing it,msy74k7,2.0,1kpefz8

comment,mt1m14n,ChefJoe98136,,2,2025-05-19 00:35:26,,,,Theres been a couple of ways to fix it I ordered a 10 pack of the same model omron switches off ebay many years ago and have used my soldering iron to heat up the old switch pegs while prying with an old soldering pick that came with my ancient radio shack soldering kit Then I put the new switches into the holes usually having to heat things up to make room in the hole and add a little fresh solder There were teardowns and instructions from others to help guide what model to seek out for switches Some folks have a solderless method that involves prying so switch case clips open up and then swapping out the internal leaf spring thing and reassembly I do not do that method,msydvtg,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt0i18l,Evocatorum,,1,2025-05-18 20:42:21,,,,Omron Thats the brand I was trying to recall for a different response so thanks,msx8d0r,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,msyfjbm,lordraiden007,,17,2025-05-18 14:06:35,,,,Id be happy if they just released a refreshed G600 Very few mice fit in its niche and their lack of production has made prices soar There isnt even a viable alternative on the market and hasnt been for over a decade Luckily the little bastards are robust and extremely resilient to failure but Im dreading the day that my mouse finally starts developing some faults because replacing it will cost hundreds of dollars,,0.0,1kpefz8
comment,mszk3ob,Ty_Lee98,,4,2025-05-18 17:41:47,,,,Yeah I seriously need another g600 refresh or a better alternative Something lighter better sensor and durable buttons Its just so useful,msyfjbm,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt2loxk,Disciple153,,1,2025-05-19 04:39:54,,,,Same here I started with the 602 and now I have the 604 Unfortunately the switches on my 604 wore out so I had to replace them If I wasnt so handy I would have either had to buy one used or buy an inferior mouse for my purposes,msyfjbm,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt8ir4l,DustyBottoms1111,,1,2025-05-20 03:12:32,,,,Yeah my g600 started having issues last year and I was lucky enough to find a good condition used one that I will have to hope lasts until they make a new model Really dont want to have to go back to the Razer Naga when I like the g600 much better,msyfjbm,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,msyfmru,darknezx,,49,2025-05-18 14:07:07,,,,My Logitech mice always failed around the 15 years mark with that frustrating click issue where one click became a double click sometimes Never buying from Logitech again,,0.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt09zmc,CelestialFury,,16,2025-05-18 19:59:42,,,,Its pretty crazy since I still have a logitech mouse from two decades ago and it still works great However Ive become a member of the dark arts of the trackball mice so it doesnt get much use anymore,msyfmru,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt0gktg,Berkut22,,8,2025-05-18 20:34:48,,,,My G502 started doing that so I bought replacement switches Then it stopped and hasnt returned Its been a couple years I like to think it realized I was going to open it up and operate on it and probably do a shitty job of it and that scared it straight,msyfmru,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt0gqp0,wreeper007,,1,2025-05-18 20:35:39,,,,Ive had several so far do that ended up buying new switches and just soldered them,msyfmru,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt2ldk8,darknezx,,1,2025-05-19 04:37:15,,,,Im a hardware repair noob so the thought of using a solder terrifies me Its a shame because those mice are still in my drawer and Id love to repair them myself but practically it feels like theyll stay broken for the next decade,mt0gqp0,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt2no9d,wreeper007,,1,2025-05-19 04:56:54,,,,I hadnt soldered for many years but it was a pretty straightforward process Luckily theyre punched through and not surface mounted so it was pretty simple,mt2ldk8,3.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt8j17z,omp_,,1,2025-05-20 03:14:34,,,,The same thing happened with both of my g203s The wheel on my steelseries didnt last very long either When my Asus allegedly Tuf mouse conks out Im just going to buy the cheapest Chinese mouse I can find on Amazon because brand names dont seem to matter much in mouse world,msyfmru,1.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt8x0oe,darknezx,,1,2025-05-20 05:03:51,,,,Thats exactly what I did The Chinese mice werent so great to hold but theyve been nearly indestructible And once it shows wear and tear I might as well buy a new one but mostly it doesnt get there because the build quality is decent,mt8j17z,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,msx8xwj,terrytek,,36,2025-05-18 08:09:23,,,,Ive only had one issue with my G903 double clicking but thankfully it happened within warranty and they sent me a new unit circa 2021 and it hasnt failed me since Still looks more or less brand new if a bit shinier thats it For an 80 dollar ambidextrous mouse I cant complain about durability a usb c charge port would be nice though,,0.0,1kpefz8
comment,msxjaw7,GravityRabbit,,15,2025-05-18 09:58:54,,,,Ive had this problem on all 4 of my previous logitech mice including the one Im using right now always outside of warranty I bought a new switch to replace it instead of buying a new mouse but havent taken the time to solder it in yet I wish theyd use higher quality switches,msx8xwj,1.0,1kpefz8

comment,msyh6s0,iswedlvera,,-2,2025-05-18 14:15:46,,,,Yes they use the cheap Omron switches made in china instead of the better quality Japanese ones Its not too hard to desolder and swap them out my g900 has been my daily driver these last 10 years and I had to change the switches 23 years ago to the Japanese ones Im still very happy with the overall quality of the mouse Switches are consumable products after all,msxjaw7,2.0,1kpefz8
comment,mt0gomd,Evocatorum,,1,2025-05-18 20:35:21,,,,The switches they use inside are or were anyway cheap to buy and replace Omrons They just require a bit of skill with a soldering iron and a couple of tools to pull apart the housing In fact converting the charger over to USBC isnt as difficult as one might think though making it look professional is something entirely different Edit for clarity,msx8xwj,1.0,1kpefz8

comment,msz7dm8,brickmaster32000,,20,2025-05-18 16:36:14,,,,You have to realize the difference in scale between people who spend time on their computer a lot and those that dont I would imagine that at the lower edge people who spend a lot of time on their computer probably put miles on their mice 10x fasters So your 2 years of gaming is going to be equivalent to something like 20 years of use for someone else,msyfll7,1.0,1kpefz8

comment,mt60h29,Oerthling,,1,2025-05-19 18:41:47,,,,Yes I standardized everything on USBC Same charger for everything no adapters I almost didnt buy the keyboard just because of the obsolete port Cheaper Its not like Im buying the things I already have some from other gadgets like laptops Also there is a variant of Murphys law where your first attempt to plug in a microUSB is always the wrong way around The bandwidth hardly matters to me Network connections are BT and WIFI Its mostly just charging Rarely for data transfer,mt04qnc,2.0,1kpefz8

comment,mt46wci,JoostinOnline,,2,2025-05-19 13:10:02,,,,One cable life man never going back But youre not really just using one cable are you Youve still probably got a dozen USB C cables one for each of your devices And if I refuse to support a manufacturer that cant do something as simple as keep up to date on their connectors Im not asking you to But its not really simple either You cant just swap out a micro USB and USB C connector That requires a board redesign and potentially a shell redesign Modern PCB manufacturering is rarely completely custom these days A board will be designed to work with a ton of different products for maximum output That means they only need slim margins to make a profit and in turn means a much lower cost for the consumer While the connector prices may not be that much difference in price its a lot more work and that costs money,mt40c0m,5.0,1kpefz8

comment,msyj7vl,uncoolcat,,2,2025-05-18 14:26:59,,,,Ive had issues with the past two or three iterations of the MX master but in my case taking them apart and thoroughly cleaning them fixed the issues that I was having a scroll wheel on two and thumb button on another I was convinced the scroll wheel was busted both times but turns out there was just a lot of compressed debris stuck under the wheel which was a total PITA to clean The thing that irritates me the most about the MX master 3 and 3s is the rubber eventually starts to wear away from the palm area and looks sort of like peeling skin and last time I checked replacement shells were between 2040 USD which is absurd,msxcpb1,2.0,1kpefz8

comment,msxnved,egnards,,1,2025-05-18 10:44:54,,,,I honestly hated the G502 series and had so many issues with different aspects of mine Originally bought it to replace a Rat7 mouse years ago because it was a less expensive take on a similar style Eventually ended up going back to a Rat6 only because I couldnt find a rat7 anymore The G502 just felt like a cheap 10 Walmart mouse dressed up in new pretty clothing,msx7tc0,1.0,1kpefz8

comment,mt0eog5,Noxious89123,,1,2025-05-18 20:24:49,,,,Actually the wired ones can experience the issue too Fundamentally the issue is caused by the mouse switches being used far outside of their specification They are designed for 5 volts and have a minimum current specification Because modern mice now use 33v logic it is easier to just run the switches with 33v instead of adding complexity to use 5v The current is also an order or magnitude lower than what the switches are designed for A very long video about it here but the most thorough analysis Ive seen on the issue TLDR the switches are being used out of spec and mouse manufacturers are too tight with money to want to design the circuits properly,msxkvpi,2.0,1kpefz8

comment,mt0hw4b,Evocatorum,,0,2025-05-18 20:41:37,,,,Theres a reason why a Forever Mouse doesnt exist Its the same reason why our dishwashers no longer use stainless steel springs in the water compartment or our dryers use sintered bearings instead of actual rollerbearings Planned Obsolescence It used to be a way of protecting industries and skilled labor thus ensuring that the craftsman have jobs while those skills are maintained that was the original argument However the Lightbulb conglomerates made short work of showing how that can be turned in to serious profit The moral of the story is if you want a Forever Mouse youll have to either find someone to make what you want or make it yourself Logitech isnt never going to do it,,0.0,1kpefz8
