comment,mqy9jyz,SpinCharm,,66,2025-05-06 20:48:29,,,,Not sure I see a use case for this You use this to identify where your stolen bike is Do you a call the police and tell them that its stolen and you know where it is after which they tell you they cant help wont help with such a minor crime or b take matters into your own hands and challenge thief andor den of thieves to try to get it back,,0.0,1kgca6s
comment,mqybbai,mattyhtown,,27,2025-05-06 20:56:37,,,,You can lose a bike too But ya thats kinda how find my iPhone works if your phone was stolen Had a friend have a phone stolen and i had to be his backup at the den of thieves location Some drunk had picked it up and thought it was his Could happen with a bike on a college campus easily too,mqy9jyz,1.0,1kgca6s
comment,mr9holp,GreggAlan,,1,2025-05-08 15:49:41,,,,If it made the bike impossible to use and somehow prevented many of its parts from being used to repair other bikes then itd be like enrolling it in Apple ID and Find My Device If Apple was really green their stuff would have a feature like Power Wash on Chromebooks where they have a built in secure erase that allows them to be used when the login isnt known unlike how everything Apple becomes an iBrick if you forget the password and arent the original purchaser with proof so you can go begging at an Apple Store to get it unlocked,mqybbai,2.0,1kgca6s

comment,mr0psqe,Banannarama21,,11,2025-05-07 05:37:45,,,,Sooo my bike was stolen and they were able to confirm it was my bike due to this tracker I filed a police report and my local stolen bikes fb group spotted my bike because I was posting real time images of its location They phoned the police the police called me back and then they retrieved my bike and delivered it back to me,mqy9jyz,1.0,1kgca6s
comment,mr1v3tv,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,5,2025-05-07 12:03:21,,,,I mean this is 100 going to depend on the police department for your area I had bikes stolen from my house called the police to report it Got a knock on my door about a month later police arrived to take a report in person And thats when I lived in the county with a much lower crime rate than the city I use to ride with a OneWheel group and one of our members got robbed at gun point for his wheel He called the police who did nothing of course One of the group members found the police camera that was on that block they got the cops to pull the tapes Sure enough the robbery was on camera including the license plate of the car Our sluth managed to figure out who the person was for that found his Facebook profile where he was trying to sell the stolen OneWheel Also pulled the background on the guy turns out hes wanted for some gun crimes They took all this evidence to the police name address contact info from the ad where hes trying to sell the stolen goods Cops refused to do anything with the information,mr0psqe,2.0,1kgca6s
comment,mr71nkd,RegulatoryCapture,,2,2025-05-08 04:56:15,,,,Sounds about like my experience with the police and a stolen bike You can literally do the all the detective work for them and they still wont do their jobs in many departments I live in a small town now and I think they would help but I wouldnt be terribly surprised if they dont,mr1v3tv,3.0,1kgca6s

comment,mr299bl,hertzsae,,4,2025-05-07 13:29:08,,,,SB 553 is focused on protecting employees The bill does not prohibit employees from stopping theft It does prevent employers from asking nonsecurity personnel to confront a person involved in criminal activity We dont want rank and file employees to be forced to place themselves in harms way Did you read the article you posted It doesnt seem to do what you say it does Im sure the news source you first heard about it from greatly distorted its presentation to fuel maximum outage though That seems like a pretty good law to me,mqzy89e,3.0,1kgca6s

comment,mr1jvfu,sorrylilsis,,2,2025-05-07 10:39:08,,,,I live in a city with a huge biking population and a huge bike thief problem Me and most of my friends have airtags on our bikes We got back a stolen bike twice using it both time cutting a lock that the thief had used to park the bike a couple km away Mind you in both cases we found out that the bike was stolen very shortly after it happened,mqy9jyz,1.0,1kgca6s
comment,mr26hf2,Electrical_Style8094,,2,2025-05-07 13:13:32,,,,I have one can be placed discreetly and you can track location via the app and apple find my if somebody touches and moves your bike you can set it so a very loud alarm sounds if the tracker moves from the location from where you armed it you will get a notification so you know in real time when somebody is fucking with your shit,mqy9jyz,1.0,1kgca6s

comment,mqzgvjm,thirdtryacharm,,0,2025-05-07 00:40:10,,,,I went to an Etta James concert one time and locked my bike up It was a road bike that had a kangaroo on it I left the concert and saw that my bike was gone A few weeks later I saw my bike and some dude on it and tried to take it back and all of a sudden he had three other degenerates behind him and I didnt like those odds A few weeks after that I saw my bike again and the same guy riding it and he was carrying a bag of plastic bottles and I guess wherever he is on my stolen bike 20 years later I wish him the best Bike theft is a part of ownership,mqy9jyz,1.0,1kgca6s

comment,mr0dlkg,kitkatfitfat,,8,2025-05-07 04:00:02,,,,I will say that I had this installed on my bike mounted under a bottle cage so kind of hidden The alarm could be louder and it only alarms on your phone if youre within Bluetooth range which is comically short My bike was stolen I used it to locate the rough area it was in the police actually came to help right away when I called the non emergency line and they were like yeah were pretty sure which house it is and recovered it for me So I gotta give it props for that Thieves know about AirTags and theyre easy to find and toss But with this thing the crackhead took extra long to get the alarm off the bike due to the non standard pattern the bolts use and also the fact it was hidden The alarm was not activated at the time he stole it and probably for the best because he would have known to take it off before he got to home base and I wouldnt have known where to go looking for my bike,,0.0,1kgca6s
