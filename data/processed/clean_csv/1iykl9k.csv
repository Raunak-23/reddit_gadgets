comment,mf1xt7r,ACanadianNoob,,1,2025-02-27 11:30:28,,,,If your battery bulges even a little bit replace it immediately Dont wait for it to bulge so much it inconveniences you Its a fire hazard the moment it starts to expand and should be buried in a bucket of sand until it can be disposed of,mex2ic4,3.0,1iykl9k

comment,mewsvuc,Outrageous_Article87,,5,2025-02-26 16:43:14,,,,I got a spicy pillow on my HP work laptop a couple years ago It also happened on an Alienware laptop after I gave it to my nephew But I still think Razer gets them more Super slick looking laptops though I dominated some great WoW raids on a Razer Blade back in the day,mewnb2a,3.0,1iykl9k
comment,mewte6j,Spotter01,,2,2025-02-26 16:45:39,,,,I still Love my 2022 Razer 15 its just a couple grams lighter now that I turned it into a quasi desktoplaptop where now it just runs off AC It only just recently got a spicy pillow but Im still thinking if its worth replacing if its just gonna happen again if its the same lithium chemistry from Razer,mewsvuc,4.0,1iykl9k
comment,meww6b6,Outrageous_Article87,,2,2025-02-26 16:58:34,,,,Yeah I think 15 is still a weird place to go without battery but if I bought an 18 I would probably leave the battery out of it and solely use it as a desktop replacement that I can take with me sometimes,mewte6j,5.0,1iykl9k
comment,mewonh9,sargonas,,5,2025-02-26 16:23:28,,,,Same over the last 20 years Ive probably owned around 15 laptops between personal and work uses Five of those were razers and all five of those are the only ones to ever get spicy pillows,mewnb2a,3.0,1iykl9k

comment,mewtp6r,Rdub,,1,2025-02-26 16:47:04,,,,I worked at a company that bought around 20 Blade 15s around 5 years ago literally every single one of them suffered from battery bloat within a year of purchase My specific laptop had 4 batteries bloat in 3 years Never had battery bloat issues on any other laptop Ive ever owned and Ive also owned maybe a dozen over the years Razers battery issues are well known and much much worse than any other laptop manufacturer,mewnb2a,3.0,1iykl9k
comment,mex369m,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-02-26 17:31:22,,,,That is crazy same here Well not 1525 but at least 10 And probably 4 more my wife has owned Only my 2019 Razer had to have the battery replaced not because it was dead but because the trackpad couldnt be pressed down I was shocked to realize the trackpad was fine it was the battery,mewnb2a,3.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevmmtr,AmNoSuperSand52,,6,2025-02-26 12:59:44,,,,Nah thats mostly specific to Razer,mevhvmh,2.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevmrr9,HeftyArgument,,-1,2025-02-26 13:00:39,,,,every lithium ion battery has the potential to become a spicy pillow,mevmmtr,3.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevn0xu,AmNoSuperSand52,,15,2025-02-26 13:02:20,,,,Agreed but only Razer has the poor enough QC to have a 96Wh battery swell so much that it pops your trackpad out of the chassis They cost way too much for this to be a reoccurring issue,mevmrr9,4.0,1iykl9k
comment,meyapzf,podoka,,5,2025-02-26 20:51:29,,,,Thats actually really common with HP and Dell laptops as well I work in IT and deal with inflated batteries regularly,mevn0xu,5.0,1iykl9k
comment,mexf9dn,Tabs_555,,1,2025-02-26 18:27:22,,,,This happened to me with my Razer Blade lmao Never buying razer again Sucks theyre a cool brand with fun products but every single one of the products Ive bought from them breaks within a year or two,mevn0xu,5.0,1iykl9k

comment,mevleng,norse95,,29,2025-02-26 12:51:39,,,,The Blade gets a lot of hate online some warranted it sucks when they have issues but I havent had any issues with mine and I love it,,0.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevoguy,Shosui,,12,2025-02-26 13:11:34,,,,Same here Got a 2020 model right when Covid first hit to use for work as well as light games and its been great overall The metal body feels leagues better than the plastic casings and textured rubber It was easy to upgrade and the battery lasts surprisingly long for nonintensive usage Its been one of the best laptops I have owned to date,mevleng,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mewklp6,manicMechanic1,,6,2025-02-26 16:04:10,,,,I have a 17 Blade Pro and its been the best pc Ive ever had Never had a problem with it,mevleng,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mewx2g3,Demented_Alchemy,,2,2025-02-26 17:02:47,,,,I have a 15 from 2021 and I love mine havent had any issues but I dislike the lack of driver downloads Razer expects you to use windows update for drivers which is ehhh at best Intel has an update tool as well but thats only for Intel products Im sure theres microcode patches that need to be put out that Razer simply isnt and its that aspect that bothers me about Razers product support I have a dell xps thats constantly betting bios updates and various patches left and right,mevleng,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mf16oma,Chav,,1,2025-02-27 06:59:05,,,,I have the 15 from 2020 it was great then saw it sitting at a crazy angle because the battery bloated enough to pop off the screws and bend the bottom casing,mewx2g3,2.0,1iykl9k
comment,mez89o4,borninamsterdamzoo,,1,2025-02-26 23:32:56,,,,Mine had a terrible noname SSD that was glitchy and slow and died after 2 years Ever heard of Liteon SSDs Yeah me neither Not something youd expect inside a 3k laptop,mevleng,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mev5fwv,Kiflaam,,31,2025-02-26 10:42:49,,,,in my experience heat management becomes difficult once you get over 1200 dollars or so for a laptop Gonna have to listen to that fan 247 for 2400 might as well get a nice PC and why is that keyboard all scrunched in the middle Honestly I wish they would just offer laptops without the track pad so the keyboard is up front and more usable The track pad could just be a usb peripheral or something maybe even have a little cargo section in the bottom to store it,,0.0,1iykl9k
comment,mey4dcd,seiyamaple,,11,2025-02-26 20:22:41,,,,for 2400 might as well get a nice PC Someone choosing a laptop to game on instead of a desktop isnt doing so because of price This statement makes no sense,mev5fwv,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mey5mwp,Kiflaam,,-6,2025-02-26 20:28:23,,,,I disagree I think it makes sense I am presenting an argument that dissuades going for highend laptops for gaming At such a pricy investment especially since I have experience going this route I am recommending against trying to have both portability and highend gaming and instead just get a desktop If they want to do it anyway if portability is required alongside highend gaming then they should get ready for a wellknown problem with laptops,mey4dcd,2.0,1iykl9k
comment,mev85bv,Bloody_Sunday,,9,2025-02-26 11:08:25,,,,From a noise perspective any heat management for a discreet GPU in a laptop becomes an issue It doesnt matter if its below 1200 or not It will get hot with a newish game the fans will start reaching their max rpm Its just the heat dissipation physics at work in the case of such a tiny space filled as tight as possible with components So headphones are mandatory if it bothers you What I personally do to help my own oldish 2060 laptop is 1 set the fans at max 2 use an elevated cooling pad with two big quiet fans 3 optionally use headphones noise cancelling helps but not strictly necessary Ive grown accustomed to the fan noise and its not so loud In everyday browsingOffice work its very quiet and the fans are working on normal,mev5fwv,1.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevg5bu,Nightshade-Dreams558,,3,2025-02-26 12:14:49,,,,My wife got a 3060 laptop back in 2020 and it heats up so much you cant have it in your lap at times It works fine but it gets hot as hell and loud,mev85bv,2.0,1iykl9k
comment,mevnhg2,Bloody_Sunday,,4,2025-02-26 13:05:17,,,,Unfortunately this is very true Even new gaming laptops can be an instaforget for using on the lap They can get very hot and not just when gaming,mevg5bu,3.0,1iykl9k

comment,mewpehv,gamerfiiend,,2,2025-02-26 16:26:58,,,,I have the mini led razer with 4090 and the dual mode display in it is okay I never use the feature its a little annoying when you unplug or plug the laptop in it swaps It also had a ton of issues in the first year lol like screen not working or just static I think they resolved most of it tho,,0.0,1iykl9k

comment,mezqsex,IAmWeary,,1,2025-02-27 01:13:37,,,,I took a look at this earlier today They want 1400 to go from a Ryzen AI 9 365 to a HX 370 on the new Razer Blade 16 400 to go from a 5070 Ti to a 5080 and an insane 1400 to go from the 5070 Ti to a 5090 700 to go from a 1TB to a 2TB SSD 1800 to go with a 2x2TB SSD option from the single 1TB 400 to go from 32GB to 64GB of RAM Their BTO price gouging could give Apple a stroke Jesus Fuck its laughably grotesque Who the fuck is buying this shit,,0.0,1iykl9k
