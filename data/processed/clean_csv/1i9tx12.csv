comment,m956o2f,SsooooOriginal,,207,2025-01-25 19:48:13,,,,From the little I have gleaned of how they use tech over there Indians use their phones for everything related to IDs and other paperwork type stuff I know plenty of people here try to do the same already I hate how quickly we are pushing sensitive info onto insecure devices so casually,,0.0,1i9tx12
comment,m96ez6n,UnkindPotato2,,87,2025-01-25 23:40:07,,,,I dont give a shit what the app is I want nothing but the OS and the app store installed on my device when I buy it Honestly I dont even need the app store you can just sideload if you decide you want it When it comes to government apps I definitely want that shit off my phone The government can send me whatever I need as a hard copy and thats perfect Anything that must be kept secure must be kept offline,m956o2f,1.0,1i9tx12
comment,m96r16l,SsooooOriginal,,16,2025-01-26 00:47:34,,,,Cool anyways India has already pressured Apple on making the devices on their soil this is just further action by their conservative government The fact that people are already comfortable and fine with using their phones exactly in the way you dont like means this will lilely happen and become normalized I dont like the lack of privacy and security with tech but we are too late to effect change Any device with an internal battery and communication capability is compromised by state level acessibility by now And rather than work to fix this the people benefitting from it have successfully gotten many people hooked on lines like so you just gonna be amish or wut And people lile you and me knee jerk whining about wanting pure devices when those do not exist in practicality,m96ez6n,2.0,1i9tx12
comment,m977ekj,UnkindPotato2,,5,2025-01-26 02:21:20,,,,I mean I care about government survailance but honestly youre right that avoiding it is unattainable They can motitor your device without installing anything locally its more of a bloatware issue Furthermore its generally more concerning to me that people who arent the government can access my sensitive information contained on government applications that are preinstalled and cant be uninstalled without taking some pretty drastic pain in the ass measures,m96r16l,3.0,1i9tx12
comment,m9783sb,SsooooOriginal,,3,2025-01-26 02:25:24,,,,You are not wrong we are just unfortunately a minority amongst the masses that are largely ignorant of any potential dangers and risks from sensitive information processing apps being placed in devices as default I care about thenprivacy and safety ramifications as well as the gross bloatware restricting devices we are supposed to own but in reality we lease all the software and hardware,m977ekj,4.0,1i9tx12

comment,m95try3,None,,3,2025-01-25 21:45:24,,,,Safety is just perception SS numbers in the US were never meant to be secure and private yet here we are treating them like lock and keys to our private life Nothing is safe nothing is secure Were just using rocks and sticks out of fear instead of lasers When my state lets me use my ID on my iPhone instead of my plastic shitty one Ill be happy Instead of being afraid of the future we should embrace change and fight for actual security and repercussions when its broken,m956o2f,1.0,1i9tx12
comment,m9900sh,JSoppenheimer,,3,2025-01-26 11:13:55,,,,Im not even American but the part about social security numbers feels eerily familiar But yeah trying to keep those numbers secure is inherently a game that is doomed to failure through inevitable security breaches and worst of all you cant really do much to protect yourself against that Weve already had cases where those numbers were stolen through either health service or vehicle registration databases So its kind of maddening that there isnt a stronger push to demand stronger verification procedures in place of asking social security number,m95try3,2.0,1i9tx12
comment,m95x1se,SsooooOriginal,,-7,2025-01-25 22:02:22,,,,Continuing to put the cart before the horse and expecting that to work is asinine We are here because we embraced the future with no regard for security or repurcussions,m95try3,2.0,1i9tx12

comment,m9ge5t4,ReallyRecon,,1,2025-01-27 14:21:10,,,,Why do we draw the line at insecure mobile devices when we already store this information on insecure desktop and laptop devices I think an iPhone with its encryption and fullytransparent app permissions is a bit more secure than the average home PC,m95x1se,3.0,1i9tx12
comment,m9h2r13,SsooooOriginal,,1,2025-01-27 16:25:08,,,,The phrase cart before the horse is going over some heads As far as the phone you dont have the home pc with you everywhere you go The home pc is not necessarily more secure which is another instance of the cart before the horse But the home PC is not as highly competent as an observational vector like a compromised phone can be I am not arguing anything is secure I am arguing that is exactly the problem that needs to be dealt with rather than blindly charging on with little care of consequence and fully ignoring lessons we have already paid for in blood The government is aware That is why fed computer skus will be the no wireless comm builds because no PC with wireless capability is secure anymore You truly believe your iphone encryption is actually useful,m9ge5t4,4.0,1i9tx12
comment,m9tw9sx,ReallyRecon,,1,2025-01-29 14:54:44,,,,Yes I think its useful Most consumers dont have any reason to fear someone trying to physically or remotely extract data from their device Its an effective deterrent The software crack that the FBI bought from Israel years ago to bypass iOS encryption cost 13 million The tools they use today to try to extract any usable data rarely work on the newer devices running iOS 18 You say nothing is secure but I dont really see any evidence of that Most peoples biggest concerns are their browsing habits and voluntarily giving up information because they dont know any better and thats not a device security issue,m9h2r13,5.0,1i9tx12

comment,m98j1s0,iamjkdn,,-37,2025-01-26 08:21:47,,,,You are an idiot if you think democracy means forcing Apple to install Indian apps Edit Not replying to all you idiots about democracy i guess snowden didnt teach anyone the overreach of govts in the name of democracy This is just bonkers,m95ymez,2.0,1i9tx12
comment,m98kg3e,TimmyMTX,,20,2025-01-26 08:35:57,,,,Youre missing the point they said being a democracy doesnt affect this decision You could democratically elect a government that promised an app on every smartphone hell you could vote for it to be written into your constitution,m98j1s0,3.0,1i9tx12

comment,m98lvc4,TimmyMTX,,9,2025-01-26 08:50:33,,,,With democracy government is by the people either directly or by their agents under a free election system Thats literally all it means The people can choose whatever batshit rules they want you can democratically decide to ban eating fruit for breakfast forbid any form of communication that isnt overseen by a censorship committee or just to install cameras in every bathroom Doesnt matter what the rule is democracy means it was decided by the people directly or via elected representatives rather than a monarch a nonelected president for life or any other number of cracies Just because you associate democracy with freedom doesnt mean the two concepts are logically the same,m98l46w,5.0,1i9tx12
comment,m990rzg,DeadEye073,,7,2025-01-26 11:21:20,,,,If there are 10 people on an island and 9 decide that the 10th should be beaten to death is cruel the majority literally just elected a cruel decision but since the majority decided to do it makes it democratic Just because its bad or unmoral doesnt make it less democratic,m98l46w,5.0,1i9tx12
comment,m98m5c0,JudgeFondle,,6,2025-01-26 08:53:23,,,,Imagine this A nationwide vote wherein a proposal is voted on by the people for the people and that proposal is to have this government app pre installed on phones Is that what happened No But pretending democracy and surveillance are two mutually exclusive things is just being dense Indias elected officials may be implementing policy you dont like but theyre still democratically elected,m98l46w,5.0,1i9tx12
