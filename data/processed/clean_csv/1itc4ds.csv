comment,mdolq29,tastyratz,,-5,2025-02-19 20:53:20,,,,I mean people are really picking apart the tiny what if details of the possible scenarios when I gave very off the cuff broad examples This is the end all device for people who just want a phone that will be charged and available when they need it compared to other retail market options without extra hassle Its not because they genuinely need 6 months of standby in most cases Its overkill battery insurance for people who constantly find a dead phone they have to keep topping off that they dont use on a day to day basis If you wanted a phone you didnt have to deal with or worry about charging all the time then this fits that bill I can find other ways to charge it does not Edit I dont really know what is so controversial here about people buying a phone with the biggest battery possible when thats their priority in buying a device You could always use a portable battery bank is the same argument for phones with 12 hours battery life too Its about your priorities and use case If you want to use a battery bank do that,mdojq3n,8.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdo76k5,rnilf,,4,2025-02-19 19:48:52,,,,It would be horrible for those use cases Anyone with a survival mindset who has a bugout bag would avoid single points of failure and this thing is as singular as it gets If one component breaks you risk losing functionality of the whole thing Its far better to stay modular not buy this,mdo4lvz,3.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdoj6ds,tastyratz,,0,2025-02-19 20:42:09,,,,I mean sure thats something anyone can do they can go out and get a battery bank and charge as needed In an emergency scenario thats a cumbersome but available option This is an expensive luxury but if you were paying for a phone on a standby line its being sold at prices comparable to a mid tier alternative phone and still serves a dedicated purpose better If youre trying to procon it against using a cheap battery bank youre probably not the target audience,mdohw3a,4.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdokyme,tastyratz,,1,2025-02-19 20:50:02,,,,Depends on if you can afford to just get a phone you wont have to worry about charging more than once or twice a year and dont want to mess with extra third party accessories in the event of an actual emergency If you were already going to spend 900 on a new phone and it was going to forever live somewhere that isnt your pocket it might just be the better choice Regular phones even powered off still drain power and you find out they are too dead to use when you need them This phone has an overkill battery but its still just going to work when they need it That peace of mind carries value when its a backup you buy for peace of mind,mdok0r8,6.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdq20tz,CMDR_KingErvin,,2,2025-02-20 01:10:32,,,,Not sure what youre up to that you need a bugout bag to disappear at a moments notice lol but if your cover is burned and you need to run just get a couple of battery charger banks and youre set You dont need to carry around a literal brick of a phone Even if this is somehow a real problem for some people theres zero market for it as the vast majority of people dont need to store a separate phone for 6 months for some whatif scenario,mdo4lvz,3.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdq393n,tastyratz,,1,2025-02-20 01:17:19,,,,I dont need a bug out bag lol I just rattled some scenarios where someone might want this phone Everyone is trying to tell me why I dont need it I dont lol I can see a market for though for people who just want a phone they never have to worry about charging if they dont care how bulky it is its really just that simple,mdq20tz,4.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdqs8tx,dontbajerk,,1,2025-02-20 03:41:34,,,,Even if this is somehow a real problem for some people theres zero market for it as the vast majority of people dont need to store a separate phone for 6 months for some whatif scenario Similar phones have already sold a fair bit this isnt a new category Its definitely quite niche but the niche exists,mdq20tz,4.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdqn1l8,dkadavarath,,2,2025-02-20 03:10:17,,,,There would be a bunch of conversion loss and duplicate circuitry in your proposal Itd be bulkier and more fragile due to the dangling cables If you go wireless then theres more losses and heat to deal with If you 3D print something to hold everything together itd all get more bulkier So overall this phone solves a niche Maybe not for you but for someone out there I personally would like to have this on the weekends,mdoduwv,4.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdrqcs2,ctzu,,5,2025-02-20 08:12:07,,,,It doesnt have an objective advantage over other solutions for any specific purpose Its a somewhat unique gadget for people with an affinity for gadgets money to spare and a usecase in their life Im not even thinking about buying it but Im really happy about things like this being released because bringing up something new in the stale smartphone market might lead to actual innovation like significantly larger batteries or maybe usable projectors for once instead of the usual We made our fartphone 29 05 thinner it has a 100 mAh larger battery than last year and we crammed some AI crap into it for only 1000 that we get yearly from every company,mdnww7g,1.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdr7j6s,nnomae,,4,2025-02-20 05:25:15,,,,I have a Doogee VMax Plus which has a 22500mAh battery and I love it Yeah its a brick but I have to charge it less than once a week and thats with two small kids watching hours of video on it a day The big advantage you get with a single device over a combination is that you never have to worry about power If Im going away for a few days I dont need to bring anything other than my phone I dont need to worry about chargers power outlet types connection cables battery packs or anything else I can happily go away for a week with none of those things and still not be concerned about whether or not streaming a bunch of stuff is going to cause me to run out of battery Now the phone itself has a few issues the main one being that fast charging doesnt seem to work which means a full charge takes about 9 or 10 hours Ive been onto them about it but Doogees customer service is garbage tier to say the least but other than that it works fine the side button is good but tends to activate when you dont want it to but those are device issues separate from the battery life I dont see myself ever going back to a phone that doesnt have long life batteries It just removes a few of those small daily annoyances and thats worth so much more to me than the minor inconvenience of lugging it around Also your point about a separate battery bank avoiding a single point of failure here doesnt apply If you are depending on having a working phone a working charging cable and a working battery pack for your phone to work you havent eliminated a point of failure youve added two additional ones,mdnww7g,1.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdvncpz,mrheosuper,,2,2025-02-20 21:46:36,,,,1st you dont have to carry 2 things at same time so no i forget my powerbank at home 2nd efficiency There is no additional DCDC converting like in powerbank solution thus a phone with 13000mah battery will last longer than a 3000mah phone 10000mah bank,mdnww7g,1.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdqnrq6,Agouti,,16,2025-02-20 03:14:37,,,,1200 is good medium sized flashlight territory its not that silly For reference your classic 100W incandescent bulb is 1600 lumens so it would be good for lighting a large tent or outdoor campsite I doubt they have room for focusing lenses even in that case so I would assume it would be flood rather than spot,mdptot5,2.0,1itc4ds
comment,mdqajbq,CocodaMonkey,,7,2025-02-20 01:58:03,,,,Flagging down a helicopter is one of the use cases Its got a built in button to flash an SOS in Morse code using that flashlight This phone is targeting people who use it off grid like hiking through the forest for months at a time or sailing across the ocean,mdptot5,2.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdoqzvg,None,,5,2025-02-19 21:16:46,,,,I think the primary use case is while camping at night you can project it on the inside of your tent or something This phone doesnt seem to be meant to carry around in your pocket But also it seems they just crammed as much as they could into it since they had the room to,mdopybp,4.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdoa1dh,Yalkim,,7,2025-02-19 20:01:32,,,,Why is it that we either get phones that barely last a day when they are new or massive gray bricks that supposedly last six months You could take any modern phone and triple its battery size while barely increasing its width and weight by 50 This would be infinitely more usable than either of the other two but no one seems to be doing it Is it because a phone that stops lasting a single day after a couple of years incentivizes people people to spend a grand on a new phone every couple of years,,0.0,1itc4ds

comment,mdrpbxh,OneBigBug,,1,2025-02-20 08:01:53,,,,Well batteries are essentially already split internally as a giant stack of sheets in 18650s and other round batteries those sheets are just rolled up and put in a metal can with larger batteries just having more sheets inside The charge rate of a battery is typically discussed in terms of its Crate which is the ratio of the rate of charge in Amps to the capacity in amp hours So a Crate of 1 on a 33000mAhor 33Ah battery means you could charge it at 33 Amps Watts are Amps Volts so 1C for this battery would be 165W This product claims it can be charged at 66W which would be 4C and thatsalready pretty high Honestly higher than is advisablemdashthe higher the Crate typically used to charge it usually means the lower the lifespan of the battery And because the USBC power delivery spec already comfortably allows 66W theres no real reason to use more than one cable,mdrjm89,3.0,1itc4ds
