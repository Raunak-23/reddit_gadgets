comment,mg6bo8j,gameonlockking,,550,2025-03-05 17:04:57,,,,I hope they emulate this software somehow on the switch 2,,0.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6f4gv,ThePr0vider,,138,2025-03-05 17:21:07,,,,how having the two screens side by side itd be ugly as hell,mg6bo8j,1.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6fz3w,WovenWoodGuy,,253,2025-03-05 17:25:02,,,,So modders have actually already solved this problem with a special grip you put the switch in vertically Then homegrown emulators let you play ds and 3ds games on the single screen split across the middle,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6lgyu,Mother_Restaurant188,,56,2025-03-05 17:50:29,,,,Thats actually a neat idea With the Switch 2 being a bit bigger though I wonder how the ergonomics will fare I hope Nintendo either starts remasteringremaking DS and 3DS games or at the very least starts emulating them via NSO They have a huge library to fall back on between new mainline releases,mg6fz3w,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg80wpe,RemoteButtonEater,,13,2025-03-05 21:47:40,,,,I would sell my soul for a remaster of Ocarina of Time Master Quest and Majoras Mask in the BotW engine Bonus points if you make it biggeradd more stuff Other wish list item is a starfox game in the form of ace combat,mg6lgyu,4.0,1j47dtu

comment,mg7aii5,DomLite,,14,2025-03-05 19:46:28,,,,I feel the need to state for the record that the Flip Grip has been around since damn near the dawn of the Switch Its not at all a new thing that someone just came up with It also works great for emulating vertical scrolling arcade titles,mg6sv56,4.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg7tkys,None,,6,2025-03-05 21:14:15,,,,which means Nintendo wont do it officially,mg6fz3w,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg8a4db,21Fudgeruckers,,1,2025-03-05 22:30:43,,,,So its relying on having a moddable switch Not exactly common place these days,mg6fz3w,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mgpzsd5,PageOthePaige,,2,2025-03-08 18:24:27,,,,The point is that its doable If Nintendo implemented a similar solution itd function well,mg8a4db,4.0,1j47dtu
comment,mgqsahc,21Fudgeruckers,,-1,2025-03-08 20:54:45,,,,I thought the point was that there will soon no longer be any way to natively play games from the DS 3DS platforms since replacement parts will be a thing of the past Saying if nintendo added a solution doesnt add much to the conversation They could also start manufacturing replacement parts again Hell make a new new 3DS People would buy it The point is as of now Nintendo does a shit job of making sure old products are preserved and playable by the public,mgpzsd5,5.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6ld77,Potato271,,8,2025-03-05 17:50:01,,,,A lot of PC emulators have this as an option and its how I usually prefer to play and it works in as long as things dont move between screens so most of the time,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg9orew,sypwn,,5,2025-03-06 03:19:25,,,,One of the rumors is that the Switch 2 can stream wirelessly to its dock This makes DS games possible where the top screen shows on the TV while the bottom screen shows on the tablet in your hands just like Wii U,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mgaffow,OfficialJ0LT,,2,2025-03-06 06:32:15,,,,And the wiiu is my preferred way to play ds games for this very reason,mg9orew,3.0,1j47dtu

comment,mg77x2r,None,,11,2025-03-05 19:34:17,,,,Some games have the vertical alignment to have graphics that spill across the two screens This would be thrown off it the screens are presented side by side vs top and bottom,mg6o613,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg7wwch,kooldude700,,3,2025-03-05 21:29:22,,,,Also some games account for the gap between the screen when having the graphics span across so it really depends on the game I guess,mg77x2r,4.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg70sj6,Renegade_451,,2,2025-03-05 19:01:04,,,,It actually works just fine Ive been emulating it that way for a long time,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg8shk4,wrathek,,2,2025-03-06 00:09:36,,,,Honestly the way it works on steam deck works just fine That is you can hit buttons to switch screens and also to just have a perfectly usable smaller screen for the second screen at all times,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6tpe9,None,,2,2025-03-05 18:28:39,,,,I think they will offer several configurations Check out the castlevania dominous collection Some games like Sonic ds might not work well but for most of the games itll be fine,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu

comment,mg9iruc,TheBoBiZzLe,,1,2025-03-06 02:43:29,,,,Normal handheld or phone screen works just fine Bind a button to L3 joystick press that switches the screens Bind R3 to swap between full screen or corner to corner where one screen is top left and gets 75 of the screen and the second screen is bottom right and it gets like 10 Works really well actually,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mgam4v1,doyouevennoscope,,1,2025-03-06 07:34:30,,,,Hey if it works Better than not having anything since Nintendo will just nuke any nonofficial emulators lmao,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg7lwb7,Kitakitakita,,1,2025-03-05 20:39:02,,,,there was a rumor a while ago that theyre making a separate extra screen peripheral If theyre letting the stock run out there may be some truth now,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg85lj1,_Schmegeggy_,,1,2025-03-05 22:09:06,,,,It would be slightly restrictive but you could have the top screen on the TV and the bottom screen on the console,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6x2kz,obliviousjd,,0,2025-03-05 18:44:01,,,,Well the switch 2 has a usb c cable on the top and bottom If Nintendo wanted to support DS and Wii U titles they could always sell an attachable screen clam shell that connects via usb c It wouldnt be the first time they sold an attachable screen for a home console My GameCube has one,mg6f4gv,2.0,1j47dtu

comment,mg7du5a,Plethora_of_squids,,11,2025-03-05 20:01:57,,,,Last time I checked the 3DS doesnt have a GBA port and you cant exactly fix that with a firmware patch edit guys Im pretty sure OC knows you can run GBA roms on a 3DS Im pretty damn sure theyre talking about playing actual GBA cartridges,mg7aaaq,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg7ldah,notagoodscientist,,7,2025-03-05 20:36:35,,,,It literally has the hardware in it for GBA its not even emulation it runs natively on the second CPU,mg7du5a,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg82y7a,Plethora_of_squids,,9,2025-03-05 21:56:56,,,,And last time I checked you physically can not put a GBA cartridge into a 3DS Like maybe OC wants a DS lite because they want to play their existing physical GBA games perhaps,mg7ldah,4.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg8kz4x,Dt2_0,,-4,2025-03-05 23:26:04,,,,Pull the rom off your GBA cart get a 3DS blank cart boom Assuming you have a modded 3DS,mg82y7a,5.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg8m33m,Plethora_of_squids,,5,2025-03-05 23:32:04,,,,I feel like youre missing the point of playing on actual hardware Maybe OC wants to play with their old save data or wants to authentically transfer over gen 3 pokemon or theyre a speedrunner who can only play on official hardware or maybe they like the novelty of physically playing with a cartridge Theres lots of reasons why you might want to go authentic over emulation and just going just hack your 3DS dumbass is ignoring the point entirely,mg8kz4x,6.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg8oa69,Dt2_0,,-2,2025-03-05 23:43:51,,,,1 As said it is not emulation It runs the games on hardware there is no software emulation layer Its also not too hard to move old saves for most games 2 I get wanting to play games on actual hardware but if you are wanting to play your cartridges on hardware and are either considering getting a authentic console or refurbishing a console you own that might have been in a drawer for years and years its also worth considering some amazing modern systems that can play those games off cartridges like the Analogue Pocket which IMO is the best way to play Gameboy cartridges nowadays 3 I know you mentioned it as an example but if you are trying to move Pokemon from Gen 3 you need a hacked 3DS nowadays anyways to get Pokemon Bank if you want them to go to the modern games Assuming you dont have a 3DS right now with Bank already on it 4 Speedrunners I get but I do want to point out that that is a very niche community Now none of what I said invalidates wanting to play a Gameboy game on a Gameboy If you want to do that do that But if you just want to play Gameboy games there are a plethora of methods I would recommend before recommending getting a Gameboy much less a DS which can only play GBA games and has the issue of a rechargeable battery same reason I would not recommend a GBA SP,mg8m33m,7.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg83htd,viperfan7,,4,2025-03-05 21:59:23,,,,Ok but how would you connect a GBA cart to it,mg7ldah,4.0,1j47dtu

comment,mg835rg,Plethora_of_squids,,1,2025-03-05 21:57:53,,,,maybe OC wants something that can physically accept GBA games because they have GBA game cartridges Like just maybe,mg7kgs6,4.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg7lz1b,celica825,,1,2025-03-05 20:39:23,,,,Looks pretty cool I didnt know that was a possibility Seems handy for people who want to play GBA games but dont own them but I already have a decent little collection of physical games which is way more convenient for me,mg7aaaq,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mglsxh4,VictoriousSnakeking,,1,2025-03-08 00:30:29,,,,Maybe Im wrong but I dont think you can make use of features like pal park or gbapak functionality with that Basically in some games like Pokemon having a gameboy game in the gba slot adds extra functionality and features when youre playing the DS game The only non official alternative Im aware of is using melonDS emulator on a PC,mg7aaaq,2.0,1j47dtu
comment,mglw9vz,SubstituteCS,,1,2025-03-08 00:49:49,,,,You need original or 11 hardware to utilize palpark including original cartridges even on the Nintendo DS Bootleg copies generally dont work with palpark as they usually use EEPROM for the save files while the DS games only read from the 1Mbit flash chip that the cartridge is supposed to have With that said you can use any emulator you want and then copy the save files to an original cartridge I often do this myself and play the game on my Steam Deck before transferring the save to the cartridge All of this to say if youre planning on using palpark youre already going to be spending a ton of money on original or 11 reproduction hardware so it isnt unreasonable to expect that person to also own a DS for when the time comes to use that one specific feature You are correct on the GBAPak stuff but again if youre throwing down that kind of cash its a whole separate thing at that point imo Edit The Pokémon spawning stuff from the GBAPak stuff should be enablable on a modded system running the DS game via action replay codes but I havent tried These two things though have no relevance to just playing the GBA titles Everything above is relevant for the DS titles,mglsxh4,3.0,1j47dtu
comment,mg6e3mj,hardy_83,,126,2025-03-05 17:16:23,,,,Guess prices for used will skyrocket now Shame I actually like the 3D effect but clearly it cant to replicated on other devices,,0.0,1j47dtu
