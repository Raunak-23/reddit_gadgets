comment,ma3diq6,zero_z77,,6,2025-01-30 22:31:56,,,,Pretty much agree There have been some impressive improvements with AI but the way were trying to use it is impractical Its going to end up like 3D printing When it first got big everyone thought it was going to be the future of manufacturing and everything else was obsolete And thats not what happened because 95 of what you can make with a 3D printer can be made faster cheaper at higher quality more reliably and in larger quantities with conventional injection moulding The 5 of shit you actually need a 3D printer to make are the things that would be impossible or very difficult to manufacture using traditional methods But it is also very good for rapid prototyping and hobbyists because its easier cheaper and more efficient than manufacturing an injection mould thats only going to get used once or twice Same thing with LLMs they arent going to make writing or programming obsolete like everyone thinks they will Instead it will primarily be used as a method for rapid prototyping LLMs can be very useful for writing rough drafts or basic code structures that would be tedious to create by hand But its never going to get to the point where it can compotently produce a final product of acceptable quality without human intervention,ma2to4i,3.0,1idt2l0
comment,ma3jlz8,The_Pandalorian,,9,2025-01-30 23:01:58,,,,I feel like 3D printing is actually far more useful with more potential for your average person than AI I liken AI more to VR in that it is endlessly hyped but in the end people arent going to want it Like I know a good number of people who use 3D printing I dont know a single person who wants to use AI in any capacity Or anyone with a VR headset,ma3diq6,4.0,1idt2l0
comment,macl4pe,Death_by_carfire,,1,2025-02-01 08:59:24,,,,Look I am majorly AI skeptical but way more people are interacting with AI on a daily basis than 3D printing It can be helpful Its just also got causes for concerns,ma3jlz8,5.0,1idt2l0
comment,maeym69,The_Pandalorian,,1,2025-02-01 18:26:35,,,,Do you have a source for that claim And interacting how precisely And causes for concern is hilariously underselling it Tech wants to wipe out entire classes of jobs and industries with AI to get richer,macl4pe,6.0,1idt2l0
comment,mafzcep,Death_by_carfire,,1,2025-02-01 21:33:18,,,,I mean you presented your claims without a source but want me to provide a source for mine One provider alone OpenAIChatGPT has over 200 million weekly active users as of last August which was double the number from November 23 Thats just ChatGPT Its also embedded into a litany of other enterprise software SalesForce WorkDay etc Any new Samsung Pixel iPhone has AI baked in it now Cars with semiautonomous driving have AIML features baked in Spotify uses it to make recommendations or the Spotify Wrapped at the end of year How many articles in media publications are written with AI do you think Not that I think that is a positive mind you but it is happening Basically if you interact with a computer for your work or personal life theres a high chance youre interacting with AI in some capacity 3D printing is mainly used at the consumer level to make little figurines that take up room on your desk The enterprise applications for using 3D printing for modelmaking in manufacturing medicine or engineering are useful but outside of prototype modeling its still fairly niche,maeym69,7.0,1idt2l0
comment,mahdsrv,The_Pandalorian,,1,2025-02-02 02:06:45,,,,Any new Samsung Pixel iPhone has AI baked in it now Lumping them in as users is some badfaith shit Your average person doesnt give a fuck about AI on phones For example,mafzcep,8.0,1idt2l0
comment,mal526c,Death_by_carfire,,1,2025-02-02 17:40:28,,,,Yeah but they do interact with it which was my claimI agree the features are bullshit and hardly useful Lets have a look at that source for 3D printing being used prevalently by everyday folks,mahdsrv,9.0,1idt2l0
comment,malqoe7,The_Pandalorian,,1,2025-02-02 19:17:23,,,,Interact because its being forced on them Also a vague and useless term that ignores whether people want it or not Meanwhile 3d printing is growing organically because people actually want it and use it Comparing the two directly is idiotic because one is software and the other is hardware Even still the actual interest in 3d printing is growing organically Sustained growth among both commercial and individuals Explosive growth of entrylevel printers People clearly want 3d printers People clearly dont want AI I think weve probably reached the end of this conversation Ive provided substantial proof now,mal526c,10.0,1idt2l0

comment,ma3jhdz,crashbandyh,,2,2025-01-30 23:01:19,,,,The whole fad is just a way for companies to train ai learning Forcing it on us is the fastest way to advance it Then when they get the results they needed ai will strictly be an enterprise program,ma1w6ty,1.0,1idt2l0

comment,magrhx3,asicarii,,1,2025-02-02 00:03:55,,,,I feel like its not a bubble but just over use of the term Everything now uses AI supposedly Its a buzz word like synergy and pivot You didnt pivot your business model was garbage so you tried something else I had someone arguing with me that a convenient store pivoted to a liquor store Thats not a pivot thats just changing your business,ma1w6ty,1.0,1idt2l0

comment,mag98uw,QuinQuix,,0,2025-02-01 22:25:05,,,,This is nonsense Generative AI can absolutely create striking images The run of the mill AI images are shitty prompting efforts Yes they are recognizable But they are not a limit of the technology Obviously in the hands of a designer who can combine separate generated and possibly human created elements and who can work towards a vision throughout the process its even more potent technology But even if you had a rule that only an original output can count AI is absolutely capable of doing amazing stuff Youre sticking your head in the sand denying this Denial will not help here,ma2tydd,3.0,1idt2l0

comment,ma3jxvz,Surtock,,3,2025-01-30 23:03:39,,,,I went from the 22 to the 24 ultra and its a decent bump in hardware and battery Making the jump from the 22 to the 25 sound like it would be roughly the same as I experienced If youre happy skip this and wait for the 26 or 27 for more noticeable gains The only real caveat of waiting is the depreciation of your current device The money made from the old device helps offset the cost of the new obviously For fun I checked with Samsung and with preorder and device exchange they were going to give me 1125 off for sending back my s24U Pretty sizable discount but being Canadian it would still cost me another 800 CAD for the upgraded which doesnt sound like enough for what Id get back,ma2ls3y,2.0,1idt2l0
