comment,m49v7a1,TheRealMrBreeze,,1,2024-12-29 00:01:36,,,,Maybe Lots of games struggle on 1070 and even 1080 at medhigh details I would say setting reasonable expectations are only a part of it I have a couple friends who have Ryzen 7 and i7 9900k and 16GB with their ROG 1070s and maintaining 60fps even at 1080p in games like Warhammer Space Marine 2 on medlow settings is challenging at best 1070 is still a solid card for general 1080p gaming thats for sure and as long as its not being bottlenecked by the rest of the components it is one of the cards that has held its place for longer than most But even the 20x series cards are starting to show their age on newer games esp at resolutions over 1080p And lowering the resolution sucks on modern monitors as they look blurry AF outside of their native Game developers have also gotten lazy and code is bloated Faster hardware means they can just bury more dead bodies in their code and say its the norm They are to blame as well,m44hfti,7.0,1hndtp9

comment,m42eri7,LangyMD,,4,2024-12-27 18:12:11,,,,The price points that companies set should already theoretically be maximizing the profit that they receive by balancing how much people are willing to pay with how many people are willing to pay it If everything is working correctly then prices would go down when costs go down Of course that also requires that there be other companies available that will actually compete on those items and unfortunately nVidia is utterly dominating the technology in the graphics card space AMD is only barely competitive and Intel even less so there isnt enough competition to actually drive costs down as naive capitalist economics assumes it would,m418l30,4.0,1hndtp9
comment,m41a1rr,kerbaal,,-9,2024-12-27 14:25:15,,,,I didnt say that What I dont think is that simplistic conspiracy theory versions of economics make any sense They are taking a risk ordering more stocking product has costs involved and they have to eat those costs while the product itself devalues on the shelf Prices dont increase directly because of tariffs Tarrifs drive up prices by affecting the cost of supply Buying and stocking more puts a downward pressure on price as it puts pressure on the manufacturer to sell,m418l30,4.0,1hndtp9

comment,m42byos,kerbaal,,0,2024-12-27 17:57:31,,,,Sure but price is way more complicated than that That is retail price of a product that is often one of the only consistently profitable products in the outlets that sell them The manufacturers didnt see much of those initial price changes If you know the price of a product that you sell is necessarily going up then obviously you are incentivized to try and get ahead of that change in your cash flow on a cash flow sensitive business It is a dangerous gambit too as everyone else is doing the same thing and anyone secure enough in their cash flow can likely pick up new customers by having lower prices temporarily Markets always adjust to known information once it is known That is just planning to continue to be in business when cash flows change,m41pfpp,6.0,1hndtp9

comment,m441otz,Esteban-Jimenez,,1,2024-12-27 23:36:38,,,,The democrats didnt lose this election because they didnt move far enough to the left quite the opposite The democratic voter base is not composed of the leftists you see on reddit Twitter or bluesky they are closer to the middle A significant reason for the democrats loss is that the leftwing media both mainstream and alternative is far more progressive and far left than the average democratic or undecided voter The leftwing media failed to rally around the Kamala and to provide her enough support during the elections You could argue that the medias role is to hold candidates accountable and thats valid However once the candidate is chosen primaries anointed or whatever the entire leftwing media should coalesce around that candidate to ensure victory Criticizing or scrutinizing the candidate is appropriate during the primaries or after theyve taken office but during the campaign the focus should be on pushing them forward Most voters cant explain in any amount of detail Kamalas proposed economic policy or other any policies Instead most voters vote based on vibes and media portrayals play a huge role in shaping those perceptions A big reason won is that rightwing media portrays him as infallible and to them he is the chosen one While that kind of personality cult is not something the dems should to aspire to the democrats could learn from how the right consistently supports their candidates In the future if the democrats want any chance at winning an election they must align with their key voter base centerleft liberals and not reddit socialists who dont vote anyways They also need to work exclusively with media outlets willing to align with the partys messaging and rally behind their candidates,m43qam4,7.0,1hndtp9

comment,m417brq,KaosC57,,3,2024-12-27 14:07:00,,,,Tariffs wont bring more US manufacturing Remember you can pay a Chinese worker 1 USDhr and not have any benefits and they will happily make the same GPU that a USA worker would make for 20 USDhr and have Healthcare benefits and days off and a retirement plan that all have to be paid for by the company A USA worker costs significantly more than a Chinese worker Which eats profit margins So when you have a USA made GPU prepare to spend 2x the cost of the same GPU produced in China even with Tariffs imposed,m412wl6,1.0,1hndtp9
