comment,mg783nt,Aconite_72,,17,2025-03-05 19:35:08,,,,Its something they always mention if you watch their keynotes too Theres always something about how iCloud helps keep your data secured and easily available on all of your devices Most people buying base laptops have no problem with that since its a pretty reasonable point And if they do they either wouldnt buy Apple or theyd upgrade Its pretty easy for Apple execs to decide to just keep the 256GB SSD,mg6m9jz,4.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg9llnu,theinstallationkit,,11,2025-03-06 03:00:15,,,,for a measly 50 gigs of storage 2TB is 10 a month which would pay for an SSD in that size within a year or less Not outrageous but also dumb in my opinion SaaS is a disease,mg9diej,7.0,1j45s7a
comment,mg9xuna,calcium,,2,2025-03-06 04:17:45,,,,Depends on how you use it For backup purposes in case of you having your device stolen then its priceless Just wish Apple had a slot between their 200GB for 3mo and their 2TB for 10mo services,mg9llnu,8.0,1j45s7a
comment,mgb2vh1,baldycoot,,3,2025-03-06 10:26:07,,,,I mean its not priceless It has a price and your data is ever increasing as you create more and file sizes increase exponentially people stop syncing slow mo video I pay over 100 a month to Apple Google Adobe Dropbox and Amazon12k over 10 years a situation Id like to tidy up but youll find that the more youre in the harder it is to get out Try going through 50000 photos and permanently deleting 45000 Its harder than you think not saying thats anyones data usage just looking for an analogy,mg9xuna,9.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg6l5vt,None,,32,2025-03-05 17:49:04,,,,I wonder if they have data that shows the majority of people barely use that much storage so they went with that to keep the price lower If I didnt have games installed on my PC then I wouldnt use hardly anything,mg6jh5y,3.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg9ul23,bran_the_man93,,4,2025-03-06 03:56:00,,,,Of course they do hahaha Reddit forgets that like 90 of the folks buying the base spec machine are just sending email and watching Netflix Data needs for the average user have plateaued hard since the rapid growth through 2000s Basically all our media content is streamed local storage is really just for files and whatnot if people arent using them for work So 256Gb is entirely within the realm of use if people are just using them like big iPhones,mg6l5vt,4.0,1j45s7a

comment,mgbsqdl,Meta_Zack,,0,2025-03-06 13:44:22,,,,Because they are a company and they understand that the value proposition of an M4 powered machine at that price is greater than comparably priced laptops even if they have more storage If you cant figure out how to buy external storage then you probably dont need additional storage and IF you know the alternatives and CHOOSE to use iCloud for convenience then it works out for their bottom line Its a win win,mg80dzy,4.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg9gvc5,drae-,,3,2025-03-06 02:32:23,,,,Its exactly it and its not entirely unreasonable Everything is streamed No one is storing mp3s or DivX Avis on their laptop And hell usb3 is hella fast if you need local storage its a 1tb USB stick away The biggest issue is apps But no one is gaming on a Macbook air and productivity apps are significantly smaller no shaders or textures Truth is theyre not really wrong,mg6jh5y,3.0,1j45s7a

comment,mgfan34,silentcrs,,1,2025-03-07 00:06:39,,,,If you want to keep your files secure forever you dont put them on someone elses computer You save locally and store a backup somewhere safe like in a fireproof safe or outside your house,mgf91fe,5.0,1j45s7a
comment,mgfczc0,cherry_chocolate_,,2,2025-03-07 00:20:40,,,,Secure as in not deleted Any major cloud service will do a better job of keeping a file accessible in 10 years than the average person would with a safe and a hard drive Photos from 2015 taken on an iPhone and stored in iCloud are still accessible to people with 0 interaction involved The average external drive would be lost unreadable forgot to sync etc,mgfan34,6.0,1j45s7a
comment,mgfumqx,silentcrs,,2,2025-03-07 02:05:32,,,,Cloud is not a backup solution Its a syncing solution If you ever want to go back and recover a file an older version a noncorrupted version deleted over a certain length of time etc proper backups are the solution Thats why things like Time Machine exist Plus I sure as hell am not going to pay for 20 TB of online storage for my movie collection A NAS and a backup in a fireproof safe does the job,mgfczc0,7.0,1j45s7a

comment,mgg0kwo,silentcrs,,1,2025-03-07 02:40:25,,,,Also to be clear iCloud Photos do not last forever When you hit your storage limit the oldest get written over Considering videos you take count towards that limit you can run out of space pretty quickly Apple doesnt let you know when old photos and videos are overwritten this is kept from the user,mgg05bq,9.0,1j45s7a
comment,mgg1t6i,cherry_chocolate_,,2,2025-03-07 02:47:41,,,,You pay to save X gigabytes of content and that content is saved Obviously content you arent paying for isnt saved Youre not saying something revolutionary here Your NAS requires significant time investment It requires technical knowledge It has a high up front cost When it breaks you have to fix it You ignore all the downsides of your own solution and pick nonissues to criticize from cloud services,mgg0kwo,10.0,1j45s7a
comment,mgghymt,silentcrs,,1,2025-03-07 04:28:17,,,,Running a NAS does not require a significant time investment or technical knowledge You can buy ones preconfigured with storage You connect to them one time in Finder and then youre done The only time a NAS breaks is when a drive goes bad which it emails you about You pop in a new drive and youre done Youre significantly underestimating the average Mac users capabilities And for the record I do use cloud services I use them primary to carry documents I want to different devices Again though I have a significant movie collection I bought dating back to DVDs that Ive ripped Im not going to store those in the cloud and 256 GB of local storage just doesnt cut it Youre defending Apple putting an insufficient amount of storage on their devices and then charging monthly fees for cloud storage Its a stupid argument Give it a rest,mgg1t6i,11.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg97kly,audigex,,1,2025-03-06 01:38:47,,,,Well it doesnt work on me I just skip the entire device if Id need an upgrade Eg Id buy the current gen Air because Im fine with 256GB16GB because thats sufficient for my usage and Ive just picked up the iPad 11 128GB but I wouldnt touch the last few generations of MacBook with 128GB8GB or 256GB8GB base models because fuck paying 200 just for an extra 8GB of RAM Im still running a 2010 MacBook because of it so theyve definitely missed out on 1 sale to me probably 2 if the 2016 models hadnt had such shit keyboards Id likely have upgraded in 2016 and then again around now but because of their shit upgrade pricing Ive just skipped the whole line for 15 years despite the fact Ive loved my MacBook I mean I doubt Apple cares about me and my 2500 specifically and Im sure their analysts are confident theyre taking the most profitable route but I do wonder how many people it turns off,mg959oz,6.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg78hy6,chipperclocker,,12,2025-03-05 19:37:01,,,,Look I mean Id consider myself a power user and pretty squarely in Apples target demo with this product and my current laptop is a 256GB M2 Air that I have no intention of replacing soon BTW I write code Code is small A nice IDE and development environment and a Docker VM and some container images arent particularly big I store some personal documents like tax returns and receipts and contracts in my documents folder backed up to iCloud because its important stuff My photos collection is maybe 50GB but I like sync across devices so its replicated into iCloud anyways Any media Ive downloaded lives on a NAS tucked into a closet in my home but mostly I stream things because I dont have time to curate an offline collection I dont play games anymore But even most of my programming happens on my workissued laptop with much larger storage Whatever toy projects I have going on at home are just toys Frankly I want a fast laptop with great battery life and a great screen that is used to run a web browser 98 of the time Obviously plenty of people benefit from larger storage particularly people working in media but I think theres a real argument to be made that Apple only keeps the base storage small because for many of their customers people like me its simply a waste to have tons more,mg5zyn0,1.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg7gdof,Jimmeh1337,,15,2025-03-05 20:13:52,,,,Sure that can be a matter of opinion some Linux distro might have a better UX out of the box for you personally There are definitely a few settings I change every time I set up a new Mac and I install Rectangle first thing because I consider it to be mandatory for usability Still though I think Mac gets a lot of the big things and small details right Ubuntu is arguably the most user friendly Linux distro and it still feels a little clunky to use compared to Mac or even Windows just for every day use imo What do you use that you consider to have a more polished or better UX,mg7bzze,3.0,1j45s7a
comment,mg7z7jp,TheFrankBaconian,,-4,2025-03-05 21:40:01,,,,I dont think there is such a thing as a polished feeling UX on a OS level At least no packages one I have experienced yet I have to assume that something about the size of this undertaking just prevents success there I wouldnt even necessarily consider any of the other options to be better MacOSs has quite a few sensible defaults and nice behaviors Its main drawbacks are that it is opinionated and not necessarily open to modification and customization While Linux distros tend to be open to modification This always feels like a fragile balance that might break with any update I think Im just more accepting here of the fact that I might have to modify things and I have a lot of options to choose from To begin with Windows might be the worst While there is some nice behavior or at least behavior everyone expects by now There are also some fundamental things like search and app launching that are incredibly broken Im honestly not sure how open windows is to modification but it feels like I would be doing something forbidden and might just end up with a bunch of malware I think the most frustrating thing about the MacOS UX is that it could be way better if apple just fixed a lot of small things and apple seems like that company that would care about these things Which makes having those issues just so much more frustrating,mg7gdof,4.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg70h2f,deathlyschnitzel,,1,2025-03-05 18:59:36,,,,Quite a bit more than that I got the 24gb RAM 1TB SSD model and Im not in the US I wanted a very portable fanless laptop that could take those workloads and still have a good battery life Weight and size were priorities since I pretty much exclusively use bicycles to get around once it gets warm enough as thats fastest and most convenient where I live and even a 14 Pro weighs down a backpack noticeably more I hardly ever need to bring a charger and if I do need to I can get away with the tiniest phone charger That little thing can run compiles on end and barely gets warm and stays absolutely silent obviously anything I throw at it that a laptop can reasonably be expected to handle it does without a hitch though a bit more RAM would be nice sometimes Definitely one of my favorite purchases,mg6fuyw,3.0,1j45s7a
comment,mg7bkuv,NarutoDragon732,,1,2025-03-05 19:51:28,,,,exclusively use bicycles to get around That makes a LOT of sense going Pro for me boosted my productivity quite a bit due to the fan but is a mess to handle on airplanes The thickness really is a big difference,mg70h2f,4.0,1j45s7a
comment,mg7sxbl,deathlyschnitzel,,1,2025-03-05 21:11:12,,,,Ive used the Air side by side with an almost maxed out 16 Pro and while the Pro certainly was faster the difference wasnt huge in practice and I dont work with large C codebases or things like that interpreted languages dont require large compiles and where I need to compile incremental compilation usually is near instant as well For very computeintensive tasks I use a cloud VM where I get a whole lot more horsepowers than any laptop I was a bit skeptical at first too if the M2 without any cooling could really handle my workloads but then I actually looked at when the CPU hit thermal throttling and it I barely ever did even working it pretty hard GPU when gaming is a different story 1015min and it invariably throttles The silence from not having a fan is super nice as well,mg7bkuv,5.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg6bm0n,None,,5,2025-03-05 17:04:39,,,,Counter argument If you have a relatively standard modern IPhone with 256GB or 512GB storage you cant store all your iPhone pictures and videos on a standard sized MacBook with 256GB in their original quality Most likely youd struggle even with 128GB phone photo gallery This is an intentional pricing strategy for years and has been used in every single Apple computer they sell for well over a decade It has everything to do with their profit margins and nothing with making users happy As of now the M4 Air SSD upgrade from 256 to 512 is 200 to 1T is 400 20 and 40 respectively over the exact same computer with base SSD,mg64aqs,1.0,1j45s7a

comment,mg6yoai,wickeddimension,,5,2025-03-05 18:51:26,,,,More than just can it be done matters in picking a device You arent getting a device as premium as a macbook air for any other prices from windows brands Sure a 400 plastic laptop gets the same thing done But more matters than just hardware specs like having a nice keyboard screen trackpad speakers thermal performance batterylife etc I wouldnt want to do daily work on a plastic 400 laptop for a decade if I had the choice Id absolutely pick a more premium device be it Apple or Windows but prices at that level arent so different than you might think The entry level air is a pretty competitive machine at 999,mg6c01u,2.0,1j45s7a
