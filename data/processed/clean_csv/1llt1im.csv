comment,n02ahv1,VampyreLust,,153,2025-06-27 13:39:48,,,,46mm face is what they launched with Thats a huge watch for a circular face Even the reduction to 43mm is considered to be a large watch I guess this is why half the smart watch faces are not circular,,0.0,1llt1im

comment,n09lgkw,BijouPyramidette,,5,2025-06-28 16:47:08,,,,This is very exciting and i hope they eventually bring back the pebble time round But for the two they are planning to release now the feature set makes no sense One has a barometer and a compass but no GPS or heart rate the other has the better color screen but only heart rate There is no clear image of who is intended to buy which,n07j9eq,3.0,1llt1im

comment,n06o5lp,Oops_I_Cracked,,1,2025-06-28 03:42:46,,,,Its notable that this watch runs WearOS Garmins watches have always had better battery life than their WearOS and Apple Watch competitors in exchange for a more limited smartwatch feature set though fitness features were always top tier on Garmin Idk how the Venue 3 compares to WearOS feature for feature these days but a WearOS device having 4 day battery life is a notable advancement,n02vbj1,1.0,1llt1im

comment,n036qdi,Ghozer,,-3,2025-06-27 16:15:39,,,,Just look for Smart Watches on Temu there are lots of options I got the Coiusor spelling one take a look at the specs and measurements and peoples reviews of them to find ones you like and would suit you dial or face thickness is a big one smallerthinner the better dont worry too much about straps or strap material because as long as you check the measurements there are plenty of replacement straps available on there too Also dont jump for the first one you find that fits what you need take a close look around even different brands as there is often clearly the same watch from different brands at slightly varying prices 1249 was the cheapest I found the one I got but I have seen them as high as 21,n035qi7,2.0,1llt1im
