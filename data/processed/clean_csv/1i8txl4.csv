comment,m8wemmq,hotlavatube,,104,2025-01-24 12:32:36,,,,Aside from someone resting their cigarette on the mouse a lightning strike or some nearby lens focusing the sun I cant imagine how a wired mouse could selfimmolate Even if someone used some weird offbrand motherboard that somehow had no amp cutoff on the USB ports I wouldve expected there to be way more vulnerable paths thatd fry first Hmm I guess if you used an adapter to plug into a USBC port you could possibly get a higher amperage up to 3A compared to the standard 05A on USBA but Im a bit dubious,,0.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8x1iik,cat_prophecy,,43,2025-01-24 14:48:36,,,,Current is a rope you can only pull amps If something is drawing 3A its because it CAN not because 3A is being pushed into it If it were the case that someone plugged the mouse into a port that could output 1000A it wont matter because the mouse should only be capable of pulling a tiny fraction of that current,m8wemmq,1.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8x2lnl,NickCharlesYT,,17,2025-01-24 14:54:09,,,,This is correct until theres a short or other issue with the device that causes it to try and pull more then the limit is working against you,m8x1iik,2.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8x5h5k,cat_prophecy,,5,2025-01-24 15:08:31,,,,The short would have to be internal to the USB controller that limits current demand which is unlikely and might actually be impossible,m8x2lnl,3.0,1i8txl4

comment,m919ylf,zakkord,,3,2025-01-25 03:35:43,,,,if the controller had CC curcuitry there wouldnt be a need to have a polyfuse on every motherboard it has a shunt to measure itand its shared for all ports on the controller it doesnt limit anything You can connect a 3A peripheral like a heated glove and they will work without any negotiation or even data lines connected and check the current draw with a multimeter,m8x5h5k,4.0,1i8txl4

comment,m8xc45q,Seattlepowderhound,,2,2025-01-24 15:40:29,,,,iirc someone posted the same mouse taken apart I guess the mouse has a habit over the years of collecting little dust balls in the frame depending on what sort of mouse paddeskclothes youre using Im going to bet that is going to be the final cause,m8wemmq,1.0,1i8txl4
comment,m9af55l,qckpckt,,1,2025-01-26 16:40:10,,,,Youd be surprised how little currentvoltage is required to start a fire in cheap electronics My doorbell caught fire My house came with a doorbell that ran on an 18v DC circuit The doorbell circuit was very simple you press a button and this closes a circuit which makes a hammer rise to hit a bell for the ding Probably a little electromagnet or something When you release the button the circuit is open again the hammer falls and hits a second bell for the dong One day my doorbell dinged but didnt dong I didnt notice it at the time What had happened is that water damage had corroded the doorbell button so the circuit stayed closed About an hour later the doorbell caught fire because the thin metal wire coil for the electromagnet got hot enough to melt contacted the plastic enclosure and went up in flames Thankfully I was home at was able to pull the alarm off the wall and extinguish it before things got really bad We were just left with scorch marks on a wall and a weird story But yeah shitty electronics can cause fires even with low current and voltage if theyre shitty enough,m8wemmq,1.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8zug0n,BoraxTheBarbarian,,0,2025-01-24 22:44:59,,,,This is fake The cable is not rated for much amperage and would have melted before anything happened,m8wemmq,1.0,1i8txl4
comment,m907z6r,hotlavatube,,2,2025-01-24 23:56:05,,,,Well in an overamp fault there are smaller wires inside the mouse thatd go first likely cutting the circuit after a brief flashpop The power wires in USB are 2028AWG size which are rated for 3515 amps roughly At 5v a circuitboard trace can safely carry around 1amp So its likely that the trace or a component will briefly burnpop before the cable even heats up For example check out this vid where some kids try to send way too much power through a USB mouse at a way higher voltage too It briefly flashes inside the mouse and goes dead They end up cranking up the voltage but it quickly becomes clear its just the ends of the wire sparking to eachother inside the mouse Im still dubious but someone noted this mouse was prone for accumulating dust inside likely from the scroll wheel openings on top If the mouse somehow encounters an overamperage fault and sparks then in a milliontoone chance it could ignite some dust bunnies and start a small fire Another comment noted that USB cablesdevices are designed to tell the PC how much amperage the cablesdevices can support This can be done passively by adding resistors on certain data lines So if by some fluke your mouse was demanding enough power to charge a lithium battery or you were using some shoddy USB adapterextension that requested highamperage then perhaps an overamperage fault could occur Kinda reminds me of that rash of exploding knockoff iPhone USB wall chargers,m8zug0n,2.0,1i8txl4

comment,m8wipbn,jakgal04,,41,2025-01-24 13:00:30,,,,Im calling bullshit on this one How the hell does a 5v usb powered device go up in flames Take a USB cable cut it and twist all of the exposed wires together absolutely nothing will happen 5v isnt enough to cause something like this and on top of that a lot of computers will just shut off the USB port if it detects a short or something wrong Lastly the backside of the mouse has the most damage yet all of the electronics in that mouse are towards the front Had this been a battery powered mouse I might be able to believe it if there was a defect in the battery pouch but even thats a stretch,,0.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8wuzfi,TheRealPitabred,,4,2025-01-24 14:13:34,,,,A 12V AA battery can start a fire with a bit of gum wrapper The voltage wont jump through air gaps but if theres a short it will still heat up plenty,m8wipbn,1.0,1i8txl4

comment,m8xem19,shalol,,3,2025-01-24 15:52:13,,,,Its a known trick to use a piece of foil and a 15V AA battery to start a fire Its possible for the motherboard to have delivered over its USB amp limit,m8wjppi,3.0,1i8txl4
comment,m921qbf,TheBigBo-Peep,,2,2025-01-25 07:14:52,,,,My thoughts as well Given enough of a short to cause high amperage you can get a serious burn or a fire from very low voltage Heck a car battery is only 12 volts,m8xem19,4.0,1i8txl4
comment,m8xne9j,try_harder_later,,1,2025-01-24 16:32:48,,,,Ceramic caps the most common type in small electronics nowadays can fail in a low resistance state if they are mechanically mishandled Assuming a USB port with 5V 2A bad cap across the power line dumping 10W of heat could potentially set a plastic case on fire Im definitely leaning towards cigarette butt or misfocused sun ray though,m8wje98,2.0,1i8txl4

comment,m8x4jx4,wickeddimension,,13,2025-01-24 15:03:55,,,,Try thinking more critical How do you figure a mouse on a desk catches fire burns through a mouse pad and damages a table but has its underside be perfectly intact with any damage You think wood scorches but a plastic bottom looks factory new There is a black mark on the table larger than the mouse but even the information sticker on the bottom fine Has nothing to do with where he took the photo and everything with how the damage to the desk relates to the damage on the mouse Yea Im not buying it,m8wu7s5,2.0,1i8txl4
