comment,m2c45jy,cockyjames,,22,2024-12-16 14:57:18,,,,Im thinking they will do a refresh with an OLED panel at the same time they do a dieshrink revision Just speculating But follow the Steamdeck model,m2b9124,2.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2e3hfj,cockyjames,,3,2024-12-16 21:14:49,,,,Well Nintendo did a die shrink that was a quiet revision though they changed the packaging And separately they did an OLED model with the die shrink But not the two at the same time But yeah youre sort of right they just did it incrementally SD did it in one revision which is how I think Nintendo will do it this time around,m2e1u25,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2b9fzo,Hamuelin,,39,2024-12-16 11:01:16,,,,Agreed They did so well with the OLED display Itd be sad to see an upgraded Switch 2 actually have a sizeable downgrade in a key area Some people wont mind of course and thats absolutely fine power to them But as with the more recent Steam Deck OLED screens are just so so much nicer to look at Especially for bright and saturated titles that Nintendo are known for,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2blhzd,KarmabearKG,,29,2024-12-16 12:51:52,,,,Im one of those weirdos that really doesnt play my switch handheld at all so it doesnt bother me personally It means the device should be cheaper in theory,m2b9fzo,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2c1ws4,Ashencroix,,16,2024-12-16 14:43:49,,,,They should consider releasing 2 SKUs at launch a cheaper one with LCD and a pricier one with OLED to give a choice Maybe a 3rd one for pure docked users that dont have a screen on board battery and joycons and come bundled with a pro controller and is cheaper than either hybrid models,m2blhzd,3.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2cjfyp,fluteofski-,,24,2024-12-16 16:22:59,,,,As a former supply chain guy Id wager that having a noscreen switch wont really save enough to be worth opening additional dies and SKUs You might chop 2030 off the end price Because the different design configs are gonna cost money to too And for 30 Id wager that just about any consumer would be like eh Yeah Might as well take the screen one Theres also risk in carrying additional skus that you dont know for certain will sell especially if theyre at a lesser price point that can take away sales from higher price points If they end up with excess inventory and have to reduce prices it also devalues the higher price models The OLEDLCD one wouldnt be a bad idea but as someone else said I wouldnt be surprised if they launch with LCD because its easier to secure supply and ramp production for those Theyll secure all the launch sales and then release OLED later to double up on sales where people want to upgrade to OLED some LCD will end up on the used market which is fine for Nintendo because that means they have a new customer buying games butand a lot will go to become a 2nd household switch kidsmultiplayerfamilies as Nintendo positions themselves as a family oriented console,m2c1ws4,4.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2d3m4c,piroso,,3,2024-12-16 18:09:01,,,,So while I 100 am disappointed by the news or rumors that it wont have a OLED screen its funny because I would also never use it in handheld mode I do currently own a launch version of the switch my daughters and I did purchase the BOTW OLED version of the switch I just cant stand the joycons whatsoever and only ever play with it docked and with a pro controller Maybe the new joycons will be bigger and a more comfortable fit in my hands and that would change my feelings on using it in handheld mode I just feel like the only two reasons I can think of them not using a OLED panel would be 1 to cut production costs and 2 to have something to add to the refresh But without having any real knowledge of how much these things cost I do wonder how much more it would really add to the price tag assuming my guess is anything near correct Regardless of all this not launching with an OLED is a pretty simple way for me to feel like I dont mind waiting Which again is such a funny outlook considering what my expected use case will be haha,m2b9fzo,2.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2bk48x,Mother_Restaurant188,,9,2024-12-16 12:41:05,,,,A huge miss indeed Switch OLED is gorgeous But as long as the LCD is higher quality than Switch OG then it should hold me off until an OLED version I dont mind waiting,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2cp10u,PeaceBull,,3,2024-12-16 16:52:34,,,,As a mainly handheld player I was annoyed with the no OLED news Until I thought about how new parts cpugpuram cost more compared to a nearly tax year old consoles parts And while Id love the better screen the better internals are way more important to me if I had to choose And the reality is Nintendo has a price ceiling that theyre unwilling to go over so there will have to be sacrifices,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2gmbaq,Johnny_Menace,,3,2024-12-17 07:09:58,,,,Yeah going from OLED back to LCD is a huge downgrade,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2rmhlh,Forest_GS,,2,2024-12-19 03:08:29,,,,being larger than the original switch is a huge miss as well there are already pocketable windows palm handhelds powerful enough to emulate the original nintendo switch,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2csl0z,jackolantern_,,1,2024-12-16 17:11:27,,,,Thats how they keep the price down and then sell a more expensive version,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2cu01i,Fritzschmied,,2,2024-12-16 17:18:58,,,,They could have just keep using the oled screen in the current switch oled which is perfectly fine and also kept the price down because the wouldnt have do develop and source a new screen,m2csl0z,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2c99pi,_sharpmars,,-4,2024-12-16 15:27:08,,,,120 Hz OLED But yeah both would be preferable,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2cbagr,Fritzschmied,,12,2024-12-16 15:38:32,,,,Maybe for you I would take a 60hz oled all day long over a 120 hz lcd Especially for mobile gaming because honestly the gpu inside that thing wont be able to do 120hz anyway for the AAA titles,m2c99pi,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2ckbtn,_Rand_,,5,2024-12-16 16:27:43,,,,Ill definitely agree with this Nintendo barely cares about performance 120fps on a regular basis isnt happening Id rather have a nice screen 100 of the time than 120fps in 120 games Well unless it does VRRframegen which I doubt it will,m2cbagr,3.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2oqfuf,ArtOfWarfare,,1,2024-12-18 17:25:42,,,,Id say performance comes more from software than hardware I dont think compute cycle times have changed much in the past 20 years everything is in the 14 GHz range So if you went all out your performance is 4x better Improvements by boosting cores are similarly linear but it depends on your software being written so it can scale across multiple cores Really the place where improvements come from is software where you find something taking O2 or O3 or worse time and bring it down You dont see the 1020 improvement typical from hardware changes you see it go 101000x faster Thats why you see a game like BotW and Pokemon on the same console One of those games are actually well optimized The other is terrible and takes 10x as long or worse to do the same thing,m2ckbtn,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2cq9le,_sharpmars,,-2,2024-12-16 16:59:04,,,,It will 100 have DLSS 3 frame generation,m2ckbtn,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2csyh3,_Rand_,,1,2024-12-16 17:13:25,,,,Id like to think so I just dont trust nintendo to do the obvious Like how long did it take them to do acceptable online features I half expect the damn thing to be capable and they just disable it for no apparent reason,m2cq9le,5.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2ce7m3,None,,1,2024-12-16 15:54:41,,,,I personally dont care whenever or not its OLED or LCD I just want the battery life to not be shit,m2cbagr,3.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2ci9a6,Fritzschmied,,7,2024-12-16 16:16:37,,,,Also in that case oled is the better option if battery life matters to you,m2ce7m3,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2clfv6,None,,1,2024-12-16 16:33:39,,,,Thats the only reason why I got Steam Deck Oled instead of LCD model lol But Switchs case the battery life was good on V2 and lite models it became perfect on OLED model though I hate the fact that Switch 2 will be bigger My main issue with steam deck but as long as the battery is good and we will get new games instead of remakes of old ones Looking at you PS5 Everything will be good,m2ci9a6,5.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2c69r1,LePouletMignon,,-8,2024-12-16 15:09:51,,,,MiniLED is better than OLED Getting really old with the uncritical OLED comments Even LCDs can be solid if its a quality panel Look at the PS Portal,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dgar7,obi1kenobi1,,2,2024-12-16 19:14:31,,,,What are you talking about The Portal is a great example of how awful LCDs are its an absolutely terrible screen by every metric except resolution A laughably bad display by 2023 standards that Sony should be deeply ashamed of considering that they were the early pioneers of OLED and by now OLED is a mature and affordable technology The only barely adequate mini LED LCD Ive ever seen in my life is the one from the 16 MacBook Pro which has an order of magnitude more dimming zones than is typical on mini LED displays the only mini LED Ive ever seen where bloom isnt immediately noticeable and distracting and even its put to shame in terms of color intensity and contrast by the dirt cheap portable OLED monitor I got off of Amazon The only way mini LED is better than OLED is if you got confused and meant micro LED but that technology is still mostly experimental and not commercially viable so we dont really know if it has the benefits that it claims to and likely wont find out for 1015 years,m2c69r1,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dhdgx,sargrvb,,1,2024-12-16 19:20:01,,,,I wont buy OLED until they fix burn in I have a very expensive Dell 219 that is noticeably charred after three years of use I can only imagine how badly a portable game console would do with kids who play 2 hours a day every day Certain GUI elements will scar the panel Im sure Nintendo people dont care because theyll buy another after a couple years anyways but I dont think we should standardize obselesence any more than we already have,m2dgar7,3.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dmk9c,guywhoclimbs,,5,2024-12-16 19:46:33,,,,Have you seen the burn in videos from Wulff Den Switch oled took a really long time to have burn in Im really impressed with how well its done,m2dhdgx,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2drq0f,sargrvb,,2,2024-12-16 20:13:24,,,,Good recommendation just watched it It again proves my point I suggest those interested in OLED watch it It backs 100 of what Ive said Takes about 2 years to start heavily noticing the burn in after 3 I see it all the time I expect my top line electronics displays to last 5 years personally before I refresh Its really irritating to me But I get it Not everyone cares about accurate colors If youre a 13 game person avoid OLED at all cost The moving pixels thing basically gradients the decay but does NOT fix the problem,m2dmk9c,5.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dyrv5,obi1kenobi1,,-2,2024-12-16 20:50:23,,,,The good news is that burn in is already fixed its really not an issue anymore On modern devices from the past 5 years or so the only way to get an OLED to burn in is with great effort subjecting it to one static high contrast image for literal years on end No amount of normal gameplay will ever burn in an OLED in any significant way Ive seen LCDs with worse burnin than modern OLEDs,m2dhdgx,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dzwn9,sargrvb,,1,2024-12-16 20:56:12,,,,Youre 100 wrong on this which is why I keep bringing up my comments Until someone SHOWS the new tech working flawlessly it doesnt exist Show me a screen without OLED burn in after two years of heavy use It doesnt exist Stop spamming misinformation,m2dyrv5,5.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2c81un,Fritzschmied,,-2,2024-12-16 15:20:11,,,,Yes mini led CAN be better than oled But lcd definitely isnt,m2c69r1,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2czx3m,VagueSomething,,-5,2024-12-16 17:49:57,,,,OLED sucks for gaming It still burns in yes it is harder to cause than it used to but if you play a few hundred hours of a game with static UI you still risk it happening As nice as they colours look reliable longer life is better for your average gamer than luxury screens,m2b53c0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2d1502,Fritzschmied,,0,2024-12-16 17:56:14,,,,Thats bulshit You can prevent burn in today pretty good If not every smart watch would burn in and they dont Also oled lixel refresh also got way better in the last years,m2czx3m,2.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dhnvh,sargrvb,,1,2024-12-16 19:21:31,,,,This is 100 not bullshit The reason watch screens dont burn in is because theyre idle more than 50 of the day People who have not powerused an OLED have no idea how bad it can get even with pixel shifting break times etc Its an actual concern,m2d1502,3.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dli0r,Fritzschmied,,1,2024-12-16 19:41:09,,,,I literally have my Apple Watch in always on screen mode for over a year and it hasnt burn in With proper software it is possible to prevent it,m2dhnvh,4.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dqg4a,sargrvb,,1,2024-12-16 20:06:42,,,,A year isnt long enough Like I said it takes three or so on the best screens This isnt even debatable its physics Edit Physics dont lie Expect to replace that watch about 2 years in if not 3 for sure,m2dli0r,5.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2dumbt,Fritzschmied,,0,2024-12-16 20:28:38,,,,A year always on is way more than i would use my switch in 510 years tbh Also if the base model of the switch would have oled game devs could take that into account and design the zu around that If it has a lcd nobody cares and once the oled edition will be release the same issue will be there,m2dqg4a,6.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2cnjny,HRudy94,,5,2024-12-16 16:44:51,,,,Idk why you got downvoted though it makes no sense to still not have a proper dpad Yeah i know joycons can be used as single controllers and shit but its easily the worse controller you could have when it comes to comfort and it just feels like a gimmick just bring a proper controller with it 99 of joycon use is vertical with the two pieces together anyways either attached to the console or to the grip Almost nobody uses them splitted between 2 players,m2ce2w0,1.0,1hfftl3
comment,m2crz2s,stefanopolis,,5,2024-12-16 17:08:09,,,,It sucks because the split joycons is one of its biggest physical defining features for the console but also like you said nobody uses it that way So theyll keep it like a vestigial limb and well all be the worse for it,m2cnjny,2.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2lxam1,marc-andre-servant,,1,2024-12-18 04:05:35,,,,If there still relying on Nvidia chip eFuses for jailbreak protection Id guess an overclocked Raspberry Pi microcontroller would be able to time the exact moment any Nintendo digital signature is verified and cut power to the CPU for a few nanoseconds to skip the firmware validation check This is the exact method used to jailbreak new Switch consoles like the Switch Lite and the OLED model Even if there are no boot ROM vulnerabilities in the CPUGPU code if you can carefully time a nanosecondprecision power glitch to the chip and there are no glitch detection circuits within the SoC itself you can get it to skip instructions The OG Switch did have a USB bug in the boot ROM fusee gelee This was fixed in later models but didnt prevent opensource modchips from glitching the power supply to the SoC at the exact time it performed if signatureInvalid abortBoot,,0.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2d1sy7,SoldierOfOrange,,5,2024-12-16 17:59:37,,,,To be fair the 3DS XL still fits in my pocket and I can just throw that in my bag For a Switch you always need a case to protect the screen and buttons which makes its footprint like twice if not three times that of the 3DS XL Its successor being even bigger would kind of suck,m2c0pkr,2.0,1hfftl3

comment,m2cmg8w,HRudy94,,1,2024-12-16 16:39:04,,,,On one hand i did think the same but then i remembered the Switch is already not really portable nowadays lol Since you will need a bag to carry it anyways might as well make it a bit bigger to fit a bigger battery and screen as long as its not heavier its alright Though yeah id rather see them make actual handhelds that fit in your pocket like the PSVitaGPD Win 4 3DS XL etc but i guess if theyre going the switch route again they might as well make it a bit bigger,m2bimmx,1.0,1hfftl3
