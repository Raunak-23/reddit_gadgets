comment,mrf4y6x,bondjimbond,,800,2025-05-09 13:55:57,,,,Outside the US the terms are different The agreement for UK accounts now states digital products are licensed only for personal and noncommercial use and that any unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable This differs slightly from the US which states You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services andor the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part,mrf1kua,1.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrf8ulm,Macqt,,676,2025-05-09 14:17:09,,,,Theres no way this wouldnt lead to lawsuits andor a class action Intentionally bricking expensive devices without offering a refund would have lines of US lawyers chomping at the bit,mrf4y6x,2.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrfaqz2,mastercxxi,,342,2025-05-09 14:27:09,,,,The terms also include that you cant join a class action anymore instead you have to call their customer service line Edit sure its unenforceable but they wouldnt have added it if they didnt think it would deter at least a few people so its still a crappy thing for them to do,mrf8ulm,3.0,1kii3yi

comment,mriqxg5,Aleyla,,45,2025-05-10 01:42:04,,,,For an agreement to be valid there has to be consideration In other words you have to get something out of the deal The courts have ruled that the job itself doesnt count,mrhrjhj,7.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrmoce1,theawesomeshulk,,-3,2025-05-10 18:44:03,,,,It states for valuable rather than fair Im not too sure about US law which means Im talking out of my ass but for the law that Im familiar with consideration does not need to be adequate but in the valuable standard means having economic value Thus I think a 1 cent payout for such a variation is technically allowed but who would sign it as a variation clause also I do want to know what would constitute as deed under seal,mrl1vcv,10.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrjg7y7,AquaWitch0715,,1,2025-05-10 04:41:31,,,,Okay so the kids that play the game and had the account may agree and forfeit rights But Im not hearing the part where parents agree to the destruction of an electronic device that they purchase I could be wrong in this comparison but if phone companies stated that calling someone with illicit illegal immoral or unethical connections would result in a phone being bricked this isnt going to help anybody in choosing a phone Wouldnt it be easier to just wipe anything questionable from the device and restrict online services Turn off online features and services stop payment for accounts at the end of the month and dont invite trouble,mrfh0d5,6.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrfpykc,Boring_Incident,,127,2025-05-09 15:44:38,,,,This is incorrect Even if their contract says you give up rights by law it doesnt really matter You still have all those rights Contracts eluas terms of service ect all are below the law Even if you signed something that says you can never sue them for any reason if they unlawfully do something against or to you such as bricking your device you can still sue It doesnt matter and isnt binding,mrfeuyn,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrg8qqn,Boring_Incident,,15,2025-05-09 17:19:55,,,,Im much more talking about the eluas that many games and game platforms have and not such things like brokerage firms The former have been proven and ruled to be nonbinding when it intersects with the law The latter as it seems is mug more complicated,mrg7280,9.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrk3ar6,DivineFlamingo,,2,2025-05-10 08:19:12,,,,I dont think its fine in the USA I just dont think its been challenged I can write what ever I want in a contract user agreement policy but it doesnt mean that the law will agree with me I think its a situation where Nintendo is such a big company they can just afford the lawsuits this will inevitably cause and paying fines is cheaper than the damage they think people modding their games will cause To be honest Im not sure why people still Stan Nintendo Their consoles are always half a generation behind their exclusives are pretty stale a this point and their practices arent user friendly,mrfeuyn,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrfsh3r,Kwumpo,,3,2025-05-09 15:57:17,,,,Im pretty sure its not really legal in America either its just theres not a strong enough precedent to make it easy for randoms to pursue in court If someone wanted to take one for the team and sue Nintendo Im pretty confident theyd end up winning it would just be long and expensive I absolutely cannot believe these words are coming out of my mouth but Trump has actually been good about anticonsumer lawsuits so far Granted theyre almost all Lina Khans lawsuits from the Biden administration still and most are against big tech companies that Trump has his own misaligned hatred for but still we might actually see some big antitrust busts soon,mrfeuyn,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrssoof,Rymanjan,,1,2025-05-11 19:48:29,,,,Its not its the same thing as those safety waivers saying you cant sue if you get hurt Bullshit lol you absolutely can the slip of paper means nothing in court its there to deter people from bringing it to court in the first place because theyd likely lose so they try to trick you into thinking you cant sue You cant sign away your rights we made that impossible after the civil war If the EULA infringes upon your rights as a consumer it wont hold up in court a judge would strike that down in a heartbeat However hiring a lawyer that could win a case against a superpower like Nintendo lawyers aint gonna be cheap certainly more expensive than buying a new console it may be a slam dunk easy win but it still costs money upfront to hire and keep the lawyer on retainer for the duration of the proceedings and Nintendo has an infinite amount of money so they can afford to keep dragging out the litigation asking for continuances wasting time through a myriad of tactics and will attempt to outlast you to the point where you can no longer afford that lawyer so the suit gets dropped Youd likely have to get a class action together so you could all sue at once with the same lawyer as individually the financial burden would be too great,mrfeuyn,5.0,1kii3yi
comment,ms2sytq,TheOneWes,,1,2025-05-13 12:06:18,,,,You can put it in there but it wont actually hold up in a court Contracts cant violate law but for some reason theres no law that says you cant put stuff in a contract that cant be enforced anyway so companies will do it knowing that most people dont know it doesnt work that way,mrfeuyn,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrfohq9,hanlonmj,,11,2025-05-09 15:37:17,,,,Not a lawyer Yes but you need enough money to see the case through to the end including appeals as you only get the payout at the end There might be some firms willing to take it pro bono but that usually only happens on cases that are near certain victories and theres not a whole lot of precedent to suggest that this one would be,mrfn1d1,8.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrfpi75,notfork,,3,2025-05-09 15:42:22,,,,No you do not except in very narrow circumstances legal fees are not reimbursed to the prevailing party like they are in EU and most other western nations So if damages against you are not higher then the expected legal fees it is not worth it to pursue So for anyone in this to even get a lawyer they will have to break the arbitration clause so they have a chance at class action as at least then the lawyer will make money and bad actions can be stopped,mrfn1d1,8.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrfq9ya,bigjoe980,,1,2025-05-09 15:46:12,,,,My understanding for America is its not actually a default thing ironically American rule and more of a if ordered thing dependant on state and judge But I am NOT a legal guy I dunno shit about legal battles I just know someone who is Do with that what you will,mrfn1d1,8.0,1kii3yi
comment,ms12pfs,lemonade_eyescream,,1,2025-05-13 03:06:50,,,,Its still screwed up because you need to be able to afford to sue in the first place The law should make them award you your costs plus THEIR costs as well So if they have a huge legal team of sharks trying to fuck over the Average Joe force them to pay Joe what Joe spent on his own lawyer plus what they spent on theirs Ie the larger their own legal team the larger the clapback should be The message here is that companies shouldnt get a free pass just because they have a bunch of asshole lawyers willing to dick people over The more lawyers they hire the more it should hurt them when they do shit like this,mrfn1d1,8.0,1kii3yi
comment,ms2tohh,TheOneWes,,1,2025-05-13 12:11:02,,,,First you have to pay for it all while its going on and second no The losing party is not inherently obligated to pay for everything You have to sue for court costs and lawyer fees in addition to whatever your case is actually for and the judge may or may not grant you court costs and lawyer fees in whole or in part,mrfn1d1,8.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrg1sug,pogisanpolo,,2,2025-05-09 16:44:58,,,,Iirc the answer to that was to bundle all the complaints then file them all at once and now the firm is stuck with set of arbitration fees when put together is bigger than a class action suit,mrfehg4,6.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrghxfu,Sanakikster,,2,2025-05-09 18:05:40,,,,Ive seen that tried successfully but I believe the two big players in the arbitration space JAMS and AAA are both redoing their rules to prevent it happening going forward Maybe they have already I cant imagine it goes on for too much longer since the big law firms are basically their clients,mrg1sug,7.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrgm5u6,pogisanpolo,,2,2025-05-09 18:27:03,,,,Did some digging and they have In oversimplified terms the big things are the initial filing is now a flat amount regardless of the numbers and payments can wait for a bit until after proceedings are about to begin along with additional documentation requirements which makes things less painful for the defendants Theres still a percase fee but now theres discounts for sufficiently large quantities,mrghxfu,8.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrfe89j,None,,1,2025-05-09 14:45:14,,,,Unless there is a different Disney case youre thinking of that was regarding a binding arbitration clause for a single plaintiff rather than a class action and Disney ended up withdrawing their motion to force arbitration in that case before any Judge said anything,mrfc3ja,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrr7yfr,5c044,,1,2025-05-11 14:44:09,,,,I cant see how thats enforceable class actions exist because they are an efficient way for multiple persons who suffered the same injustice to get recompense So Nintendo are saying that you can sue them individually knowing that the legal process is very similar but your legal costs will exceed your damages and you may not get legal costs as part of your settlement so you probably wont do that and just go buy playstationXbox to replace your bricked switch,mrfaqz2,4.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrf4vl9,Joshawott27,,31,2025-05-09 13:55:34,,,,Given recent rulings about Apple and their App Store I wonder if a case could be made against Nintendo in the EU Im genuinely not sure just thinking out loud I imagine Nintendo are at least partially motivated to not allow emulation due to them still profiting from selling access to retro games via NSO so maybe an argument about monopolies could be made Where I think that could get tricky though is the legal nature of game sales being a license and an argument that owning a GameCube game only gives you a license to play it on a GameCube for example Also gaming as a medium being so new that every game would still be under some form of copyright However we already know that Nintendo can protect against piracy of Switch games due to them all having unique fingerprints that can be detected when played online So the next question would be whether full on bricking is even necessary,mrf1kua,1.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrf6xyb,DynamicMangos,,10,2025-05-09 14:06:52,,,,Does Valve want you to buy from their store Yeah of course The only reason the Steam Deck is as cheap as it is is because its subsidized by the Steam Store But do they FORCE you Nope You can install games from GOG or other sources just fine On Switch youre forced to give Nintendo their 30 and then they will also take extra money for playing online,mrf3hc8,2.0,1kii3yi
comment,mrfbb4w,LetsTwistAga1n,,-6,2025-05-09 14:30:05,,,,Yes because the Deck is basically a PC and the Switch is a console This is how it works in this dichotomy since the very beginning I dont understand what is unclear about that for some commenters and why Valve is praised for operating a PC platform like any PC platform,mrf6xyb,3.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrjhym8,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,1,2025-05-10 04:55:18,,,,So what about the PS3 That could NATIVELY run linux The GPU and some other resources were disabled in Other OS it was not suitable for any kind of advanced games Good for running a word processor and maybe some web browsing Not a reasonable comparison For your other comparisons yes of course those are not consoles A console is a game playing appliance If you turn it into something else then thats no longer what it is As for thats shitty Yeah of course it is So what Youre trying to claim that Steams proprietary ecosystem is better than Nintendos because Steam does its DRM through online activation and Nintendo does its DRM through hardware restriction Apparently you think that the greater hardware freedom that Steam allows is superior to the greater independence that Nintendo allows Thats subjective but you are wrong,mrg2m6e,5.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrnh5k1,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,1,2025-05-10 21:30:18,,,,All right I got distracted by your comment about DRM It isnt really the important thing so I separated that out below The important thing you are spinning the Steamdecks greater hardware freedom as can buy games anywhere while ignoring the fact that your notion of anywhere does not include offline By and large that isnt an option for PC gaming at all anymore thanks to Steam And you are ignoring the benefit of independence that Nintendos use of physical media gives to you Steam users seem to have this idiosyncratic notion of what DRM is which vilifies everyone except Steam Steam doesnt support anything DRMfree the only way that you can tell which games dont use Steamworks DRM is through third party lists of questionable accuracy And theres no enforcement so theres nothing to prevent DRM from being added after you buy the game Also even if a game doesnt implement DRM it very likely does link to other Steam libraries and so is not independent from Steam Also no Steam games come with installers and so if youre using Windows you need to be comfortable with making your own shortcuts and adding any registry entries that might be needed and if youre using Linux or Mac then you need to know where all the files go No matter what definition of DRM you use this is not in keeping with the spirit of what DRMfree means California recently passed a law which encapsulates this notion very well and Steam does not pass muster,mrks62b,7.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrf5drh,frisch85,,6,2025-05-09 13:58:18,,,,On one hand yeah a lot of people mod andor use custom roms to pirate but modding a console is not basically pirating someone could very well just mod it solely for homebrew And because of this unless you have some shady detection software going on its simply wrong to brick any device just because someone mods it,mrf2sf6,2.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrg9re2,proverbialbunny,,-2,2025-05-09 17:25:01,,,,Youre showing ignorance here Emulators make old games look better than they did in their original state They also can fix bugs the original had Likewise you can pick the system with the best version of the game Eg if there is an arcade version its probably better than the PC and console version so youll be able to play the best version of the game You can also play the best region version of the game with a translator patch Modern games may not emulate well while they work on the emulator and get the kinks out Modern games may require beefy hardware you may not have Emulation is for older games no longer sold Just wait until ray tracing is added to older games Emulators already look better with texture packs but the potential to go even further is there,mrfv84v,3.0,1kii3yi

comment,mrhseuc,Kresche,,0,2025-05-09 22:09:17,,,,Look The only semblance of a way for them to do something like this is if they offer Switch 2s like cellphones in payment plans paying for a switch 2 up front means the hardware and all software on it is yours to configure at will disassemble backup modify This would be an unlocked Switch 2 They have no legal bearing on actions taken with such devices All they can do is block you from their online servers and never let you connect it to Nintendo owned infrastructure again To brick your shit they need to sell a locked version that can only remain locked so long as the loan contract you agreed to hasnt been fully paid off They could also just create a sub class of locked loaner devices with the express terms that you actually do not own it and are simply allowed to use it while you maintain your foreverrent contact No way in hell theyre gonna do that This is super fluff BS from a company that says exactly these threats every release of a new console Theres always something they want you to believe is possible even though it definitely isnt Same goes for game cartridges You can pull that software out and copy it to your own premises to do whatever you want with it so long as you neither distribute it to others nor make a profit off of derivative works that include copies of any trademarked assets represented in the ROM data Thats all copyright or trademarked etc A fun legal question I have is whether you can prove that a specific ROM copy is any different than any other of the same ROM obviously you cant for basically all ROMs in existence today If you cant distinguish between two copies of the same ROM then distributing that exact ROM to someone who has proved to you that they own the cart already _should not be illegal in my 0 law background and very presumptive opinion_ If I happen to be making legal sense here then I can imagine that all the archiving websites currently under legal fire from Nintendo can simply continue existing legally if they just require people to legally swear in a stupid docusign or something that they legally own the physical cart and are allowed to own copies of its ROM Distributing the ROM to a legal owner of the cartridge does not infringe on any companys bottom line Idk Im just very passionate about this subject and find the laws around it fascinating The laws arent entirely concrete and you can only use them based on how they worked out in previous trials To actually find out what the law deems legal at any point Im pretty sure youd have to actually sue and try to fight your case Nintendo cannot inverseclassaction sue every person who acquires a copy of the ROM data that resides in their legally owned physical cart I imagine Idk,,0.0,1kii3yi
