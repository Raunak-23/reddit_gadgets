comment,n21qacv,VictoriaRose0,,-5,2025-07-08 20:07:23,,,,I could never get an Android tablet as they are now and I say that as an iPhone user thinking of switching to Android when my 13 Pro Max dies Unless youre just dying to sideload apps its just an inferior experience Even with iPadOS 26 fucking up using it for art Id rather just carry a drawing tablet and MacBook around if I have to considering professional artists are in the minority rather than switch to an android tablet Seriously though I cant fucking stand that theres no sizes bigger than 13 but they decided hey lets waste some space for round windows definitely didnt talk to any artists before doing that the whole reason its popular is because of how well it utilizes every mm of screen space compared to desktop,n20z7bv,1.0,1luupmj

comment,n226hme,VictoriaRose0,,1,2025-07-08 21:20:51,,,,To make multiple windows work better I dont get why they didnt just put all of that with stage manager but its kind of like how a desktop works You drag the windows around can snap them to sides but instead of a super thin non intrusive bar if youre like me and keep a reference window as skinny as a phone on the side now its completely clear with massive rounded corners so it floats Also no slide over window anymore So need another quick window for references maybe a whole different app perhaps Youll have to come up with some work around The way iPadOS is set up now its all I really need I used to need to use my phone for references which could easily pull me away from work but I could easily switch between apps with gestures and use it for references Theres enough screen real estate at 13 that I dont need to do that anymore but when I bought the iPad for how well it worked before the update with no compromises Im just not going to update and if nothing gets improved for us artists then they lost me theyll lose a lot of professionals They once again got blinded by the success and forget that they still havent actually taken off in the art industry just mainly online this couldve been a whole separate mode like they made with stage manager and just do visual changes to something only a loud minority of people were complaining about which was with stage manager Its like if desktop art programs got rid of a ton keyboard shortcuts because most users have a tablet with shortcut buttons built in theres still a lot of artists that rely on using a keyboard with their workflow you can have both No one was complaining about having the shortcuts probably just wanting a more touch friendly UI depending on the tablet,n220f0p,3.0,1luupmj
