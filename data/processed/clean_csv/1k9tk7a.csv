comment,mphjznk,ToMorrowsEnd,,179,2025-04-28 14:23:44,,,,And it will do so at extremely expensive prices for the ink I know someone that is a beta tester for that machine that print cost them 100 in ink to do the relief it prints many layers over and over to build it up a small ink set is 250 and that print demoed uses about 12 the ink They are marking up standard UV ink hard and putting it in sealed cartridges at a massive premium Standard UV ink is about 4060 a liter this setup gets you about 100ml for that same price,,0.0,1k9tk7a

comment,mpjj6k1,Emperor-Commodus,,2,2025-04-28 20:17:44,,,,Another source says the ink cartridges are 299 A 2000 printer with 300 ink cartridges isnt cheap printer expensive ink its just expensive everything In the cheap printer expensive ink model the printers are extremely cheap sometimes even less expensive than the ink refill itself Theyre intentionally heavily subsidized to lock the consumer in This printer is far too expensive to make the model work Usually UV printers are in the 30000 to 50000 range Anker is marketing this printer to makers for home use Its not the same as a 50k machine aimed at manufacturers like the Casio mentioned in the article Again did you read the article It explicitly mentions this UV printing isnt a new technology The process uses UVcurable inks to apply layers of color onto a surface that can dry almost instantly when subjected to specific wavelengths of light This means it can coat practically any surface from paper to wood to acrylic You can find a fair number of desktopsized UV flatbed printers ranging from 2000 up to 7000 For something that offers 3D texture you normally have to shell out a lot more money Back in 2018 Casio showed off similar 3D printing features with a 50000 UV printer That sort of tech is now far more affordable Anker calls its latest eufyMake device the first 3D texture UV printer for home use,mpj8ebv,4.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpwt40p,Call_Me_Mack,,3,2025-04-30 21:19:38,,,,Just wanted to point out the 300 for ink is for an entire replacement kit Otherwise I think the individual inks are around 42 for 100ml each Most reviews on YouTube so far say the ink usage isnt bad unless you are doing the embossing3d prints all the time or large prints at maximum heights Otherwise regular prints are fair it seems,mpjj6k1,5.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpvonir,tankueray,,1,2025-04-30 18:02:21,,,,Okay let me clarify something here Most current UV printers are very large format sign printers like for billboards and they can even cost over 6 figures Flatbed printers of this type were initially dreamed up as DTG printers and they were quite expensive because tshirts are always a money maker it wasnt because the printer was cutting edge technology Casio was way late to the game btw Well before 2018 Direct Color Systems were selling units based off of the Epson dx5 printers that could go higher than 5mm Iirc they were around 25000 45000 and were made to withstand commercial production but no bigger than any nonKornit DTG printer or 40W RF laser system at the time I checked them out at every trade show I attended but there is limited ROI for commercial printing applications and bespoke items take too much human time to actually be profitable At the same time Roland was selling a 20 solvent printercutter using the dx7 printhead for under 10000 and a professional vinyl cutter or sublimation system was under 1000 The markup was only because of wanting to cash in on the folks that were coming from Cricut vinyl cutting into the professional market who didnt have the space or clientele to screen print or print billboards and who saw the DTG printers as their golden ticket Those first A3 sized UV flatbeds looked nearly identical to the DTGs as well I never saw those little phone case sized UV printers at a trade show that market was and still is dominated by sublimation which was not only faster and cheaper but the customer could send a photo from their phone to the queue while standing in line and it was ready when they got to the front That entire printerheat presssoftware system was less than 3000 and extremely portable What system do you think the Cricut moms bought into What is the marketing strategy of this printer again Sublimation was a cheap way to get into the business but it wasnt cheap to stay in because of proprietary printers ink software and specially coated blanks Guess what Cricut marketed to their makermoms after the big sublimation patent wars were sorted out To be fair most of the DTGUV printers like that at the time were assembled by hand in the US from off the shelf Epson printers without Epsons permission so some of the cost was actual smallscale labor fabrication and electronics And the high cost of all professional systems includes inperson training and human tech support from your regional reps at nearly any time of day or night,mpjj6k1,5.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mphn95j,fraseyboo,,31,2025-04-28 14:40:39,,,,Ooof thats a tough sell for now then Thankfully the 3D printing community are insanely good at open sourcing solutions so well probably see a much cheaper version soon Thatll inevitably be followed up by companies making their own versions too Give it maybe a year or so and this tech will be available from pretty much every major 3D printer manufacturer,mphjznk,1.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mphur3a,jjayzx,,26,2025-04-28 15:18:52,,,,Ink printers would have been done long ago but the ongoing issue is the print head No easy way to make one There needs to be a company willing to design and sell an open source print head,mphn95j,2.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpi30g5,Gecko23,,19,2025-04-28 15:59:41,,,,It wouldnt be surprising if the print head for this machine is novel and covered by active patents Youll see the 3rd party innovation when those expire just like FDM exploded after a number of key patents went away,mphur3a,3.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpiu9ow,NotAHost,,4,2025-04-28 18:12:38,,,,I know ink print heads more than Id like to admit due to grad school and some of my jobs While there are a lot of patents around ink print heads there are a lot of brands out there and with respect to printing something as simple as a UV ink ie not particle loaded normal viscosity range 1020cps you can pretty much use any branded print head Print heads are usually manufactured with a semiconductorMEMslike process so open source for print heads are much more difficult However finding the cheapest COTS printhead and building around it is likely you can find a variety of projects on hackaday for example A big challenge with any sort of ink print head is that they dry out and fail You can do things to keep them from drying out but from a consumer perspective we are spoiled by low maintenance devices and ink print heads always have some routine maintenance such as flushing with a solvent made for the ink or keeping it plugged in to occasionally jet and refilling the ink as an operating cost even when youre not using the printer I wouldnt put it past the open source community to find innovative ways to keep printheads from drying out I did my own sort of hacks at my job but IMO its a matter of scale and Im not sure if there will be a large enough community to maintain drive in open source UV printers,mpi30g5,4.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpj09wt,ToMorrowsEnd,,3,2025-04-28 18:42:32,,,,Im betting 100 its the same Epson UV printhead used on all UV printers sold,mpi30g5,4.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mphxh36,fraseyboo,,4,2025-04-28 15:32:25,,,,A lot of the advancements weve seen in 3D printing have come from large projects like Voron and Klipper along with dedicated enthusiasts like CNCKitchen There are definitely challenges with building a printhead like this but theres a big enough enthusiast community out there thatll figure out most of the RD for free If you look at a project like Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder youll see how the open source community integrate with companies to regularise a specification and make kits that eventually leads to commercial implementations,mphur3a,3.0,1k9tk7a

comment,mpkqr5b,Sylanthra,,4,2025-04-29 00:17:30,,,,Can you use normal filament 3d printer for the shape and this to paint over it as a finishing step,mphjznk,1.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpvqw10,tankueray,,1,2025-04-30 18:13:08,,,,Ive also wondered about this and given my experience with both technologies Im hypothesizing that you might be able to build up some base depth with FDM but it would have to be mostly flat so that the laser depth finders would still be able to focus enough to give the required print resolution Any more than about 1mm will probably leave those lower levels looking fuzzy or oversprayed An alternative would be to use the UV printer to print a background then 3D print on the substrate whatever element you really wanted to stand out a la hueforge,mpkqr5b,2.0,1k9tk7a
comment,mpr363v,joe_bibidi,,1,2025-04-29 23:48:15,,,,Not to defend it but it strikes me like this is going to be something for like small business hustler types It doesnt really make much sense to me for general enthusiast purposes or for real industrial applications it feels like some of those cheap read not that cheap embroidery machines that streetwear startups were using like crazy in the 2010s But in this case itll be like shitty art stalls at bad street fairs selling knockoff BasquiatsWarholsetc for 300 with 200 of production costs under their belt,mphjznk,1.0,1k9tk7a
