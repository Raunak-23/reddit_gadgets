comment,mpj0r8g,akeean,,840,2025-04-28 18:44:55,,,,Clipboard access is a risk to anyone that copies pastes sensitive data and multitasks Thats exactly why some browsers require you to give explicit permission for access to clipboard,,0.0,1ka32je
comment,mpjeien,TechieBrew,,312,2025-04-28 19:54:23,,,,Everything is a risk nowadays For instance I use password managers that I sometimes have to go into to copypaste my password But I only started using a password manager bc typing out your password on the keyboard is a risk to anyone who does that bc keylogging is a thing,mpj0r8g,1.0,1ka32je
comment,mpjousy,NorysStorys,,153,2025-04-28 20:45:49,,,,Genuinely the only secure login method is 2 factor or token login because they either need access to two of your devices which is unlikely or physical access to a token or the very unlikely means to cryptographically break the cypher to get into anything Hell Microsoft urges you to be passwordless and login via an authentication app now and boy golly the amount of attempts to get into my Microsoft account numbers in the hundreds a week but unless they have access to my phone and email they cannot get in,mpjeien,2.0,1ka32je

comment,mpkaw4y,gargravarr2112,,18,2025-04-28 22:46:34,,,,Yubikeys support FIDO and U2F which are established standards Major platforms like Google and GitHub support them But youre right smaller services either dont or charge extra to use it Strong 2FA should not be a paid extra _,mpjube4,4.0,1ka32je
comment,mpmbmf7,deSuspect,,1,2025-04-29 06:50:41,,,,While I agree it should be standard if it costs a company to implement it why do you think it should be free If its a big enough company they can eat up the costs but for smaller ones it might just be too expensive,mpkaw4y,5.0,1ka32je

comment,mqi8mnd,gargravarr2112,,1,2025-05-04 08:33:50,,,,Theres a cost of implementing and maintaining U2F sure But the cost of running it is no different to the common TOTP code currently in use ie its just the computational cost So it could be factored into the broader implementation cost of 2FA Dont get me wrong I like that even free services commonly implement TOTP now But itd be nice if they didnt view Yubikeys and their equivalents as extras after all the customer has already paid for the key itself so paying extra to use it is infuriating,mpmbmf7,6.0,1ka32je

comment,mpmekqg,Vexxt,,6,2025-04-29 07:20:24,,,,The implicit inclusion of sms as a function of 2fa is what it takes issue with Sms as two factor isnt really two factor because its not a possession factor its a just in time password delivered in plaintext I take issue with may as its no longer a good standard,mpkhb1a,6.0,1ka32je

comment,mpjwo2j,shadowblade159,,13,2025-04-28 21:26:14,,,,You generally can and probably should set up more than one finger as your fingerprint access for your phone or laptop If you lose all of them well youve probably got bigger problems to worry about,mpju4gh,5.0,1ka32je
comment,mpjy89n,IchBinMalade,,9,2025-04-28 21:34:37,,,,You can register more than one on both hands but most if not all devices with biometrics let you use a PINpassword since you dont need to lose a finger for it not to work wet hands gloves If thats an issue though then might as well worry about getting amnesia and forgetting your passwords At some point you gotta ask yourself whats the likelihood that this will fail and how much convenience am I willing to sacrifice for more security And for the vast majority of people the answer is not much honestly Nobody is going after you specifically so your main goal is to do what you need to do so that when a company inevitably fucks up and your data is leaked the damage will be minimal side note I wanted to just respond to your fingerprint comment the rest isnt addressing you specifically I just went on a tangent,mpju4gh,5.0,1ka32je

comment,mq6hx93,alidan,,1,2025-05-02 11:43:25,,,,get a bad enough scar and your fingerprint is able to change enough to be unrecognizable burn yourself bad enough and it may not grow in the same pattern dont think of how secure or insecure it is imagine how much of a nightmare it is on the users side if something goes sideways this is why fingerprints are never supposed to be passwords they are at best usernames,mpjzfni,8.0,1ka32je
comment,mpjz9sh,Biking_dude,,1,2025-04-28 21:40:11,,,,No from my understanding when you register your fingerprint with your phone it saves the electrical signature your finger makes against the sensor IE its not saving your fingerprint its creating a key based on the resistance So if you lose a finger you can reregister a new print on your phone and then the phone analyzes the input to determine if its actually the person who registered it in the first place if it passes that test it then passes along that passed test to the site requesting authentication,mpju4gh,5.0,1ka32je

comment,mpnsl2l,Turmfalke_,,1,2025-04-29 14:00:11,,,,I use password managers because I cant remember enough secure passwords and dont want to type them in by hand From a programming perspective reading the clipboard content is easier than hijacking keyboard events,mpjeien,2.0,1ka32je
comment,mq6ijqz,alidan,,1,2025-05-02 11:47:44,,,,the only things that get secure passwords are important things to me everything else that demands I use a password and I could give a shit aboutwould never be hacked for nefarious reasons is 58 characters that I remember with a capital letter modifier if the side forces me to use one,mpnsl2l,3.0,1ka32je
comment,mptcrgz,curmudgeon69420,,1,2025-04-30 10:11:32,,,,password manager is more for the fact that people use the same password everywhere if they have to memorise it the manager at least means that you have different passwords and one leak wont compromise all your accounts,mpjeien,2.0,1ka32je
comment,mpkv7vy,None,,0,2025-04-29 00:43:36,,,,Its why I moved entirely to password manager of iOS or passkeys No longer typing them passwords but using face id Which is its own issue but at least one that I find easier to see,mpjeien,2.0,1ka32je

comment,mpkail5,gargravarr2112,,11,2025-04-28 22:44:26,,,,And why LineageOS pops up a message saying Application X pasted from your clipboard you should only ever see it when youre explicitly pasting the content The clipboard is by its very nature insecure and unsecurable and why every password manager going has a browser extensionintegrates with Android,mpj0r8g,1.0,1ka32je

comment,mpl4ffj,humble_squid,,10,2025-04-29 01:37:59,,,,Thats a bit of a leap to tie those two things together A legitimate app isnt going to siphon your credit card information to pay for some random persons dinner Im not familiar with the app but presumably it needs access to the clipboard to import recipes or something Its more likely your card got skimmed or you got phished,mpjij01,2.0,1ka32je
comment,mplya7k,Throwaway021614,,8,2025-04-29 04:52:10,,,,Thats exactly what an epicurious agent would say,mpl4ffj,3.0,1ka32je
comment,mplvxg2,Jacobaf20,,3,2025-04-29 04:34:01,,,,Exactly We often forget how vulnerable clipboard data actually is So many apps have clipboard access without us thinking twice about it Its pretty wild that most operating systems dont have a feature to auto expire clipboard contents after like 30 seconds that would solve a lot of these issues I appreciate browsers requiring explicit permission but we need that same level of protection systemwide especially on mobile devices where were constantly copying sensitive info,mpj0r8g,1.0,1ka32je
comment,mpj649z,Niceguy955,,258,2025-04-28 19:11:43,,,,The Samsung clipboard leak has been known for years It was reported to them several times and they didnt care Their clipboard retains everything even if you use an alternative keyboard and cant be disabled without jailbreaking I find myself clearing it manually every time I use my password manager This is the main reason why none of my next devices will ever be a Samsung,,0.0,1ka32je
comment,mplf7n0,asen23,,6,2025-04-29 02:41:28,,,,you can uninstall samsung keyboard without jailbreaking you only need a pc and adb The only downside i know is that you cant use password lock because it is hardcoded to use samsung keyboard,mpj649z,1.0,1ka32je
comment,mpm8nff,Niceguy955,,2,2025-04-29 06:21:43,,,,It comes back after every reboot according to what I read or at the very least after every upgrade Its part of OneUI At any rate you only need a pc and adb probably helps only 1 of 1 of users,mplf7n0,2.0,1ka32je
comment,mpm8zbm,asen23,,3,2025-04-29 06:24:53,,,,i did that 2 months ago and it never came back for me i already rebooted multiple times and iirc i got atleast two security updates If it came back after major oneui upgrade then its a hassle but not that much,mpm8nff,3.0,1ka32je
