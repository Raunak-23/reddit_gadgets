comment,mr7kcfa,Sueti_Bartox,,19,2025-05-08 07:56:38,,,,Its not as complicated as it sounds chinese characters are made up of radicals That is you will see repeating parts to the characters which have some original meaning which may not be relevant to modern characters such as fire tree knife man woman etc It is not so unlike the common prefixes suffixes and derivatives in english from ancient greek and latin,mr6q6wt,1.0,1khbsn4

comment,mr6qmea,SpicyRice99,,22,2025-05-08 03:32:07,,,,They dont Iirc most Chinese readerwriters can recall 1530kish characters and the rest you look up in a dictionary or search online,mr6efdn,1.0,1khbsn4
comment,mr830fb,DJayBirdSong,,-3,2025-05-08 11:00:52,,,,its definitely more than 1530sh characters thats how many I had memorized after like half a semester of studying Basic literacy is like 23000 characters Edit LMAO I didnt see the k in 1530sh I really thought you were trying to say Chinese people can only read 30 words Are you saying Chinese people have 15k30k characters memorized though Cuz thats not right either but based on context I feel like thats not what youre saying,mr6qmea,2.0,1khbsn4
comment,mr9luny,SpicyRice99,,3,2025-05-08 16:09:53,,,,Probably half that amount actually Around 8k 80k seems excessive unless youre trying to have a extremely comprehensive dictionary No worries about the misread haha,mr830fb,3.0,1khbsn4
comment,mraeqf3,DJayBirdSong,,5,2025-05-08 18:29:22,,,,Yep 23k for newspapers 8k for educated is what Ive always heard Any more than that and theyre probably specialized in ancient literature or scientific fields or something,mr9luny,4.0,1khbsn4
comment,mr849cj,DJayBirdSong,,8,2025-05-08 11:10:38,,,,Characters are made up of different parts which help when looking at a new or uncommon word Radicals help you deduce meaning phonetic components help with pronunciation Now think about how you read Do you sound out each word Or do you look at a word and know its meaning intuitively Its the same with Chinese you grow up seeing it every day you internalize rather than memorize the characters Consider this English natives have huge vocabularies of 2000030000 words 8000 characters doesnt seem like very much nowand you only need 20003000 to read a Chinese newspaper If youre wondering how they can tell the difference between similar looking or sounding characters just think about how often you mix up the words interior and inferior or how you know the difference between tearing up at a wedding and tearing up a dance floor Chinese is a contextual language if you know whats going on around an unfamiliar character you could guess its meaning pretty easily Or yes look it up Just like English users look up unfamiliar and uncommon words in a dictionary its easyespecially with technologyto look up unfamiliar characters Hope this helps Edit apparently Ive never seen numbers before Just realized youre saying 80000 not 8000 Thats even easier to answer Depending on how you want to count it there are 6000001 million English words But the average native only uses 2000030000 Still a keyboard should be able to type every possible English word Same with a Chinese keyboard No most people probably dont know or use 馘 cut off the left ear of the slain but if this keyboard can write characters containing all of the components of 馘 for other words then it can also type 馘 Im leaving now before I fundamentally misunderstand anything else,mr6efdn,1.0,1khbsn4

comment,mr8dbc2,avocadosconstant,,2,2025-05-08 12:14:34,,,,Going from Traditional to Simplified does not reduce the number of characters Simplified uses fewer strokes for some radicals components of characters Its argued that Simplified is faster to learn and write but all things considered this is like going from a standard transmission to an automatic when learning to drive There was an inquiry a few years ago about going back to Traditional or maybe half way Traditional has often been seen as more beautiful and refined than Simplified and more connected with literary culture But people overwhelmingly rejected the idea Simplified is pretty ingrained now,mr73bsi,2.0,1khbsn4

comment,mrc1syo,peixia,,1,2025-05-08 23:40:49,,,,When I first started learning Chinese in the late 1980s even using a dictionary was a challenging task for a Westerner Ponderous and requiring flipping of the thinnest pages back and forth between radical tables the actual character lists using those radicals and finally arriving upon the definition itself It was awesome and a serious effort The language itself is a phenomenal testament to the complexity of human brains and their capacity to figure out written communication I only saw a typewriter once or twice during my time there And yes the skills to use it are apparently insane Like exponential to the dictionary experience described above,,0.0,1khbsn4
