comment,mxkffii,ergotpoisoning,,73,2025-06-13 14:18:16,,,,For anyone in this thread wanting to get into photography but put off by this insane pricing get a used DSLR with some used lenses You can get a used Nikon D750 for 500 and a Nikkor 50mm 18G for 150,,0.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxl8sju,Quillspiracy18,,38,2025-06-13 16:37:52,,,,Or go Micro 43rds like I just did and you can get likenew weathersealed bodies image stabilisation and fancy composite image features for less than half the price of the camera in the article Especially handy for noobs who want to try wildlife photography since the smaller sensor means zoom lenses are far more accessible and relatively tiny,mxkffii,1.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxmbt0l,Skratymir,,7,2025-06-13 19:44:26,,,,I use a Lumix G909195 number depends on region Great camera but more expensive than getting an old DSLR Still a lot cheaper than the Fuji in the post though and a lot easier to use and more featurerich than an old DSLR Apart from Lumix Olympus also makes great cheap M43 cameras such as the E10 If you want to budget get one used mpbcom is a great store for used camera gear,mxm7thu,3.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxph8qa,speculatrix,,3,2025-06-14 07:56:16,,,,My Lumix G9 was only 700 new on sale a few years ago Incredible camera Paired with some lightly used Leica lenses it produces great results,mxmbt0l,4.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxmedji,Quillspiracy18,,3,2025-06-13 19:57:12,,,,Well I got an Olympus EM1 Mark III for 550 750 but you probably could get the Mark II for one or two hundred less for pretty much the same camera Mark III just has a little joystick to change the location of the focus and more incamera composite options like handheld highres and live ND for blurred movement shots without needing a filter Panasonic makes M43 cameras too but I dont know much about their models The lenses are interchangeable between the two brands though so you dont have to worry as much about getting locked in to a platform like with other brands,mxm7thu,3.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxqnqg0,Lied-,,1,2025-06-14 13:47:32,,,,I have a 2000 Sony FF and some pretty nice lenses but they are hella heavy and hard to travel with Im determined to change to APSC or M43 for this reason Be honest with me can I still get nice zoom shots of landscapes at sunset after dark of cityscapes Im hesitant haha,mxl8sju,2.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxrkqka,Quillspiracy18,,1,2025-06-14 16:43:44,,,,I havent tried anything at night or sunset yet so I cant say for certain It is a struggle to get things sharp in lower light if you need the shutter speed though thats probably less of an issue for landscapes If you want to go completely off the rails with zoom though you can get a 150600mm lens 3001200mm full frame equivalent for 2000 rather than 20000 But if a smaller camera gets you out more because its easier to carry then that just means more photos A decent photo is better than no photo,mxqnqg0,3.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxsm5kq,Lied-,,1,2025-06-14 20:01:04,,,,A decent photo is definitely better And Im planning to take mostly prime lenses anyways so I guess Ill just hope theres enough resolution to crop Thank you,mxrkqka,4.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxmpbv9,Real_Establishment56,,9,2025-06-13 20:51:27,,,,Remember when you could get a small point and shoot with a little bit of real optical zoom for 1000 Pepperidge Farm remembers Ive looked at Fuji Sony Pentax Leica all way above the 1000 mark And Canon doesnt even do a point and shoot anymore I dont know what the fuck theyre doing over there I used to haul 20kgs of DSLR and lenses around every holiday Got sick of that and sold it all But the phone just doesnt do it Point and shoot or 43 that can fit in a small bag is where its at But no idea what to get,,0.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxq4fyd,_das_f_,,2,2025-06-14 11:37:11,,,,Not sure its exactly what youre looking for but Im quite happy with my Fuji XS20 1650 kit as a convenient step up from my phone camera When I bought it it was about 1200 CHF The cheaper kit was 1100 Of course I dont know what prices are like in your region,mxmpbv9,1.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxjwi5o,thisagaingm,,11,2025-06-13 12:33:35,,,,It is a good camera It is overpriced though This is an entrylevel camera in this class and the price should be closer to 800 If this is 1600 then I cant imagine what their next midtier device is going to cost In the world of interchangeable lens cameras Fuji makes things very accessible and lowers the barriers for folks who do not want to spend as much time in the processing stages The devices are not limited to this approach but they do an incredible job with it This has given them the ability to charge these outrageous prices for them despite the competition being able to deliver equally and often more capable devices at a lower price I enjoy the processing stage and I still have a Fuji for this reason,mxjr7cl,1.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxjyutf,layeterla,,18,2025-06-13 12:47:56,,,,While I do agree it is overpriced it is not an entry level camera and there is no way you can buy a camera with IBIS and aluminium plated 8001000 dolar is indeed for entry level cameras which fuji also sells its xm5 for that price Compared to that camera this has better sensor better build IBIS EVF As far as I know there is no camera at your price range match these specs Except EVF,mxjwi5o,2.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxn3brl,NavidsonRcrd,,2,2025-06-13 22:04:16,,,,It might be worth looking into film photography then You can get a top of the line late 90s Canon or Minolta with lenses for dirt cheap and even a classic allmechanical SLR or rangefinder from brands like Minolta Nikon or Pentax can be found easily often for 1300 Youll get a great camera that will have a timeless look and feel while learning the exposure skills that most take for granted today It makes photography much more engaging and rewarding imo,mxkmrgw,3.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxnr5jy,Salaminizer-,,1,2025-06-14 00:22:22,,,,I have an iPhone 15 Serious question how good is the camera on that versus a standalone camera,mxn3brl,4.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxnt9f5,NavidsonRcrd,,2,2025-06-14 00:35:30,,,,Pretty apples to oranges imo Ive found iPhone photos while technically great lack a certain realness because they do way too much postprocessing It might not be a sharper image due to small sensor size but apples ai is going to juice it up to what it thinks it should look like which gives photos a very flashy processed look you wont get with unedited film Film renders very differently and to many has a more pleasant look than digital Finegrain film with good lenses can create incredibly sharp beautiful photos that you just cant get out of a phone camera while phone cameras will give you more immediate tools to use within a scene but force a lot of its own software magic into your photo for better or worse An iPhone will take great photos for you but shooting on a standalone film camera will make YOU take better photos with it if that makes sense Thats my two cents hope its helpful,mxnr5jy,5.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxoaxge,Salaminizer-,,1,2025-06-14 02:20:51,,,,Thank you for the answer That makes a lot of sense actually I felt like a lot of people would say to not buy a camera and just use my the one with my phone This makes me feel better about justifying a camera purchase,mxnt9f5,6.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxjzp9f,UnsorryCanadian,,3,2025-06-13 12:52:54,,,,As someone who likes the concept of photography but has only ever owned a single 20 year old used camera without a manual mode 800 for an entry model is crazy,mxjwi5o,2.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxk1crc,thisagaingm,,2,2025-06-13 13:02:26,,,,I dont disagree that the prices are very high Fuji does offer manual mode by default You set the priorities at each parameter if you wish to automate If I want aperture priority I can set the shutter speed to A If I do not I can manually set the shutter speed The same applies to setting shutter priority by setting the aperture to A or setting or not setting auto ISO,mxjzp9f,3.0,1lad4ay

comment,mxlfnbe,Perfect_Opinion7909,,2,2025-06-13 17:09:56,,,,How does it compare to the much hyped X100VI asking for a friend who has no clue about cameras,mxjwi5o,2.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxnk0tg,fourthdawg,,2,2025-06-13 23:39:33,,,,The main selling point of the X100 series is their optical viewfinder and it is a fixed lens camera you cant change the lens but there are several adaptors to convert the lens into different focal lengths XE line is an interchangeable lens camera with EVF so you can switch to a variety of lenses regarding to your needs Both cameras are compact and a rangefinderstyle camera the viewfinder is in the corner of the body instead of in the middle like a typical SLR In terms of image and video quality they shouldve been similar provided youre using a similar lens to X100 on XE3 due to their sharing the same sensor,mxlfnbe,3.0,1lad4ay
comment,mxmupbq,thisagaingm,,1,2025-06-13 21:18:25,,,,They can be used for overlapping needs but the experiences will be different The fixed lens of the X100VI and the option for using the optical viewfinder being key differences I dont know much beyond that because I have no experience with these two cameras I expect that with a similar lens you would get pretty much the same result I dont know for sure though,mxlfnbe,3.0,1lad4ay
