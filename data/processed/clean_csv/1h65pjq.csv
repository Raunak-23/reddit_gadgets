comment,m0b6pv0,OffbeatDrizzle,,420,2024-12-04 03:04:03,,,,pretty sure the pi 3 and 4 were capable of this also it only has to be able to decode some video,,0.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0blmus,Guzabra,,201,2024-12-04 04:45:41,,,,I think the big news here is that they semi officially worked with Valve on the implementation Not sure if the pi 3 and 4 had a similar collaboration Sam Lantinga from Valve worked with the Raspberry Pi team on optimizing for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware,m0b6pv0,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0c484s,hi_im_bored13,,80,2024-12-04 07:30:37,,,,The previous steam link for linux was also optimized for the 3b but even wired it struggled with anything past 1080 andor higher bitrates And then I could never get it stable on the pi4 for whatever reason h265 or not though I switched to moonlight sunshine which I find better than steam link in general,m0blmus,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0d62if,Kichigai,,5,2024-12-04 13:34:59,,,,Its probably because Valve decided on backing Wayland over X X has been around for decades and I remember getting it going on a 386 laptop with a 4bit grayscale display and like 16MB of RAM Something tells me Wayland is a little more demanding than X,m0c484s,3.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0g3khf,darkriftx2,,5,2024-12-04 22:44:02,,,,Wayland uses the GPU for compositing and this puts a strain on older Pi models The GPU also uses more of the shared system memory to perform these tasks,m0d62if,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0g6njy,WestCV4lyfe,,1,2024-12-04 23:01:04,,,,Moonlight can run without X as well I have it running on a pi5 with a dpi24 vga gpio hat to a CRT Easier than trying to get Crtemudriver working And its insanely fast without x,m0d62if,4.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0c3cax,GimpyGeek,,14,2024-12-04 07:21:26,,,,Yep they launched the pi version shortly after the Steam Link hardware was discontinued on purpose,m0bffvv,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0co3bm,TheTerrasque,,2,2024-12-04 11:09:31,,,,I have both steam link and raspi 3 And steam link on the lg tv os and on the fire stick I always go back to the actual steam link box because it just works much better Maybe now its finally time to retire it,m0bffvv,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0bybgn,Hypno--Toad,,14,2024-12-04 06:31:43,,,,Pi 4 did with certain builds pi 5 just has the grunt we expected in the pi 4 People still dont know how to run 4k on pi 4 when I make it clear they need x265 not x264 encoding The pi 5 power management is so much better than 4,m0b6pv0,1.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0chhsz,anomaly256,,9,2024-12-04 09:59:06,,,,Thats because those top tier CPUs back then didnt have MPEG2 decoding hardware The pi3 actually did but you needed to configure it and purchase a license to enable it,m0c85i8,2.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0dacw2,beefstenders,,7,2024-12-04 14:02:45,,,,MoonlightSunshine allows for some truly edge case bullshit Ive got Sunshine set up to allow 2 connections to the host literally so I can have 1 session streaming to my TV and a second session to a laptop sat next to me with specific wired peripherals plugged in a Logitech G600 and a G13 because I cannot play FFXIV with a pad to save my life Thinking about it I could probably do it with a Pi and fire a command over SSH to initiate the second connection,m0bkvqs,2.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0bx50n,dandroid126,,46,2024-12-04 06:20:39,,,,With sunshinemoonlight if both ends are wired ethernet the latency is manageable imo There is definitely some added latency but unless Im playing a competitive FPS game its totally fine For single player games I hardly even notice it unless Im looking for it,m0bcou8,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0c0lb3,TooStrangeForWeird,,-8,2024-12-04 06:53:37,,,,My PC is wired and I sit right next to a 5G router with my phone Moonlight says something like 1415ms delay,m0bx50n,2.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0ekhow,mxrider108,,1,2024-12-04 18:08:40,,,,I think they mean a 5GHz access point,m0cwlzf,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gd5ot,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2024-12-04 23:38:46,,,,5Ghz router if you want to be all technical about it Its not an access point its a router There is a hardwired access point on the other side of the house but the one Im talking about is the router,m0ekhow,5.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gd04z,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2024-12-04 23:37:52,,,,Its not an AP though it can be configured as one Its the main router,m0cwlzf,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0bo138,primaryrhyme,,15,2024-12-04 05:04:05,,,,I thought the same based on previous attempts but just tried it with steam deck today and it was amazing Actually feels smoother than native steam deck for RDR2 as the deck can only run it at 3040 fps latency wasnt noticeable,m0bcou8,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0cnguf,Zephyrical16,,3,2024-12-04 11:03:05,,,,I just got a steam deck to replace my steam link Gonna have to try this Been loving the deck for streaming shows so far,m0bo138,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dcpr5,primaryrhyme,,1,2024-12-04 14:17:37,,,,Native is still preferable on titles where it makes sense but for modern AAA titles its a great option make sure your main PC is on Ethernet if you can Added benefit is that you get 4x battery life on the deck since its just streaming,m0cnguf,3.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gkr2j,Zephyrical16,,1,2024-12-05 00:23:33,,,,Wow its insane how much better the Steam Deck is than the Steam Link at that Steam Link was basically unplayable for all games even with both on ethernet Steam Deck both on ethernet worked wonderfully for a quick test on the two games I tried Northgard and Hades,m0dcpr5,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0c3k5w,GimpyGeek,,6,2024-12-04 07:23:40,,,,Theres definitely considerations Network conditions are very important ethernet is the most solid way to handle it Anything wifi is asking for trouble but if its connected to 24ghz instead of 5ghz its likely to get interference and get screwed up real easily,m0bcou8,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0bhpr9,CatProgrammer,,8,2024-12-04 04:16:52,,,,And Steam Deck Steam Link on your phone assuming you can afford one,m0bcou8,1.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0bw14p,im_thatoneguy,,10,2024-12-04 06:10:33,,,,Unfortunately weve kinda plateaued The encode decode time actually is greater than most wired LAN connections by like 20x and decoding YouTube or Netflix faster isnt a high priority investment for GPUs My parsec streams are about the same latency on an integrated Qualcomm soc as they are on an Nvidia 3090,m0bmta0,3.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0f0aew,JukePlz,,1,2024-12-04 19:27:26,,,,I was talking about rendering latency that happens before anything even hits the encoding phase and has been tested to be significantly impacted by high CPU and GPU utilization But yeah once you get to a certain limit you cant just cut off anymore of the latency related to encoding and network transport,m0bw14p,4.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0cjpmk,kryst4line,,6,2024-12-04 10:23:25,,,,Why not Docks exist for this reason Want to connect it to the TV Then put it on the dock And now that were already wired why not just to invest in connecting it through ethernet,m0bwcmi,5.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dax09,dakoellis,,2,2024-12-04 14:06:18,,,,If youre just going to use it docked why spend the money on something like a steam deck instead of just getting a steam link,m0cjpmk,6.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dtrfy,kryst4line,,0,2024-12-04 15:53:09,,,,Who said it was only to use it docked I fail to see where it was mentioned,m0dax09,7.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0d0krb,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2024-12-04 12:56:51,,,,The link needs to be wired If both are wired latency is going to be shit always The link being wired solves most of the issue,m0bwcmi,5.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dasgy,dakoellis,,1,2024-12-04 14:05:31,,,,I asume you mean if both are wireless but Im not talking about a link Im talking about handheld devices the point of them is to be mobile not tethered in a specific spot,m0d0krb,6.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gtf4y,Zephyrical16,,1,2024-12-05 01:15:06,,,,The link was unplayable even when wired I had two and this was across three different places Ive lived Just got a Steam Deck to replace it and its a night and day difference in latency Added bonus of not needing my power hungry PC with monitors on to play something like Balatro in my living room or to stream some content,m0d0krb,6.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0ezgb2,JukePlz,,1,2024-12-04 19:23:14,,,,Latency is not just a networking issue tho Thats only one part of it you still need CPU and GPU power to minimize rendering latency which is mainly what I was hinting at,m0bnmp5,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gayts,gramathy,,1,2024-12-04 23:25:56,,,,Yeah but if youre streaming it from a PC to a handheld as described youre not going to change the rendering performance The biggest latency increase that computer hardware has an impact on is video encodedecode can be up to a whole frame of extra latency before you start effectively dropping frames which can be very fast with low latency settings like what youd use for this application,m0ezgb2,5.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0bvymk,TheDreamWoken,,2,2024-12-04 06:09:55,,,,Yeah I found that to be the most effective,m0bcou8,1.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0dz12n,redkeyboard,,2,2024-12-04 16:20:25,,,,The hub is an Amazon basics USB 20 hub that is powered I recommend a powered hub for sure and USB 20 unless you really need 30 in that case I got a 50ft fiber optic active cable that was more expensive than long HDMI cables haha I use it with regular dongles like Logitech Microsoft etc my Bluetooth dongle is from aliexpress I believe links get scrutinized but its just a USB dongle with 2 big screw on antennas There should be many sellers for it Cost me like 6,m0drl4f,5.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0efm5e,redkeyboard,,1,2024-12-04 17:44:20,,,,yeah actually I didnt get a fiber optic one see 2nd image Still you can now get hdmi 21 cables that are 48gbps for cheaper especially from china websites and such I also use an HDMI splitter so it works on multiple TVs the latest one I got also downscales if a TV doesnt support the resolutionframerate its not perfect but its useful for sure,m0e1dvf,7.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0d29fj,zil,,2,2024-12-04 13:08:56,,,,I wish there was an affordable wireless HDMI solution every few years I look into it and find that theres no innovation,m0c0isl,2.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0e8rbj,Tig992,,4,2024-12-04 17:09:49,,,,Its always fun seeing someone want a top speced current gen Pi you ask them what theyre gonna do with it and they say its gonna be their dedicated PiHole And then you ideally gently tell em that they can do that for a fraction of the price with a Pi Zero and life gets so much nicer,m0d0xb8,3.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0b5dm0,AlexHimself,,36,2024-12-04 02:55:45,,,,So is this basically to compete with gaming consoles Like if you want to have a bunch of random steam games and play them on your TV with the controller or something Or do you actually use a keyboard and mouse connected to this thing while using your TV Is this for retro games or controller games Whats the target audience Id imagine if I was playing an intense PC game I would need the keyboard and mouse But if I were playing some casual games controller would be nice,,0.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0bm1r9,Guzabra,,19,2024-12-04 04:48:49,,,,No its more of an extension to your main gaming PC allowing to use it more as a console that you gan move around your house It has dedicated OS to connect to your PC and load the steam library to stream the games over the network I have a Steam Link and it was a wonderful device but the wifi streaming was hit or miss Hardwired I never had issues,m0b5dm0,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dyihb,StonebellyMD,,2,2024-12-04 16:17:48,,,,So are any of these options better than just an HDMI cable run from PC to TV combined with an HDMI switch to swap between my comp monitors and my tv,m0bm1r9,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0dzefc,Guzabra,,1,2024-12-04 16:22:18,,,,Nope Ive tried a bunch and if you can do itspouse allows it an HDMI cable has always been better,m0dyihb,3.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0dzkpm,Ahnteis,,5,2024-12-04 16:23:11,,,,I have 2 of the old steamlink boxes Theyre great for playing PC games on a big screen I have a keyboard mouse if needed but most of the time Im using xbox controllers We tend to use it mostly for splitscreen games but I do play the occasional SP game as well when I want to enjoy the much larger screen and better sound This is really where Steams Big Picture interface shines BTW its made for this use,m0b5dm0,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0e1eze,AlexHimself,,1,2024-12-04 16:32:36,,,,Woa tell me more about the split screen games Are you saying I can play some PC games with two players in split screen with my keyboardmouse somehow And then if I had one of these devices I could get a couple XBox controllers and play with a friend in my living room,m0dzkpm,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0e7gvq,Ahnteis,,1,2024-12-04 17:03:13,,,,Look for games with splitscreen or couch coop tags EG EDIT Most multiplayer games wont let 2 players be on same input so only 1 could use mousekeyboard Other would need a controller or both using separate controllers,m0e1eze,3.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0b7erk,Trustoryimtold,,8,2024-12-04 03:08:22,,,,Not so much Its just Remote Desktop software which has been around since before the first xbox had software for it Situationally useful depending on what you want to do but with limitations due to the nature of the multiple devices interacting over distances How you wanna control it is up to you you can give em Bluetooth ir usb we Wanna use your pa5 controller and an on screen keyboard Have at it,m0b5dm0,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0ctus4,Fgtfv567,,2,2024-12-04 12:03:47,,,,Streaming games lets you play them on your TV but you dont need to buy a console or HTPC to do so Nor do you need to haul your desktoplaptop to the TV or figure out a path for a super long HDMI cable An underrated bonus is that you dont have to wait to download games or updates again since thats all done once on your desktop You can play literally whatever game you want and ideally you would use a controller Steam input is fantastic to create custom profiles for games that dont work too well with controllers natively For example FPS games where aim assist and joystick aim can be replaced with gyro aim and flick stick If you really want to bring a mouse and keyboard you can but itll be a little awkward if you dont bring a little table to use it on,m0b5dm0,1.0,1h65pjq

comment,m0c3kp7,Caughtnow,,3,2024-12-04 07:23:50,,,,What window The thing you are typing this message on can likely stream games to it takes very little to run steam link Ive a 10 year old TV that you can stream to without any additional hardware How your devices are linked play a bigger role If your PC is hardwired and you have a strong wifi preferably 6 or newer signal on the receiving end phonetabletdeckwhatever you are good to go,m0bx5q9,1.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0cvw46,IllllIIIllllIl,,4,2024-12-04 12:20:48,,,,Anecdotal but my experience with the Steam Link app is that no matter the hardware or network involved it just runs like such absolute dogshit that Im unsure Valve is even still updating or doing anything with it Direct wired connections experiencing frequent and extreme latency spikes MoonlightSunshine on the same connection works absolutely flawlessly though,m0c3kp7,2.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0eed2c,SovietMacguyver,,1,2024-12-04 17:38:04,,,,Youre doing something very wrong in your network then Ive been using a Steam Link for almost a decade now via WiFi and its been flawless,m0cvw46,3.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0eio8e,IllllIIIllllIl,,2,2024-12-04 17:59:29,,,,Im very much not doing anything wrong as its quite difficult to fuck up a direct Ethernet connection I dont know if its an issue the NVIDIA Shield in particular has with the Steam Link app but a wired connection between my PC and Shield via a single gigabit switch and functioning Cat6 cables results in such severe latency issues its unusable while Moonlight works perfectly Im far from the only person youll find with this experience It is what it is and I have a working solution but Steam Link just doesnt function in any meaningful way for me and even if it did its lacking in options for high frame rate and occasionally has issues recognizing my controller,m0eed2c,4.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0gu4r1,Zephyrical16,,2,2024-12-05 01:19:18,,,,Yeah I also had the same issue Steam Link worked wonderfully for HTPC type things like streaming shows and such Boot up a game and the latency with inputs was unbearable Just got a Steam Deck and the latency wasnt noticeable when streaming stuff from my PC to the Deck Only messed around with it a bit but its a night and day difference The Steam Link just simply wasnt strong enough to decode everything in a timely manner even at time of release,m0eio8e,5.0,1h65pjq
comment,m0f54ds,SovietMacguyver,,-2,2024-12-04 19:51:37,,,,Then you all have something in common and that is your networks misconfiguration Works fine for everyone else,m0eio8e,5.0,1h65pjq
