comment,lwltw14,DarthBuzzard,,46,2024-11-11 17:04:10,,,,wccftechcom but the author doesnt understand tech Then again I suppose that is the norm for mainstream tech outlets these days The large bulky and expensive mixedreality headsets will eventually be replaced by a pair of smart glasses Literally the first line in this article is wrong Not only will mixed reality headsets get much smaller but they are ultimately two separate product categories for different needs Anyone in the AR or VR industry knows this AR is the one for both indoor and outdoor usage but the quality of VRMR will always be so far ahead of seethrough AR that there will be people who prefer to use VRMR when indoors Also why even mention expense in this sentence when AR glasses will be far more expensive The Apple Vision Pro experience could be squeezed into a glasses form but it will take several years for a quality product to arrive Thats a lot longer than several years away Maybe 710 years Even Metas 25000 Orion AR glasses prototype isnt even close to Apple Vision Pros experience,,0.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwm1dbr,TheModeratorWrangler,,6,2024-11-11 17:42:28,,,,Here is what I dont get Everyone expects Apple to make a miracle device that upends the technological status quo However technology today means that the playing field has leveled out enough that to even have a first generation product like Vision Pro outperform devices that cost factors more than it Id say that people need to understand Apple shifting to in house silicon to use these MX devices that simply outperform expectations All for a price point no where near as painful as the process of building a PC Eventually Apple will achieve the type of SoC to ensure they practically dominate the high end VR AR markets,lwltw14,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwoz7sp,NecroCannon,,3,2024-11-12 03:21:35,,,,Apple looks at anything they can do better themselves for around the same price and goes for it like currently with modems and what else are they pushing Satellite connection The problem with the Vision Pro is the price and even they know that what Im going to find interesting is what will a Vision nonpro2 do to push the quo Thats when well get a peak into what MRARVR will bring soon after TBH I see AR glasses from Apple being a thing with the Apple Watch Apple Watch buyers buy a pair of glasses that can use hand gestures from the watch to control the glasses and its just a basic unintrusive UI that can give you information at a flick of the wrist and you can stream movies or something if you want I really just dont see people wanting to have a AR UI around them when they want to use it The average person is pretty lazy and would be pretty against having to wave their arms everywhere or put on an additional tech device to charge just to use the glasses And you dont want to make them too bulky adding a ton of tech in there either for everyday use simplicity is key and Apple has a way of doing that well while also tying it to other products to milk more money I can somehow see Apple WatchApple GlassesiPhone being the starter ecosystem thing for them and you gotta have all three for the perfect modern mobile experience,lwm1dbr,2.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwy4dnz,TheModeratorWrangler,,1,2024-11-13 17:31:36,,,,I admit that your points are valid and coincidentally I tried out a Meta Quest latest whatever and was pleasantly surprised by the demo experience Ill sit out further opinions,lwoz7sp,3.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwypqnc,HunterVacui,,1,2024-11-13 19:18:54,,,,I wouldnt say the problem is the price I would be willing to pay that price for a comfortable high quality headset The problem is that the device has too many problems Walled ecosystem Im not paying apple to develop apps for a headset Too heavybulky its not comfortable enough to wear for a long period Short battery life if youre going to give the damn thing a tether offload compute AND battery and make the attachment bigger Or hell just make it a pc tethered headset The newer apple computers are small enough to be portable anyway And add all that to the price no thanks As a side note theres plenty of room for improvement too After seeing YouTuber reviews of the Orion Im pretty convinced that hand tracking will never be as good by itself as having a wrist band In particular for haptic feedback and handsinpockets controls but Im also assuming the gesture detection accuracy with a wrist band will be a game changer,lwoz7sp,3.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwmo7ox,Sirisian,,2,2024-11-11 19:38:10,,,,Thats a lot longer than several years away Maybe 710 years It really did require Apple to invest way more in MicroLED Their original plan to begin producing them might have cut some timecost off but without that investment the timelines are unknown Its going to be a relatively glacial progress MR glasses have to go through 4K 8K 16K per eye to get to mainstream They also need an opacity filter to mix incoming light with pixel resolution which doesnt exist yet The actual time scales for some of these projects are into the 2040s at this pace Literally the first line in this article is wrong Not only will mixed reality headsets get much smaller but they are ultimately two separate product categories for different needs The goal is ultimately for local dimming to merge the two If the light blending filter that mixes incoming light with the display light is cheap enough then it can just shutout incoming light completely This same optical component is what will ultimately create shadows and opaque objects for fully immersive experiences The timelines for this could easily be 30 years away though so youre probably right that well have two products,lwltw14,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwmr6az,DarthBuzzard,,2,2024-11-11 19:53:12,,,,The timelines for this could easily be 30 years away though so youre probably right that well have two products Yeah I know that Meta and Apple really want a device that can eventually do everything but it really is so far into the distant horizon and even then it essentially needs to be contact lenses to provide a perfect VR experience as glasses with full dimming capabilities will still need to look like normal glasses whereas VR enthusiasts will really want that full human field of view in a wraparound form factor,lwmo7ox,2.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwpdd9i,None,,1,2024-11-12 05:03:09,,,,Thats the eventual death of smartphones as the dominant paradigm If we can get to the point where glasses can provide a HUD with no projector or ski goggle screen it will be a complete game changer Imagine walking down a hall or street where your glasses tell you who a person is and how you know them Or giving you in context notifications like temperature when looking outside or helping you see paths when driving Literally revolutionary technology but were just not there yet,lwltw14,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwtvb94,alidan,,1,2024-11-12 23:17:21,,,,for ar glasses to make sense you would need several technologies at the same time 1 you would need internet access and an ai at the ready for translation needs or any questions you have this is the most obvious thing they could do an example look at manga and imagine the glasses just translate whats in japanese and overlay 2 you need to have low latency access to more data imaginee in a car if all the cars sensors allowed you to have far far clearer vision at night for upcoming issues or see the deer or threats at the side of the road without much issue the only place I know that does shit like this is fighter jets as standard 3 high enough quality for some level of entertainment most current ar doesnt have a form factor that allows you to not be noticeable but imagine being able to sit there and just watch a show without needing to stare at a phone possibly a split controller because god knows normal people are afraid of what people they will never see again think of them imagine if in public you could play a game controllers not visible and thats how you spend the time on a commute 4 from a self preservation stand point cameras that dont make it obvious when you are recording people get really weird when they think or know they are being recorded to the point it will provoke fights better than an insult ever could I would want to wear a body cam in public at all times just so im never accused of shit I never did computer enabled glasses are the number 1 thing I would want this on because its seeing exactly what I see,lwltw14,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwm6tlv,WhenPantsAttack,,1,2024-11-11 18:09:58,,,,I think what you are discounting is that it doesnt matter the quality of VRMR displays It matters on how you can fit that experience into your life and workflow VRMR by definition put a barrier between you and the rest of the world around you even if MR tries to integrate it I also disagree that AR glasses will be more expensive I think mainstream adoption of AR will ultimately look similar to the thumbnail It will be simple notifications and static information such as turnbyturn directions or maybe a list of 34 of nearby resteraunts not full resolution dynamic video or animations overlaid on the world Think more North Focals before Google bought and shuttered them than Meta Orion or Snap spectacles,lwltw14,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwm7no7,DarthBuzzard,,3,2024-11-11 18:14:13,,,,Think more North Focals before Google bought and shuttered them than Meta Orion or Snap spectacles Lets say that AR settles on that and this is what its used for Great useful stuff but that would drive home the point that this is completely different to VRMR because in this scenario AR would have no real focus on immersion Depending on how you describe it it wouldnt even be AR at all like if it was a Meta Raybans type deal I just dislike the narrative that people assume AR glasses are the beall and endall and will replace MRVR it wont,lwm6tlv,2.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwq538d,Borbit85,,3,2024-11-12 09:48:06,,,,O think its so weird that smart glasses are not a thing yet There are so many people that wear glasses already I dont need to watch a 4k movie on them Just a really simple text only display would be so usefull I dont need it to have AI bullshit Dont even really need a camera A headset could be a nice plus but I can do without easy It doesnt need compute power I have a damn fast computer in my pocket already Just a real simple see through display for some notes A clock or navigation,,0.0,1gowmr7
comment,lws93ct,None,,1,2024-11-12 18:10:15,,,,Right there with you just give me the same as my phones lock screen would timedate any messages reminder or calendar events I find the camera idea really invasive and I find it bizarre that people are more trusting of meta to do it than Google,lwq538d,1.0,1gowmr7
comment,lws9oe3,Borbit85,,1,2024-11-12 18:13:15,,,,Ja and imagine something so simple as a shopping list Or instructions for assembling IKEA furniture Cooking recipe I dont think people are more trusting of Meta than Google Google had smart glasses but it was a first And quite some years ago so people are more used to it I guess if you wear the Meta glasses irl a lot of people are gonna mind But if it was just a screen no cam I would not mind at all,lws93ct,2.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwlvfkj,None,,13,2024-11-11 17:12:05,,,,Metas demo AR glasses are the most advanced things Ive seen and I think its probably safe to assume that Apple has a very similar prototype in their labs since all these companies basically copy each others stuff so 5 years seems doable from that context Then again Meta is outpacing Apple in tech so maybe Apple doesnt have it anymore e wholly run on sentence Batman,,0.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwrh9q6,glytxh,,2,2024-11-12 15:46:48,,,,Apple is rarely the first to drop a new kind of hardware to the market But they refine the shit out of whatever they eventually do release Smartphones existed a while before iPhone set the standard Some very good smartphones built by companies that just failed to play the long game If I were a betting man AR smart glasses at a price comparable to a smartphone is a decade away still Metas lenses in their prototype are one of the biggest hurdles Anybody who works out how to mass manufacture those as a viable cost is going to run the AR game,lwlvfkj,1.0,1gowmr7

comment,lwq86hl,mt0386,,1,2024-11-12 10:23:02,,,,Instead of big heavy vr headset why wasnt it just light weight glass screen tethered to a main device sittin in your pockets or back pack Yeah critics would say how ugly the tethered wires to the ass would be but pretty sure MOST vr enthusiast or gamers have wires tethered to their pc,,0.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwrkzs1,I-lack-braincells,,1,2024-11-12 16:06:28,,,,AR that uses transparent optics is trash compared to the reproductive AR like the Apple Vision Pro I hope its a separate device and does not replace the Apple Vision Pro line Just make the Apple Vision Pro smaller and give it better cameras,,0.0,1gowmr7
comment,lwm1hmh,bbbbears,,1,2024-11-11 17:43:03,,,,Idk I dont think AR glasses are ever gonna catch on in a major way I sold glasses for decades and it would be a nightmare I just dont see how they can get to the point where it wont give the wearer headaches and be more of a distraction than a benefit,,0.0,1gowmr7
