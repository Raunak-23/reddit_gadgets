comment,ms1he3n,Sirisian,,9,2025-05-13 04:52:36,,,,This gets into futurology stuff but well need this capacity and more later for lightfield video formats Theres a lot of details but at 50100 gbps compressed file sizes in the 2040s they require massive amount of storage capacity On a 512 TB drive its less than a day of video Raw data is a whole other beast requiring potentially absurd amounts of temporary storage before encoding To make these kind of future storage services possible requires that enterprise drives continue to grow rapidly,ms0xzol,1.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms1xgju,Earthiness,,3,2025-05-13 07:19:21,,,,Yeah I remember seeing some projections on playing back 3D apples version on their headset immersive video where youre in the scene and youre able to turn your head and look around while its playing I think the throughput on data transmission was nearing 10GBs and for 10 minutes you needed something like 10TB Im sure with a better codex you could get that down but truly immersive video is technically possible but youll need a couple Petabytes Edit Did some quick math and it would be around 102TB for a 10 minute video but only a 12Gbps transfer rate,ms1he3n,2.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms270rz,Sirisian,,1,2025-05-13 08:59:00,,,,That would be the early glimpses of where this is going One of the best examples Ive seen of this is at the end of Ready Player One where the protagonist is teleported to a copy of someones room It captures the idea that one can be fully immersed in a 11 copy of another environment and interact with others For reference future mixed reality will aim for 16K240Hz per eye with eye tracking With edge servers its possible to stream data over 6G or later at near zero latency So youd be decoding only a partial viewpoint even if the full video file is multiple PB large and allows you to walk into it A lot of current 360 lightfield video only encodes a small sphere where moving outside this region causes artifacts due to missing views Nothing would stop say a 3D film from rendering a lightfield with a multiple meter large view region and bloating the file size immensely On the capture side taken to the extreme SPAD event cameras should be able to scan the world at submillimeter resolution Static scenes obviously dont cost as much but when you have a lot of dynamic people even in 2040 it might be quite demanding One example Ive seen is someone livestreaming a busy city street where viewers would feel theyre standing next to them The MR glasses would be encoding all the important changes It could even use pose estimation and other analysis to compress people in the scene further reducing the cost Lot of techniques later should make this not as daunting as it might seem Microsoft research has a number of papers on this topic,ms1xgju,3.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms27gnb,Earthiness,,2,2025-05-13 09:03:37,,,,Yeah I did my calculations at around 13K each eye and just assumed a full render at 240hz If you just rendered field of view it would be a lot less intensive Its interesting that we really arent that far off having this be possible at consumer levels Probably just another 10ish years out for pixel density and once you essentially pass 14K resolution there isnt a need to go further Thats already peak human vision,ms270rz,4.0,1kl63uh

comment,ms24fq0,unematti,,2,2025-05-13 08:31:49,,,,They TARGET it tho It doesnt always work out Plus compressed vs uncompressed 4k streams and of course itll probably cost as much as the equivalent capacity in multiple drives,ms0xzol,1.0,1kl63uh

comment,ms7smkd,im_thatoneguy,,1,2025-05-14 04:14:33,,,,That chart is bunk Nobody has ever gotten SSDs that cheap 150 for a 4TB drive No 13TB for spinning disks is about right,ms1vl4a,2.0,1kl63uh

comment,ms0cui8,kyredemain,,2,2025-05-13 00:33:29,,,,Storage isnt really a limiting factor for AI Most models arent really that big 100 GB or less in many cases At least the ones Ive used,mrzzoyc,1.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms7t4d8,im_thatoneguy,,1,2025-05-14 04:18:08,,,,And what is that AI model trained on or verified against If its Tesla that means petabytes of dashcam footage for training and validation For multimodal LLMs that means every written word and image on the internet,ms0cui8,2.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms7tz4i,kyredemain,,0,2025-05-14 04:24:22,,,,That isnt actually that much storage when you look at it at a corporate scale You also dont really need to keep all of that information all at once If it saves you money by just rescraping the web every time you just do that No reason to download the whole internet and hold onto it,ms7t4d8,3.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms7ug0i,im_thatoneguy,,0,2025-05-14 04:27:56,,,,What You need to push TBs of data through a rack of GPU thousands of times You dont just plug in your modem and go download the internet every time It would add insane amounts of latency Also 100000 GPUs isnt very many in a corporate scale but its enough to drive GPU prices up,ms7tz4i,4.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms21jw4,johnryan433,,1,2025-05-13 08:01:23,,,,It has nothing to do with the storage of the AI model Its about post training or fine tuning the model itself,ms0cui8,2.0,1kl63uh
comment,ms22oqd,johnryan433,,0,2025-05-13 08:13:12,,,,Its to store the synthetic data used for fine tuning or post training an AI model,ms0cui8,2.0,1kl63uh
