comment,lvs66sh,dustofdeath,,23,2024-11-06 20:59:41,,,,Even 5800x3d has similar performance at 2k4k in games Most games outside esports1080p are just GPU limited instead,,0.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lvspwva,ghostridur,,15,2024-11-06 22:31:55,,,,Yeah the ltt video benchmarks put the 1080 performance better but higher resolution even with a 4090 is negligible,lvs66sh,1.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lvt15hq,gerard2100,,5,2024-11-06 23:30:11,,,,The problem is the environement if you are upgarding an am4 plateform it is indeed a very good choice but if you are not on am4 unless you are short on money i wouldnt commit to an am4 plateform better wait a bit to see if 7800x3d drops or take a cheaper am5,lvs66sh,1.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lvv5i0u,Betrayedunicorn,,-11,2024-11-07 08:00:23,,,,Theres a huge x3d echo chamber here I wouldnt be surprised if the AMD marketing has deeply embedded here X3d is so expensive even on AM4 that I went for the 5950x on sale Ive yet to be cpu fps capped Thats what we are after right I like benchmarks and hype but at what cost,lvt15hq,2.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lvv5ukb,gerard2100,,17,2024-11-07 08:04:05,,,,Its not only hype the perf gains i had with it are real It really depends on the game,lvv5i0u,3.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lwj766x,Mhugs05,,1,2024-11-11 04:32:47,,,,There are quite a few ps5 ports that are CPU bottlenecked even on 30 series cards especially on ddr4 Hogwarts Legacy and the Spiderman games are the big ones for me Using rt makes it worse too 9800x3d is over 50 uplift from 5800x3d for example with Hogwarts legacy at 1080p ultra with a 4090 More importantly lows go from 60s to over 110fps too Im upgrading from a 5800x3d now because of spiderman 2 coming in January and wagering prices are going to go up because of tariffs,lvs66sh,1.0,1gl5j0a
comment,lvv37g1,bonesnaps,,3,2024-11-07 07:36:52,,,,Waiting for the 7800X3D to hit 325 CAD again and maybe Ill scoop one Not paying scalpers for it though pass,,0.0,1gl5j0a
