post,1jo0nl5,chrisdh79,Reviewers report GeForce RTX 5090 for laptops is 50 percent slower than desktop version,1852,2025-03-31 11:09:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1jo0nl5/reviewers_report_geforce_rtx_5090_for_laptops_is/,182.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mko0und,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,841,2025-03-31 11:14:08,,,,The 5090 is a 600w GPU Why even pretend that a laptop is ever going to have anything close o equivalent Hey really should just have a completely different line of GPUs for laptops with different names so consumers dont get confused or mislead,,0.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mko2bwv,alman12345,,75,2025-03-31 11:26:22,,,,Im fairly certain they do it both because the mobile 5090 is the best they could squeeze into a laptop chassis while maintaining decent boost clocks and because it sells for more when people think theyre getting a 90 class,mko0und,1.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkohira,Trisa133,,12,2025-03-31 13:12:13,,,,Laptops can only handle 160w sustained tdp So even if they actually give you the real 5090 chip the most power that chip will get is 100w It may not even reach 60 of the performance The laptops that can go 200 watts had dual power supply,mko2bwv,2.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkop0zg,sk3tchcom,,8,2025-03-31 13:55:51,,,,Thats just not true The RAZER Blade 14 has a 230W power supply and theres behemoth laptops with 330W power supplies EDIT I misunderstood what they were referring to and got clarity thanks,mkohira,3.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkounnr,andynator1000,,23,2025-03-31 14:25:54,,,,Its charging brick is 230W but youre still only getting 140W to the GPU,mkop0zg,4.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkouxtq,sk3tchcom,,8,2025-03-31 14:27:24,,,,Ah right TDP to the CPU or GPU not all,mkounnr,5.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkozz81,Trisa133,,12,2025-03-31 14:53:12,,,,TDP is thermal dissipation You can have a 800 watt psu if you want It will throttle after it heats up The big laptops can dissipate more than 200w if the fans are screaming but none can dissipate a sustained 300w afaik,mkouxtq,6.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkpaq90,Eteel,,3,2025-03-31 15:47:24,,,,Back in the day I had the MSI GT72 Dominator Pro G It was a huge heavy laptop with a single 230W power supply unit It didnt actually get that hot but thats because it was huge with a lot of space for air ventilation Its definitely not an office laptop but people who are buying laptops like that arent buying them for the office I believe there was a dragon edition with 980M SLI which had dual power supplies That one was one hell of a laptop,mkozz81,7.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkoi1a3,alman12345,,1,2025-03-31 13:15:23,,,,Honestly Id be surprised if it reached 60 the issue with such large silicon is that it reaches a point of extremely diminished performance when the power envelope is restricted too far Coincidentally this is also usually why manufacturers decide that an actual 202 die isnt even worth it and go with the 203 die instead Its in the same vein as why the Steam Decks APU can do some pretty amazing things with a very restrictive power envelope even compared to newer and more advanced silicon like the Z1E or even the HX370,mkohira,3.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mko9cx7,Mainbaze,,50,2025-03-31 12:19:00,,,,600W keeps sounding so insane to me Thats half a microwave or half a water kettle running all your gaming hours Then you also have the CPU and screen misc,mko0und,1.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mko2m60,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,6,2025-03-31 11:28:42,,,,A C13 plug right into the back of the GPU would be a better solution than the 12 pin PCIE power connector,mko1xqw,2.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mko4xqq,wintermoon007,,3,2025-03-31 11:46:58,,,,something something LTT video on this exact topic,mko2m60,3.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkobjvb,PaulR79,,-7,2025-03-31 12:34:07,,,,LTT is a very poor source now Hes never been the best for real technical stuff but things like not bothering to check what a manufacturer claims when you have a thing called Labs seems lazy at best,mko4xqq,4.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkodscw,wintermoon007,,1,2025-03-31 12:48:54,,,,So you would rather trust a manufacturers claims rather than a third partys tests And specifically for PSUs i would very very much disagree that labs is lazy at best,mkobjvb,5.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mktwpjb,PaulR79,,3,2025-04-01 09:43:16,,,,You misunderstood what I meant but thats on me for being lazy in my reply I meant the complete opposite of what you picked up LTT asked the manufacturers a question about the power all running through a single line to the plug then trusted the manufacturers likely PR response without verifying it themselves They have Labs available to test and confirm what the manufacturers claimed but didnt bother to do so,mkodscw,6.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkojdrb,flowersonthewall72,,-1,2025-03-31 13:23:28,,,,LTT is tech news and entertainment Always has always will Dont hate them because you dont understand the content they make And do I understand that correctly you have a problem with independent third party testing,mkobjvb,5.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkopkjx,diuturnal,,1,2025-03-31 13:58:47,,,,And do I understand that correctly you have a problem with independent third party testing Its all over one part of a video where they reached out to MSI to see if a card was receiving all 6 pins of power to one plane Instead of verifying if that was true they just emailed the company and went with it It had zero impact on the video and they removed it when they were called out for not double checking,mkojdrb,6.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkorih3,flowersonthewall72,,1,2025-03-31 14:09:18,,,,So this one event discounts everything else theyve done Im asking this in good faith Im not licking LTTs boots I want to know where the line is drawn because it really seems like LTT is held to a standard that is well above what we expect from literally any other company LTT is trying to break into this new test and VV role in the industry They have made mistakes and the community is rightfully calling them out But all I see is LTT working to correct them while the community calls them lazy and frauds I just dont get it Dont like them if you want but at least have some moral consistency and backbone,mkopkjx,7.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mktw0hf,PaulR79,,1,2025-04-01 09:35:32,,,,I understand the content and how he does it but when you have a large audience youre going to influence people and he will be taken as knowing what he and his team are talking about What I dont understand is why they accepted a manufacturers PR response to a technical question rather than check it before reporting the result,mkojdrb,6.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mko6eyl,NuclearLunchDectcted,,1,2025-03-31 11:57:55,,,,There was a GPU that did something like that back in the 2ks Voodoo3 I think Wasnt a C13 plug but the GPU had its own power supply that plugged directly into the wall,mko2m60,3.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mko6vd2,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,3,2025-03-31 12:01:15,,,,That might make more sense Having a separate power supply for the GPU and rest for the system could make things more affordable because a giant 1000 watt power supply is more complicated and possibly more expensive than a couple of more basic powers supplies,mko6eyl,4.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mko13hy,kickthecommie,,304,2025-03-31 11:16:10,,,,Its the same chip from a desktop 5080 and maxes out at 2025 the wattage of a 5090 honestly kinda impressive Its able to reach half the performance but absolutely not worth it either way retailers are charging like 5000 for a 5090 laptop,,0.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkztag2,rachnar,,2,2025-04-02 08:48:21,,,,The laptop 1070 packed more than the desktop 1070 but ran much slower speeds IRC I was able to OC mine past desktop 1070 speeds and it was INSANE how good it was ofc you needed a proper laptop for it and the alienware i had was an amazing one It was the cpu holding me back in thay model not the gpu At least until one of the fans died and the battery nearly blew up I might have pushed it too much admitedly After replacement it was as good as new again,mks2qau,3.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkzwbat,Cless_Aurion,,1,2025-04-02 09:23:24,,,,Exactly For me the CPU wasnt an issue since it was one of those laptopsbarebones that also have desktop CPU and had a full fat 7700K running on it D Replaced it after like almost 7 years of heavy use,mkztag2,4.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkzx64p,rachnar,,2,2025-04-02 09:33:13,,,,Yeah thats beefier than the i78750h i had in mine not complaining though i got it through a deal which made it much cheaper than alternatives for me And the alienware chassis really was a marvel tbh but the noise did suck was like a low power vaccum cleaner when gaming unsurprisingly,mkzwbat,5.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkzxo9h,Cless_Aurion,,1,2025-04-02 09:38:57,,,,Lucky you Man computers back then were affordable as hell I think I paid like 2k for mine Being 17 too Nowadays same tier de stop is like 3000 or 3500 for sure,mkzx64p,6.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkp6rjp,sali_nyoro-n,,3,2025-03-31 15:27:25,,,,I guess its a case of diminishing returns where past a certain point you start needing greater wattage increases for a given performance increase PC parts have largely hit a wall for scaling lately so its not surprising were back to an early2000s style wattage contest at the top end where you need 45 more power for 2 more performance,mko13hy,1.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkocpy7,CamiloArturo,,7,2025-03-31 12:41:53,,,,True but thats exactly the issue I believe Naming it the same as the desktop version it does make it look like a similar GPU The fact it is 50 slower kind of makes the case either for a different branding completely to avoid deceiving the general public Yes for building PC fans its of no concern but for most regular people it is a deceive tactic,mko92r1,1.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mktko5t,SnowGryphon,,1,2025-04-01 07:25:15,,,,I think the golden age of laptop GPUs was the GTX 1000 series if i recall right the mobile GTX 1070 actually had more ROPs than the desktop 1070 and was clocked only slightly slower That meant a mild overclock could beat the desktop,mkogew8,1.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkyuaa0,Mackadelik,,1,2025-04-02 03:14:12,,,,Is this actually bad though I read somewhere on Google that someone compared the 4090 laptop with desktop and found the desktop gfx card to be 75 faster and desktop cpu to be 15 faster So a card that is only 50 slow might not be that bad Im desktop all the way but is 5090 better than other cards in this sense,,0.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkos3al,SamYeager1907,,7,2025-03-31 14:12:23,,,,Mobile 1080s performed very close to desktop ones and they even had 1080s with identical performance in larger laptops too When nVidia had a good generation the performance gap is negligible The issue is that 5xxx is a performance flop Raising wattage is the laziest way to increase performance,mkojjfx,1.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkp8isz,elton_john_lennon,,4,2025-03-31 15:36:15,,,,Youre talking about technology from almost 10 years ago to make a point that your argument of mobile being worse than desktop is being invalid since desktop more powerful than mobile wasnt always the case Its not about technology its about naming things If it performs as 80 card it should be named 80 card regardless if it is 1000 2000 or 6000 series,mkou3za,3.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mko5ew0,phillz91,,30,2025-03-31 11:50:33,,,,Thats the point though right The reviewers are doing their job by pointing out that the mobile 5090 is nowhere near the desktop version because Nvidia will continue to market it as if it is to people who dont know any better and manufacturers who charge as if it has a full 5090 in there To you they are pointing out the obvious but most people would not know the difference between them since Nvidia insists on calling it a 90 class chip The same people who may look up a review before buying one,mko3wje,1.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mko7tak,JBWalker1,,1,2025-03-31 12:08:04,,,,Didnt GPU manufacturers used to just put an M at the end to show that its a mobile version Seems like the obvious solution and would still have the 5080 in it which is the important part It is the same graphics cardprocessors after all isnt it Just massively underclocked to keep the heat down Makes no difference to me because obviously laptop versions are a slowed down version but to a person new to pc gaming itll help them a lot Would help with googling too I dont think it really does help them much more from the marketing side compared to if they put an M at the end so they should just do it,mko5ew0,2.0,1jo0nl5
comment,mkoikb1,joanfiggins,,5,2025-03-31 13:18:33,,,,Its marketing bullshit that is just meant to mislead some lesser knowing consumers Theres a good chunk of people buying expensive laptops and not understanding that the GPU isnt the same as the desktop version That group wants a gaming PC but is intimidated by building a desktop so they get a laptop instead My cousin bought a 3070 laptop and used it for like 6 months He came over with it and my 3060ti desktop was beating his in performance by like 5 to 10 percent in a game we were playing Then he put on his undervoltoverclock settings and so did I and the gap increased to 10 to 15 percent He assumed 3070 is faster than 3060ti because the number is higher Thats the type of person they are trying to trick,mko7tak,3.0,1jo0nl5

comment,mkp7x5z,saposapot,,0,2025-03-31 15:33:12,,,,Besides what everyone else already explained laptop performance is very variant on each model You can have a 5090 in a model with good cooling and good performance and a very different result in another model Instead of blaming manufacturers for using the same name I think we should blame them for not enforcing laptop makers to guarantee a baseline performance for their GPU with a proven cooling solution that fits their requirements,,0.0,1jo0nl5
