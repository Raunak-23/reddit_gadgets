post,1je1dha,diacewrb,World's first long life sodium-ion power bank launched,1425,2025-03-18 09:58:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1je1dha/worlds_first_long_life_sodiumion_power_bank/,127.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mieyx2z,fmaz008,,749,2025-03-18 10:49:08,,,,TLDR Its has a lower energy density bigger and heavier compared to equal lithium ion capacity it does not use hard to find material like Lithium Ion cobalt etc So its better for the environment it has about 10x more lifecycle than a lithium ion battery 5000 charges vs 5001000 it can be shipped at 0V,,0.0,1je1dha
comment,mifo1eq,Mr_Vulcanator,,326,2025-03-18 13:41:27,,,,Shipped at 0V is pretty cool Lithium batteries have to be at around 5080 charge to be shelf stable Every time I use my RC car I have to use the charger to get the batteries to 50 charge so they dont degrade in storage,mieyx2z,1.0,1je1dha
comment,mig3avf,BeersTeddy,,103,2025-03-18 14:59:44,,,,From my very long term experience with powertools I learned that what kills lithium batteries fastest is zero charge Leaving them fully charged is absolutely fine as fairly quickly they loose a bit of charge anyway Main killer appears to be heat generated when fast charging or leaving them fully discharged Also a lot more of short charging cycles appears to be killing them much quicker than zero full charge or leaving indefinitely fully charged About the same experience with smartphones,mifo1eq,2.0,1je1dha
comment,mig6ytz,Asttarotina,,55,2025-03-18 15:17:49,,,,Also a lot more of short charging cycles appears to be killing them much quicker than zero full charge or leaving indefinitely fully charged Thats generally wrong If you discharge them to 0 every cycle they will last 510x less cycles than if you discharge them to 50 every cycle Attached is a chart for how many cycles LiFePO4 needs before losing 20 of total capacity PS However it still may be true for your specific batterycharger combo if the charger is designed poorly,mig3avf,3.0,1je1dha
comment,mihwjmp,Agouti,,13,2025-03-18 20:07:13,,,,There are several major problems with how you arrived at your end conclusion 1 The chart is Depth of Discharge against cycle count The reason higher DoD causes more wear is because each cycle is more watt hours DoD against cycle count is a bad metric because 1000 cycles at 20 is literally twice the total throughout as 1000 cycles at 10 Its like a chart with Trip length miles vs total number of trips for a car What matters is Depth of Discharge vs total watt hours or kJ or whatever your chosen measurement That tells a very different story 2 The start end end charge states are ambiguous with DoD charts 10080100 is 20 DoD as is 604060 The latter is actually far more favourable for batteries and manufacturers exploit this 3 Being held at elevated charge states for long periods of times causes significant wear even with no charge cycling at all This is not factored into charge cycle charts at all If you really want to learn the nits and bolts of lithium life preservation you cant beat If you just tldrd the above think about this why does every single EV and most phones let you limit the maximum charge state if it wasnt beneficial Edit I should also note that the 100 as a measurement of charge state is also very ambiguous what really matters is the cell voltage For example the 100 charge state on a typical EV or UPS is typically 37V while for a mobile phone its often more like 4244V even though they are both similar chemistry though constructed differently The latter is chosen for maximum capacity while the former is chosen to favour overall lifespan and if you take your phone and limit it to that same 37V maximum charge state around 60 you will see similar benefits,mig6ytz,4.0,1je1dha
comment,mii1pln,Asttarotina,,4,2025-03-18 20:31:37,,,,Thanks for the great response I agree with most of what you said apart from 1 As can we see in this chart the relation between DoD and life expectancy is not linear at all itsalmost exponential For example 100 DoD will give you twice the throughput per cycle than 50 DoD but life expectancy will be 3k cycles versus 18k cycles So the total throughput of the battery before losing 20 capacity is 3 times more in 50 DoD scenario But I totally agree that this report totally misses the high charge degradation aspect which is likely to be much more significant contributor to the battery life than DoD Thanks for the link will go educate myself,mihwjmp,5.0,1je1dha
comment,mii9sck,Agouti,,6,2025-03-18 21:09:58,,,,You are correct higher DoD does cause more wear for the same watt hours I gave the wrong impression there What I was trying to get at was a chart of DoD against total watt hours was a much better measurement and what is even better is height of recharge against the same I left point 1 as before so people can see what you were responding to I also amended it to note that EVs limit their maximum charge state to what is effectively around 60 charge state for your typical mobile phone exactly because height of recharge is so much more important than true depth of discharge even at the cost of overall range,mii1pln,6.0,1je1dha
comment,mijxaaa,GreenStrong,,1,2025-03-19 02:31:20,,,,This is an excellent comment it is just worth adding that LFP chemistry has much greater longevity than the LMC used in most consumer electronics It is not quite as energy dense but it is denser than sodium based chemistry It is low fire hazard and uses no cobalt which is a conflict mineral,mihwjmp,5.0,1je1dha
comment,migicvx,BeersTeddy,,4,2025-03-18 16:12:56,,,,I know the rule very well but Im not so sure if this actually means zero charge as a very deep discharge All of the modern devices have battery discharge protection built in and never allow them to go below the danger point,mig6ytz,4.0,1je1dha
comment,migmoqc,Asttarotina,,10,2025-03-18 16:33:39,,,,Chart answers it all 0 as in before any deep discharge protections kick in Even discharging not more than to 40 will double battery life expectancy compared to discharging to 25,migicvx,5.0,1je1dha
comment,migtq3o,BeersTeddy,,1,2025-03-18 17:06:55,,,,Yes but what I mean is how it translates to real life usage I mean how deeply powertools or smartphones are actually discharging batteries 50 70 95,migmoqc,6.0,1je1dha
comment,migxlvu,Asttarotina,,3,2025-03-18 17:25:12,,,,Low 10s at max Otherwise 5Ah powerpack will give you 25Ah effective capacity no one wants that They are incentivised to discharge to the absolute safe limit Hours on one charge sells things how long that battery will last doesnt as far as it is 1 year Maybe youre getting this chart wrong Discharging from 100 to 65 every time still doubles your batteries life expectancy compared to discharging from 100 to 55 every time It doesnt really matter where the cutoff is in the controller What matters much more in small goods are bad chargers Some companies spend huge amounts of money on RnD charge controllers battery chemistry and cooling to achieve fast charge without destroying the battery ie car companies And some companies just brute force voltage into it effectively cooking that battery I dont see a reason why power tools companies would care about battery health Their batteries are effectively disposable And theres nothing they will love more than locking you into effectively subscription for their batteries if were talking about professional operation PS Theres one thing missing in my thinking which is max charge Everyone knows that charging lithium batteries to the brim is also bad for them and the chart I attached doesnt focus on this at all If you charge battery from 80 to 100 every day it may indeed kill it significantly faster than if you charge from 20 to 100 every 4 days just because youre keeping it above 80 all the time which hurts more than deep discharge Need to find more data,migtq3o,7.0,1je1dha
comment,mih6mdt,BeersTeddy,,1,2025-03-18 18:05:34,,,,Cant comment on other brands but bosch pro which I was referring to from the day one comes with a cooling fan built into charger At the same time bosch batteries are known to be the longest lasting amongst powertool brands also simplest built as there is zero electronic on it everything in the tool or charger Also Ive seen rumours that bosch have highest voltage for low discharge protection Never really checked this,migxlvu,8.0,1je1dha
comment,mihcfjd,Asttarotina,,1,2025-03-18 18:31:51,,,,If these charges had a switch to select maximum charge 80 90 100 that would probably make all the difference Also if theres a way to disassemble the battery you could just swap cells themselves for cheap if you burn through them quickly Most likely theyre some standard cell like 18650 or similar Just dont short them they can catch on fire,mih6mdt,9.0,1je1dha
comment,mihlm1q,Yellow_Triangle,,3,2025-03-18 19:15:39,,,,Another thing that kills tool batteries is if there is a long while between you your them and you dont charge them before use This is a problem for all batteries built with multiple cells inside The voltage of the individual battery cells will drift from each other causing battery imbalance This isnt good for battery life You will basically overstress single battery cells in the battery and experience faster battery degradation You might also run into a situation where a single cell will be drained beyond what it is designed to because it bottoms out before the rest of the cells in the battery The way to combat this is to put the battery in the battery charger before you use your power tool when you havent used the tool for a while Even if you stored your batteries at 100 charge and the charge indicator reports a full charge Putting the battery in the charger makes the BMS module inside the battery balance out the cells even if there is very little need to actually add energy charge the battery for some more reading on the topic,mig3avf,3.0,1je1dha
comment,miibee1,BeersTeddy,,1,2025-03-18 21:17:48,,,,Im very familiar with recommendations although found them very impractical so I stick with basic rules from NiMh days which to my surprise actually works At least my oldest batteries from 2013 are still fine amd not noticeably lost any power,mihlm1q,4.0,1je1dha

comment,mihog4r,sump_daddy,,2,2025-03-18 19:29:09,,,,If theres a significantly reduced thermal runaway risk seems like there is then it stands to reason that they would not be regulated the same way that lithium cells of various chemistry are,mighek7,3.0,1je1dha

comment,mig4d26,Gamebird8,,11,2025-03-18 15:05:01,,,,Any grid scale storage facility would be warming the batteries anyways because the chemical reaction that stores and releases electrical energy are slower and less efficient in the cold,mig40lc,3.0,1je1dha

comment,mihqgfg,StateChemist,,3,2025-03-18 19:38:37,,,,Sodium metal is highly reactive sodium ions readily form ionic bonds with many other elements like Cl or K to make a salt in a solid state Sodium ions in water just float around maybe be a bit corrosive to metals There is very little dangerous about sodium ions There is a good bit of dangerous with sodium atoms My comment was intended to be a clear indicator that they are not just the same thing and their chemistry is explosively different,mihd27x,5.0,1je1dha

comment,mig7783,pholan,,4,2025-03-18 15:18:57,,,,Evidently they still typically use a flammable electrolyte and metallic sodium still reacts vigorously to water including simple humidity Id expect them to be safer to ship if they can be shipped fully discharged but theyre still going to burn vigorously and be rather hard to extinguish if physically damaged,mifj36k,2.0,1je1dha
comment,migdfnx,Knut79,,2,2025-03-18 15:49:17,,,,The issue is if they generate gas and bloat and explode if overcharged or overheated So they even have high c ratings so they can be used in high power devices,mig7783,3.0,1je1dha

comment,mihasx8,Ohjay1982,,6,2025-03-18 18:23:59,,,,Another big factor is the temperature range at which they safely operate 34 to 50 Celsius As someone who lives in a cold climate can attest to normal batteries kind of suck in cold weather When Im wearing my gopro for downhill skiing the battery lasts less than half the time vs when I use it in the summer That said its possible that being safe to operate doesnt mean the charge would last any longer in cold weather compared to lithium ion batteries Just that its safer,mieyx2z,1.0,1je1dha

comment,mifqir0,Gangstastick,,46,2025-03-18 13:54:48,,,,You are focusing on just one feature of sodium ion batteries SIB other ways an ICE vehicle could benefit from SIBs over LAB include 1 Size Due to better gravimetric and volumetric densities While weight might not necessarily be an issue in cars vehicle engine bays are getting tighter Installing a new battery in a recent gen Ford Escape is not trivial Smaller sized batteries for the same capacity would be very helpful for car manufacturers And if those batteries only need to be replaced after 10 to 15 years then its even better 2 Cycling stability Minimal self discharge for SIBs means you can leave your car unattended for months and not worry about the battery being flat when you return Plus I read somewhere SIBs are more tolerant of deep discharges meaning if they do run down you can recharge it again without much loss of capacity 3 The environment While there are strict regulations in western countries for how used LAB should be disposed it isnt necessarily the case in the developing world If we can use fewer batteries that do not contain toxic materials the earth will be better off for it,mifiinx,2.0,1je1dha
comment,migoubo,googang619,,8,2025-03-18 16:43:50,,,,Sibs currently lack in volumetric densities current anodes are thicker than the current Liion batteries so currently cant compete in EV applications The current idea or at least where I work is to hit static storage applications where spacevolume constraints arent much of an issue If we can make them lower cost than the lithium counterpart thats what would get the ball rolling,mifqir0,3.0,1je1dha
comment,mihcubj,Gangstastick,,3,2025-03-18 18:33:50,,,,I have used LAB deep cycle batteries for home storage in the past As long as the densities for SIBs are better than LABs and price is competitive SIBs should see a huge uptake in the home energy storage world I think your company is on the right track Do you mind sharing what some of the road blocks are towards hitting price parity in the immediate future,migoubo,4.0,1je1dha

comment,mihg51v,Gangstastick,,1,2025-03-18 18:49:34,,,,Oh you can stick batteries in the trunk and Ive owned a Benz that had one in the trunk However there is a good reason batteries have always stayed in the engine bay large amounts of current are drawn from the battery during start up A longer wire means that current needs to travel a longer distanceThis leads to a voltage drop and thus even more current and an increased heat generation and increased fire risk and Its best for batteries to stay close to the engine,miheq3u,4.0,1je1dha

comment,mig4qtz,rtb001,,4,2025-03-18 15:06:55,,,,I just replaced the original AGM battery out of a BMW 328i that I bought in November 2012 which my battery evaluation tool obviously said replace but was actually still working well zero issues starting the car and everything I dont know if it is a really good battery the fact that the BMW actually changes the way it chargesuses the 12V over time to compensate for battery degradation or my fathers religious use of a tender when not driving the car since he doesnt drive it that often the past few years or probably a combination of all three but in any case the fact it survived for more than 12 years is crazy,mifiinx,2.0,1je1dha

comment,mig8ur3,StateChemist,,6,2025-03-18 15:27:00,,,,Sodium metal highly reactive Sodium ion is half of salt Incidentally all batteries are chemically stored energy Lots of energy comes with risks Part of why battery technology is not trivial is you want lots of energy storage and a slow controlled release of energy A fast release of lots of chemically stored energy is either a capacitor a fire or a bomb,mifd7lf,3.0,1je1dha

comment,migpg14,googang619,,3,2025-03-18 16:46:41,,,,Faradion which is uk based did have some static storage applications in AUS Theres lots of good research in this space uk but im unsure why nobody seems to be making the leap to a commercial product Agratas are looking at building a plant but a lot of other companies have had issuesbuy outs even though the technology is pretty good,mig5xe4,2.0,1je1dha
comment,mii3ze7,rtb001,,1,2025-03-18 20:42:19,,,,Well coming up with something that works in a lab is very far from being able to mass produce that same thing in a commercially viable manner The Chinese are now quite dominant on that half of the process for to all the various manufacturing knowhow and experience theyve accumulated over the years,migpg14,3.0,1je1dha

comment,miexdsk,OperatorJo_,,15,2025-03-18 10:35:26,,,,Its the PERFECT place to start rolling out this tech because its still so new inmarket and the battery has to be larger than a regular lithium one Its that fat and only 9000 mah A power bank is the leastcared daily object it can be in where people dont gripe that much about thickness For comparison just by the photo of the device inhand charging the gopro that is 23 of my 20000mah Redmi powerbank in size for less than half the rating The needed thickness to achieve similar results to lithium is also why these are being more marketed towards EV Batteries instead of things like smartphones,mieu4k6,1.0,1je1dha

comment,mifgug8,Way2trivial,,0,2025-03-18 12:59:35,,,,well its disclaimed in the article and multiple elsewheres in the citeable world as too big and too heavy from the linked story Its one of the limitations holding sodiumion from being widely adopted in EVs though some lowrange vehicles are expected to use this tech in the near future,mif3yow,4.0,1je1dha
comment,mifs3p0,OperatorJo_,,1,2025-03-18 14:03:08,,,,That doesnt mean its not being researched further as the safer alternative it only means that at this period in time its a limiting factor for LONGRANGE electric vehicles 250 miles as standard EV sedans go Didnt say the tech would be bolted onto EVs tomorrow Thats still a decade away Hell its been over 50 years of research and just now were getting a consumer product with it This being 9000mah that large if they focus start focusing on more efficient but justasstrong electric motors I could see ebikes scooters or electric motorcycles start using it sooner asis,mifgug8,5.0,1je1dha
