comment,m0f6c4t,fatherofraptors,,51,2024-12-04 19:57:37,,,,That has something to do with the DNS blocklist youre using in pihole or AGH for people like me You can try different blocklists or just track down which DNS query gets blocked when paramount fails and just whitelist that one If it bothers you of course,m0e8jgx,3.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0hp53b,BlitzSam,,3,2024-12-05 04:36:40,,,,For a lot of these experimental changes companies tend to do A B testing or batch rollouts So some users get it some dont Or the change can be implemented differently between users Google products are particularly known for this People reporting that their YT looked weird or broke for a couple of days then went back to normal Unskippable and multi ads started out that way And this kind of selective rollout makes issue reports look schizophrenic as heck,m0hdgoe,4.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0h7oz8,imakesawdust,,1,2024-12-05 02:41:00,,,,Its just a matter of time before TVs behind PiHole dont work I already have to run two versions of PiHole because some Roku channels will hang if I use the default blocklist For example I have to allow certain adservers in order for the PBS app to work Its just a matter of time before all devices start that behavior,m0dswpr,1.0,1h6e6af
comment,m0ifgug,cr0ft,,1,2024-12-05 08:40:34,,,,Yeah I even have two separate Wifi networks one of them can only talk to the Internet blocked from everything else in the house and is heavily filtered with pfBlockerNG in my case Most devices even on that network can only talk to my Home Assistant and not outside at all I temporarily permit some of them to go online if I need to check for firmware Im sure some TVs already do or soon will put up giant red error boxes about not reaching the ad server unless you permit it to talk though Id personally take an axe to one of those and throw it out but thats just me,m0dswpr,1.0,1h6e6af
comment,m0iknhg,Pixie1001,,1,2024-12-05 09:39:09,,,,Does pihole actually work for stuff like this though It seems to work pretty well for popups and google ad sense stuff but if the ads are directly embedded into the site pihole cant differentiate them For example Im using pihole right now while typing this comment but still getting banner ads on reddit for some car because the thumbnail is being hosted on reddits servers at least I think Its also totally possible I set something up wrong,m0dswpr,1.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0gysdr,cincydude123,,0,2024-12-05 01:46:42,,,,Im new to pihole Its an app you download and install on your TV and then it blocks ads on anything Cable Netflix YouTube I also dont have a smart tv yet,m0dswpr,1.0,1h6e6af
comment,m0hd7sq,theangryintern,,2,2024-12-05 03:15:07,,,,No dont think you cant install it on a TV since those are pretty closed systems that can only install certain apps Most people run it on a Raspberry Pi device hence the name Pi Hole but it can be installed on other things I know my Asustor NAS has it as an app I can download for example so Id guess that QNAP or Synology also has it Another similar product is called Adguard Home does basically the same thing You could theoretically install in on your main computer the caveat is the device running PiHole needs to run 247 which is why Raspberry Pis are so popular since they are very low power devices so it doesnt cost a lot to have one running all the time The basics of it is it acts as a DNS Sinkhole The PiHole device sits on your home network and you point your Routers DNS settings to the PiHole That way any device on your network has its DNS queries go through the PiHole before going out to a public DNS server So if it tries to go to a known adserving address the PiHole will not allow that traffic through effectively blocking the ads,m0gysdr,2.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0hstsq,bigeyez,,7,2024-12-05 05:04:25,,,,The new ones are trash anyway This year alone the TV has bricked twice because when their online services go down it completely bricks your TV if its connected to the internet Cant even watch antenna channels when this happens No Vizio services will load and even disconnecting from the internet at that point doesnt fix the issue The OS is also just dogshit Its constantly sluggish and prone to freezes and crashes At least once a month or so we have to unplug it from the wall because the OS will just stop working and lock up and only a full restart will fix it The cherry on top is no browser and no side loading apps like you can do on Samsung tvs Its the worst TV Ive ever bought and Ill never get another Vizio again,m0dco33,1.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0gl60t,URPissingMeOff,,1,2024-12-05 00:25:59,,,,Not necessarily Tivo boxes have had the ability to record promotional videos off a cable channel at preset times for a couple of decades They would buy ultra cheap air time for their ads on crappy channels that no one watched at around 2 or 3 am record them and play them back when you were watching a recorded show,m0ev8n2,3.0,1h6e6af
comment,m0gdeyg,Wloak,,1,2024-12-04 23:40:16,,,,Thats not really the play here I build advertising products that span TV web mobile and in person the data about you is what they want not to show more ads but ads more likely to get you to buy things Walmart is the fastest growing ad platform over the past few years because they can tie your online shopping to in person shopping and what sites youre browsing at times Walmart runs ads not for themselves but other companies all over the Internet Now they also will have direct access to what TV is being watched in your household Why this is a big benefit for them you search for something and go to a website with their ad tracker on it their ad platform know nows youre looking at fridges Through their ad platform they can now show you ads for fridges across their websites 3rd party sites and ads on your smart TV If you buy from Walmart they can tie it back to a specific commercial for a brand that got you to buy it,m0dz7un,2.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0lljlb,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2024-12-05 20:55:58,,,,The thing is those others are far worse about shoving ads in your face Philips and Samsung were two of the earliest to jump on the TV menu ads bandwagon and remain probably the most egregious offenders on that front Vizio can cram a lot more ads into their stuff before they get on that level,m0lj5zx,5.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0fsmdg,None,,3,2024-12-04 21:47:15,,,,Encryption The video going between your devices and the television has encryption to keep filthy pirates from making copies of the digital video It doesnt help much but they require it Sometimes a key will get compromised and theyll update them or some displays will stop working with the player Im not sure how often this happens My guess isnt often Ive never had an issue,m0fow1p,5.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0fwn89,None,,4,2024-12-04 22:07:31,,,,Not the blurays themselves but the video going from the player to the television This includes Rokus Apple TVs Amazon TV etc that have players and hook up to a television That digital video can be grabbed on the wire and they want to prevent that And yes of course there are ways around it Nothing will stop the pirates Before all this technology and old friend of mine used to say locks keep honest people honest but they wont keep out everybody,m0fuqrv,7.0,1h6e6af

comment,m0ds800,dandroid126,,8,2024-12-04 15:45:06,,,,Yes I refuse to update Not just because Because I have been burned in the past I bought a smart TV that was fine when I bought it then they updated it which fucked with the color balance and I preferred it before I did an insane amount of research on my TV paid a lot of money to get the exact one that I wanted and then they fucked it up with an update I also had one where they made it so instead of just going to my content like it did when I bought it they updated it so it went to their shitty adriddled home screen where I had to select my input first before it would show my content I could no longer just turn on my TV I now had to turn on my TV then select my input while seeing ads As I said I do a lot of research on products before I buy them When I buy something I am paying money and deciding to be content with the features that I get in exchange for that money If VRR wasnt important to me when I was doing all that research then it isnt going to suddenly become important to me later If I decided I want a new feature set later I will buy a new product For the record VRR is an important feature to me and I do have a TV that has it But I made sure that it had it before I bought it even though my PC at the time couldnt use it because I wanted to future proof myself for when I could use it and after a GPU upgrade I can,m0dp1my,7.0,1h6e6af
