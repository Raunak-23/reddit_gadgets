comment,lv5oi7t,GerhardArya,,1,2024-11-03 10:20:06,,,,If you know Indonesia and how big of a market it is you wouldnt be so arrogant Like the other reply said Samsung and chinese manufacturers follow their requirements and can sell there They just want you selling your stuff there to also benefit them through job creation knowledge acquistion something So honestly good for them,luzek7o,1.0,1gh6wk4
comment,luz0znp,Athryn237,,7,2024-11-02 04:27:04,,,,Major smartphone makers must manufacture devices develop firmware or invest in local innovation to meet Indonesias content rules The Indonesian rule requires tech companies to source 40 of handset and tablet components domestically a requirement that can be met through local manufacturing firmware development or direct investment in innovation projects Honestly good for Indonesia they know the value of their market to the phone makers and are actively trying to get more of the money to stay within the country,,0.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv05g7i,CosmicCreeperz,,19,2024-11-02 11:49:37,,,,Except when Apple and Google say who cares and refuse to comply with their unofficial bribes I guess they overestimated the value of their market for high end phones,luz0znp,1.0,1gh6wk4

comment,luzui22,skolioban,,7,2024-11-02 09:57:39,,,,Samsung did it So are the plethora of Chinese brands,luz23tm,2.0,1gh6wk4
comment,luz5l39,Athryn237,,9,2024-11-02 05:09:22,,,,Absolutely feasible If Indonesia had demanded that they had to specifically have 40 of the phones physical components made locally end of story that would for sure be ridiculous but they offer several ways to reach the dollar value of that 40 requirement The Indonesian rule requires tech companies to source 40 of handset and tablet components domestically a requirement that can be met through local manufacturing firmware development or direct investment in innovation projects Samsung and Xiaomi have opened manufacturing facilities there and Apple had originally been allowed to sell as they opened developer academies to train people from the country but didnt meet the 95 million investment requirement Indonesia set for the company Which might seem like a lot of money but Apple also just made approx 296 Billion dollars in gross profit from just the presales weekend of the iPhone 16 launch So regardless of anything else the company does or sells just that sales volume is staggering Indonesia is the largest smartphone market in Southeast Asia being 40 of the total smartphone devices for the entire region so its a juicy steak to smartphone makers Good to see a country leveraging its market share to bring more money training and skills into the country and keeping it there rather than having all that money immediately going offshore,luz23tm,2.0,1gh6wk4

comment,lv0495y,3600CCH6WRX,,5,2024-11-02 11:38:32,,,,Not many countries have the same leverage as Indonesia Their relatively young large population and their strategic importance in geopolitics are not something anyone can ignore The local buildinvestment requirement sounds ridiculous but they did it and most companies complied with it,luzjvyn,4.0,1gh6wk4

comment,lv0dv6i,shadowrun456,,-4,2024-11-02 12:56:49,,,,So just because they have a relatively young and large population they should get special rules If I was the US I would ban all US companies from following similar rules This is worse than tariffs most companies complied with it Define most Both the newest Apple phone and the newest Google phone are banned Thats literally the two largest companies which make phones,lv0495y,5.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv0grtz,msennaGT,,10,2024-11-02 13:16:57,,,,Samsung Xiaomi Oppo Vivo Basically 4 of the 5 largest phone companies in the world complied Google largest company which make phones Largest tech company Yes Largest phone company Not by a landslide,lv0dv6i,6.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv0pm5f,3600CCH6WRX,,6,2024-11-02 14:13:10,,,,Its not a rule Population demographic is a powerful leverage They can do this because there are manufacturers who is willing and the market who receptive Guess what The US had a similar law back in 1933 called the Buy American Act The rule was that American companies had to use at least 55 to 75 Americanmade materials in their products Even higher than what Indonesia asks for While there are some drawbacks to this policy it had a huge impact on the growth of American domestic manufacturing,lv0dv6i,6.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv1v3sv,shadowrun456,,-1,2024-11-02 17:59:15,,,,Like I said this is worse than tariffs Why should other countries not retaliate with similar measures,lv0pm5f,7.0,1gh6wk4

comment,luzxd43,hasdunk,,4,2024-11-02 10:29:12,,,,nope its to yours you said phone will cost 10k the fact that Samsung manufactures their phones in Indonesia and Indonesian can still buy them with competitive prices says otherwise,luzx4av,6.0,1gh6wk4
comment,luzxu39,shadowrun456,,-4,2024-11-02 10:34:20,,,,Do you have reading comprehension problems or something If every single country made laws like this then a smartphone would cost 10k USD,luzxd43,7.0,1gh6wk4
comment,luzzu2i,hasdunk,,1,2024-11-02 10:55:22,,,,Okay let me break it down slowly for your sake Samsung does this in Indonesia the price didnt increase What Samsung did is not building everything from scratch like the chip motherboard or display in Indonesia but only assembly Cars for example are assembled locally or at least regionally yet the prices are not that much different between market Why would a smartphone cost 10k USD if they have to be assembled locally,luzxu39,8.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv0cj8c,shadowrun456,,3,2024-11-02 12:47:11,,,,Why would a smartphone cost 10k USD if they have to be assembled locally For the third time If every single country made laws like this It has nothing to do with being produced locally and everything to do with having to find and permanently maintain 190 different manufacturing assembly whatever lines,luzzu2i,9.0,1gh6wk4
comment,luzi6fw,boilingchip,,2,2024-11-02 07:29:22,,,,What happens when another country passes a law that requires 61 of the product to be sourced locally Do you see how absurd the Indonesian rule is,luz5l39,3.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv09mg3,humannose2,,4,2024-11-02 12:24:40,,,,Then the remaining 39 can be made somewhere else Lots of countries Vietnam India etc already do this not just with phones but cars too Or are you thinking the Indonesian law also rules where phones in Americaworld are made Google Pixels in America can be 0 Indonesian Google Pixels in Indonesia has to be at least 40 Indonesian,luzi6fw,4.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv2vrr5,boilingchip,,1,2024-11-02 21:17:20,,,,So every country gets their own phone manufacturing plant This is not feasible The people in this thread who are acting like the Indonesian rule is at all reasonable simply dont understand how logistics manufacturing QAQC or distribution work,lv09mg3,5.0,1gh6wk4
comment,lv3f0we,humannose2,,1,2024-11-02 23:09:50,,,,I think you dont understand how phones or anything are made Phones are not just made out of thin air in phone manufacturing plants They need GPS receiver LCD or OLED the panel itself touch sensor layer protective glasses flash storage image sensors camera camera lens camera modules lithium ion battery NFC chips accelerometer gyroscope etc Let me give you an example for Vietnam For nonVietnamese phones 25 phone parts are produced in Vietnamese plantsfactoriesmines but 72 for Vietnamese phones China itself is able to make more than 150 parts of a phone You mentioned logistics and distribution so you have to at least realize phones are not just made in phone factories out of thin air,lv2vrr5,6.0,1gh6wk4

comment,luzzghh,Skyswimsky,,2,2024-11-02 10:51:28,,,,Not downvoting but Capitalism bad is such a loaded statement I mean nobody is saying that but the whole idea behind it is that a group of individuals focus their effort into overproducing what they excel at and export it while importing what theyre lacking Thats commonly done via trade And its what helped humanities growth accelerate So going so GOOD of them to force companies to produce there instead in places where it make more sense rather than India focusing on its economic strengths is kinda like saying capitalism bad or just eat an apple if you have depressions the vitamins make you happy At least thats my take and I guess thats why downvotes,luzwpbj,1.0,1gh6wk4
