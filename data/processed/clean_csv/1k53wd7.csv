comment,mol9tbp,Less_Party,,1,2025-04-23 11:27:56,,,,Its a nice side benefit rather than something Id seriously argue people should buy one for but Ive got an M1 Macbook and thats a lot nicer to just have on all day than my big lumbering desktop that draws something obscene like 80W at idle and is clearly audible throughout the room,mogbsz8,4.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofe7ln,okram2k,,18,2025-04-22 13:26:45,,,,look up commercial displays They are all the features of modern TVs with no smart features only simple HDMI inputs Most intense software many include is wifi streaming from another device They are though more expensive because theyre targeted at business customers but sometimes you can find used ones pretty cheap,mof9osn,2.0,1k53wd7

comment,moffxyk,Nimradd,,5,2025-04-22 13:36:45,,,,I know they technically exist I just wish they were consumer products and cheaper because I dont want the extra features I can make my smart TV kinda dumb again just blocking it from accessing the internet,mofe7ln,3.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofohyr,Briantastically,,6,2025-04-22 14:22:44,,,,The consumer TVs are cheaper because of the extra features The manufacturers assume they will make their profit selling information the tv scrapes from your viewing habits,moffxyk,4.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofp9ue,Nimradd,,0,2025-04-22 14:26:42,,,,I get that they will make some money selling my data or showing me ads but for each TV that is a very very small amount compared to the price of the TV itself Nobody in their right mind would purchase my viewing habits for a three digit number of dollars,mofohyr,5.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofr2se,Briantastically,,3,2025-04-22 14:35:52,,,,My limited understanding is that tv manufacturers sell the TVs at or below their cost and the profit is almost entirely a result of the metricsad business Even if theyre only making a few dollars per month from you over the years that adds up to a healthy margin,mofp9ue,6.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofx11k,Nimradd,,2,2025-04-22 15:05:26,,,,My understanding is thats only true for the cheap TVs Manufacturing costs of high endmid end TVs have big margins I only know this from knowing guys in the business the goal is upselling all the time,mofr2se,7.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofg3fe,NuclearReactions,,-5,2025-04-22 13:37:37,,,,Thanks ideally i want to avoid using any additional device the beauty of the tv is being able to just turn it on with the remote press either netflix or youtube and watch something Its such a casual thing that adding additional steps would lead to me simply not using it i never watch it actively unless its movies night or something like that The proxy or pi hole thing should work well worst case scenario Ill consider apple tv as long as i dont have to pay any subscruption or a simple windows based gaming pc which would replace most of my consoles,moff6rz,2.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofi5df,foggybottom,,23,2025-04-22 13:48:56,,,,For what its worth I hit power on my Apple TV remote and it turns on the tv and the Apple TV at the same time and goes right to the Apple interface There are no extra steps just plug and go There are no subscriptions when it comes to the Apple TV Apple TV is the service with all the shows they are releasing You download whatever apps you use and go from there Your other option could be Roku if you want Ive used both and prefer the Apple interface as it feels cleaner and I find the Roku interface a bit sluggish,mofg3fe,3.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofukgb,foggybottom,,1,2025-04-22 14:53:13,,,,I used to use Roku much more but its the interface in my old tv Im honestly not a huge fan of it really Its very slow now Was just giving an alternative that is much cheaper though Ive never used the google tv interface so couldnt really talk to that but its sounding like its probably better,mofrwrp,5.0,1k53wd7
comment,mohyabj,IrishWolfHounder,,1,2025-04-22 21:02:26,,,,Put an Apple TV on each tv throw in a pihole if you are a bit technically inclined and you can have a pretty good consistent experience with no ads I even got my MIL to do this Let me set her up I mean The Apple TV can be customized pretty well and is easy to use Shes pretty happy with this,mofi5df,4.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofm7j5,pinkynarftroz,,7,2025-04-22 14:10:50,,,,I thought it would be a hassle but our setup is a dumb plasma TV with a Mac mini hooked to it Weve got a Bluetooth keyboard and trackpad that we use to wake the Mac when we turn on the TV Its actually way faster to navigate and search on streaming sites with a cursor and keyboard you can type with And of course it has an ad blocker if we want to watch anything on YouTube Ill never ever go back to a smart TV with a shitty interface and slow remote,mofg3fe,3.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofs3qu,dominus_aranearum,,1,2025-04-22 14:41:00,,,,Ive been running my TV off a computer for the last 15 years Current setup is a Xulu XR1 mini PC with Linux and a Bluetooth keyboardtrack pad on a 75 Aver interactive flat panel Adblockers on Firefox No commercials in this house,mofm7j5,4.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofu0kw,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-04-22 14:50:29,,,,Weve got a table in front of the couch You can also just put the trackpad and keyboard on a tray or something You definitely do not need a full size keyboard for this The apple Bluetooth one without the num pad is a good size,mofs963,5.0,1k53wd7
comment,mog5mwy,rudimentary-north,,1,2025-04-22 15:47:16,,,,macOS has such awful scaling issues on larger screens that I use a mini windows PC for this purpose,mofm7j5,4.0,1k53wd7
comment,mog75oh,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-04-22 15:54:33,,,,That doesnt matter with media The scaling of full screen playback is program dependent Youre thinking of the interface elements,mog5mwy,5.0,1k53wd7
comment,mog7uuq,rudimentary-north,,1,2025-04-22 15:57:53,,,,yes I am thinking of the interface elements in order to get full screen media playing you have to interact with the interface Web browsing was a nightmare compared to windows 11,mog75oh,6.0,1k53wd7
comment,moguhkk,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-04-22 17:46:47,,,,In my opinion youre massively overstating the issue Its so minor and few people will really notice or care You speak like a web browser is unusable on MacOS,mog7uuq,7.0,1k53wd7
comment,mohp46p,rudimentary-north,,1,2025-04-22 20:17:27,,,,Just stating my experience Im 100 in the Apple ecosystem except for this media Pc because the scaling issue bothered me so much I did find the web browser almost unusable on my Mac scaled to my 4k TV I dont think the issue is minor at all plenty of forum posts out there complaining about the way macOS handles 4k displays,moguhkk,8.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofr74w,menkoy,,3,2025-04-22 14:36:29,,,,Yeah I recently bought an LG TV About every week it asks me to update which involves it running like shit restarting and making me agree to new terms and conditions again Every week If I ignore it then it asks me to update after 3 minutes of being turned on every time I turn it on On top of that my home screen is 80 ads that play way too loud and obscure the 23 apps I actually want to use Those apps have also randomly uninstalled themselves a couple times,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofhw4a,ArchusKanzaki,,4,2025-04-22 13:47:32,,,,I think it depends My Samsung G80SD have those smart TV features and I do love them Its the only way to get 4K Netflix or other streaming services to stream actual 4K output for some reason The upscaler also works quite well As for the ads I do not encounter any but the thing is everything about the TV generally stays outoftheway when doing normal computer stuffs so I do not need to interact with TV stuffs on daily basis I just do it when I want to watch Netflix,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofmiga,pinkynarftroz,,2,2025-04-22 14:12:25,,,,I might be wrong but Netflix can be 4K under Safari on MacOS I remember Apple making a big deal about this for being the only browser allowing that resolution A quick search seems to corroborate this,mofhw4a,2.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofn0f6,ArchusKanzaki,,2,2025-04-22 14:15:01,,,,Maybe they do special support for Safari on Mac but Windows PC no longer have 4K HDR as of now I checked both the Windows Store Netflix app and opening Netflix on Microsoft Edge browser which some noted that it used to support I am using Godzilla Minus One for checking Might also be because the connection is using the DisplayPort instead of HDMI but switching is a dealbreaker for me since I use both HDMI for PS5 and Switch,mofmiga,3.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofqyje,dylanholmes222,,2,2025-04-22 14:35:17,,,,You can switch to just the app list mode which is a more basic UI kinda like Apple TV but it doesnt have all the crazy large Ads rotating on the carousel,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofv88g,Moskeeto93,,2,2025-04-22 14:56:29,,,,You should definitely check out the Projectivy Launcher Its so much better than the default launcher has no ads and is very customizable I use it on any Google TV device now It also easily takes over as the default launcher so you never have to see home screen ads again Also check out rProjectivy_Launcher for some examples of how others are customizing their home screens,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7

comment,moh9mn6,ball_fondlers,,1,2025-04-22 19:00:50,,,,This would have been shit ten years ago too its just that the smart features would have been underpowered enough to ignore If I have a monitor I want it to do exactly one thing display whatever is plugged into it If I want streaming services or AI bullshit Ill bring those in myself,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7
comment,mof4zai,xpen25x,,-16,2025-04-22 12:30:29,,,,but without the smart function you would have paid way more have you looked at nonsmart tvs in the same size and cost,moex6z2,1.0,1k53wd7
comment,mof6euo,NuclearReactions,,7,2025-04-22 12:39:43,,,,When i bought it it was 2018 i doubt the tv ads were factored into the price Not in the market for a tv now and wont be for as long as this TV lives hopefully another 10 years but that would be the plan Either buy a non smart one no idea if there are 65 non smart oleds now Im curious or buy one and not connect it to the internet As for the current tv Im working on a proxy server and have the tv connect there instead It should load everything but the ads once Im done,mof4zai,2.0,1k53wd7
comment,mog8mib,xpen25x,,1,2025-04-22 16:01:35,,,,even in 2018 it was all about harvesting your viewing now sending you ads and even in 2018 smart tvs were comparable in price and very few monitors were built then as well and there are nonsmart but they are made for the commercial space,mof6euo,3.0,1k53wd7

comment,moex1zj,cat_prophecy,,191,2025-04-22 11:35:22,,,,Having recently bought a smart TV monitor I can tell you that the smart TV stuff is the worst part of it I dont need Netflix or Hulu on my monitor its connected to a fucking computer already About the only thing thats unique to it is that it has an OTA antenna for TV But who in 2025 is watching over the air TV Certainly not people buying OLED monitors,,0.0,1k53wd7
comment,mof0mgo,SonMystic,,40,2025-04-22 12:01:02,,,,OTA antenna is actually pretty nice I think I agree the smart features dont seem to match up since youre connected to a computer with it but an antenna that doesnt require Internet connection to watch some stuff like live sports on local channels is a very nice perk I think Small edit to this after just a bit more thought even using something like this as a spare monitor would be a decent idea You could swap over to a sports game on a second screen sacrificing no processing power or internet bandwidth I like this idea,moex1zj,1.0,1k53wd7
comment,mof3db2,Buckeye_Monkey,,14,2025-04-22 12:19:51,,,,Yep Live sports local news and severe weather coverage are why we have antennas on our TVs Everything else is streamed,mof0mgo,2.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofcwuo,JohnJohn173,,3,2025-04-22 13:19:16,,,,People really havent used netflix or hulu on their computer and it shows I cant use hulu because for whatever reason even with my location it locks me out and does not allow me to watch or browse hulu Netflix and all other streaming services with movies or tv speficially are locked behind 720p 169 I just bought an ultrawide to see content in its recorded aspect ratios and it was painful trying to figure out what was going on I have since sailed the sea found the content I want to watch and enjoy it how its supposed to be seen This does not help with sports though if you can somehow get espn or hulu to work those are at least broadcast in 1080p We have the ability to make streaming services work on pc but as of now in order to watch above 720p you have to be on a tv This monitor would allow you to do that it seems,moex1zj,1.0,1k53wd7

comment,mofv11f,ArchusKanzaki,,1,2025-04-22 14:55:29,,,,More like alot of people either never really try to have 4K on their Netflix or does not even have 4K display Most people here seems to not be aware of the quality reduction either its because they do not notice or they never experienced actual 4K Tbf this is probably because the rest of specs are not great 45 Curved WQHD OLED in 2025 When 42 and 48 Flat OLED exist I dont know who is this for I guess thats why they promote the WebOS to try to slot it as Smart Monitor In contrast not much people even know that Samsungs G80SD even have Samsung Smart TV things inside them because its more like a footnote in their feature list instead They dont even tag it as Smart Monitor despite it probably qualifies as such and Samsung also produce Smart Monitor And now that I think about it you do not need 4K too for this Its only WQHD,mofcwuo,2.0,1k53wd7
comment,mofympg,JohnJohn173,,1,2025-04-22 15:13:28,,,,Im sure lots of people would love to watch streaming services through a browser Im sure many have tried think about all the college kids hosting movie nights or families with a home network sitting down to watch something If I can immediatelly start watching a show and notice the resolution isnt getting any better surely than can too And these specs are fine lol you mention 42 and 48 already being a thing but I guess you fail to realise 45 is literally in the middle of both of those Not a huge difference 1440 isnt terrible either this seems to be a middle of the road gaming monitor with some smart features If I hadnt just bought an ultrawide wqhd monitor Id be looking at this one,mofv11f,3.0,1k53wd7

comment,moieta5,x10011010001x,,1,2025-04-22 22:30:17,,,,Smart TVs were a great idea until advertising absolutely everywhere became popular I got a TCL Roku TV about 7 years ago and noticed a huge increase in ads during COVID Enough of them that it prompted me to factory reset the TV and only use it as another monitor and connection to my stereo Every update brought more ads that slowed it down more Ads for the background ads on the right side ads at the bottom briefly even popup ads when I turned it on I have a theory that smart TVs prompted streaming services to seek ad revenue because they knew the only way around ads would be special adfree memberships 7 years later theres ads everywhere and the correct way to bypass is membership for fewer ads YouTube even has ads if you pay for the adfree membership now If LG can promise NO ADS in the UI seems like a good idea But because Im about 9999 certain thats not gonna happen seems like a bad idea,,0.0,1k53wd7

comment,monv9ax,imakesawdust,,1,2025-04-23 19:35:01,,,,LG has already shown smart TVs that analyze screen content to guess the viewers mood Now lets extend this concept to a computer monitor that analyzes screen content its relatively easy to perform optical character recognition so one of these smart monitors could be used as a type of keylogger,,0.0,1k53wd7
