comment,mtnw2ru,Pocok5,,517,2025-05-22 14:44:21,,,,This is a pricy fully digital camera cosplaying as a film camera It just uses digital filters on the images to simulate the looks of film Hence why its absurd that you are not permitted to disable the filters and just save RAW data,mtnrjix,1.0,1ksro8z
comment,mto2n4n,gdopiv,,133,2025-05-22 15:16:15,,,,Yeah definitely But film is like your raw image and the print is like the JPEG It took digital a loooong time to be able to match the dynamic range of film So to say theyre dedicated to analog vibes but removed raw is a statement that doesnt make sense to me If they were dedicated to analog vibes wed get RAW and a 3 CCD sensor,mtnw2ru,2.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtpwsxg,shawnington,,7,2025-05-22 20:34:08,,,,Correction it took digital a long time to have enough dynamic range to simulate the soft rolloff of overexposure that film does Film in general only has about 7 stops of EV some more some less where as modern cameras have 14 stops of ev but the film when its past its exposure range has a progressive roll off not a hard clipping like digital does,mto2n4n,3.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtoi3st,VagabondVivant,,80,2025-05-22 16:30:54,,,,Im guessing youve never shot with a Fuji Theyre known for their excellent color rendition Its pretty much their thing next to their love for the analog aesthetic This camera basically combines the two Fujis film simulation is a far cry from the digital filters you see in camera apps Theyre not just a simple overlay thats slapped on a finished image and called a day Theyre applied at multiple levels in the process working with tone curves color lookup tables lens profiles the works Its an algorithmic process rather than just an aesthetic one Theyre also the result of literal decades of research and development striving to achieve specific film looks A number of Fuji photographers already shoot SOOC JPGs relying on the innate processing to achieve certain film emulations and save them hours in front of Lightroom thats how good Fujis tech is I dont know how well this camera will fare Its a big swing but thats what Fuji is known for People laughed at the X100 when it first came out saying no one would pay 1500 for a fixedlens camera Now its one of their most popular models with new models being impossible to find for months after their releases Ultimately well have to see if this camera finds a market but I think it can Halfframe cameras are few and farbetween so there isnt much competition And the Pentax 17 has proven theres a market for every niche Time will tell,mtntbul,1.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtosd61,NavidsonRcrd,,25,2025-05-22 17:19:46,,,,Their film sims are great but this just feels a little ridiculous focusing on analog nostalgia while targeting zoomers who have never used one with a tiny sensor that most likely wont match 35mm film quality Would love to see them go the Pentax route and actually make a film camerasfilm again as I feel like Fujis one of few brands that could pull it off,mtoi3st,2.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtp7696,VagabondVivant,,9,2025-05-22 18:29:36,,,,I dont think the X Half is meant to compete with other cameras but with phones And in that regard its going to produce pushbutton results that far outpace anything said Zoomers could get on their latest iPhones and Pixels All in a retro package that theyre gonna lap up,mtosd61,3.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtp8b38,NavidsonRcrd,,3,2025-05-22 18:35:08,,,,I do totally get that a nice if pricey party camera that will take much better photos than an instax or alternative while being much more of an event than just a phone shot Fuji does a phenomenal job producing SOOC results without need for tweaking Personally as a biased film shooter it hurts to see Fuji putting their resources into this with all of their analog heritage and the resurgence in film though,mtp7696,4.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtp1kep,Intelligent-Parsley7,,6,2025-05-22 18:02:43,,,,Unfortunately for that price Id just get a used X100whatever Same price effectively just a heck of a lot more features I have an X100s Arguably can never sell it Unless Im gettting a newer one,mtoi3st,2.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtp4znf,VagabondVivant,,4,2025-05-22 18:19:06,,,,Conversely one could argue Why would I get an X100 when I can get a used XTwhatever and just keep a pancake 28mm on there 90 of the time That way Id at least have the option of switching to a different lens if I ever wanted to After owning both X100 and XT cameras thats why I ended up keeping the latter I _love_ the X100 series but the XT is more versatile for my needs At the end of the day it comes down to the market Fuji is trying to serve X100s and XTs serve different markets just as the X Half is going to,mtp1kep,3.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtthwcb,Intelligent-Parsley7,,1,2025-05-23 11:48:23,,,,Fair point,mtp4znf,4.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtxlfvu,korewafap,,1,2025-05-24 00:44:47,,,,I actually cross shopped the XT5 and X100VI too and in the end I kept my XT3 and picked up the X100VI I kept the X100VI mostly for its size and because I prefer the 23mm focal length over the 28mm or 18mm pancakes I also really like the rangefinder style not having my face hidden behind the camera when Im shooting people feels more natural and it helps avoid constantly smudging the screen with my nose haha As for this new camera Im honestly baffled by the price its such a niche product That said if its your vibe you probably already know you want it Im definitely intrigued but theres no way Im paying full price Specs wise its practically toy level but its still a real enough camera that my kids could actually start learning photography with it I would love to have one to play with,mtp4znf,4.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtojy0b,None,,1,2025-05-22 16:40:00,,,,Well I may be more convinced if it produces decent looking film shots As you mentioned other filters dont tend to come close to the real thing But why not just shoot film at that point Is it still cheaper Or is it the digital convenience I cant tell who the market is for this,mtoi3st,2.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtp6leo,VagabondVivant,,8,2025-05-22 18:26:48,,,,But why not just shoot film at that point Thats ultimately an argument one could make about _any_ Fuji camera really I cant tell who the market is for this Because youre not in it Theres been a huge clamor among Gen Z for more old school tech Theyve been buying up outdated digital cameras to achieve certain retro aesthetics to them Theyre also the folks most using filters and film simulations The X Half marries all of that into a simple nomuss nofuss digital camera Dont forget many digital camera users never shoot RAW because they dont have the wherewithal to spend hours sitting at a computer editing They just wanna shoot and post Which is also why the portraitoriented sensor is so clutch its the perfect Instagram Camera Sure they could just turn a regular camera on its side to achieve the same effect but they could also just turn their phone on its side to watch videos in landscape mode and yet no one does Thats why TikTok is so huge The X Half basically gives Gen Z who I believe to ultimately be the target market a camera that produces better images and achieves closer filmlike looks than their phone while still letting them shootandupload via said phone without ever having to download to a computer All in a package small enough to fit in a purse or jacket pocket I think it has the potential to be pretty popular The 800 price tag might hurt it but well ultimately have to see,mtojy0b,3.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtweeoa,Kilo147,,3,2025-05-23 20:36:55,,,,I dont think Gen Z is gonna go for it Cheap Y2K era digicams are everywhere and do what they want with a specific style of photograph Its not about doing film digitally its about ditching the hyperprocessed smartphone photos for ones that are more authentic The Fujifilm X fails the vibe check period Get a Nikon Coolpix instead,mtp6leo,4.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtwm36f,VagabondVivant,,1,2025-05-23 21:16:41,,,,Yeah I dont know how successful its gonna be at 800 Maybe theyll find some success in the Insta mom market but GenZ might be too savvy or broke to bother with the X Half no matter how much Fuji seems to be building it for them I think the biggest mistake was removing custom recipes I can say that as someone who loves travel photography thats one of my favorite features with Fuji Not to emulate film styles but to be able to dial in specific incamera pp settings in order to spend less time in front of a computer when Im on the road Letting X½ users customize their jpg presets would go a long way to helping them make it theirs as it were Time will tell Maybe itll find an audience outside of its intended one,mtweeoa,5.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtwovwg,Kilo147,,3,2025-05-23 21:31:49,,,,Never underestimate Gen Z and Gen Alpha They delight in sheer simplicity are creative beyond their means and love old tech forgotten by the masses They love their individuality will make their own style and are absorbed with expressing themselves in the most unique ways Ive seen in my 42 years on this rock They are remarkably intelligent outshining any generation Ive encountered and they are more politically aware than any of the proceeding generations going back to the 70s Flip phones Y2K digicams wired headphones and CDs are all making an unlikely comeback thanks to them Grunge is back I mean fuck Blackberries are back Go through the Gen Z Reddit Its absolutely fascinating,mtwm36f,6.0,1ksro8z
comment,mtr5o2r,darti_me,,3,2025-05-23 00:41:35,,,,Shooting film is can be very expensive Your basic film point shoots can go up to 100 for a good working condition Your SLRs by the likes of Canon Nikon can hover in the 3 digit mark for body lens But some premium models ex Konicas Pentax Fujis Hasselblads Leicas 2 decades out of production can go up to 1000 just for a donorparts body A working Body Frame can easily hit 2000 Thats just your fixed cost For variable cost youre looking at 10 per 36 exposures plus a development scanning fee if you dont have the equipment Then you may want to do cleaning calibration every few years which usually costs 50 for basic SLRs PS,mtojy0b,3.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtw1hb3,VagabondVivant,,1,2025-05-23 19:31:33,,,,Then youre not the target market One of Fujis schticks has been making big swing cameras that only appeal to specific niches The X100 and GFX series have been proof of that mocked by many when they were initially announced Nobodys gonna pay 1500 for a fixedlens camera Nobodys gonna pay 5000 for a notreallymedium Medium but eventually finding audiences willing to spend the money on them The 800 price tag might be a bit of a tough sell but theres absolutely a market for a portraitsensor superretro nopostneeded camera especially among the GenZ and Insta crowd You and I might not be _in_ that market but that doesnt mean the market doesnt exist,mtvfloe,5.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtphixm,VagabondVivant,,9,2025-05-22 19:19:44,,,,Fuji doesnt have a look it has an industry reputation for incredible color rendition and obsessive attention to film emulation that it has built over years Monitors have never been standardized and calibration exists only on the desks of professionals yet none of that has affected their reputation in the slightest,mtpeic8,3.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtqb70k,VagabondVivant,,2,2025-05-22 21:47:34,,,,What do you mean not to display the final result Are you still talking about the fact that monitors dont have a universal standard and display images differently Because again that has zero bearing on Fujis exceptional color rendition Different people perceive the same sounds differently that doesnt change the fact that Sennheiser headphones produce exceptional sound quality Different people perceive the same tastes differently that doesnt change the fact that HäagenDazs makes some of the tastiest ice cream around Fuji sensors and lenses produce fantastic color Thats just an industry fact Where theyre being displayed doesnt change that,mtq9v51,7.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtofc4p,roadmapdevout,,4,2025-05-22 16:17:23,,,,Theyre not just built in filters exactly The in camera processing on Fuji cameras is fantastic I say this from their reputation and from experience I have no doubt the images out of this camera will look great Why they added a film advance lever I couldnt possibly say Its a stupid gimmick The lack of RAW makes no sense other than to simplify the experience for the super casual target demo of the camera Otherwise its just a super budget X100 with a lot of corners cut,mtntbul,1.0,1ksro8z

comment,mto5don,robalob30,,12,2025-05-22 15:29:23,,,,Fuji is absolutely good with natively processing JPGs which is so nice when Im too lazy to work on the RAW files But the film advance lever seems a bit pretentiously silly like adding a clutch pedal to a fully automatic car,mto0o12,3.0,1ksro8z
comment,mto9dmp,LaVernWinston,,3,2025-05-22 15:48:20,,,,I mean theyre definitely leaning as much as they can into an analog experience though and tucked that function away into its own mode I would completely agree if the lever was required at all times,mto5don,4.0,1ksro8z

comment,mtq2m3f,ThinkExtension2328,,2,2025-05-22 21:02:18,,,,Yea no so with Fuji part of what makes them cool is other then the ones they have in this camera they have slots for 7 user defined film simulations These are called recipes This camera does not seem to have that ability,mtpzaik,3.0,1ksro8z
