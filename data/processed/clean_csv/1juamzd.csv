post,1juamzd,chrisdh79,Researchers have developed a handheld device that could potentially replace stethoscopes as a tool for detecting certain types of heart disease.,1257,2025-04-08 10:51:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1juamzd/researchers_have_developed_a_handheld_device_that/,63.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mm2vmi3,Emademademad,,56,2025-04-08 18:41:32,,,,Nobody uses a stethoscope to detect heart disease Its at most a crude tool to exclude heart disease No one actually listens to the heart with their stethoscope and thinks ah hah a systolic midejection murmur with radiation to the carotids no need for confirmatory echocardiogram just move directly to the trans catheter aortic valve replacement Fucking dumb ass article,,0.0,1juamzd
comment,mm3tnik,S_A_N_D_,,16,2025-04-08 21:26:58,,,,This was my thought Not to mention there are already handheld EKGs the size of a credit card capable of giving 6 lead data In other words there is already a handheld device that exceeds this one Now Id love for an expert to chime in here to give their opinion on whether there sounds that dont translate to an EKG because unless there is something that sound gives that an EKG doesnt this device is already obsolete,mm2vmi3,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm5zuaz,pairoflytics,,3,2025-04-09 05:35:02,,,,Youre looking at two related but very different things with a stethoscope and an EKG The EKG shows electrical conduction of the heart The stethoscope listens to the closure of the valves You can have a relatively normal EKG with absent heart tones and absent pulse its called PEA or pulseless electrical activity An EKG tells us very little about how well the heart is mechanically functioning,mm3tnik,2.0,1juamzd
comment,mm7qruz,S_A_N_D_,,2,2025-04-09 14:12:55,,,,OK this is the reply I was looking for I figured if it was apparent by sound it would be apparent electrically but Im also not an expert Thanks for the correction,mm5zuaz,3.0,1juamzd
comment,mm5lims,DanielCA77,,3,2025-04-09 03:40:49,,,,Its not uncommon for primary care doctors to detect a murmur on exam with a stethoscope and then order an echo which leads to the diagnosis of severe valvular heart disease Stethoscopes are still useful,mm2vmi3,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm3slcr,nomjs,,4,2025-04-08 21:21:26,,,,Those 80 year old cardiologists definitely still declare shit like this with their stethoscopes lol but the confirmatory tests are also ordered,mm2vmi3,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm4bs25,Dedb4dawn,,2,2025-04-08 23:06:31,,,,Was having chest pains about a month back Went into AE UK where they took my pulse BP did an EKG and blood tests At no point did anyone even wave a stethoscope in my general direction Cant remember the last time I actually saw one in use Thankfully turned out to be a really bad anxiety attack rather than anything more serious,mm2vmi3,1.0,1juamzd

comment,mm0lgy0,dstevens25,,101,2025-04-08 11:20:37,,,,Requires training to use Alot of user to user intervariability Sounds are still muffled at times and when you move the tubing itninterferes with the sound Patient boby habitus impacts sounds A cardiologist vs a family doctor listening to your heart the cardiologist will hear things that the family doc may miss Source nurse who uses a stethoscope multiple times a day,mm0j7ix,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm1f5t9,Honest-Layer9318,,22,2025-04-08 14:25:59,,,,My GP asked if I had a murmur because of a heart valve issue he saw in my notes I said no I have a systolic click His response was I wont hear that so Ill take your word for it I appreciated his honesty A cardiologist diagnosed my issue with only a stethoscope,mm0lgy0,2.0,1juamzd
comment,mm1ysk0,IlGssm,,24,2025-04-08 16:03:34,,,,In fairness cardiologists usually have significantly better stethoscopes than the average GP Its not just a difference in skill though obviously thats part of it but also equipment,mm1f5t9,3.0,1juamzd
comment,mm42q16,ThunderDungeon02,,7,2025-04-08 22:15:18,,,,No its definitely skill Anybody can buy a cardiology scope Maybe a nurse is using your basic littmann but no GP is The difference is training A cardiologist has 4 years of medical school 34 year residency in internal medicine and then at least a three year fellowship in cardiology General MDDO has everything but the three years of cardiology Then your NPs have two years of training outside of a four year nursing degreehowever heart sounds are never really taught outside of personal experiencewhat type of nursing you are in Finally PAs with two years of training,mm1ysk0,4.0,1juamzd
comment,mm4otiw,JstVisitingThsPlanet,,5,2025-04-09 00:21:11,,,,Im an NP and heart sounds were taught in both my under grad and grad programs Nursing education varies widely,mm42q16,5.0,1juamzd
comment,mm56mhy,Inner-Bread,,5,2025-04-09 02:05:54,,,,Cardiologist also benefits from having a large sample size of data to train their ear on over their career too Basically all of their patients have heart issues While for a GP it will be rarer but they are looking for early signs of tons of other things,mm42q16,5.0,1juamzd

comment,mm1bxow,binarygoober,,13,2025-04-08 14:09:02,,,,Unlike a stethoscope the device works well even if its not placed precisely on the chest its larger flexible sensing area helps capture clearer heart sounds than traditional stethoscopes,mm0j7ix,1.0,1juamzd

comment,mm1yh5o,Toomanydamnfandoms,,2,2025-04-08 16:01:58,,,,Oh thats awesome It would be nice to get a similar device for lungs too as body shape and weight can make differentiating some lung noises difficult at times as well,mm1bxow,2.0,1juamzd
comment,mm2jbxr,drpacz,,4,2025-04-08 17:43:02,,,,This reminds me of the quote in 1834 London Times about the stethoscope That it will ever come into general use notwithstanding its value is extremely doubtful because its beneficial application requires much time and gives a good bit of trouble both to the patient and the practitioner because its hue and character are foreign and opposed to all our habits and associations,mm0j7ix,1.0,1juamzd

comment,mm5g0zw,Kookycranium,,1,2025-04-09 03:02:59,,,,No Like anything it takes practice Lung sounds rales rhonchi wheezing stridor bowel sounds hypohyperactive cardiac heart tones S1 S2 S3 S4 Bruits gallops thrills Not to be that guy if its difficult for a certain provider to distinguish Then they need to practice and study more EDIT source Flight paramedicFlight nurse,mm0j7ix,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm3enwl,Minimum_Aioli1102,,7,2025-04-08 20:14:41,,,,just 38 of patients who present to their GP with symptoms of valve disease receive an examination with a stethoscope Maybe things are different in the UK but in the US someone could come in with a stubbed toe and we still listen to their heart and lungs I find it hard to believe this statistic And I dont think an engineer is the most qualified to do that research or comment on reasons behind it,,0.0,1juamzd

comment,mm31ol0,TeaEarlGreyHotti,,2,2025-04-08 19:11:38,,,,It will replace the little round part on the stethoscope and the drs can wear this like a medal And still put the things in their ears so they can also hear what the lil machine hears,mm0nft0,1.0,1juamzd

comment,mm4ffjh,CaptRon25,,1,2025-04-08 23:27:09,,,,echocardiogram but this can only be done in a hospital and NHS waiting lists are extremely long between six to nine months at many hospitals 6 to 9 months Thats crazy Theres an EKG machine in just about every Cardiologist office in the country and multiple machines in most hospitals and testing centers in the US ECG machines can be found in medical offices hospitals operating rooms and ambulances Mayo Clinic,,0.0,1juamzd
comment,mm5x46b,_LarryM_,,1,2025-04-09 05:11:15,,,,Im in the US and it would probably take me 6 months to get one too 3 months to get into normal doc to have him refer me to a cardiologist so my insurance doesnt get pissy than another 3 before cardiologist will see me Yes 3 months for normal doctor I checked a few weeks ago for heart issues and then just realized Im fine with a massive heart attack when I saw 3 months away for a 7am appointment,mm4ffjh,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm61nzn,CaptRon25,,1,2025-04-09 05:51:36,,,,The reason I said what I said was my brother suspected he was having cardiac problems Called his primary and got in the next day He was refereed to a Cardiologist who prescribed an EKG ECG later that day at the hospital It took 1 full day EKG showed signs that suggested a possible blockage He went back early the next morning for a Cardiac CT Angiography procedure Later that day he was in the Cath lab where the Doctor implanted a coronary stent Total time was 2 full days,mm5x46b,2.0,1juamzd

comment,mm9i9jp,CaptRon25,,1,2025-04-09 19:21:54,,,,Another one My mom was married to guy from England They had houses in Chipping Campden England and Michigan He was in CC for a few months and had numbness in his extremities They scheduled him for a MRI or CT cant remember which in 9 months My mom called his physician in the US and they flew him back the next day He was having emergency cervical surgery at University of Michigan hospital the day after that,mm8cxd5,4.0,1juamzd
comment,mm6lijw,Rhone33,,1,2025-04-09 09:19:53,,,,It sounds like youre confusing echocardiogram with electrocardiogram ECGEKG The latter is a quick and easy display of the hearts electrical activity and should be done within minutes after arrival if you show up to a hospital with any cardiac or respiratory symptoms The former is a specialized cardiac ultrasound and is far less quick and routine,mm4ffjh,1.0,1juamzd
comment,mm9ggzp,CaptRon25,,1,2025-04-09 19:13:02,,,,Which ever one they did at the primary doctors office he ended up at the hospital Cath lab and it didnt take 6 months It took 2 days,mm6lijw,2.0,1juamzd
comment,mm9pvsg,Rhone33,,1,2025-04-09 19:58:46,,,,Yes thats an electrocardiogramEKG Hospitals are swarming with EKG machines and an EKG can be performed in a couple minutes by any nurse or underpaid tech A hospital might have one machine for echocardiograms and it could take up to an hour per patient EKGs are great for helping to diagnose emergent heart issues like a myocardial infarction that would require a trip to the cath lab Echocardiograms are good for diagnosing some less immediately lifethreatening heart issues that dont always show up on an initial cardiac workup I agree it shouldnt take months to schedule an outpatient echocardiogram but thats an entirely separate issue from how quick it is to do an EKG And if youre having any cardiac symptoms like chest pain or difficulty breathing you shouldnt be scheduling an outpatient echo to begin with you should be going to an ER At that point if the initial cardiac workup EKG bloodwork chest Xray doesnt show anything emergent but your symptoms and risk factors warrant further investigation you should be getting an echocardiogram andor a stress test no later than the next day,mm9ggzp,3.0,1juamzd
comment,mm9x45j,CaptRon25,,1,2025-04-09 20:33:37,,,,you shouldnt be scheduling an outpatient echo to begin with you should be going to an ER My brothers primary thought the same thing which is why he ended up in the Cath lab the next day getting a stent Apparently Mayo Clinic considers ECG and EKG to be the same thing Echocardiogram is ultrasound The original issue I was responding to was in the UK it takes 6 to 8 months like the article was saying I said that was crazy since every hospital and cardiac testing clinic in the US has at least one machine and you could be dead by then if you had wait 6 months The article said The gold standard for diagnosing heart valve disease is an echocardiogram but this can only be done in a hospital and NHS waiting lists are extremely long between six to nine months at many hospitals,mm9pvsg,4.0,1juamzd
comment,mm9yfty,Rhone33,,1,2025-04-09 20:40:04,,,,Yeah ECG and EKG are used interchangeably to abbreviate electrocardiogram I think the K in EKG comes from the German term kardio instead of cardio,mm9x45j,5.0,1juamzd
comment,mm6htij,GlumTowel672,,1,2025-04-09 08:39:43,,,,it outperforms GPs at detecting valvular heart disease but how good is it at excluding it I could listen to 100 people and say they all have valvular heart disease and need to be sent for an echo and then you could also say I outperformed GPs at detecting valvular heart disease,,0.0,1juamzd

comment,mm5ciqk,Inmytanks,,2,2025-04-09 02:40:32,,,,The headline is bad because it doesnt describe or hint anything unique about the device or why its different exciting The title only describes it as a handheld device which the stethoscope is also,mm4248w,2.0,1juamzd
