comment,mm7mvyn,TheDynamicDino,,1180,2025-04-09 13:52:51,,,,We believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point Thats why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe be a part of these characters in these worlds and see value if you will in whatever rung of the platform they come in The full quote,,0.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmd78ga,Wisdomlost,,9,2025-04-10 10:44:17,,,,Their biggest problem was there was massive rumors about diablo 4 being announced at that con Rumors that blizzard fed for a couple days before they realized oh that might be a bad idea and stopping pushing the Rumors further I dont think a phone game announcement would have been well received no matter how they did it but if they would have shut down the D4 Rumors immediately and tried to temper expectations instead of building hype for the wrong reasons then the backlash would have been vastly smaller They shot themselves in the foot by trying to ride a hype train for something they knew was not happening,mm9zd8n,7.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmbq459,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-10 02:39:54,,,,Theyre not ending support for Switch for very practical reasons First being the simple fact that a large chunk of their user base cant afford the new console Second being the equally simple fact that most of their user base hasnt been clamoring for PS4 visuals when PS3 visuals have been sufficing just fine Good luck trying to get parents and kids interested in forking over 500 for a visual upgrade that those specific demographics almost certainly couldnt even identify in an AB comparison,mm99sql,5.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmelaww,Creative_Impulse,,1,2025-04-10 15:41:44,,,,The reason that feels lame is because it takes dev time to make games compatible for both consoles and usually takes away options for more high end features on the new thing because you still have to run it on the old hardware in some way Idk as a consumer who will now pay way more for Switch 2 games that DOES upset me If I am paying more they better be fully utilizing the new specs of the console I paid a high price for,mm84e4w,3.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmce37e,SolidOshawott,,1,2025-04-10 05:45:17,,,,I know but thats not quite the point Its still a much more similar development process for crossgen games Similarly shaped devices with similar functionalities Besides we can be pretty confident that any new firstparty Switch 1 game going forward will receive a Switch 2 Edition Nintendos development teams wont be split between Switch 1 and 2,mmc6fkw,5.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mm8qf1z,kscountryboy85,,3,2025-04-09 17:08:46,,,,This is only valid if the price of the switch and its games continue to drop with said price reductions I almost pulled the trigger on a switch a few months ago heard about the switch 2 thought I would wait yeah no way am I going to jump into nintendos walled garden and absolutely bonkers over priced weak ass ecosystem now Cant even match a last gen X86 chip Lol Can it truly even match a steam deck Those are alread underpowered,mm82pvf,4.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mm8mmk6,Dhiox,,7,2025-04-09 16:50:28,,,,Its not a fair comparison telling gamers they still have the more affordable albeit weaker model that some games will still be coming out in is reasonable Telling people they should just stick to the old dead console because they dont have good internet is not,mm854w9,3.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmagmvt,PatternrettaP,,3,2025-04-09 22:14:56,,,,I think its context in the overall market place changes how people react to it Microsoft was announcing a new machine at a very high price point for the time while they were being undercut by Sony a full 100 cheaper and having to defend the value proposition of their console against it and some of their more unusual choices Kinect No 4k disc support etc The answer people wanted to hear was whoops we got our pricing wrong we will be matching Sony at 399 Instead they got a we know our worth and deserve the premium answer and people said ok and then PS4 outsold Xbox 21 Nintendo is in a different situation Traditionally they have gone for the value market so 450 is huge for a Nintendo console but its not the most expensive one out now so they can be a little more confident in their pricing without seeming cocky If the current steam deck undercut them by 100 it would be a different story,mm9hpd1,5.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mmgjy00,Cdwoods1,,1,2025-04-10 21:27:19,,,,I see where youre coming from but considering the switch 2 is more in the previous console generation range power wise Id say those are the prices theyd be competing with,mmagmvt,6.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mmfp8s4,ChaosLord121,,1,2025-04-10 18:55:53,,,,The difference is that with the Xbox One debacle Microsoft execs pretty much told people to suck it up if you dont like the always online requirements and restrictive nature of the console They quietly walked back on that after E3 that year Nintendos statement boils down to letting consumers know that they are still going to support the Switch 1 though I will agree that it is pretty tone deaf,mm9hpd1,5.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mmgjdb7,Cdwoods1,,1,2025-04-10 21:24:17,,,,Im sorry but to me thats just the same message but one has better PR Theres differences in the situation but both are really just dont like it Then get the old out of date console instead,mmfp8s4,6.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mm7xogp,ItsOkAbbreviate,,15,2025-04-09 14:47:37,,,,Well he did basically say if youre to poor for the new one there is still the old one in nicer wording The thing is support for how long since I dont believe nvidia is still manufacturing the silicon for that version any longer A year two years three who knows If anything they should have just said nothing they are already in enough hot water with the pricing the game pricing how they are handling the carts the empty carts with just codes on them the game upgrades to switch two quality the cheaper Asian market version etc Just know this does not affect me I was not going to get one its just a bit tone deaf right at this moment,mm7qdle,2.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mm7z6um,Oahkery,,20,2025-04-09 14:54:56,,,,How is it rage bait The headline is literally what he said in the quote that some people cant afford Switch 2 so they can still buy Switch 1 Dressing it up in PR speak by saying make available and Switch platforms doesnt change anything Maybe theyre still going to release some Switch 1 games for a period of transition like with PS4 to PS5 but after its not going to be the same ones as Switch 2 Thats why he said people can experience these characters in these worlds not experience these games We live in the era of corporate boot licking and some people are ready to slobber all over them every time,mm7qdle,2.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mm8sejv,Turmoil_Engage,,4,2025-04-09 17:18:18,,,,Theres a clear attempt to call back to the Xbox 360 controversy in the headline Also nuance and objectivity in discussions arent corporate bootlicking If we live in any era its the my feelings are more important than facts one,mm7z6um,3.0,1jv5h2y
comment,mm8thzk,mimbo757,,14,2025-04-09 17:23:24,,,,Im all for nuance but it isnt that nuanced Its PR speak for go buy the old version well toss on some games and charge the shit out of ya if you want a switch 2 Theres no hidden meaning here and folks can care or not care but no one is being all that reactionary Switch 1 was pushing its limit for games years ago,mm8sejv,4.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mm9tig8,TheOvy,,1,2025-04-09 20:16:08,,,,Yeah and this is not exactly a radical notion The PS2 is still the best selling console in history because it kept receiving support well into the PS3s life cycle And suffice to say a lot of us could not afford 599 US dollars in 2006 for the upgrade Production of the PS2 did not end till 2013 Thats not a typo twentythirteen I imagine Nintendo would be all too happy to keep producing the original Switch for as long if people are willing to still buy it And since the new game sharing feature on the Switch 2 works with the original Switch they will have new value That all said maybe Nintendo should introduce a price cut for the original switch And a physical copy of Mario Kart World should not cost 90 Thats a much bigger threat than Switch 2 launching at 450,mm7qdle,2.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mm7ragl,None,,-6,2025-04-09 14:15:34,,,,Yeah well so is the gaming community as a whole lol its still probably a reasonable enough indication of the broader population despite being a Nintendospecific sub Most console buyers are upgrading from a previous generation regardless of company Most people who bought a PS5 have had a PlayStation before Most people who bought an Xbox X owned an Xbox before It stands to acceptable reason that most Switch owners have owned another Nintendo before and therefore a fair enough assumption that people who are interested in a Switch 2 likely currently own a Switch Even if its a biased sample in this scenario its still probably accurate enough I dont think any recentgen console out there has been wildly successful enough to capture a majority market of firsttime users,mm7o8s7,3.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmf5dss,AJDx14,,0,2025-04-10 17:20:01,,,,I didnt get mad its just true that youre all spoiled The entertainment options we have today are not the same as the ones available during the Great Depression there isnt any reason at all to think theyd have comparable costs Despite that even 80 for a game is pretty cheap when you look at what they used to cost and inflation If a game is going to have 20 hours of playtime and it costs 80 then youre just paying 4 per hour of playtime For longer games the deal is even better And the cost of entertainment being low during the Great Depression was partly a consequence of the depression there was less consumer spending so theaters for example had to charge less to continue to operate at all And entertainment isnt expensive just the entertainment that you personally want is There are inexpensive entertainment options theyre just less entertaining because they arent luxury goods You are all spoiled to think that video games are the only product that needs to forever cost the exact same nominal amount regardless of how the economy shifts or how the product changes,mme78v6,4.0,1jv5h2y

comment,mmccvse,Static-Stair-58,,2,2025-04-10 05:34:06,,,,Yikes Generalizing human kind Im talking about nerds and console war fanatics People that get defensive over faceless corporations Those people 100 exist Ive seen them and talked to them and read their opinions And they show bias like in my example before about how Nintendo made a statement about customers sticking with the old console if they dont or cant get the new one When Xbox said that it was a mistake and people pointed to it as a reason the console didnt sell Nintendo making a similar statement could also cost them in the same way To think that it wont or cant shows denialbias toward one company Which is fine like I said earlier its the white knighting and getting defensive over it thats the weird part I hope the Switch 2 sells like hotcakes its still dumb to make a statement that justifies staying put with your old one And then weird to keep defending their moves like its nbd because there is evidence from previous companies where talking like that hurt their bottom line That pretty much the whole enchilada of what I was trying to say Im not sure theres much more I can do to explain it any better I appreciate the conversation Have a nice year Stay safe,mmcagpb,13.0,1jv5h2y
