comment,myyniup,bio4m,,1653,2025-06-21 09:52:28,,,,Any Mac that still has Firewire ports wont be supported by the new MacOS anyway,,0.0,1lgsge7
comment,myzbrkh,ChocoJesus,,258,2025-06-21 13:09:23,,,,Right but they do specifically mention FireWire 800 to thunderbolt adapters dont work now Doesnt seem like a big deal and it isnt going to be for most But I have a number of old enclosures that I could daisychain with FireWire 800 and since they were all hard disk drives FireWire 800 was enough No reason to switch over to a newer enclosure until now,myyniup,1.0,1lgsge7

comment,mz6ohov,UprightJoe,,3,2025-06-22 17:29:34,,,,Meh there will be third party solutions if enough need is out there I bet there are already companies deciding whether or not to make new adapters and drivers Its pretty niche though at this point I was briefly running an audio interface that was FW400FW800ThunderboltUSBC It was cool that it worked but having that many dongles strung together was a pain the butt If the cable got bumped around too much it would drop the connection and reconnect I retired the interface pretty soon after At some point things become obsolete I was running that setup about a decade ago and FireWire was already pretty much dead I havent purchased a FireWire device in at least 15 years I wouldnt expect to be able to connect a 1980s dot matrix printer via a parallel port to a modern Mac without spending some cash on hardwaresoftware from a 3rd party,mz31skj,4.0,1lgsge7

comment,mz511l0,jadedflames,,1,2025-06-22 11:55:56,,,,It could be and it has despite being obsolete for more than a decade But every new OS would require some testing and thus cost to make sure it didnt break FireWire It makes sense to eventually say sorry to the hobbyists but that its more trouble than its worth to keep making things backwards compatible,mz31skj,4.0,1lgsge7
comment,mz283u9,retainftw,,1,2025-06-21 22:46:52,,,,I had some of these from tapes I took from the late 2000s Fortunately since theyre digital the transfer was pretty quick and easy Each recording startstop ended up as a single file,myzsljo,3.0,1lgsge7

comment,mz3gq4g,blanketstatement,,5,2025-06-22 03:29:26,,,,The difference in quality was a theoretical 40 lines of resolution at most but more often than not it was about a realworld difference of 10 lines Thats not much better at all Whereas VHS could hold 2x the footage while only sacrificing 10 lines of resolution How is that not objectively better Sometimes I think people get confused when someone just says Beta because for some they default that to Betamax and others default to Betacam and the latter is inarguably better than VHS in every metric,mz2slal,5.0,1lgsge7

comment,mz3m4wt,davidjschloss,,3,2025-06-22 04:09:11,,,,I worked at Sony when the MD was released and Japan was certain it would be a big hit in the US as it was taking off in Japan The consensus around the US people I talked to was that it wasnt going to take hold in the US IIRC the big issue was not the format itself but not being able to rip music from CDs onto MD MD had the potential to be a lot more durable than CD for portability I also think you couldnt record external audio digitally again IIRC and that a lot of audio engineers had wanted that I just remember the US staff at the music and device divisions being really pessimistic,mz0wrto,3.0,1lgsge7
comment,mz6bljy,xXgreeneyesXx,,2,2025-06-22 16:25:09,,,,yeah the RIAA can probably be held atleast partly responsible for MD and DCCand probably DAT before that doing so poorly You can rip music from a CD onto a MD as a first generation copy but not as a second generation copy per SCMS I know in Japan it was common to rent a CD burn it to a MD and then return the CD which wasnt how people used MD in the US treating it closer to records and CDs than the tape it was supposed to replace Terrible as a prerecorded format wonderful recordable format,mz3m4wt,4.0,1lgsge7

comment,myzcqxa,ScotTheDuck,,68,2025-06-21 13:15:48,,,,The porn thing is a myth Betas original sin came from the fact that it could only do 90 minutes per tape at its original recording speed VHS by comparison started at 2 hours at SP speed and when it came stateside got a 4 hour LP mode that let you put an entire football game on one tape By the time distributed content was even a thing on tape VHS had pretty much already won the war,myzcb9o,3.0,1lgsge7
comment,myzpu6h,AbeLincolns_Ghost,,15,2025-06-21 14:34:35,,,,Yeah as Technology Connections talks about VHS and BetaMax were not originally focused on prerecorded moviesTV shows They were all for recording TV at home sort of like a DVR TiVo would be in the future Tapes were really expensive originally which was fine for 12 to record with but not to buy a bunch of movies Porn wasnt a major part of the market at first for the same reasons Betamax effectively already died before prerecorded content became a major part of the videotape player experience,myzcqxa,4.0,1lgsge7
