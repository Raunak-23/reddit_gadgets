comment,mrfx850,DigitalStefan,,110,2025-05-09 16:21:40,,,,tldr If you want to play at native 4k youll want to have deep pockets,,0.0,1kim95l
comment,mrg1icj,flac_rules,,41,2025-05-09 16:43:30,,,,At least on ultra but isnt ultra alway a pretty stupid setting,mrfx850,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mri1sf9,Horibori,,26,2025-05-09 23:05:01,,,,Correct Normally when optimized settings are discussed many of the ultra settings are turned down because the difference is just so fucking miniscule,mrg1icj,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mricq4r,PatSajaksDick,,4,2025-05-10 00:11:06,,,,It didnt seem to be that big of a gap between Ultra and High so might as well do Ultra if you want pretty stufff,mrg1icj,2.0,1kim95l

comment,mrj0nih,arthurdentstowels,,4,2025-05-10 02:45:31,,,,If my lights suddenly dim Ill know what happened,mrg1vnx,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrrb72a,LordOfTheStrings8,,2,2025-05-11 15:01:25,,,,Yep People often post guides on how to maximize a games fps without losing noticeable quality I will sometimes read those if my system is struggling to maintain a high frame rate Sometimes even 5 fps makes a big difference,mrg1icj,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhzk5m,Giantmidget1914,,1,2025-05-09 22:51:41,,,,I was thinking the same thing For example I played L4D2 recently with the settings maxed It actually ran the 4060 to 50,mrg1icj,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrt68b8,brondonschwab,,3,2025-05-11 21:02:20,,,,Not sure why anyone would want to game at native 4K when DLSS is as good as it is,mrfx850,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrtcpa8,DigitalStefan,,-3,2025-05-11 21:38:32,,,,There is a latency penalty for engaging DLSS,mrt68b8,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mru2pxl,TehOwn,,3,2025-05-12 00:18:38,,,,Youre thinking of frame generation,mrtcpa8,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrw1z8w,DigitalStefan,,1,2025-05-12 10:22:31,,,,I wasnt but frame gen is definitely an enemy of latency,mru2pxl,4.0,1kim95l
comment,mrtctaw,brondonschwab,,2,2025-05-11 21:39:10,,,,No there isnt Youre gonna be at a higher framerate because of DLSS AKA lower latency,mrtcpa8,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrtlv9t,DigitalStefan,,0,2025-05-11 22:32:34,,,,I dont think youre right about this Not about the frame rate but overall latency Latency isnt purely a factor of frame rate Edit I was dead wrong on this Every day is a school day,mrtctaw,4.0,1kim95l
comment,mrtm1f0,brondonschwab,,4,2025-05-11 22:33:38,,,,Sure man Its a good thing that someone tested this and proved me right Literally no downsides to using DLSS so this obsession with native is stupid,mrtlv9t,5.0,1kim95l

comment,mrgqeyf,DriftMantis,,38,2025-05-09 18:48:42,,,,I dont understand why this game is so demanding when doom eternal running with ray tracing performs about 3 times as fast and I would argue looks marginally better anyways I know game graphics are subjective but to me everything in the new doom game looks washed out blurry enemies have poor silhouettes and blend into the background there is a lack of dynamic lights flat textures at a lower resolution the environments look lubed up with overblown specularity etc I also think the real time GI doesnt look any different than prebaked lighting found in eternal and 2016 But also of course I havent played the game yet and sometimes you need to get hands on before you get a feel for things It is what it is performance wise but it looks like even top end systems will be using upscaling and frame gen to achieve any kind of high refresh experience A lot of the market still uses nonraytracing hardware so they cant play the game at all and anyone on 1st generation raytracing cards is going to have poor performance,,0.0,1kim95l
comment,mrm91om,HallowedError,,9,2025-05-10 17:20:25,,,,It doesnt help that youtube fucking destroys clarity with its compression Its weird watching a 4k gameplay video look worse than my 1440 gameplay even when the the video has it running on higher settings,mrgqeyf,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrk7r5z,fattytron,,14,2025-05-10 09:05:25,,,,maybe the large open spaces with far more objects and a shit ton more enemies Doom eternal was basically small arenas with 5 10 enemies appearing at a time,mrgqeyf,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrl8tls,DriftMantis,,5,2025-05-10 14:00:39,,,,I think you have a good point there This game wasnt meant to be like serious sam 4 However if you think doom eternal only had small arenas and 510 enemies at once definitely go play the last couple levels again Also some of the dlc levels were pretty bonkers with enemy spawns Dark ages seems to also add environmental destruction which is pretty cool,mrk7r5z,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhvk23,Cryio,,6,2025-05-09 22:27:44,,,,Not to mention AMD GPUs from GCN1 to RDNA1 can run RT under Linux If DOOM Dark Ages also demands FP16 like Indiana Jones does then it restricts GPUs to GCN3 and up for RT,mrgqeyf,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrp85jk,astro_plane,,1,2025-05-11 04:29:06,,,,Running DOOM on my RX 480 and FX 8320 at max settings and 60fps felt like black magic Im honestly surprised this game is so demanding I was expecting more performance from my 3080,mrhvk23,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrgsgle,dirtinyoureye,,8,2025-05-09 18:59:06,,,,Eventually we have to accept that old cards cant keep holding games back Raytracing cards came out in 2018 Is it crazy for devs to expect most people to be able to run base level raytracing Its the norm now and will be going forward,mrgqeyf,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrgwg1f,DriftMantis,,34,2025-05-09 19:19:39,,,,Thats not really what I was posting about exactly but I think thats a fair point about tech needing to move forward However as a counterpoint I think some of the best looking recent games on the market dont require base level raytracing to look amazing For example kingdom come deliverance 2 and clair obscura expedition 33 off the top of my head being examples,mrgsgle,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrh2ld7,pastalex42,,3,2025-05-09 19:51:35,,,,Raytracing is both cheaper and easier to develop Its the same reason so many games rely on upscaling to run well at all It stinks but its the direction most AAA games are headed for the foreseeable future,mrgwg1f,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrm9cg6,HallowedError,,1,2025-05-10 17:22:02,,,,Well unfortunately modern cards have ramped up in price so its harder for people to get them at the tier where raytracing is viable,mrgsgle,2.0,1kim95l
comment,msvb0rw,dafjkh,,1,2025-05-17 23:02:35,,,,I dont care about raytracing Its simply not worth the tax on performance I dont want washed out textures and everything looking blurry on a GPU for less than 3k,mrgsgle,2.0,1kim95l
comment,msvcteo,dirtinyoureye,,1,2025-05-17 23:13:19,,,,Agree to disagree Its the choice of the devs at this point and a lot are moving to the new tech,msvb0rw,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhvrza,Cryio,,1,2025-05-09 22:29:04,,,,Wait until you hear AMD has a GCN GPU from 2014 that theoretically can launch DOOM Dark Ages AMD R9 285 GCN3 on Linux,mrgsgle,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhkmpf,Cry_Wolff,,-17,2025-05-09 21:25:36,,,,I paid 150 for 2060 Super If thats too much for someone then how can he afford AAA games in the first place,mrgsgle,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhv66q,juh4z,,18,2025-05-09 22:25:27,,,,Yeah that 2060 super cant run anything with actual ray tracing though lol,mrhkmpf,3.0,1kim95l
comment,mrhy21x,Cry_Wolff,,-9,2025-05-09 22:42:45,,,,But it does support RT so games that require it will launch,mrhv66q,4.0,1kim95l

comment,mrifgax,hyrumwhite,,10,2025-05-10 00:28:03,,,,Pascal can technically do ray tracing Itll just do it at extremely low fps and no access to DLSS Also games may lock them out Nvidia allowed it on pascal basically to make a point,mrgnfgk,2.0,1kim95l
comment,mris6kn,ItsDreamyWeather,,4,2025-05-10 01:50:12,,,,Ill be finding out the answer to this on the 15th Still using my MSI Duke 1070Ti and should be receiving a copy of the game for free,mrgkh73,1.0,1kim95l
comment,mrj2j84,vikingdiplomat,,5,2025-05-10 02:58:24,,,,mostly a joke question but the oblivion remaster is the first game ive had much trouble with on anything above low graphics settings ill probably upgrade soon but lot of shit plays well still so im not in a big rush D,mris6kn,2.0,1kim95l

comment,mrhts6f,thunderc8,,5,2025-05-09 22:17:17,,,,Just upgraded to an OLED 1440p from a 1440p ips after a debate to go 4k or not I decided that 4k is not yet sustainable even with my 4080s I would have to lower graphics and enable dlss fg etc to be able to play Good thing my eyes are not that good to distinguish 1440p vs 4k at 27,,0.0,1kim95l

comment,mrg6e6y,MultiMarcus,,-3,2025-05-09 17:08:08,,,,1440p 90fps or 120 fps with quality mode upscaling on the 9070xt seems quite reasonable 4K is as usual heavy as fuck but I think this performance is quite reasonable Not to mention how all of this is on Ultra though without the path tracing stuff It isnt the insane performance of something like Eternal or 2016 but seems quite similar to the other well optimised games of the last couple of years Avatar Frontiers of Pandora for example also performs quite well even with ray tracing being basically required,,0.0,1kim95l
