comment,m9ee13p,lost_signal,,2,2025-01-27 04:17:19,,,,One of a few things Rumor is Apple Watch Ultra 3 which is launching next year could tout Emergency SOS via satellite as well as rumored messaging via the Globalstar sat network 1 Apple does make a eSIM compatible model and for few bucks you can have it connect to towers without your phone This is useful when your phone is dead or you just cant reach it people who go running use this It generally costs somewhere between 615 to get this service active 2 If youve fallen abd broken your leg in snow you might not be able to reach our phone The watch can relay through it 3 The apple watch has fall detection That can be configured to call 911 or emergency contacts My parents watches will auto SMS my sister and I for instance After my mom fell in the shower and had to drag herself for 45 minutes with a broken leg to get to where my dad could hear her we moved to this Wearables are fun I watched my wife diagnose someone as septic based off of their Garmin watch data they sent her once They were puking and had had fever and the heart rate data gave her the confidence to make the call to have them meet her at the ER and get her on antibiotics,m9dnnm9,1.0,1i9y49m
