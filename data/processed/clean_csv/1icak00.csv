comment,m9qpbs6,imaginepostinglmao,,8,2025-01-29 00:58:12,,,,When I was younger I had one that would have the red ring of death fairly often Im not talking about any of the other alert Im talking about the flashing 3 quarters of a ring red ring of death It was because the socket I had it plugged up into was for some reason connected to the laundry room light switch so if someone rapidly turned on and off that switch it would do that My guess what it means normally is that when you try and turn it on it sends a bunch of power on signals that it cant execute properly,m9p3yi0,2.0,1icak00

comment,m9p885f,drmirage809,,44,2025-01-28 20:36:40,,,,It depended on which one There were multiple error codes that the 360 would communicate through flashing red lights on the power buttons Some of them just meant that the hard drive wasnt connected and quickly reconnecting it fixed things PS3 has a similar issue in the form of the yellow light of death or YLOD,m9p3yi0,2.0,1icak00

comment,m9ri7yn,LordCreamer69,,5,2025-01-29 03:37:28,,,,The Red Ring of Death was caused by a failure of the adhesive they used in certain areas Over repeated stress of the heat expansion and compression the adhesive would expand and contrast at a different rate the the solder The problem with this is that every xbox needed to be repeatedly stress tested before going out on sale Every Single One This was a problem that affected virtually every single xbox just to less severe degrees No amount of fixes would actually fix it It was over the day it was shipped out It was just a matter of time until it hit a red ring,m9qxzll,3.0,1icak00

comment,m9q8kxx,Hithaeglir,,13,2025-01-28 23:30:30,,,,Back in time when Samsung Galaxy S2 was a new thing I bricked it with some custom ROMs At least I thought so The device was completely black and no action never did anything Then I found some magic software from some Chinese site Apparently it was recovery tool created by the manufacturer itself Well I installed the software and just ran it while phone was USB plugged Few seconds later and the phone booted and it started to install some Chinese version of Android starting from bootloader Scary to think these days that what else I got from that software Or what was possible to do with phones back then when the security might not have been that much priority,m9pnfz0,3.0,1icak00

comment,ma7qq3v,masterspeler,,1,2025-01-31 16:09:26,,,,I dont mean things dont get bricked anymore Im referring to people using the term bricked incorrectly If something is bricked its bricked its now a brick theres no going back its useless But some people say their computer is bricked if they need to reinstall Windows which is obviously wrong since you cant install Windows on a brick,m9pnfz0,3.0,1icak00

comment,m9pn7y6,shotsallover,,45,2025-01-28 21:45:29,,,,The BSOD got the name because it usually signaled a hardware problem frequently just before it died And it took all your open unsaved work with when it happened It didnt become just a kernel panic until the Windows 2000 era Then there was the Click of death which was the sound an Iomega Zip drive made when it was eating all of your data Which meant both the drive itself was dead and so was the media you put in it Then there was the IBM Deathstar drives that would randomly shell out and lose everything on the drive with no warning So the of death has a little bit of history that earned its connection to bricking,m9p2ndn,1.0,1icak00

comment,m9pq3qo,figmentPez,,8,2025-01-28 21:58:48,,,,The Iomega Zip Drive click of death happened back in the late 90s and often meant a disk or drive was no longer usable,m9p53qg,2.0,1icak00

comment,m9teece,audigex,,3,2025-01-29 13:12:47,,,,Bricked doesnt mean that its completely burned out and never has Ive no idea where you got that idea from It means its as useful as a brick The RROD is definitely a bricked device because its broken useless as a console The presence of an error light telling you its broken doesnt change that,m9qn46w,3.0,1icak00
comment,m9tfehy,double-you,,1,2025-01-29 13:19:04,,,,That seems to be your opinion Way back when bricking was not just broken but turned completely inert and unfixable by some change,m9teece,4.0,1icak00
comment,m9tivhc,audigex,,0,2025-01-29 13:40:14,,,,Its literally the dictionary definition cause a smartphone or other electronic device to become completely unable to function typically on a permanent basis And to render an electronic device such as a smartphone nonfunctional as by accidental damage malicious hacking or software changes Unable to function not completely dead in every way If it cant fulfil its job its bricked even if fansLEDs etc still power on It also matches up with usage for decades Not one example on Wikipedia refers to a device which is completely inert If something is completely nonresponsive we tend to call it dead not bricked Also acting like Im using some new definition is nonsense In the 1990s it was being used to discuss PCs breaking after BIOS updates theyd still show LEDs and youd still get POST beeps Frankly it sounds like youre just doubling down by trying to act like youre talking about some earlier period than Im aware of Obviously its hard to definitively prove anything from the 1990s since most forums and usenet groups are gone now but heres an example from nearly 20 years ago showing people talking about bricked hardware with flashing LEDs etc Another from 2009,m9tfehy,5.0,1icak00
comment,m9tle71,double-you,,0,2025-01-29 13:54:59,,,,People have just been using the term in several ways Ive never seen this oh it broke so now its bricked thing until recently No it was always after a software update or some such just made the device not function at all Not being physically broken but the software change messed things up,m9tivhc,6.0,1icak00
comment,m9tmg33,audigex,,2,2025-01-29 14:01:03,,,,Its often been from firmware updates but definitely not exclusively we were definitely using it back in the early 2000s in both ways and it was 100 used for the Xbox 360 RROD issue Honestly it just sounds like youve missed a common form of usage,m9tle71,7.0,1icak00
comment,m9tnk8j,double-you,,0,2025-01-29 14:07:26,,,,I guess I especially liked the word because there hadnt been a word for breaking things with software But if it is just synonymous to broken meh We need a word for breaking things with software,m9tmg33,8.0,1icak00

comment,m9te5v2,audigex,,1,2025-01-29 13:11:17,,,,The first usage of the of death thing I can find comes from the Black Screen of Death a precursor to the Blue Screen of Death error mentioned in InfoWorld magazine in 1993 followed by the Click of Death on the Iomega zip drive first mentioned in 1998 on CNet although its likely that either or both of these were used by the community before they first appeared in news articles The most widespread one was the Blue Screen of Death followed by the Red Ring of Doom usually Doom at the time not Death for some reason its been retrospectively changed to Death probably because of the Blue Screen of Death being so pervasive in the public consciousness But yeah the RROD seems to be the first time it was used for a properly bricked device arguably maybe the Iomega drives because that could mean the drive was fucked although not always,m9p2ndn,1.0,1icak00

comment,magwl5n,SuperSpartan300,,1,2025-02-02 00:31:01,,,,My 5 month old Garmin Venu 3 got an update last month after the update the screen just went off after an hour even though I can hear chimes when I was pressing buttons I tried charging it to full restarting the watch nothing helped I took it to the Garmin service center and they gave it back to me after a week saying they just did a software reset Well I got it it only worked for a day then the screen went off again so this time they replaced the entire watch with a brand new one Ever since I just kept the replacement watch and posted it for sale this left a sour taste in my mouth I bought a Google Pixel Watch 3 which is awesome I dod miss the long battery life of the Garmin Venu 3 though,,0.0,1icak00

comment,m9sw213,TeenJesusWasaCunt,,1,2025-01-29 10:47:19,,,,I will never know what actually happened to it because I didnt take that deal The watch just wouldnt take a charge anymore and I tried everything the website said to do like clean the ports and try multiple chargers Mine was a Fenix 5x that I had bought brand new from Amazon and I was offered the 7 solar or something like that for like 729 after discount I declined,m9rq1n0,2.0,1icak00

comment,m9shevy,Smooth-Accountant,,2,2025-01-29 08:15:19,,,,My forerunner 955 can gets over a week with 10h of exercise a week 3h with gps and music on Without heavy GPS use I could probably get 23 weeks out of it Nothing gets close to Garmin when it comes to sport watches,m9p6v9d,2.0,1icak00
comment,m9pkvyj,FixSwords,,2,2025-01-28 21:34:46,,,,Gets nowhere near that in real world use cases If you use always on display and why would you not Its properly annoying having to tilt your wrist just to glance at your watch you get more like 56 days Now the MIP displays give proper battery life Fenix 8 MIP or the 7X Pro gets about 30 days with some GPS usage and everything,m9p6v9d,2.0,1icak00

comment,m9pat8w,wopper,,-5,2025-01-28 20:48:30,,,,Good Fuck Garmin From hosing customers into buying proprietary cables to forcing customers to repay for updates to their maps on their OG GPS devices to the more modern bullshit if them paying off the hackers that pulled a ransomware job on their servers and then deleting their users content anyway for security Ironically Garmin lost their way a long time ago,,0.0,1icak00

comment,m9qt54a,Osiris_Raphious,,-5,2025-01-29 01:18:31,,,,Finally maybe all the higher income people distracted can finally understand the evil that is planned obsolescence and digital version of it This affects our right to repair it affects our use of the device because it can bug out if not connected to their servers Like google is doing this i didnt update for 2 months and my phone starts to act up badly Why if it was stable then one day just refuses to charge to turn on burns hot Like I had this issue with samsung phones when they no longer wanted to support my device i get a final update and it just ruins the battary and tries to cook itself Like we all know these tech giants do this to push us to buy new devices but its so evil Clearly if your device can be bricked by a simple little software that needs you to restart or reconnect to their servers then you dont really own the full rights to your own device Which is essentially the evil of technofuedalism,,0.0,1icak00
comment,m9shjoc,Smooth-Accountant,,7,2025-01-29 08:16:40,,,,What are you on about lol its a corrupted file that puts the device in a boot loop It has nothing to do with planned obsolescence or whatever And that last paragraph is straight up dumb you can brick any device it doesnt mean that the device is or isnt yours,m9qt54a,1.0,1icak00
