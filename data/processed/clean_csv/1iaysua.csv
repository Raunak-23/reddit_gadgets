post,1iaysua,a_Ninja_b0y,The Steam Deck is about to get a standard charging feature that it's sorely been missing - A charging limit (80 percent),1124,2025-01-27 03:39:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1iaysua/the_steam_deck_is_about_to_get_a_standard/,74.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,m9ebc94,Razzeus,,499,2025-01-27 04:00:02,,,,I was under the impression that modern devices are equipped with battery management systems that mitigate this significantly better than years ago when this was a much more meaningful practice Is this still necessary in 2025 or is it just a case of old habits die hard A quick search is giving me a mixed bag,,0.0,1iaysua
comment,m9ebydd,orangpelupa,,213,2025-01-27 04:03:54,,,,Still necrsarry Charging limit is part of battery management system The lower the max voltage the longer lasting the battery life will be Not to be confused with battery runtime Most devices doesnt allow customized charging limit This post is about steam deck getting the customization,m9ebc94,1.0,1iaysua

comment,m9f8g5n,PhabioRants,,11,2025-01-27 08:40:09,,,,There are a couple Decky plugins that do this They allow you to set autosuspend thresholds By default its 20 or 25 I believe Super valuable both for battery preservation and state preservation if youre traveling since the suspend state can hold battery for a respectable amount of time,m9eule0,4.0,1iaysua
comment,m9j402g,MachinaThatGoesBing,,6,2025-01-27 22:05:47,,,,A battery runs at basically a steady voltage usually referred to as the nominal voltage It technically varies a little over the discharge cycle but batteries are designed to spend the maximum amount of time in a big relatively flat area of their voltage vs charge curve And that same voltage is required to charge it by forcing electron flow to go in the opposite direction and reversing the chemical reaction that releases energy when you use the battery For a big scale example our car has an 800V battery pack If we were to plug into a 400V fast charger somewhere while on a road trip the car has to somehow convert that 400V DC into 800V DC in order charge the battery EDIT And it has a very clever way of doing that using the inverters for the rear wheel motors The charging limit in discussion here isnt about charging speed though limiting charging speed also helps prolong battery life its about charge percentage how much the reaction has proceeded in one way or the other Lithium batteries tend to be happiest to be around 50 charge according to most of what Ive read But thats not very practical for a device you want to use So a lot of folks charge up to 80 and stop there Its full enough to get you through most daily usage but still saves wear on the battery by not charging that last 20 Using our car as an example again we dont charge it to 100 when were just using it for commuting errands and local travel Just up to 80 And we try to keep from going below 20 Not a hard rule of course and road trips see us charging higher and going lower sometimes With something like the Steam Deck if youre using it docked or plugged in a lot itll really save on the battery to not charge above 80 And you can always remove the limit before travel or expected heavy use days,m9ebydd,2.0,1iaysua
comment,mbeprhs,audigex,,1,2025-02-07 02:16:57,,,,Lithium batteries tend to be happiest to be around 50 charge according to most of what Ive read But thats not very practical for a device you want to use Yeah this is correct although within about 3070 20 either side of 50 theres negligible impact to the point its not even worth considering So in an ideal world wed keep all our usage in that range but obviously that means we can only use 40 of the capacity which is quite wasteful Between that and 2080 30 from 50 theres a little impact but its pretty small Its not zero or negligible but its still low enough that its not really worth worrying about and gets us up to 60 of the capacity being useable which is a good compromise for daytoday usage for most devices This is where the 80 charge limit try to put it on charge when you get to 20 bestpractice comes from Once you get up to 1090 though 40 from 50 then theres quite a noticeable impact on longevitydegradation Theres still a noticeable benefit vs using the full 0100 charge capacity but its really starting to ramp up And then 0100 gives you the worst possible degradation which can be somewhat mitigated with charging strategies charging slower managing voltage and heat minimising charge speed at the extremes of range etc etc but still isnt ideal The result of considering all of the above is that 2080 is generally the best of both range you still get a good amount of the maximum possible run time but its pretty gentle on the battery Pushing to 1585 or 1090 work too but you start getting a more noticeable impact Limiting it to 2575 or 3070 has benefits but not really enough to be worth limiting your run time for,m9j402g,3.0,1iaysua
comment,mbfz8kj,MachinaThatGoesBing,,1,2025-02-07 07:33:17,,,,Yep We did a load of research on this before and after buying our car Unless were planning a big trip or traveling we leave the AC charge limit at 80 except for the once a month it recommends the 100 charge to do wear leveling calculations and testing on the cells When were trip planning we set A Better Route Planner to a minimum of 15 but it has some wiggle room on what makes the most efficient route Though were rarely below 20 at a stop,mbeprhs,4.0,1iaysua

comment,mbeqkfx,audigex,,1,2025-02-07 02:21:28,,,,But In practice no one knows Theywe absolutely do this has been researched pretty thoroughly and the science is fairly well known and no one cares because Im not here to baby sit a battery worst case Ill buy a new one years later This is true for many people but not everyone Personally I prefer to keep my devices until it isnt capable of doing the job rather than because the battery has died And since the battery is often the most vulnerable part it makes sense to me to protect it Eg I still have a 2009 MacBook on the desk behind me a 201415 iPad etc They both still do the jobs I need of them and because Ive taken care of the batteries theyre both still providing me with useable runtimes If thats not for you no problem you can leave the charge to 80 option off and charge to 100 every time nobodys going to be upset with you for using your device how you want to But for those of us who do care its nice to have this option because it means I dont have to carefully nurse the battery and eg remove it from charge myself I can just change the setting and leave it,m9f3ej4,2.0,1iaysua
comment,m9lhdua,doughaway7562,,5,2025-01-28 06:24:00,,,,Engineer here The short answer is just use your device as you want and dont babysit it The long answer is that this feature only really makes sense if you mostly use your Steam Deck in your home where it spends a lot of time plugged in The whole point is to keep your battery between 20 to 80 charged to extend its life in the long run I personally only use this feature on my laptop which is plugged in the vast majority of the time On the instances I run it off battery Ill have finished using it long before before Ive hit 20 And so I use it because it has no noticeable impact to my day to day use of my device at all I do not use this feature on my phone I paid for the whole battery and Ill use it Official replacement batteries for devices cost 30100 so at worse youre paying that much every 23 years Life is too short to worry about that sort of thing,m9ebc94,1.0,1iaysua
comment,mbergge,audigex,,1,2025-02-07 02:26:27,,,,I do use the feature on my phone too because an iPhone 15Plus has about twice as much runtime as I need most days and for me the battery cant last a day has been the reason for upgrading my last couple of phones already too old to be economical replacing the battery on them I leave it set to charge to 80 and right now at 2am when Im about to put it on charge for the evening its just hit 40 admittedly thats a lightduty day even for me Most days it hits the 2030 range So for me that isnt babysitting my battery specifically because this feature is built into my phone and takes basically zero effort I can set it once and not worry about it and just set it to 100 when Im going on a flight the next day etc which already comes naturally to me because I do the same with the 100 charge limit on my car After a year my phones battery is at 100 health so its working out well for zero real effort from me I appreciate its not for everyone but for many of us theres not much to lose from doing this because we dont need the whole battery most days anyway I sure as shit wont judge someone for not bothering with these settings but its nice to have for those of us who do appreciate it,m9lhdua,2.0,1iaysua

comment,m9k0121,RoadkillVenison,,2,2025-01-28 00:51:27,,,,They are but lithium ion batteries age just from being stored They age faster if theyre kept at 100 with high heat Above 86f30c The best BMS in the world cant circumvent battery chemistry Any gaming device is going to be relatively warm in use and if its being maintained at full charge the batteries wont last more than a year or two,m9ebc94,1.0,1iaysua
comment,mbeoabm,audigex,,2,2025-02-07 02:08:36,,,,Its kinda both Modern devices do manage the battery better than in the days of yore but they have to strike a balance between battery longevity yearscycles vs battery life hours per charge Therefore while they do reserve some space at the top and particularly the bottom of their charge range they also still provide most of that charge range to the user Which is to say you can probably actually charge from something like 510 up to 98 of the batterys actual charge range reserving more at the bottom because discharging to true0 is much worse for the batterys long term health than charging to true100 depending on the use case and specific chemistry of the battery Thats fine it gives an acceptable compromise you reduce the risk of the battery becoming damaged by entirely discharging and get noticeably better longevity in exchange for 510 reduction in battery life It removes most of the bigger risks and causes of the worst degradation without wasting a ton of battery life But theres still an optimal range within that from about 20 to 80 of the batterys charge range whereby you get even better battery longevity at the cost of losing 40 of your battery In an ideal world this makes your battery last longer but you have to compromise quite a lot in exchange Your battery might last for 1200 cycles instead of 500 but you lose 1 hour from your 2h30 gaming time Thats too much of a compromise for most users who would rather have that battery available to them What many manufacturers are starting to do is offer the user the ability to optionally charge to either 80 or 100 minus the bit thats always reserved This allows the user to choose between Im near power today or not planning to use my full battery anyway and prefer to preserve battery healthlongevity or Im on a plane and want maximum runtime Im happy to take the tiny hit on battery health today depending on their use case A car is a great example of this I drive an EV with a range of about 300 miles but 99 of the time its doing maybe 1050 miles in a day So 99 of the time Im perfectly happy limiting my charge to 80 and putting the car on charge before it gets to 20 Sure that gives me an effective range of about 180 miles 220240 if I need to go below 20 unexpectedly instead of 300 but if Im only going 30 miles who cares But I dont want my car to limit me to 240 miles ALL the time because on the days that I am doing a long journey Id much prefer to do a oneoff charge to 100 and have 300 miles available that day The same applies to phones consoles and pretty much anything else the user probably wants the option to use the full battery when they need it but most users will prefer to protect their battery health a lot of the time too when they dont need the maximum runtime,m9ebc94,1.0,1iaysua

comment,m9eqmcd,None,,57,2025-01-27 05:50:08,,,,Ive also never had a device that _regularly_ loses 5 percent of its battery per day I leave my steamdeck go for a week and when i power it on the battery has lost 40 of its charge I feel like its the only device I own thats I need to constantly be managing the battery Meanwhile I have a ds lite I just powered on for the first time in a decade just yesterday and its still at 50 and played for an hour or so before dying,m9eb7su,1.0,1iaysua
comment,m9f8pvz,internetlad,,31,2025-01-27 08:43:02,,,,The DS lite doesnt operate in low power mode when you turn it off If you want to store your Deck for more than a month theres a mode to actually turn it off off in the BIOS which sounds insane but it is in there I think its called Battery Mode or the like You have to do it when reinstalling the OS and it got my touchscreen running after it stopped,m9eqmcd,2.0,1iaysua

comment,m9gb0qn,Avarus_Lux,,10,2025-01-27 14:03:06,,,,Most modern pcs at least have a physical switch on the psu to completely kill it Also while turned off normally there is indeed a little bit of power running through the mainboard of a pc still miniscule though as far as i know thats only a dedicated circuit to the button to turn it back on nothing else hopefullyusually i expect that to also be normal on say a phone or the deck too but that function shouldnt lose you so much battery as that indicates theres much more going on even in shutdown mode Cant exactly install a physical switch on the deck in the battery leads to prevent that sadly,m9g9g5t,5.0,1iaysua
comment,m9gcprb,internetlad,,4,2025-01-27 14:13:00,,,,Literally no modern laptop other than the Framework actually has a physical power switch and Im not even sure about the Framework Still on most desktops though because its built into the PSU as an ANSI standard,m9gb0qn,6.0,1iaysua
comment,m9gzzss,Avarus_Lux,,2,2025-01-27 16:12:12,,,,I dont expect a physical switch on a laptop pulling the battery perhaps though even that is a hassle on a lot of modern laptops and other portanle devices A tiny off switch would be nice though dumbasses will likely ruin those quick Both for tech support and physically literally haha Imho also i cant exactly call a laptop a pc not like a desktop machine at least Like i said i expect the only power that is actively going on a properly shutdown laptop steamdeck tablets phone or a desktop amongst other devices to be the tiniest amount necessary to only use the power button which engages everything else Maybe a whopping two whole buttons like a steamdeck to alternative power on in a biosboot menu mode Nothing else no other lingering data no processes nor connectivity whatsoever So if a battery drains fast while properly shutdown that doesnt sound right to me Ps Physical switches are just a neat extra stepoption to ensure that one can physically disconnects a powersource to enforce a true off off,m9gcprb,7.0,1iaysua
comment,m9etnzr,submerging,,16,2025-01-27 06:16:08,,,,Thats pretty good for a device made in the past few years Most laptops are a lot worse than this In fact 5 battery drain per day would be considered good thats relatively close to the amount a typical Apple Silicon Mac would drain in a day Phones are worse than this Find me a phone that drains less than 5 per day without airplane mode being turned on Other PC handhelds are worse than this too lol 5 per day translates to 20 days or close to 3 weeks,m9eqmcd,2.0,1iaysua

comment,m9g0d9z,BenadrylChunderHatch,,2,2025-01-27 12:56:14,,,,Yes but this is a different battery preserving feature which serves a different purpose one doesnt invalidate the other and its better to have both The issue is that keeping LiIon batteries at or close to 100 shortens their lifespan With the deck it charges to 100 and then switches to pass through With this feature it will charge to 80 and then switch to pass through so that you only charge to 100 when you actually need it This feature is very common in modern laptops and phones,m9eq8ll,3.0,1iaysua
