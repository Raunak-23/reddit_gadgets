comment,m9gglfe,Vitss,,395,2025-01-27 14:34:45,,,,Shame its so large the main reason I liked the older SE was its smaller footprint,,0.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9gr2c8,Vee8cheS,,178,2025-01-27 15:29:10,,,,Yeah this is a bummer Was hoping something akin to the Mini Alas I think well never see that form factor again and Ill just have to clutch onto my iPhone 13 Mini until it no longer receives updates,m9gglfe,1.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9gwkm9,Nosib23,,86,2025-01-27 15:55:46,,,,Because no one buys them The people who love them are very vocal about it but the sales figures indicate there just isnt a big enough market,m9gv7rx,3.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9h2rcy,thisischemistry,,70,2025-01-27 16:25:11,,,,The SE and the mini competed for similar markets a small formfactor phone The SE had an advantage in that it was the last Apple phone to have TouchID and it was lowcost so they sold a ton of them IMO they should have just combined the SE and the mini so they didnt take sales from each other A SE the size of the mini with a fullphone display would have been a sweet spot for a phone,m9gwkm9,4.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9hf38r,coalForXmas,,21,2025-01-27 17:22:31,,,,Thats exactly what happened to me I wasnt aware of the upcoming mini at the time and purchased the SE so there was no point in getting the mini,m9h2rcy,5.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9ibt3n,rogue_giant,,17,2025-01-27 19:53:52,,,,Im still rocking the SE because of the home button I really couldnt care about the larger screen on the newer phones so Im hanging on to this bad boy until it physically wont work anymore Ive also got an 8 that needs a new digitizer so Ive got that as a backup,m9h2rcy,5.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9jlsyb,ManlySyrup,,-2,2025-01-27 23:35:14,,,,I seriously do not understand why some people just dont want a fullscreen phone only cause its got no home button Like have you even tried a new iPhone It is literally the same experience only you swipe up now Thats literally it Youre missing out on new phones cause for no good reason It really blows my mind Its like saying you dont want a new car cause the windows roll down with the push of a button instead of having a handle to roll down manually I seriously dont get it lol,m9ibt3n,6.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9kqih2,rogue_giant,,7,2025-01-28 03:15:14,,,,I do actually have a newer iPhone for my work phone and I still prefer the SE over it I also do not like the increasingly larger sizes that the newer phones come out as Its all a personal preference,m9jlsyb,7.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9ki5wd,T-Rex_timeout,,5,2025-01-28 02:28:50,,,,I loved my SE I let my husband talk me into getting a 16 since it was covered by a stipend and regret it I preferred the home button The full screen is very problematic as my hand keeps touching the edge and switching mid video The camera button is where I grab my phone out of my scrub pockets and u keep activating the camera every time I tough my phone Plus the keyboard is just a hair bigger so I keep mistyping things,m9jlsyb,7.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9jvz51,dandroid126,,7,2025-01-28 00:29:52,,,,Im not an iPhone user but Android has the option where you can either swipe up or have a soft home button on the bottom of your screen Personally I dont like the swipe because a swipe is always slower than a tap Plus in my experience gestures dont always work on the first attempt maybe Im just bad at them I greatly prefer a tap over a swipe But thats just me To each their own,m9jlsyb,7.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9jzmdk,thisischemistry,,1,2025-01-28 00:49:17,,,,have a soft home button on the bottom of your screen Yep thats available on iOS too,m9jvz51,8.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9o9b6c,RobotPreacher,,1,2025-01-28 17:57:15,,,,Swipe gestures are a lot more prone to misinterpretation than physical buttons Ive been a diehard home button lover but just switched to a newer iPhone There are way more accidental gesture errors then when I had the home button That being said its not that bad and I do think the difference is negligible,m9jlsyb,7.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9ik0oh,Spazzdude,,4,2025-01-27 20:32:36,,,,Small Android phones also have weak sales Asus went to smaller phones for the Zenfone 810 and they had weaker sales than the generations before that had a larger screen The base model of Galaxy devices is less popular than the ultra devices Though I would not call the 62 screen size of the base Galaxy small the data shows that people want the larger screen increased power larger battery or a combination of the three I do think that it would benefit companies to at least make a flagship compact phone every 23 years There is not enough demand for a yearly entry but there are clearly people who want flagship specs in a smaller phone,m9h2rcy,5.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9jbhh9,thisischemistry,,2,2025-01-27 22:42:00,,,,Im sure that the smaller devices might not sell as well as some of the larger ones but they still might be profitable The key is to not split that market into multiple models which cannibalize each others sales Both the mini and the SE were on that low end they were both small formfactor devices and they cost less than the rest of the lineup They are bringing back the SE in some form but are abandoning the smaller size I wonder if the formfactor could be viable if they only had a single product at that size And I agree it might turn out that they need to go with a longer lifecycle on those devices in order to make the economics work,m9ik0oh,6.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9m00o7,Zerfallen,,1,2025-01-28 09:31:38,,,,Zenfone 810 were the same size as regular iPhonePro and S234 Thats not a smallphone market they were engaging with just the lower size end of the regular market Maybe they would have had more success going smaller thats why i didnt buy it the S24 was still the smaller device overall and way better software support and hardware quality,m9ik0oh,6.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9mrcho,Spazzdude,,1,2025-01-28 13:25:36,,,,They were not the same size The Zenfone 10 has a 59 screens The Galaxy and iPhone have 61 screens Though they were roughly the same height the Zenfone was also not as wide by about 3mm making it feel much more compact in the hand The Zenfone also had flagship specs and ran as close to stock Android I have ever seen a phone get that wasnt a pixel phone Battery was larger than the other 2 as well The s24 has a better processor than the zen10 because the 10 is competing with the S23 And those have the same chip The only thing the s23 had in the zen10 was the support as Asus only guaranteed 2 years of updates Yes thats super important But the hardware was neck and neck with the S23,m9m00o7,7.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9ik3a8,David-Ox,,5,2025-01-27 20:32:57,,,,The timing was bad too and the 12 mini had some problems even tho the 13 fixed them they still killed their sales because of it,m9gwkm9,4.0,1ib9shs

comment,mb3rlfj,FlyingThunderGodLv1,,1,2025-02-05 13:48:43,,,,I never bought the mini because they didnt make a pro version and I had already bought a new pro iPhone the year before it came out Had they made a pro it would have done better,m9gwkm9,4.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9gwmf8,Vee8cheS,,11,2025-01-27 15:56:00,,,,As much as we love our Minis its a very niche market and considering most of media today is consumed through our smartphones rather than our computerstvs People tend to gravitate towards bigger screen estate to enjoy their content which is inclusive of social media Tik Tok Instagram YouTube etc Furthermore Apple attempted two years of Mini and both did not meet their monetary expectations and sales were not as high as their other devices Only way I can possibly see the Mini making a return is having one iPhone as the standard which they wont do and then the Pro models I held out hope for the SE considering they can lose some profit there but as we can see that is not the case and they have doubled down on bigger devices I do hope they prove me wrong someday,m9gv7rx,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9hkbfo,Vee8cheS,,1,2025-01-27 17:46:41,,,,And this is what hindered the 12M and was sort of rectified in the 13M Trust me I get it because I had a 14PM and the battery life was phenomenal Just couldnt get used to the size of the thing and being able to easily use the 13M with one hand is more convenient Battery life isnt the greatest however I make sure to keep my MagSafe battery pack on hand in the event I need it Oddly enough the battery charged extremely quickly with the MagSafe charger were talking 10 to 45 in about 20 mins or so I do miss the Dynamic Island frosted glass back and ProMotion display though,m9hj5fy,5.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9l3utg,stempoweredu,,2,2025-01-28 04:39:11,,,,To give a little data to the people dont want them comment others are making I manage cell phones for a large company We have about 1000 phones in deployment 900 iPhones 100 Android Out of our deployment fleet the maximum amount of iPhone Minis we purchased represented only 35 of our fleet The data on them was pretty solid as well theyre too powerful for their small size and battery They were rife with battery issues and often experienced premature death The minis had the shortest lifetime out of all of our iPhone models The SE however were reasonably popular but that was more due to pricing free with contract than size Users often lamented the size only a minority sought it Its a shame because I prefer the smaller size myself I would love a consistent 495 inch cell phone,m9gv7rx,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9ks7xx,Vee8cheS,,3,2025-01-28 03:25:07,,,,The iPhone 10 Ex as many called it is one of my favorite phones next to the iPhone 4 I just remember just unboxing it and using Face ID for the first time in the dark and being absolutely amazed considering all phones at that time couldnt capture face recognition well Same for the iPhone 4 when I first saw that you could do a video call albeit anywhere theres WiFi on a phone I couldnt stop smiling Anyway iPhone 1010s are spectacular devices,m9kllv4,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9l4e7x,calcium,,1,2025-01-28 04:42:53,,,,Everyone keeps saying this but the iPhone 16 was one of the smallest phones released in 2024 Open GSM Arena and sort by all phones released in 2024 and youll find there are something like 30 smartphones that have screen sizes of 6 and smaller So by this metric Apple is already making one of the smallest phones on the market but how many are they selling and is it because theyre smaller than their competitors,m9gglfe,1.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9l0h66,ryrobs10,,0,2025-01-28 04:16:20,,,,The current SE is nearly the same size as the regular pro irrc I went from a 6 to X to and they were all nearly the same overall size,m9gglfe,1.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9j0erd,mainguy,,-4,2025-01-27 21:49:01,,,,yeah but more people probably want a big budget apple phone than a small one Its why the mini didnt sell well I had a mini for a bit The weight was cool but the compromise versus my old 11 pro max was insane The screen was terrible for content and the speakers way weaker Most people rely on phones for content consumpion 14h per day so small phones will remain niche and likely a poor investment for apple,m9iyfwm,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9hlys7,thisischemistry,,4,2025-01-27 17:54:10,,,,And folding isnt the answer either A folding phone doubles the thickness but also doubles the amount of casing for the insides as well as the hardware to do the folding plus more screen Take the iPhone mini form factor make it thicker so theres more battery and no camera bump done,m9hl0tx,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9hihts,KotaIsBored,,3,2025-01-27 17:38:18,,,,I had a 6s until only a month ago When I first bought it I got a mophie case with it Used it for years until the battery in the case stopped working I didnt bother getting a new case and still had the phone for a few more years Now I have a 15 and have no desire to get a case for it Phones are already too big nowadays and a case just makes them bigger Pressing the actual buttons on the side of the phone feels a lot better than pressing them through whatever material the case is made out of Its a lot easier to clean your phone without a case and Ive honestly found it much more convenient to just learn to not drop my phone instead of spending even more money on an already too expensive product and hoping that it holds up Ive seen plenty of people drop their phone from just a few feet and their phone stop working despite being in a case It just isnt worth it me,m9h86yq,4.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9hg5mc,zzazzzz,,0,2025-01-27 17:27:28,,,,there already is multiple phones without any camera bump and you not getting ppl not wanting to use a case is not really relevant tbh the same way that i have never had a phone break or even shatter a screen in my life isnt relevant because both are just anectotes and what ppl want is for phone manufacturers to innovate on the camera bump and flatten it not make phones fatter many ppl dont care the slightest about their phone camera and would gladly take a slightly worse camera in exchange for a flat back thinner phone,m9h86yq,4.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9gfp3w,MattBrey,,14,2025-01-27 14:29:44,,,,Apple has the added problem of wanting to keep the face id camera desperately instead of using a fingerprint sensor So while normal camera hardware is progressing towards better under display cameras the specific tech they use is much much harder to get right,m9gecur,2.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9h7xlf,IMPolo,,-1,2025-01-27 16:49:09,,,,Pixel has the best of both worlds with an ultrasonic fingerprint reader and they made their face unlock secure enough to be used with banking apps and anything else that you can use touch for without a bar across the screen The only feature missing compared to TouchID is the infrared sensors that allow you to measure your face but I dont think 98 of people are going to be doing that,m9gfp3w,3.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9ghdr2,slavchungus,,-6,2025-01-27 14:39:08,,,,honestly i dont miss touchid and even the underscreen ones on my old Android didnt work so well granted they werent ultrasonic i just feel like display tech is moving so fast but apple hasnt upgraded from face id since the x simply making the notch smaller,m9gfp3w,3.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9gj4e4,MattBrey,,5,2025-01-27 14:48:29,,,,I think the fingerprint sensor on the power button is the easiest and fastest biometric security measure I agree the underscreen ones are not as fast in general and imo a lot of the time theyre not even positioned in a place thats comfortable to press Although I dont like face id at all Its nice as an extra but it feels awkward to me as the only security method And I simply couldnt tolerate the notch Idk how iphone users do it The dynamic island version is fine but the iphone 1112 was obnoxiously big,m9ghdr2,4.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9gvlcb,nissanfan64,,2,2025-01-27 15:51:05,,,,Ill probably upgrade to this when it comes out My 13 never impressed me much and its battery capacity is down to like 79 Tanked super hard this fall Also I kinda despise the camera and the way it post produces the photos They look awful and fake,,0.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9h0jfd,nissanfan64,,3,2025-01-27 16:14:44,,,,Eh Hoping to get a better camera too And Ill be honest I beat the absolute hell out of my phones This Spigen tougharmor case I have is gouged to hell I could just change the battery but paying like 500 for a new SE would be a better option,m9gzdy5,2.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9hz2zc,primaryrhyme,,2,2025-01-27 18:54:35,,,,Not sure the camera would be better than the 13 they have to cut costs somewhere Also theyve been careful in the past to kneecap the SE enough so it doesnt cannibalize flagship sales which are much more profitable if they made the camera too good I feel like too many people wouldnt bother with the regular iPhone,m9h0jfd,3.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9hzrab,nissanfan64,,1,2025-01-27 18:57:40,,,,I just hate this new post processing shit they do It looks so bad 90 of the time If they dont have that and cut down to one camera I truly think Id like it more,m9hz2zc,4.0,1ib9shs
comment,m9kduhl,PNF2187,,1,2025-01-28 02:05:16,,,,A lot of the rumour mill seems to be pointing towards a single 48MP sensor They can knee cap the camera compared to the flagships but its probably more cost effective at this point to use the sensor from either the 15 or 16 than it is dig up an older 12MP sensor thats inferior to the one on the 13 Not having the Ultra Wide is enough for some people to go straight to the 15 or 16 and while its technically a downgrade from the 13 in that regard I personally rarely used the Ultra Wide on my 13 because how lacking it was,m9hz2zc,4.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9h3f5c,thisischemistry,,2,2025-01-27 16:28:15,,,,The notch can do the same the main difference between the two is a few useless pixels on the side Make the notch dynamic in the same way as the island,m9gvdom,2.0,1ib9shs

comment,mashqdg,CosmicPurrrs,,2,2025-02-03 19:42:22,,,,The only physical button youre missing is the home button Wheres the problem Get an android if you like pressing specific areas on a screen But even they copied the iOS gestures Ive used all three and much prefer swipping its so much faster Even your se doesnt have a physical button its a touch sensitive button and the phones haptic engine vibrates to simulate a click wich has been the case since like the iPhone 78 iirc,maq5ug7,3.0,1ib9shs

comment,m9rx0tu,SFanatic,,1,2025-01-29 05:15:32,,,,15 Pro user here the dynamic island is bullshit Its just a permanent island that they sometimes have a black banner over to kind of hide it but its still perpetually there and it cant possibly move because theres an actual camera there You cant just move the camera sensor its a physical thing in the iPhone Its a static island I hate this marketing,,0.0,1ib9shs
