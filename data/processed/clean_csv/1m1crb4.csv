comment,n3g1tso,SaiyanRajat,,300,2025-07-16 13:43:57,,,,8bitdo is making a better controller than actual console manufacturers,,0.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3hs2zc,SweetTea1000,,13,2025-07-16 18:56:06,,,,1st party controllers have been inferior to 3rd party controllers for like a decade The 1st parties have too much of a built in audience and guaranteed retail space It means they dont actually need to compete They can sell worse products at worse prices and still win,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3p1nrc,JoostinOnline,,3,2025-07-17 20:20:52,,,,Thats not necessarily true I have 8bitdo controllers but Ill still take a Series X controller over them in most cases Now dont get me wrong the lower price easily makes up for it but theyre less sturdy and the hall effect joysticks dont offer the same amount of precision Stick drift isnt nearly as much of a problem with Xbox controllers as with joycons,n3hs2zc,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3pmfja,SweetTea1000,,5,2025-07-17 22:01:59,,,,As far as 8bitdo goes I think they are probably the most prominent third party controller manufacturer these days likely have the greatest variety of products but if were just talking your daily driver dual analog controller I generally find that they always have a strong offering but rarely the best one Great value though Theyve also improved over time My first 8bit due controller had a mechanical failure that I would put down to poor build quality but newer models show substantial thought went into the redesigns And as far as yall effect goes were now 2 generations of technology ahead of that remember we had hall effect sticks in the 90s and theyve never gone out of fashion in the flight Sim market TMR replaced Hall Effect and now If you manufacturers are trying capacitative sticks in both cases the most substantial improvement is exactly what youre discussing regaining the accuracy of a frictionbased device without the fragility Even when the first parties do catch up in technology However they still always charge you that brand premium so its never going to be a decent value proposition,n3p1nrc,3.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3ptinb,JoostinOnline,,2,2025-07-17 22:40:07,,,,Ah you clearly have more knowledge about this than I do I appreciate the info Im going to look more into it I do regularly see people acting like anything with Hall effect is the savior of everything and that the 20 8bitdo controllers are top of the line Out of curiosity whats a controller that you would say beats the Xbox series controller in build quality and features,n3pmfja,4.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3r0yb1,SweetTea1000,,3,2025-07-18 02:55:53,,,,Ive been daily driving a MobaPad chitu but Im getting their Huben2 as an upgrade Thats me early adoptingtrying the capacitative tech though so I cant actually make a recommendation there I also got the KingKong2 the 1st modern controller that repopularized hall effect and that was not a smooth day 1 experience though they improved it on software updates As you say just because its hall effect doesnt necessarily mean its superior As a more direct Xbox controller upgrade Id recommend looking at the GameSir G7 Pro The reviews for that are just coming out now,n3ptinb,5.0,1m1crb4
comment,n45hyb2,lolic_addict,,1,2025-07-20 11:59:41,,,,Same experience with ps5 here Less precision but wont drift in 6 months is reconfigurable with less hassle and cheaper Pretty good deal to me,n3p1nrc,3.0,1m1crb4

comment,n474zjx,funforgiven,,1,2025-07-20 17:27:46,,,,This is two years old Also it wasnt really about hall effect itself but rather the quality of gamepads that used hall effect joysticks Sampling rate or recentering design have nothing to do with hall effect technology specifically By the way this controller doesnt even use hall effect but TMR for the joysticks,n46wd11,5.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3l8vvl,AbhishMuk,,3,2025-07-17 07:14:02,,,,True its just that often batteries are the first thing to go Its nice if its replaceable Whats more disappointing is that the pro 2 already had it,n3l8ey0,5.0,1m1crb4

comment,n46rs55,Peter_Nincompoop,,1,2025-07-20 16:22:26,,,,They do still exist Theyre all running Android and none are high end but they do still make them How does that negate the fact that replaceable is infinitely better for the consumer than nonreplaceable Batteries are what wear first on electronics,n46i2qz,11.0,1m1crb4
comment,n46u1gs,ypeelS,,1,2025-07-20 16:33:52,,,,Not on a video game controller that would be the sticks To claim 3rd party controller makers are anti consumer by making the batteries internal is wild considering they did what SonyMicrosoftNintendo refuse to do and are going hall effect anything I have an 8Bitdo Ultimate 2 and being able to pick up a fully charged controller every single time is infinitely better no having to swap batteries mid play dont have to make sure my spare batteries are fully charged dont have to worry about anything honestly Absolute worst case I use it for 20 hours straight and run the battery down plugging in a Type C cable is still easier than changing batteries,n46rs55,12.0,1m1crb4
comment,n46vf2p,Peter_Nincompoop,,1,2025-07-20 16:40:46,,,,Hows that work out for you when you play long enough that the batteries die midgame You gonna sit there and wait for your controllers to recharge,n46u1gs,13.0,1m1crb4
comment,n46vure,ypeelS,,1,2025-07-20 16:42:57,,,,if you read my previous response While extremely unlikely given the rated battery life I would just plug in a Type C cable which is faster than swapping batteries,n46vf2p,14.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3h3pz7,Kevadu,,12,2025-07-16 17:05:43,,,,Im not sure about this I bought an Ultimate 2 and the triggers failed in just a couple of months And apparently thats a really common issue Whats the point of having sticks that dont drift if something else fails instead,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3hbi0j,madmofo145,,2,2025-07-16 17:40:29,,,,Yeah Ive been super tempted buy some of their recent releases but Ive heard a few too many horror stories It seems to me like the big thing they need to do is slow down Their release pace of late has been a bit much and it seems like they arent working out all the kinks More just a throw every bell and whistle at it and hope for the best,n3h3pz7,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3l6bx5,The_Owl_Man_1999,,1,2025-07-17 06:51:32,,,,the right trigger on my ultimate failed after 3 months exactly I ended up just getting a gamesir because you can just walk in and buy one but I do want this pro 3 so I have a playstation layout controller too,n3h3pz7,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3h4uuz,LoBFCanti,,0,2025-07-16 17:10:52,,,,Not to say that have to but the triggers are pretty easy to replace if you dont want to wait on customer service Ive done surgery on a lot of joycons and Id risk an 8bitdo button fix over assured joycon drift I have had the same controller for 2 yrs,n3h3pz7,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3hku9s,Dt2_0,,5,2025-07-16 18:22:43,,,,I bought 2 Ultimate 2 Cs both failed completely no power no nothing within 2 weeks of purchasing First was exchanged with the retailer 8Bitdo offered to replace the second but could not cover shipping which was going to be about 60 of the cost of the controller itself Overall for a company so hyped I was left disappointed and decided not to continue purchasing from them,n3h4uuz,3.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3h6xyi,fnv_fan,,-3,2025-07-16 17:20:11,,,,Thats why you buy GameSir controllers instead Much better than 8BitDo imo,n3h3pz7,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3ihqh7,rebbsitor,,2,2025-07-16 20:54:52,,,,Yep I love my 8bitdo Pro 2 controllers I was going to buy an extra set to have as a backup because theyre great Guess Ill get the Pro 3 Ive always wanted to have swappable ab and xy buttons for use on PC Theyre mapped correctly but the text on the buttons are swapped if youre not using a Nintendo Switch,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3jn2mb,Wetzilla,,1,2025-07-17 00:26:36,,,,I dunno I have an Ultimate 2 and it basically gathers dust It just feels cheaper than an xbox or playstation controller It also for some reason doesnt use xinput in bluetooth mode so it doesnt work well with windows,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3ko9yd,The8Darkness,,1,2025-07-17 04:24:01,,,,If only their controller names were as good as the controllers or they had some table clearly stating what is the bestnewest and the features in general Like Ultimate Bluetooth Ultimate 2C Ultimate Wireless Ultimate 2C Wireless Ultimate 24G Ultimate 3mode Ultimate wired Ultimate C wired Ultimate 2C wired And thats just the ultimate line Plus it would be great if they could make a dongle that supports multiple controllers not really a fan of having 8 dongles plugged into my pc at all times,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3ls69z,alvenestthol,,1,2025-07-17 10:14:38,,,,The Pro line is the one line that does it well Despite evolving out of the retroimitation line with names like SF30 the Pro line just has the Pro Pro 2 and Pro 3,n3ko9yd,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3kqpbx,zexton,,1,2025-07-17 04:42:31,,,,the c2 ultimate wireless is a 30 euro controller that has hal effect triggers and sticks turbobutton change without software 1000hz with the included dongle on for pc after trying a hal effect controller there are no way im going back fun fact you need a xbox controller dongle for pc to get lower inputlag with the xbox series controller using bluetooth against the 8bitdo c2 wireless 1000hz there is 15ms difference in input lag,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3l22hh,JWayn596,,1,2025-07-17 06:14:51,,,,They were but with this release Theyre jumping on board with the shittiest release ever Non removable batteries No more AA support Are you fucking kidding me Now theyre just like the rest of them I dont give a damn they got extra buttons They turned their best product into a brick Stock up on Pro 2s,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3hp2xo,KFUP,,2,2025-07-16 18:42:25,,,,Yup both 8bitdo and GameSir have ridiculously good price to quality ratio GameSirs Tegenaria Lite is like 20 and has hall effect sticks Nintendos new 85 Pro joke of a controller doesnt it has the same old cheap drift prone potentiometers,n3g1tso,1.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3i8qyc,inveniam7,,5,2025-07-16 20:14:35,,,,Really glad they arent moving away from this form factor I have the Pro 2 and using it doesnt aggravate my hands the way the Switch joycons or the Duelsense do so its been my goto when any system that isnt the PS5,n3g9vll,1.0,1m1crb4
comment,n3kv62a,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,1,2025-07-17 05:17:25,,,,Do you know if the charger is cross compatible with the Ultimate Doesnt look like it I bought the Ultimate about a year ago but really wanted a PS form factor If it isnt compatible Im kind of locked into Ultimates as I dont wanna have to have specific chargers for specific controllers,n3i8qyc,2.0,1m1crb4
comment,n5dcp2j,digitalasagna,,1,2025-07-27 02:48:14,,,,You can just charge with the usb c cable for any of them but the dock definitely looks unique Shouldnt matter though since it comes with the controller,n3kv62a,3.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3rjomz,JWayn596,,1,2025-07-18 05:09:52,,,,I have the Pro 2 that doesnt have an included dock But my point still stands Replaceable AA batteries or removable battery packs at least are much more convenient and versatile in all aspects and extend the life of the product by decades Even if you did as you said and used the dock properly the occasions where youll run out of juice will be massively inconvenient because youll have to wait for it to be charged or use it wired or the battery will wear down in 10 years and youll have to buy a whole new controller PS4 controllers did not have replaceable batteries and they needed full replacements because they wouldnt work anymore,n3rix0c,7.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3rn8i2,JWayn596,,1,2025-07-18 05:39:05,,,,Thats not what happened with the PS4 controllers And often times the advertised battery life is not the actual battery life Or you dont have a dock and you just put the controller down and it runs out next time mid session But even if you wanted to have the same kind of full battery experience you could just replace the battery at the end of a session and leave the old ones to charge You would literally have 0 downtime At all Changing the battery is simply much more convenient Its literally like reloading,n3rkcyk,9.0,1m1crb4

comment,n3tcp00,ypeelS,,1,2025-07-18 13:39:32,,,,how is a non removable battery anti consumer A low capacity LiIon in a low amp draw controller wont degrade to the point of being noticeable before other parts on the controller fail This is literally the headphone jack all over again everyone shunned Apple when they removed it and until they realized its actually not a bad idea and followed suit,n3rwkbq,16.0,1m1crb4
