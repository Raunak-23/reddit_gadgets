comment,mck6629,DontForgorTheMilk,,4,2025-02-13 15:11:32,,,,I mean yeah for real Im surprised too Especially after the chip shortages and such In around only 5 years theyve reached almost half of the entire lifetime sales of the PS2 I think by the end of its lifecycle it probably wont get close to the PS2 itll slow down for sure but still its surprising,mck2tfr,1.0,1iok82f

comment,mck5s7f,DontForgorTheMilk,,3,2025-02-13 15:09:33,,,,That number for the PS2s will change to 170m in a few months when the Switch closes in on 160m units Disclaimer IDGAF about console sales numbers I just think its a funny idea that Sony is just that petty,mck3fhd,2.0,1iok82f
comment,mck7kyd,Juub1990,,5,2025-02-13 15:18:43,,,,I thought so as well but they had a tweet from way back in like 2015 that said 160M sold and they had the exact number They never really advertised it though Once Nintendo was closing in on them they started reminding everyone of the real sales numbers they hadnt been interested in yelling for a long time,mck5s7f,3.0,1iok82f
