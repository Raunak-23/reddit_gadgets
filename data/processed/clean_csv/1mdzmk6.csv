comment,n65ok36,technobrendo,,114,2025-07-31 12:58:16,,,,Home assistant is one I think you need to spin it up on your own home server or appliance like a docker container running on a NAS for example Plus you need to integrate it with all your smart things and I dont know how compatible it is compared to Google home,n65n26j,1.0,1mdzmk6
comment,n65r7qw,PreviousImpression28,,35,2025-07-31 13:12:59,,,,I get Home Assistant is like a server for IoT but I have no idea what hardware to get What do I get for the doorbell What do I get for the thermostat What do I get for the lightbulbs etc People on here always tout Home Assistant but god damn theyre so fucking bad at selling how it can be the alternative to Nest or Alexa Like I need someone to spell out the entire hardware ecosystem to me so I can just buy them and brainlessly install Home Assistant,n65ok36,2.0,1mdzmk6
comment,n67x255,audigex,,34,2025-07-31 19:21:58,,,,Its not a big commercial entity so theres no Just buy Google Home stuff statement we can make But as some general rules Buy ZigbeeThread or Matter devices where possible they pretty much all work locally if you have a suitable coordinator and with minimum effort Ikea smart home stuff is mostly Zigbee and works with home assistant with a generic Zigbee USB dongle Reolink are very popular for cameras I use their doorbell and its great works fully locally Aqara are a general good call for Home Assistant sensors some lights Shelly for relays IKEA for lightbulbs You can also connect most things that use cloud services so most existing devices you already have should work until you need to replace them and can buy fully locally Some things like thermostats you may struggle to find a local only version because there are so few on the market but again cloud ones will generally work to fill in this kind of gap if you find its unavoidable The actual answer is that Home Assistant can work with almost any smart device theres very little in my house that Ive found doesnt just work,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n67nl8y,Tuxhorn,,3,2025-07-31 18:36:34,,,,If you start from scratch focus on zigbee compatible smart devices Stuff from Ikea and Philips Hue products support this for example Home assistant does sell a complete package hardware wise No need to go crazy if you dont care to although the software side of home assistant does require you to be technically literate For anyone else if youre running it on your own hardware old PC a raspberry pi id always recommend the smlight slzb06 instead of a dongle This makes virtualization a lot simpler as you dont have to deal with pass through but thats a more in depth discussion about why you might want to do that,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6
comment,n6660y3,JamesTiberiusCrunk,,10,2025-07-31 14:28:02,,,,You can just ask people what to get Most of the time you can just Google home assistant local XYZ where XYZ is thermostat or doorbell or whatever You are going to have to do some things for yourself though If googling is too much work for you Im not sure any of this is for you,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n6a2rbk,emelbard,,1,2025-08-01 02:17:35,,,,Because almost everything works with HA out of the box Its borderless and talks the languages of nearly all HA devices Zwave zigbee HomeKit thread WiFi Bluetooth Most cameras to include UniFi Protect are discovered out of the box If you have something thats cloud based like iRobot for roombas HA will integrate it although its still reliant on their cloud since their comms are proprietary I think thats why people never explain this about HA many of them cant grasp that the rest of the home automations are closed and single protocol,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6
comment,n6a8y4q,inventord,,1,2025-08-01 02:56:34,,,,I switched to home assistant just over a year ago I grabbed a 40 mini PC that sits in a drawer and runs home assistant in a VM For compatibility every single device I had worked All my cheap tuya stuff could be switched to local control My TVs work fine My smart plugs from different brands cooperate via homekit integration as well as my ecobee thermostat Someone even made an integration for our alarm that mostly works Since theres such a a big community out there its kind of hard to find a large manufacturer that isnt supported at all unless theyre super stubborn For new purchases just look for things that work with zigbee or zwave and get a dongle for home assistant I run a bunch of inovelli smart light switches and some cheap sengled bulbs I did that so I could have color changing smart lights with a physical light switch that wouldnt just kill the power to them I even DIYed a landscape lighting controller that uses a zigbee relay,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n6c61eo,IronHeart_777,,1,2025-08-01 12:20:01,,,,I have a HP DL380 G9 enterprise server running Unraid down in my basement that I host a bunch of things on such as my own personal instance of Vaultwarden to manage my passwords completely removed them from googleapple Immich which completely replaced googleapple photos multiple dedicated game servers NUMEROUS other self hosted docker containers and a VM running home assistant What no one is mentioning with Home assistant is that its complex Linking your services such as Philips Hue to Home assistant is cake sure but the nightmare begins when you want a nice big library of premade scenes or scenes that gradually shift over time Theres nothing like that without taking a big dive into HACS If you buy a zigbee adapter all zigbee devices can only be controlled by one master zigbee controller so youll need to factory reset them such as hue bulbs and then let the zigbee controller manage them Its very much an all in situation that Ive been extremely hesitant to jump to even though I have a zigbee usb controller I also think that the google speakers home assistant plugin has a subscription could be wrong If you want to switch to home assistant without fussing about hardware check out the home assistant green or yellow which are made directly by the group who make the software,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6
comment,n6e6a3a,SirPancakesIII,,1,2025-08-01 18:19:00,,,,From my experience there is no brainlessly install home assistant I am a computer engineer by day and setting up home assistant was not an easy task I have a front door bell camera an automated water shutoff system and an alarm system running on my home assistant It took a lot of learning and many hours of testing and debug to get those systems set up how I wanted I am in love with it now because I have local control of everything but for people with little technical experience I would say its probably not going to be worth it unless if you can dedicate many hours to learn some new skills,n65r7qw,3.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n67qfl7,danny12beje,,-3,2025-07-31 18:50:07,,,,All of you ask like its as simple as that but theres a fuckton of devices not natively supported by HA that you can only use with custom things that require you to have specific devices because even if you find for example an extension for Xiaomi devices not all of them are on that list I can name plenty vacuums lights and fans that wont work And the ones that do you have to learn fucking programming to use them HA is terrible for when you have multiple differentbrand devices And if youre forced to have 12 brands to make sure everything works out of the box how is it different than having everything in the google apple or amazon ecosystems,n65ok36,2.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n668tfy,mikeyyve,,8,2025-07-31 14:41:23,,,,Historically youre only choice was to use their integration into Google Assistant to get voice control through Google Homes The Home Assistant team has started adding voice control systems directly into Home Assistant itself and they are even currently selling a device that basically replaces a Google Home mini but its in preview I havent messed with any of that yet but it sounds like its still being worked on and will be good in a year or two Im still using the method of exposing my local devices to Google Home and using Assistant for voice control I hate it and its terrible Google AssistantHome is absolutely terrible now With that said we dont use voice control much in the house I have Z Wave wall switches for the switches that can support wired ones and battery powered wireless switches for areas that dont have a switch or have a switch that doesnt support a smart switch I also have a lot of motionpresence sensors in the house which trigger things like lights when you enter a room Wow Im sorry for the wall of a response this turned into Lmao Home Assistant and home automation is sort of an unhealthy hobby of mine,n660no5,3.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n65zujn,Major_T_Pain,,56,2025-07-31 13:57:47,,,,12 years ago I predicted this with my buddies No one should have to rely on a corporation to have access to their own home tech But the solution is a business model that for all intents and purposes does not yet exist Local Self hosted home tech control via a hub If you want outside access it makes sense for that to be provided by a third party perhaps But Your local devices should in theory run forever and be controlled without the need for internet via your hub Obviously if you want to upgrade you may have to buy a new hub andor devices locally but thats just like any other techutility in a house water heater HVAC etc But having bulbs switches sensors etc get bricked simply because a corporation desires more money or didnt put together a realistic business model is Absolutely fucked,n65j0te,1.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n67zjh7,rechlin,,2,2025-07-31 19:34:05,,,,Local Self hosted home tech control via a hub If you want outside access it makes sense for that to be provided by a third party perhaps And thats exactly what Home Assistant does Free software that runs on a local server and they provide an optional paid service to make it accessible over the Internet though I dont need that since I just VPN in from my phone to access it Unfortunately some integrations with some products are still reliant on the cloud like Google Nest for example but one just needs to be careful to only buy products that have local APIs so even if my Internet connection is lost I can still control my garage door locks lights thermostat irrigation etc Some of my smart devices can work both ways for example my Lutron hub can be accessed with their app via the cloud or it can be controlled purely locally with Home Assistant and others I only have setup through Home Assistant like my Schlage front door lock and my ratgdo garage door controller,n65zujn,2.0,1mdzmk6

comment,n678an2,lunasdude,,-1,2025-07-31 17:26:20,,,,I see that some people are equating Google with Amazon and their Alexa smart home systems and thats not fair they are very different You can hate on Amazon all you want but theyre smart offerings are far superior too Googles in every respect from hardware to the Alexa devices they work dramatically better As a matter of fact I would put the Amazon smart devices up against Apples smart home devices I had a few Amazon smart devices for years and WeMo devices well guess what Belkin is dumping WeMo support and theyll go offline January 1st 2026 What that means is any WeMo branded device will cease to have any smart functions meeting it will not work with any app nor will it work on the internet at all Are a few models that will work with Apple home kit but just a few The rest of the product line will simply become dumb switches My Amazon devices Are still working reliably so I replaced my 14 WeMo switches with Amazon smart devices and everything works seamlessly As a matter of fact I was pleasantly and shockingly surprised at how easy it was to set up Every time I hooked up a inwall switch or plugged in a smart plug by the time I was done and sitting down to open the Alexa app it was already there set up and ready to go All I had to do was rename it to what I wanted to call it and put it into any smart routines Ive wanted I used to have my own personal smart home server setup And people will tell you that you should do this because its so much better and you dont have to worry about big companies etc blah blah blah But what they dont tell you is that you have to maintain the computer whether its a raspberry pi or a fullon PC you will have to update any APIs that change which is the instructions to the physical device thats turning things off and on and you will have to deal with any network issues that pop up and they will pop up After dealing with all of that for years I simply dont want to do it anymore Im not saying that Amazon is the best company but it works simply and reliably and Amazon generally doesnt have a huge record of dumping products unless they are not profitable and being bought by people Google on the other hand does it all the time,,0.0,1mdzmk6
