comment,maxma9b,PineappleLemur,,29,2025-02-04 15:18:11,,,,Not cost wise The wheels end up being like 6 8 times the weight of a traditional wheel for the same performance Speed will be quite low without some magic motors too lot of wear and tear on those as well You need to surround about 70 of the wheel in order to secure it in this video he relies on gravity which failed him in a few runs so ride height is pretty low Suspension for a vehicle with 4 of this also becomes a reinvention of the wheel literally Dirtdebries will mess up the control wheels inside very fast Balancing and having a uniform wear on the rubber is a very hard task as well You need a whole system to make sure each point on the wheel is spending equal amount of time on the road So as cool as it is Its totally impractical If you think changing a tire today is expensive think how much more something like this will cost,maxcx8e,1.0,1ihemn5
comment,may2vfz,leftiesrepresent,,12,2025-02-04 16:38:07,,,,This is so similar to scaling up quadcopters you eventually just end up reinventing the helicopter for being far more practical,maxma9b,2.0,1ihemn5
