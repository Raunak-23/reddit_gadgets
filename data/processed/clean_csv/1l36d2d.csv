comment,mvykcxq,Enough-Meaning1514,,152,2025-06-04 14:44:17,,,,User swappable doesnt mean toolless swaps It means the supplier also needs to sell the necessary tools to open and close the phones Modern phones are a pain to open even with heatguns I dont think this bill will make any impact to Apple or Samsung,mvygyu0,2.0,1l36d2d

comment,mvz5mxu,BenadrylChunderHatch,,39,2025-06-04 16:25:00,,,,It really depends how old it is No manufacturer warranty covers water damage and the glue they use to seal the phone degrades over time,mvyqlfn,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mvz7tx1,tinglySensation,,26,2025-06-04 16:35:29,,,,There are some phones out there that can be opened with just a screwdriver and have their battery replaced without ruining the water seal The one I know of is chonky AF but uses a gasket and even has a projector Tank 3 pro on Amazon Jerry rig everything does a teardown on it,mvz5mxu,5.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw3orgp,BenadrylChunderHatch,,1,2025-06-05 08:39:27,,,,The IP rating only tells you what the phone could withstand when it was tested at the factory It will not necessarily withstand the same thing after owning it for a year Maybe the waterproofing on an S4 Active lasts longer than on modern phones but unless the manufacturer is willing to back up the waterproofing claims by honouring warranties for water damage then I wouldnt count on it,mw2ss44,6.0,1l36d2d
comment,mvzm0ph,RegretAggravating926,,17,2025-06-04 17:40:50,,,,Curious question how often does this happen I only lost 1 phone to water in my entire life ironically a water resistant phone Havent dropped a phone in the water before or after Personally I would prefer a swappable battery instead of water resistance if I had a choice,mvyqlfn,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mvzsggs,Cynical_Manatee,,17,2025-06-04 18:10:38,,,,I like the fact that I can just rinse my phone if I accidentally spill something on it and not worry at all I dont think plunging it in a pool is a necessary requirement Tho end of the day I just want reasonable battery replacement costs I dont really care if I do it myself or not but just charge me a fair price for the battery and the 20 minute labour cost of getting someone to replace it properly,mvzm0ph,5.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw0grno,dabbax,,12,2025-06-04 20:06:38,,,,funny story My wife has an iPhone which is stated as waterproof Display broke had it replaced at authorized Apple Service provider Few months after my wife spills something on the phone and gives it a quick rinse phone goes out and is dead Found out that the technician back then when changing the display has forgotten to put the two bottom screws beside the charging port back in Which is where water could enter You would not believe how long I had to discuss with Apple and the service provider until they agreed to fix their fuckup Water damage is not covered by warranty blahblah They agreed when I asked them how high is the possibility of both bottom screws unscrewing themselves and falling out without anyone noticing which they had to admit was nearly impossible,mvzsggs,6.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw2aoff,SpidermanAPV,,3,2025-06-05 02:01:13,,,,I just had a very similar situation myself I had the battery replaced and after that water got splashed on it at the pool They said it was their fault and that the techs hadnt fully sealed the phone down Came back in a week to pick it up and they said I needed to pay 750 Said why when they told me it was free They said that it was only free if I could prove their technicians caused the problem Except they had already shipped my old phone out for refurbishment so it couldnt be proved anymore I wouldve fought harder but I had medical work that needed doing and couldnt go without my phone for another week,mw0grno,7.0,1l36d2d

comment,mxiyk44,F-21,,2,2025-06-13 07:47:39,,,,Its seriously not a big deal You do not need to design the phone in the exact same way as they were 20 years ago A phone can actually be designed so that everything except the battery is sealed and if it is dropped in water the battery might get damaged or die but not any other component of the phone,mvyqlfn,4.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw3gqjl,Enough-Meaning1514,,-2,2025-06-05 07:18:52,,,,They dont have to They will sell the kitspare part and ask the user to heat the phone with a hairdryer What will happen next is someone will apply too much force to pry it open and break the front or back glass AppleSamsung these guys are clever enough to bend the regulations to the maximum effect,mw0xjxt,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw0sc6w,kamekaze1024,,1,2025-06-04 21:01:03,,,,I dont really think that matters Them being repairable in general is what people want If you have to buy tools to do it thats fine Even if its hard to do making it more feasible is the end goal Like most things if you are unable to or feel uncomfortable fixing something the pros will always be there for you anyway,mvykcxq,3.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw1rtbr,zushini,,1,2025-06-05 00:10:54,,,,Yes it will if its too difficult to open the Apple or Samsung we can sue And if they include a toolkit theyll have to weigh up costs for how complicated it needs to be,mvykcxq,3.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw0u0a3,nagi603,,1,2025-06-04 21:09:15,,,,My type C port died before I the rest of the phone did And there was literally no first party replacement and third party ones were unconnected passive charging only with no data connections Might have to try the next fairphone one of these days provided its popular enough for nonstock ROMs,mvzb1wc,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw3t42x,Blergonos,,2,2025-06-05 09:23:27,,,,Im telling you the main bane of old phones is the ports I have lost 3 phones due to the damn microusb ports and they were quite ok otherwise,mw0u0a3,5.0,1l36d2d
comment,mvyunmk,Yancy_Farnesworth,,6,2025-06-04 15:33:03,,,,LineageOS is not a replacement for official device support Most LineageOS builds will not pass Googles Android automated tests which tests security stability etc that all officially supported builds must pass Its better than no support but its not a silver bullet,mvyllrj,3.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw0tgfw,nagi603,,2,2025-06-04 21:06:31,,,,LineageOS is not a replacement for official device support In fact it WAS the official device support for some Most LineageOS builds will not pass Googles Android automated tests Thats mostly have to do with Google trying to go walled garden and lock you in And valid only if by most you mean every random custom oneperson ROM that you can google In my experience since the start of Android many official releases had far worse stability problems,mvyunmk,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw22zgq,Yancy_Farnesworth,,0,2025-06-05 01:16:24,,,,In fact it WAS the official device support for some Citation on official support Lineage gets from SoC manufacturers for drivers for their SoC Because absent that it is quite literally not official support Its community support using reverse engineered SoC drivers Thats mostly have to do with Google trying to go walled garden and lock you in Citation Every complex piece of software utilizes a suite of tests designed to catch among other things regression bugs and ensure things like past security fixes continue to work Thats what this suite of tests is for To my knowledge this suite of tests deal with the OS itself not the Google Play services which are the closed source components of Googles walled garden But hey dont take my word for it A company called Fairphone documented their journey to extend support for their devices and documented their partnership with LineageOS to deliver official support for their devices as Qualcomm refused to allow them to use official drivers for their SoC It was not trivial and one of the hardest parts was making sure their updates still passed those automated tests for quality,mw0tgfw,5.0,1l36d2d

comment,mwdy5bw,mailslot,,1,2025-06-06 21:23:05,,,,Those seals on the S5 were problematic to line up and the USB cover broke off easily Then the constant warning to check the seals even if theyre perfect were annoying In practice the water proofing didnt even last long The back cover would also pop off with the slightest provocation ejecting the battery across the room I reinserted the battery multiple times but never had to replace it once The S5 is the worst example of waterproofing and a good justification for not doing what they did The subsequent fully sealed S7 was fantastic no replaceable battery but the battery also cant fly out of the phone or rattle,mvyj5os,3.0,1l36d2d

comment,mvzvfl8,umataro,,1,2025-06-04 18:24:49,,,,Spare battery is 25 euro and can be swapped in 10 seconds In a56 if I want the phone to last me years I have to enable maximum battery protection which caps the battery at 80 anyway Samsung Xcover phones are also semi rugged and dont need a case,mvzps7c,4.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw3sfw0,Shadow647,,1,2025-06-05 09:16:41,,,,The point is that you sacrifice battery life by 20 every single day to speed up by an hour a battery replacement that is needed once in 34 years if it is a good battery,mvzvfl8,5.0,1l36d2d
comment,mw9tq6i,KunashG,,1,2025-06-06 06:16:05,,,,And why does this happen exactly Because as far as I can tell the batteries are actually swappable theyre just hiding behind proprietary screws and a glue strip was used I think thats fine as long as they sell the battery by itself and change the screws,mw3sfw0,6.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw0li6z,Alortania,,-1,2025-06-04 20:29:01,,,,If you can carry extra batteries you can carry power banks Power banks require down time you need to plug your phone in and keep it plugged in Theres also power lost through the transfer Batteries make your phone go from near 0 to 100 instantly If you use your phone as part of your job or hell just take lots of picsvidsetc having it attached to a brick and cable might make things less efficient or annoyingly bulky etc AFAIK havent had ext batteries for a very long time now _ the batteries are also lighter than comparable powerbanks,mw0kc81,8.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw0nyze,Alortania,,1,2025-06-04 20:40:32,,,,Actually more and more people use phones vs cameras when the pictures arent for photography Phone cameras are more than sufficient nowadays and the instant upload is a big bonus you dont find on lowertier cameras plus theyre lighter and its less equipment you have to buy I know many jobs that have you use your phones as scanners so screen on camera internet connection either for retail jobs vs giving you dedicated scanners etc and on those despite access you dont have time to stop and charge your phone midshift or maintenance with barQRetc codes keeping track of things or apps on said phones linking to said equipment in leu of dedicated diagnostics tools most really just need a screen bit of computing power and some security handshake thing easy enough to add an app for and maybe a dedicated cable for older things expecting a certain plug I havent worked enough of those jobs to really tell you more TBH but I know enough to know they exist,mw0mgo2,10.0,1l36d2d

comment,mvyrabd,NorysStorys,,10,2025-06-04 15:17:07,,,,As much as I respect the points people make about user swappable batteries and essentially a return to a removable back case with a battery compartment but phones like that exist on the market and other types shouldnt be banned thats something the market should more or less decide Having phones be reasonably user serviceable is something that should fundamentally be required as it is a complete ballache to get into most phones to swap a battery but something being reasonably userserviceable doesnt mean brain dead simple either Most PCs and Laptops are userserviceable and the vast majority of people still refuse to do it themselves,mvyj9my,3.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw00qkg,AuroraFinem,,5,2025-06-04 18:49:56,,,,Honestly for me personally I see that as a significant downgrade The only reason Id want swappable batteries is if mine degrades significantly and the law as written isnt likely going to make many manufacturers give you the old on the fly swappable battery It will be them providing the tools to do it officially rather than formed batteries in fully sealedglued casings that need specialty trainingequipment to replace I dont see anyone taking out a screwdriver or something to take the back off and replace a battery on the fly when you can just carry a single power bank and exchange your phone in your bagpurse a half dozen times on a full charge,mvz1o6g,2.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw0gwed,Alortania,,0,2025-06-04 20:07:16,,,,You dont buy what A smart phone They were all equally messy and created so much ewaste as well as confusion You know they also used the chargers and locking other brands from working ie only apple watch worked with Apple at one point with their phones as a way to stop you from swapping yes Even if a different brand came out with something better because of the sunk cost And thats not even counting when you had brands do different chargers for different things so even if you stayed loyal the cable changed often and the phone didnt charge with the same thing the tablet did etc So what you like a brand but damnit all your stuff is for the older version of it so now you need all new chargers and stuff and shit your friend likes a different brand so like no you cant just ask him to charge your phone when you forgot your cable because damnit you made the wrong choice vs that particular event and goshdarnit you decided you didnt want the chargeall dongle that takes half your bag Apple especially would have never swapped to USB C without being forced to do so by the EU and you know it and we would still be stuck in the tangle of useless PitA wires everyone had from various old phones and other stuff because everything had its own solution Its very naive to think companies would do something proconsumer out of the goodness of their hearts Food companies would totally give ingredient lists and calories if they didnt have to and cigarette companies would totally add those fun black box warnings if they didnt have to and cell companies would just create phones with options as to which charger it comes with just so you have a choice,mw0eyap,4.0,1l36d2d

comment,mvzav1r,crasscrackbandit,,2,2025-06-04 16:49:35,,,,there are no usable replacement batteries left on the market And what guarantees swappable batteries staying on the market indefinitely Some phones swell up within a few months of use Ive seen it happen Thats within warranty period You take it back to where you got it Swappable or replaceable its the same lithiumion battery so they carry similar amount of risk Swappable battery malfunction can damage a mobile device just the same Phone battery replacement is extremely common It takes minutes if they have the battery in stock So I am creating a lot of ewaste when I could just be swapping the battery If your swappable battery is damaged that still goes to waste If you are throwing phones out due to battery issues thats on you not on the phone I am 40 and I have never done that ever We just get a new battery Every phone manufacturer performs battery replacement Some do it online even like you mail it in and get it back same way Im sorry but you are talking absolute nonsense And basically describing your personal inability to perform basic tasks such as getting a device serviced Apple charges 4999 dollars to replace a battery Android devices cannot be 100200 dollars Swappable batteries are not handed out free of charge are they because when you connect the charger the phone heats up like crazy when charging and becomes impossible to use slow and laggy What sort of phone is that Never experienced it lol besides we got fast charging these days 1020 mins and you are done for a while You can survive without using your phone for 1030 minutes in a day maybe more I think you have a problem Not the charging or phone We got charging in cars we got wireless chargers for desks If I got my laptop with me I can plug it in there,mvz4l71,3.0,1l36d2d

comment,mvyykf5,Pupperoni__Pizza,,33,2025-06-04 15:51:28,,,,Coming from a country with strong consumer protections Australia I like seeing the EU take the lead with consumercentric rules However I do worry that they may be starting to overreach with lawmakers mandating things that may not be feasible In this example if a user replaces their own battery and does not reassemble the device in a way that creates a sufficient seal against water ingress which is highly likely given the demand to not require specialist tools and knowing the average person then we will inevitably see a large number of devices being damaged by simple water exposure that would have otherwise been no risk Apart from the fact that this may lead to unnecessary ewaste I wonder how the EU will rule where liability of the water damage lies in such a circumstance A sensible approach would suggest its on the consumer who performed the faulty reassembly and I say this as an extremely proconsumer person but judging by the EUs actions thus far I daresay theyll be pinning it on the manufacturers which is rather stupid and demonstrates a lack of understanding of how things work Many modern devices more closely resemble a mechanical watch than a combustion car Intricate and delicate parts are inextricably linked to the function of the device and come with cons Curiously we dont see the EU mandating the same protections for said automatic watch mechanisms or similar devices though,,0.0,1l36d2d

comment,mw45v95,shitposts_over_9000,,-1,2025-06-05 11:14:22,,,,it is about 30 for most tech verticals but only 1520 of the profit under the current prohibitions plus regulatory and tax overhead this particular change probably wont be the tipping point but when the bottom end of that range hits 10 something is going to change because the companies are going to be in a situation where they would be risking underperforming the market just by selling in the EU smartphones being viewed as a necessity by the people with the most disposable income I would expect EU only models with significantly higher prices for a while before any of the large vendors exit the market though,mvzl0oc,2.0,1l36d2d
