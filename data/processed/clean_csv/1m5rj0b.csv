comment,n4fjp8u,rebbsitor,,14,2025-07-21 23:22:56,,,,ET is a pretty good 2600 game It gets a bad rap mainly because it was release just as the Video Game Crash happened and because its not a pick up and play game Someone absolutely must read the manual to understand what to do Theres also one fiddly mechanic thats easy to work with once you know how but could be very frustrating if you dont I had a lot of fun with it back in the 80s and Ive replayed it a few times more recently It still holds up Its honestly one of the more advanced games for the 2600,n4e4vyp,2.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4frgzk,rebbsitor,,8,2025-07-22 00:06:06,,,,Thats why you need the manual Theres a command to show where the phone pieces are so you dont go searching all the pits Its 100 in one that flashes Also you eat the Reeses Pieces for more energy so you dont die The game is actually played for high score so once you win build the phone go home you keep playing additional loops for score,n4flm4r,4.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n5c6hyw,BetSubject6704,,1,2025-07-26 22:20:28,,,,I agree I bought an Atari 2600 in the late 2000s when I was 16 mainly because I loved shitty games and wanted to try out ET and because I loved retro games Plus my local game store was selling a 2600 bundle with like 30 games for 25 so why not Anyways I thought ET was a decent game Definitely had more depth than most of the games I had on the console,n4fjp8u,3.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n5bgwlm,snoromRsdom,,1,2025-07-26 19:57:38,,,,No ET is a crap game We were right back then and we are still right Just stop with the BS attempts to rehabilitate one of the worst games of alltime Its embarrassing,n4fjp8u,3.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n5c7f4v,BetSubject6704,,1,2025-07-26 22:25:57,,,,Eh I kinda agree with them I was born in 93 and purchased an Atari 2600 in the late 2000s as a teenager So I wasnt around when the game came out but I didnt think it was that bad at the time Of course not playing a 2600 until decades after it came out a lot of the games seem rudimentary and archaic But ET seemed a little more complex than many other 2600 games and I had some fun with it,n5bgwlm,4.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4eotto,jimbobdonut,,29,2025-07-21 20:42:04,,,,It blows my mind that Atari spent millions on getting the licenses for both ET and PacMan but then rushed out the games to make a Christmas deadline ET was programmed by one guy in eight weeks Im surprised that the game was as playable as it was,n4e9tqv,1.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4l21po,obi1kenobi1,,2,2025-07-22 19:49:23,,,,ET is my go to cartridge for testing controllers Youre just instantly thrown into gameplay where every action the four directions and the button does something but theres also no action or enemies so you can take your time to figure out if the controller is working properly and reliably So its good for something at least,n4eotto,2.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4fj964,rebbsitor,,7,2025-07-21 23:20:29,,,,PacMan on the 2600 is mainly down to time constraints on the developer and knowing that it was going to sell well no matter what they put in the box Donkey Kong on the 2600 came from a similar situation They could have made the game better even back then but they wouldnt have made more money and that was the bottom line for the business You can see this with Ms PacMan on the 2600 that came out a year later,n4ez81c,2.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4hsrs3,KeplerFinn,,0,2025-07-22 09:06:48,,,,but they wouldnt have made more money Thats highly speculative Unless you have a time machine which can branch into parallel dimensions theres absolutely no way to tell for sure Its a typical excuse made by lazy greedy people Its this kind of mindset which directly lead to the video game crash at the expense of a lot of opportunity money,n4fj964,3.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4i0o41,rebbsitor,,2,2025-07-22 10:20:30,,,,Its both the companys assessment and probably correct In the early 80s there was basically no gaming media reviews and certainly nothing like social media Home video games sold based off advertisement arcade reputation if it was a port and the back of the box What really led to the crash was companies churning out shovelware and customers having no good way to know what they were getting until after they bought it the 2600 version of PacMan is arguably shovelware to capitalize on PacMan Fever They were so confident they could sell this version that they produced more carts than there were consoles existing at the time expecting it would be a system seller And they sold a ton of them Its by far one of the most common carts out there even after throwing a bunch in a landfill Unfortunately consumer confidence plummeted due to stuff like this and the market being flooded by a lot of 3rd party shovelware It took Nintendo and their Seal of Quality system to revive the home market,n4hsrs3,4.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n5bibjf,snoromRsdom,,-1,2025-07-26 20:05:21,,,,You have no clue about the crash at all You obviously werent there and are quoting from teenagers on Youtube who also have no clue The amount of shovelware a term which didnt exist yet was absolutely irrelevant Acting as if people stopped buying good games because bad games were on the shelf is lazy and ignorant Try harder The answer is obvious and was written about at the time And all of us back then read magazines that had reviews Again you have no clue at all,n4i0o41,5.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n5bhvti,snoromRsdom,,1,2025-07-26 20:02:59,,,,It has nothing to do with having a better understanding The poorgramma was not given enough time to write the game just like ET And sure I could make a better version today We all know that extremely primitive CPU and Jay Miners AV chip inside and out now Most games made for the Atari VCS today are far better than what came out at the time Of course they often have 16K or more of code which means Atari could not have afforded to SHIP them back in 1982 so theres that,n4ez81c,2.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4geq8o,pohatu771,,1,2025-07-22 02:21:35,,,,Yes Original 2600 version plus a newlydeveloped 7800 version even compatible with the original 7800 The screenshot looks equivalent to the Namco NES version,n4gead7,5.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4eqtj6,pohatu771,,2,2025-07-21 20:51:26,,,,Its a themed 2600 The 2600 plays both 2600 and 7800 games The 7800 also exists and is the same hardware in a different case and includes a different controller The game they are showing is a brand new 7800compatible version of the game,n4edck1,1.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4erunm,Pauly_Amorous,,1,2025-07-21 20:56:20,,,,The game they are showing is a brand new 7800compatible version of the game There any videos of this version,n4eqtj6,2.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4g26bi,pohatu771,,1,2025-07-22 01:08:05,,,,I mean it is the 2600 and they say that in the product name Its 40 more than the retail price of the standard version and includes a game that sells for 35 separately Thats not a bad markup for a special edition console I have a working VCS but still bought the standard edition Its more convenient and now I can also play 7800 games,n4f84my,1.0,1m5rj0b

comment,n4g7cfv,bonesnaps,,1,2025-07-22 01:38:27,,,,I remember going to a thrift store with my parents for years and being disappointed time after time that the only vids and consoles they had were Atari 2600s The games did not age well lol I had like 10 games and only 2 of them were decent,,0.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4gaugv,meloman11,,1,2025-07-22 01:58:31,,,,Its undoubtedly a cash grab for nostalgia but I dont mind because it makes sense Give us new carts and more of this and Im all for it Over the past five years Atari has been doing quite well here,,0.0,1m5rj0b
comment,n4gf28f,LucasNYC9,,1,2025-07-22 02:23:36,,,,I still have my original 2600 in the beat up original box I had bought some type of cable like 10 years ago that allowed me to plug it into a modern TV but it might have been composite or component input not HDMI I forget and my box is up in a high closet So I wonder if this and the 2600 1 are actual hardware like the original 70s version or an emulator 2 will the joystick esp the wireless one with this PacMan version have any lag I remember years ago buying one of those Atari joysticks that like 20 games in the joystick and it was super laggy FYI the 2600 came with 1 WIRED controller and a 10in1 game cartridge,,0.0,1m5rj0b
