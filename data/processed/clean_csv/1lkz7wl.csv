comment,n03w4ch,Xylamyla,,5,2025-06-27 18:14:10,,,,Not calling Jobs a magician or anything but the primary goal he strived for in his later years was bringing features and products that consumers didnt even know they wanted Things that we wouldnt think of as cool or useful but when we see it its awesome Obviously we dont know if Apple would have been capable of that now if Jobs was still around spearheading them but honestly I think its unwise to do so No sense in pondering something that will never come to be as Jobs cant be brought back from the grave,mzw5pu1,2.0,1lkz7wl
comment,n061b13,DontDropTheSoap4,,3,2025-06-28 01:10:43,,,,Jobs was cool he did a lot of innovative things during his time at Apple I just seriously doubt hed do anything marginally different with phones than what we already have Theres been plenty of one off fun and innovating phone developments that 3rd party manufacturers have done with android but none of them ever stuck because the average consumer doesnt care for it And theres not really anymore tech we can squeeze into the form factor that makes sense that would drastically change how we use or interact with our devices,n03w4ch,3.0,1lkz7wl

comment,mzx4ywx,DontDropTheSoap4,,16,2025-06-26 17:39:32,,,,Yeah thats about all there was to do They took a computer and put it in your pocket and all they have to do is make it better and faster every year A phone already does everything it needs to do for a computer in its form factor There is quite literally nothing left to innovate in the smartphone sector The phones are already blazing fast have enough storage for anything you need can handle any task or problem you throw at it Thats why all phone manufacturers do nowadays is upgrade the camera and try to plug AI features It can already do everything you need or want from it The next big thing is supposed to be AR tech Apple tried to do it with the Vision Pro but everyone hates it for some reason The tech just isnt there yet and it wont see mass adoption or blow peoples minds until its as small and light as normal glasses but can do everything your phone can And even then thats not really innovation its just a smartphone on your face with AR We have reached the upper limit of what computers and battery tech can do at small form factors and moors law is slowing down We arent going to see tech that wows you and feels like magic for a long time,mzx10kg,3.0,1lkz7wl

comment,mzw5y1k,TpMeNUGGET,,30,2025-06-26 14:56:36,,,,Depends on which one you get I got the fold that folds out into a tablet and my wife got the flip She likes that hers can fit into the small pockets that come on most womens clothes it takes up less space in her purse and hanging up is extremely satisfying I play bass guitar on stage and I unfold my phone and put it into an ipad stand with my chord charts just like a tablet would Its also really satisfying to watch YouTube videos on a larger screen Showing friends pictures of things I can unfold it and zoom easier If you have parents that are farsighted and have to squint at stuff its nice Also my phone is its own phone stand You can also have multiple programs open on different halves of the screen You can be texting friends while watching a video you can be copying some information from an article into a document all kinds of highworkflow type stuff that those realtortype people would probably appreciate Also nintendo DS emulation is awesome Its not for everyone but its a gamechanger for those who utilize it I prefer apple UI to android so Id probably switch back in a few years if apple released a decent foldable,mzw3tl8,3.0,1lkz7wl

comment,mzwiz64,Jess_S13,,5,2025-06-26 15:57:23,,,,Ive been using them since the Fold3 The failure point is valid but it really comes down to the user I broke one by dropping it stupidly from a ladder over tiles but beyond that one never had an issue My Mom on the other hand broke 4 due to the inner screen getting damaged mainly cause she carries it in her purse which is always a mess and she would get crap in the hinge area So yeah if you are rough with phones they are fairly easy to break but otherwise they are fine,mzvv747,1.0,1lkz7wl

comment,mzwvksg,nullCaput,,1,2025-06-26 16:56:52,,,,Im guessing Apple isnt going to go that route The foldable interior will likely be two separate panes of glass that will be engineered such that it appears seamless or close to when opened IMHO Why do I believe this like the dynamic island that theyll approach it different than the current competition If its truly a product destine for market and not vaporware leak sniffing or just prototyping,mzw3rfa,2.0,1lkz7wl
