comment,lwhqubw,_RADIANTSUN_,,32,2024-11-10 23:14:16,,,,At least they made them repairable and the parts available The parts might be interchangeable between phones as well if theyre meant to be replaced or afterwards might make their way into the aftermarket otherwise I guess,lwhn7w9,1.0,1goc09e
comment,lwifn7h,__theoneandonly,,19,2024-11-11 01:40:20,,,,The parts might be interchangeable between phones It will depend All the parts are serialized now If you swap a part from one phone to another the phone will check with Apples servers to see what phone the part came from If it came from a phone that has activation lock or lost mode active then it the phone will refuse to use that part,lwhqubw,2.0,1goc09e
comment,lwjijca,rpkarma,,21,2024-11-11 06:04:22,,,,Which is a good thing in some ways It massively lessens the pressure to steal an iPhone when you cant even strip it for parts As long as apple sells the parts and theyre readily available Im okay with it because phone theft is rampant,lwifn7h,3.0,1goc09e

comment,lwj9r1g,happyjello,,13,2024-11-11 04:50:49,,,,Why would they have schematics available I assume that you would want layout too thats valuable IP for Apple and its not reasonable to expect that,lwhvck9,1.0,1goc09e
comment,lwjl5os,alidan,,8,2024-11-11 06:29:01,,,,schematics on everything you buy use to be common place so you could repair it damn near every single thing in that phone is buyable off the shelf in china is manufactured in china where the schematic will come from within a week of it being made the only thing of value that they dont have is apple custom chips which no one is able to clone much like modern x86 chips by the time you would map out by hand the several billion transistors so you can manufacture your own it will be 5 generations ahead at minimum the cost benefit is not there the only thing schematics help with is board level repair where replacing 1 01 cent resistor costs 50 or iy would cost you 500 from apple and you loose all your data because you didnt pay for their cloud shit,lwj9r1g,2.0,1goc09e
