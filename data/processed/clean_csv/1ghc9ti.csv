comment,luxerm0,MentalAusterity,,430,2024-11-01 21:59:58,,,,Good god it took me way too long to realize they were talking about DIMMs For a sec I thought Sony found an old warehouse full of Memory Stick Duos and sold them to intel,,0.0,1ghc9ti

comment,luy56l6,Keks3000,,9,2024-11-02 00:39:22,,,,Ha me as well Sony Ericsson K750i with MP3s playing from a Memory Stick Duo that I ordered directly from China because they were stupid expensive in Germany That was one hell of a phone man to me it felt like a leap about as big as the jump to my first iPhone,luxm7co,2.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luzkbht,radio-ray,,3,2024-11-02 07:55:16,,,,That was my first phone I was too young to get the memory stick that I needed and I didnt even know how to order stuff online,luy56l6,3.0,1ghc9ti

comment,lv0mj6e,secretrapbattle,,2,2024-11-02 13:54:14,,,,That isnt what happened I have to read the article some year I guess,luxerm0,1.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luwcsjx,thefpspower,,286,2024-11-01 18:35:37,,,,This is not because the consumer hated it it was the OEMs that couldnt upcharge you for memory upgrades like before they even played around with selling the memory parts of it at cost to keep the OEMs happy but seems like it didnt work,,0.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luwnlu4,Angry_Villagers,,99,2024-11-01 19:32:20,,,,The article says that it is partly because they had to outsource a lot of the components from outside companies and even rivals This made it unprofitable It also indicates that their initial intention was never for this to be the way forward for their entire product line but merely an attempt to create the most efficient system possible Who knows what their intent actually was but within the context given in the article all of this makes sense and seems rational,luwcsjx,1.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luwppx2,thefpspower,,44,2024-11-01 19:43:33,,,,Well yeah if they cant sell the memory with a nice margin its not worth it you still have to take the hit for warranty so you cant sell it at cost Intel has tried this before a few years ago and it didnt work they thought it could work now because its way more efficient but the OEMs dont give a crap about effciency they want the margins,luwnlu4,2.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luzltyd,iamnotexactlywhite,,4,2024-11-02 08:13:28,,,,wdym take the hit for warranty,luwppx2,3.0,1ghc9ti
comment,lv0odea,GrynaiTaip,,3,2024-11-02 14:05:36,,,,Some units will be defective and manufacturer will have to replace them for free Its an extra cost that has to be factored into the final price of the device,luzltyd,4.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luwtwvf,CompromisedToolchain,,2,2024-11-01 20:05:41,,,,Intel is big on connectors now It only makes sense to focus on integrating parts and not trying to be the only game in town Their focus is on connectivity at modern transistor manufacturing levels Check out the Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express,luwppx2,3.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luz75b5,HippoLover85,,1,2024-11-02 05:24:43,,,,Imo intel and amd should both go to on package memory and sell their chips to oems with 2 or 3 different memory capacities On package memory is the way forward,luwnlu4,2.0,1ghc9ti
comment,n0bj0ja,The_B_Wolf,,1,2025-06-28 23:05:49,,,,Intel is already doing this no Kind of a straight up admission that Apple was right to do this back in 2020,luz75b5,3.0,1ghc9ti
comment,n0cnslm,HippoLover85,,1,2025-06-29 03:31:42,,,,Lunar lake was Pat said they were canceling on package because oems didnt like it couldnt upsell laptops for memory Will see if they reverse course They should imo Apple is definitely right,n0bj0ja,4.0,1ghc9ti
comment,n0cp6sz,The_B_Wolf,,1,2025-06-29 03:42:07,,,,Apple upsells on memory and storage upgrades Boy do they ever I wonder how Pat will feel when Intel gets canceled because they cant deliver laptops with both performance and battery life,n0cnslm,5.0,1ghc9ti
comment,n0cql12,The_B_Wolf,,1,2025-06-29 03:52:13,,,,Pat said they were canceling on package because oems didnt like it couldnt upsell laptops for memory My grandfather informs me that this is not possible I have been told many times that makers of Windows laptops are saints who will bend over backward to deliver more value for their customers without making an extra dime while Apple is run by criminal vampires and the guy in charge is an accountant who looks like Nosferatu,n0cnslm,5.0,1ghc9ti

comment,lv006iu,sunkenrocks,,7,2024-11-02 10:58:56,,,,Like the Apple III That thing had such bad cooling theyre garunteed to give out using them for a certain amount of time It was so bad the official support line when you called told you to pick your Apple III up about 26in off your desk And drop it hoping the chips slot back into place after the heat popped them out Theres some terrible PCs out there and of course in theory every computer will eventually fail But thats the only one I know of from a decently sized company that has a 100 failure rate lol,lux6ncj,1.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luzklwj,notagoodscientist,,2,2024-11-02 07:58:44,,,,Thats actually what theyve built into CPUs already servers only so far but you buy the hardware which has parts locked out then you pay for a license to unlock them for a limited period of time,lux6ncj,1.0,1ghc9ti

comment,luxh73g,Quiet_Desperation_,,54,2024-11-01 22:14:19,,,,Until we get battery life on par with a MBP I dont care I just want a Linux Laptop on ARM with the battery and performance of a MBP Thats it I can run 16 docker containers and all of my dev software on my M2 Max MBP for 68 hours My last Lenovo Linux machine would last 2 hours max under that same load,,0.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luy1721,TehOwn,,51,2024-11-02 00:14:37,,,,Speaking as someone who used to fix laptops you bought one of the worst makes of garbage budget laptops and compared it to a premium MacBook that costs thousands Reminds me of when people compare their iPhone to Android but their last Android was a 5 year old budgetline second hand phone and their iPhone is the iPhone 25 Super MAX Plus XXL Heres a Dell with a Snapdragon that outlasts a MacBook Pro according to Toms Hardware Honestly though I can see why youd prefer the MacBook,luxh73g,1.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luy30h5,danielv123,,21,2024-11-02 00:25:49,,,,I got expensive Lenovos and dells as well its the same Actually the 200 Lenovo N21 Chromebook I had in 2015 had the 4th best laptop battery life I have ever had second to M1 8gb sold because 8gb is a joke and it was swapping bad with 4 tabs open 16gb M1 eventually got stolen and 18gb m3 pro amazing machine I just wish apple sold ram and storage with less than 1000 margin,luy1721,2.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luyukpz,pizoisoned,,10,2024-11-02 03:34:47,,,,Yeah I like my Apple hardware I just wish I didnt have to make future decisions with todays budget Its beyond stupid that memory has to be determined at purchase and thats it forever,luy30h5,3.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luzq289,Ray-chan81194,,10,2024-11-02 09:05:22,,,,Actually I would buy an apple product if they stop charging RAM and Storage like crazy Paying 200 and you should get 1TB storage not 512GB,luy30h5,3.0,1ghc9ti

comment,lv0li4c,PaddiM8,,2,2024-11-02 13:47:53,,,,Until we get battery life on par with a MBP I dont care But we do have that now The new snapdragon laptops sometimes even outperform the macs Even some new ones with intel chips have similar battery life,luxh73g,1.0,1ghc9ti

comment,lv0nehj,SmittyMcSmitherson,,1,2024-11-02 13:59:38,,,,The reason for memory on package MOP is to support the fastest memory bandwidths which is nearly impossible with memory on board and not supported with CAMM So wins for low cost expand ability but losses for performance,,0.0,1ghc9ti

comment,luwt3y7,None,,-24,2024-11-01 20:01:25,,,,People also want hot swappable batteries in phones but lets be honestthe percentage of people that will actually swap ram instead of buying a new machine isprobably less than 1 They should have just figured out how to make the memory chips how swappable on the SoC itself The they could just make a base model and let users pay for the upgrades before buying Right now how is probably works is they get and SoC with non changeable memory they have to order different SoCs in bulk,,0.0,1ghc9ti
comment,luwwoz5,3Dchaos777,,12,2024-11-01 20:20:31,,,,They should have just figured out Easier said that done buddy lmao Why dont they just figure out how to cure cancer also,luwt3y7,1.0,1ghc9ti
comment,lv5gyin,philocity,,1,2024-11-03 08:52:42,,,,Hey man Im just an ideas guy thats why I make the big bucks The engineers can figure it out and if they cant well fire them and hire a team of interns to do it instead,luwwoz5,2.0,1ghc9ti
comment,lv0bacr,rubseb,,2,2024-11-02 12:37:46,,,,Its not just about upgradability Its about repairability If the RAM can be hotswapped then replacing a faulty stick is a piece of cake either for users or for repair shops If the whole motherboard needs to be replaced thats another story Even if still under warranty the warranty usually doesnt cover a loan device while your own is being repaired so Id much rather have a laptop that can be repaired in minutes if it comes to that as opposed to having to be shipped across the country to some repair facility where after three weeks they decide its not worth the work and they send you a new device instead that you have to configure again from scratch,luwt3y7,1.0,1ghc9ti
