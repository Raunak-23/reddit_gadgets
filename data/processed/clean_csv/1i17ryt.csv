comment,m7c7jxy,JM062696,,3,2025-01-15 21:07:57,,,,My phone alarm is incapable of waking me up I have to use a dedicated alarm clock Also helps to have to walk across the room to turn it off,m77vt5s,1.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7w82nq,karnyboy,,1,2025-01-19 00:27:57,,,,the fact it doesnt have a battery back up is astoundingly annoying If your power were to go out so does your alarm Good thing you can get an old school clock and put batteries in it or you use your phone,m77vt5s,1.0,1i17ryt
comment,m78tk4t,MultiMarcus,,0,2025-01-15 08:51:24,,,,I just use my Apple Watch but like for kids who dont have phones yet its almost a no brainer The price is steep though Its very much intended for kidss to get enjoyment out of waking up instead of dreading it so much which is always something that parents like to see,m77vt5s,1.0,1i17ryt
comment,m79pajc,MagicWishMonkey,,13,2025-01-15 13:36:41,,,,I bought my son one for Christmas and its super disappointing It doesnt have a white noise function or nightlight its just a dumb clock that notices when you get in bed My kid likes it but I dont think its worth 100 you can get better alarm clocks for half as much at target or Amazon,,0.0,1i17ryt

comment,m7g0dye,MagicWishMonkey,,4,2025-01-16 13:10:14,,,,My kid also likes it which I guess is all that matters but 100 seems pretty steep for something that has basically zero features lol,m7en582,2.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7hceb2,makoman115,,0,2025-01-16 17:23:22,,,,But u and op already bought it which means you had the money and your kids like it Whats with the buyers remorse,m7g0dye,3.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7ifxbg,MagicWishMonkey,,1,2025-01-16 20:33:23,,,,For me it was that I expected it to have a night light and sound machinewhite noise function built into it basic stuff that most alarm clocks for kids have Its on me for not doing any research into it and my kid likes it so I dont really care that much,m7hceb2,4.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7w8ccz,karnyboy,,1,2025-01-19 00:29:25,,,,You shouldnt have to research an alarm clock these things should be engineered by mere common sense,m7ifxbg,5.0,1i17ryt

comment,m7mlqtt,None,,2,2025-01-17 13:53:50,,,,I got it for Xmas I like it Its just cool looking and since I dont have any type of clock anywhere its adds one plus I like the Nintendo characters and the updates they keep adding As a clock there are better options with more functions available,m79pajc,1.0,1i17ryt

comment,m7sh8qj,MagicWishMonkey,,1,2025-01-18 12:13:47,,,,Its on me for sure but I assumed that a product made for kids would have the same basic features as all the other alarm clocks for kid,m7rsm0l,2.0,1i17ryt

comment,m7dfqjo,learnedsanity,,7,2025-01-16 00:57:40,,,,Someone says its just a clock that notices when you get into bednear it and you say it does a lot of fun things Can you elaborate,m789em2,1.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7dx0y8,Heady_Mariner,,5,2025-01-16 02:37:15,,,,One thing is that it continues to monitor the person for an hour after the alarm to keep them from returning to bed this is huge with my autistic kid But more importantly it makes it all fun The animations familiar game sound effects and all of their favorite characters make for a more positive experience We have battled for years with our kid in the morning Alarmo has him getting up nearly an hour earlier than we were ever able to do The alarm can be set on specific days without having to remember to reset it like no alarm on weekends but on weekends Maybe these are more common features than I know but the thing has been a real boon to our mornings and anything that makes life easier with autism feels like a miracle,m7dfqjo,2.0,1i17ryt
comment,m7mmsmu,None,,2,2025-01-17 14:00:00,,,,Im an adult dont even use and alarm my body just wakes now on routine but I love the Nintendo sounds and characters too It is overpriced 60 probably would have been good but hopefully they keep updating it for years My biggest disappointment is that the whole circle isnt a screen just a small box within it,m7dx0y8,3.0,1i17ryt
