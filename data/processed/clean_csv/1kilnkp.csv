comment,mrm9vip,Ok-Pie7811,,16,2025-05-10 17:24:51,,,,Massive ad campaign and the worst Idea ever Expensive finicky Im sure easily lootable by anyone who can sprint This is rich kids society shit no one has the money or time to deal with this thing What it runs outta battery and you gotta lug it across town Im sure the thing isnt light plus you might have all your stuff inside so it would be even worse with no comfortable way to carry it against your body without your hands This is some startup by a rich kid who had tons of funding from his friends and family who are also rich and just splurged this ad campaign across every device that ever uses Reddit,mrgh6lh,1.0,1kilnkp
comment,mrhez61,centran,,3,2025-05-09 20:55:05,,,,There was one a while ago that I think was a Segway concept Maybe It was self balancing hoverboardone wheel with a knee control It could also follow you and carry something The idea was to zip around to destination then put your backpack on it and it would slowly follow so you didnt have to carry it inside I believe they dropped the whole self balancing when not on it with AI following and pivoted it to what is now the ninebot A product like that I could see as useful because if you are using it to commute then it would be nice to not have to carry it Think ride is to train have it follow you at station then ride it to work and have it follow you inside in the lobby,mrgh6lh,1.0,1kilnkp
