comment,mgb9d6x,blacksoxing,,598,2025-03-06 11:28:00,,,,Updates of this sort are an annual occurrence as the Advanced Access Content System AACS encryption key regularly expires its a copyrightprotection technology that requires a key to be set on both the disc and the console in order to play new films See you next year for the 20th edition articles and the following for the 20th anniversary ones,,0.0,1j4szct
comment,mgbu4m1,cia91,,113,2025-03-06 13:52:29,,,,So at one point when they stop updating this key the PS3 will not be able to read blu ray disk,mgb9d6x,1.0,1j4szct
comment,mgbuu76,danielv123,,95,2025-03-06 13:56:33,,,,Not new ones Old ones should still play fine,mgbu4m1,2.0,1j4szct
comment,mgc0mry,japzone,,61,2025-03-06 14:28:56,,,,I wonder why the PS3 needs to refresh its keys for this Normal Bluray players can play new discs fine without updating keys Havent hooked my Sony Bluray player up to the Internet since I got it years ago,mgbuu76,3.0,1j4szct
comment,mgc1l62,Izicial,,43,2025-03-06 14:34:09,,,,Cant they put the keys for the updates on the blueray itself for the players I assume the PS3 firmware cant be accessedchanged by blueray movies,mgc0mry,4.0,1j4szct
comment,mgc8p7n,japzone,,40,2025-03-06 15:10:38,,,,I did some digging and for some reason this isnt laid out simply anywhere but it seems youre kinda correct The AACS encryption used by Blurays allows newer Blurays to contain updated key lists but theres also a trick in the system that allows them to Blacklist certain softwarehardware from decrypting the updated list if deemed necessary Probably an attempt to prevent compromised hardwaresoftware from gaining the latest keys The disc isnt modifying the players just providing a list of updated keys that a player may or may not be able to decrypt because of the blacklist trick in the encryption In cases where your hardwaresoftware is blacklisted it must be replaced or updated in order to start decrypting the updated key list again It seems the PS3 either cant read these lists on Blurays though and thus cant update its key database to play new Blurays or the PS3 is considered a constant security risk by AACSmaybe because people can easily mod it these days and so they constantly Blacklist its older firmware in order to force people to download the new firmware The former situation makes me wonder why they cant just add the needed functionality in a firmware update unless its because it requires specific hardware now which the PS3 doesnt have by fact that its so old and one of the first bluray players The latter makes me wonder why they even bother blacklisting the PS3 if they arent preventing modding from taking place anyway and there are likely other sources people have to obtain the keys at this point,mgc1l62,5.0,1j4szct
comment,mgczldc,TheArmoredKitten,,21,2025-03-06 17:19:26,,,,Software cant patch hardware exposures and the PS3 has been oscilloscoped at this point You could effortlessly intercept the key list right out of the buffer in raw binary,mgc8p7n,6.0,1j4szct
comment,mgd0qbi,japzone,,16,2025-03-06 17:24:42,,,,True but its clear that kneecapping the PS3 isnt preventing people from getting the keys anyway Bluray ripping is alive and well,mgczldc,7.0,1j4szct
comment,mge4y2g,TheArmoredKitten,,1,2025-03-06 20:32:28,,,,this boat is so full of holes that its not like pulling that cork is gonna sink us See also why do we even clean when its just gonna get dirty again,mgd0qbi,8.0,1j4szct
comment,mgsk331,mackadoo,,3,2025-03-09 03:08:18,,,,The first generation Bluray players all needed regular internet updates for this The ps3 was seen by many at the time as the most future proof on the presumption Sony would update it longer than other models and they were right For years it was common to read headlines like Panasonic is going to force you to by a new movie player soon,mgc0mry,4.0,1j4szct
comment,mgc1c8l,blacksoxing,,7,2025-03-06 14:32:47,,,,Seemingly so due to the encryption Sony implemented One would say that its a huge blunder when that happens which will now be 20 years from when the PS3 launched but I think I see it as this the PS3 especially the first models were VERY heavy on power Id hope by now hose using a PS3 for watching blurays would have switched to something less consumingbut I also know that Im looking at this from a different lens than someone in a less economical state,mgbu4m1,2.0,1j4szct
comment,mgn2cbr,rayshmayshmay,,1,2025-03-08 05:28:05,,,,And then well get an article about how the PS3 wont be getting any more updates after 50 years,mgbu4m1,2.0,1j4szct

comment,mgf19zp,AeitZean,,17,2025-03-06 23:11:26,,,,I know right youd think theyd have a separate blu ray update that just downloaded the keys if only to save on bandwidth and hosting every time,mgezlcr,3.0,1j4szct

comment,mghjzbh,AeitZean,,6,2025-03-07 10:07:57,,,,Sony is the creator of blu ray and if theyre just updating keys it shouldnt need to be validated if it was only keys Idk it just seems a little overcomplicated imo,mghg1sz,5.0,1j4szct

comment,mggkgw3,shd0w2,,3,2025-03-07 04:45:53,,,,You can keep using it until it dies Or you can preventatively perform the maintenance he is explaining Depends on your methodology for car repairs Fix it before it breaks Or fix it after it breaks Cost up front and time investment will always be more for fixing preventative but long term could outweigh in case your PS3 does fully die But in that case is the cost of another nonfailed one going to be cheaper Depends where you find it,mgewfvd,7.0,1j4szct

comment,mgfcfdq,lmoki,,8,2025-03-07 00:17:19,,,,As an professional in a different industry thats fully dependent on electronics this is nearly 100 true Lead free solder is great as a safety condition during manufacture but is questionable as a longterm environmental decision all those electronics with shorter lifespans end up in landfills requiring new replacements That is not without environmental cost,mgeixy8,5.0,1j4szct

comment,mgcr1l7,SoapyMacNCheese,,3,2025-03-06 16:39:29,,,,Probably a little of both It is to update Bluray disc protections but most other Bluray players dont need these yearly updates as the Bluray discs contain the updates that the players would need My guess is Sony designed the PS3 to not be able to update its protection from a Bluray disc to eliminate it as a potential attack vector for modders as a result Sony needs to keep sending out updates to keep the PS3 working with newer Blurays,mgbb8hw,2.0,1j4szct
