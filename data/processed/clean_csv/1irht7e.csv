comment,mdatbgv,CatWeekends,,-3,2025-02-17 19:32:19,,,,Yep You can find USBC based boards but theyre more expensive because the connectors themselves are more expensive If I was launching a new product Id save the quarterdollar or whatever the materials cost difference is at scale per unit use the older tech to see how it does with consumers and use the cost savings to make a battery software experience,md8uxca,2.0,1irht7e
comment,mdclvvg,relator_fabula,,20,2025-02-18 00:53:24,,,,Except consumers hear micro USB and immediately have a bad reaction The creator is either cheap to save money or the product is datedold USB c has been the standard on small devices for years now Cheap ass rechargeable flashlights have USB C If I see a product thats willing to cheap out on a connector what other components and assembly are they cheaping out on A better software experience Can I really trust someone who is trying to save a 1 per unit on a more robust connector to care about my experience How long will my device last Im not buying something for hundreds of dollars just to encourage the developers that there is a market,mdatbgv,3.0,1irht7e

comment,md8he55,BrotherRoga,,30,2025-02-17 12:03:05,,,,This sounds fun For about 4 hours at most I would definitely rent one for a week or so Unless it costs something like 50 bucks and the games at a max of 20 I cant see this gaining more than a niche fanbase Of course if this is their objective more power to them and the best of luck in their endeavors,,0.0,1irht7e

comment,mdaopjo,Bobbler23,,6,2025-02-17 19:11:12,,,,I was kinda interested but then I was also reading the specs and thought why are they talking 18650 battery which would make it a bit of a chonk to house one of those before the not real capacity claims of 5000mAh too micro USB port erm and full size SD cards it sounds like a parts bin special,,0.0,1irht7e

comment,mdabu6j,BlastFX2,,9,2025-02-17 18:13:08,,,,Manufactured ewaste Textbased adventures are not something youll spend enough time on to warrant a dedicated device You can run them on a phone or a PC If you insist on the eink display get an Android ereader much better hardware that will have a bunch of other uses as well This is essentially an ESP32 dev board and an off the shelf eink module from Waveshare in a 3D printed case thats stupidly thick because they couldnt even be assed to source a flat lithium cell and are instead using an 18650,,0.0,1irht7e
comment,mdbcveo,NeWMH,,1,2025-02-17 21:03:17,,,,If the 18650 is in an easily spot for replacement then it at least achieves a mark for lifetime of the product,mdabu6j,1.0,1irht7e
comment,mdc2rdv,BlastFX2,,1,2025-02-17 23:08:50,,,,Its a bit easier sure but sourcing and replacing a flat cell really isnt an issue either The repairability issues mostly come from devices being hard or even impossible to open without damage,mdbcveo,2.0,1irht7e
comment,mdcnxbg,NeWMH,,1,2025-02-18 01:04:40,,,,If the 18650 is in an easily spot for replacement I meant like in a normal battery compartment,mdc2rdv,3.0,1irht7e
comment,mdd4j8s,BlastFX2,,1,2025-02-18 02:39:13,,,,I get that Im just saying I dont think it matters in terms of reparability since its not something you have to replace ever 510 weeks but rather every 510 years so even if it requires a cell thats not stocked by every hobby shop and a soldering iron its not a big deal because you can order a replacement cell online and then any decent repair shop will swap it for you for 10 max Sure it costs a few bucks more and takes a couple hours of your time but you dont have to spend a decade handling a device twice chonkier than it needed to be which I think is a fair exchange,mdcnxbg,4.0,1irht7e

comment,mdalu2s,Vivian_Stringer_Bell,,2,2025-02-17 18:58:07,,,,They have this already as mobile apps Fabularium Text Fiction No its not eink but something to try Plus just moving a parser of these file formats to something that has an eInk display seems trivial There are a bunch of android based e ink reader Sure they wouldnt be as low powered as an ESP32 but way more likely to have support for the codeOS,,0.0,1irht7e
