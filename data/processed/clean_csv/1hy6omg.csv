comment,m6eyhqo,narwhal_breeder,,125,2025-01-10 15:29:55,,,,Interesting project but I dont really see who is supposed to use this The required commercial components consisting of a basic camera for image acquisition and light emitting diode controlled by a Raspberry Pi for illumination are integrated into the 3D printed microscope with the full design shown for ease of replication Our 3D printed microscope uses a single 3D printed objective lens with a 29x magnification and a numerical aperture of 007 There are dozens of camera microscopes offering 2 orders of magnitude higher optical performance with dirt cheap injection molded lenses that cost less than the camera module alone selected by the writers A 40 student microscope goes to 640x with illumination and is another 20 to add a camera,,0.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6jt213,mymemesnow,,9,2025-01-11 08:41:45,,,,Thats how it begins with time the technique gets optimized and better Now theres 3D printed rocket parts and other mostly small and complex things that would be a lot harder more expensive and take more time to create with any other method Im not saying that microscopes might be one of those cases but 3D printing have some really useful applications,m6f5gn2,2.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6ibzg5,WoolooOfWallStreet,,5,2025-01-11 01:50:51,,,,Probably as a proof of concept of what they do because part of the article that can be read said Gail McConnell and her colleagues previously worked out how to 3Dprint lenses like those used in microscopes which led to the breakthrough This is similar to when Oak Ridge National Laboratory made a 3D printed Shelby Cobra Making a Shelby Cobra wasnt the important part its that an entire car design or prototype can become a full fledged working car in 6 weeks In this case the important part isnt that a microscope was made its that a microscope and its optics can be made in under 3 hours Imagine you have a new custom very niche lens design that you need for whatever reason in a microscope or even a new microscope design itself Using their methods you can make it yourself in under 3 hours instead of possibly trying to call manufacturers for a quote on making the lens you need It might take a week for the lens to finally be made and have the payment go through and then possibly another week for that custom lens to finally get to you Thats 2 weeks Thats 336 hours Now it can be made in 3 hours Thats impressive Thats faster than most shipping options for things that are already made in bulk or in warehouses,m6eyhqo,1.0,1hy6omg
comment,m6hmbal,Alltimesnowman,,6,2025-01-10 23:25:23,,,,One of the primary benefits of this design is that it provides a researchgrade motorised microscope with very nice software for 100 dollars This model is fairly common in research labs in the UK because with a bit of tinkering they can perform similarly to a piece of equipment which is 100x its price They can also be run from batteries and they are compatible with traditional objectives The team are increasingly working to deploy them in lowincome nations and actually making good progress on this I did a PhD on lowcost microscopy for diagnosis in lowresource settings and this is one of the most interesting devices in the field I think,m6eyhqo,1.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6ho2ty,Alltimesnowman,,2,2025-01-10 23:35:19,,,,You can use any objective with the microscopes body there are several publications related to this design This new publication is focused on 3d printing the lenses so the optics have a coarse magnification Really the main benefit of the openflexure microscope design is as a motorised scanning microscope with high precision and easy reproduction But yes many microscopes in research labs will be low magnification If you google inspection microscope you can see what I mean they have low magnification,m6hmtk6,3.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6h07nk,Level_Forger,,1,2025-01-10 21:28:32,,,,I think this is more a step towards printing even more complex items than a microscope theyre expecting people to use a lot,m6eyhqo,1.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6fnwuk,VietOne,,9,2025-01-10 17:34:00,,,,Except theres a big difference Flying wasnt a well developed industry and there wasnt significantly better products at the time Here Microscopes are very cheap Its a well developed industry with a wide range of products Sure this is cool that if you didnt have access to a microscope by any means but when you can buy one that is as good or better for the same cost as youll still need to source many components then why would you print one and rely on the tolerances of 3D printers,m6fjm3g,2.0,1hy6omg
comment,m6g4fd0,rpithrew,,1,2025-01-10 18:52:58,,,,The whole democratizing of sciences starts with projects like this its a balance of low cost open source STL for customizability and reproducibility relative to materials Although its probably cheaper to obtain something prefabbed the fabrication of it is something equally valuable Im surprised it wasnt published to the HardwareX journal,m6fnwuk,3.0,1hy6omg
comment,m6g9h5r,VietOne,,2,2025-01-10 19:17:33,,,,Low cost would be not needing a 3d printer which in itself isnt low cost for something that produces with good tolerances Many of these components being 3D printed could have been sourced from a hardware store which would be more accessible and consistent,m6g4fd0,4.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6g76t2,SsooooOriginal,,-3,2025-01-10 19:06:08,,,,So many of yall spew bullshit so easily just to debase your own statements Democratizing of science Through over engineered and overpriced AND underpowered microscopes Get fucking real you ignorant clown The chemicals are locked down and theres no amount of 3d printing that will reverse that If you dont understand what that means then you have no business talking about democratizing of science,m6g4fd0,4.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6gz10c,SsooooOriginal,,0,2025-01-10 21:22:37,,,,Its a time and money sink to make a less functional item that can be had better and for less relatively easily Shit I can walk to store and buy like 3 or 4 better camera microscopes and be home in less than three hours and have saved money still and then some when you account for the actual printer resin and the actual non printed necessary components and the shipping on top of all that This isnt a boon to remote villages or schools This is bullshit click bait and Im sick of people giving it any time and energy Yall should be making custom grips for controllers and mice and shit or epic miniatures or duplicating autoparts that are hard to source,m6gxejx,6.0,1hy6omg

comment,m6jdp4h,JaggedMetalOs,,1,2025-01-11 06:06:42,,,,According to the full paper the process of printing the lenses is quite involved requiring a high quality resin printer and a vacuum chamber its probably a step above hobby grade 3D printing,m6g9d36,1.0,1hy6omg
