comment,mwcoz7d,Opetyr,,9,2025-06-06 17:35:47,,,,Nope Helldivers 2 doesnt record audio chat so you cannot report for offensive behavior Only if they type it Maybe changed since then but this and the inability to report cheaters on PC were just incompetent,mwbr4mu,1.0,1l4uddh
comment,mwceswa,KowardlyMan,,12,2025-06-06 16:47:35,,,,Indeed If the chat is not locally saved or online saved then you could not view it at all its that simple In fact its pretty nice that its locally saved and only sent by you when you report Thats good for privacy and unusual these days,mwbr4mu,1.0,1l4uddh

comment,mwbtath,B19F00T,,1,2025-06-06 15:04:05,,,,Yeah you dont really have privacy on the internet As long as the recordings arent accessible manually and are only stored temporarily to allow for reporting seems fine to me Im sure some bad actors could find a way to access them tho Having more ways to protect kids seems like a good thing to me,mwbr4mu,1.0,1l4uddh
