comment,lz8aro6,relator_fabula,,1,2024-11-27 12:04:20,,,,There are plenty of cheapish handhelds that can run emulators depending on what consoles youre looking to emulate There will never be some magical allpowerful handheld that can emulate consoles from the past 10 years or less Like youre not emulating a PS4 or a Switch on an inexpensive handheld but you can get one that will play along the lines of the PS2 and gamecube for under 150,lz5qw6z,5.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lywtnpq,Jon_TWR,,120,2024-11-25 14:42:25,,,,Unfortunately its getting harder and harder for the Steam Deck to play the newest PS5 games It can still do it but its getting rough But a Steam Deck 2 will probably be out either around the same time as this or not long after,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyx7tl5,sgeep,,6,2024-11-25 16:00:47,,,,Interesting My experience has kinda been the opposite Days Gone Tsushima and Ragnarok have actually been some of the most impressive Steam Deck ports Ive seen for similar games,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyy3hui,EVMad,,3,2024-11-25 18:43:46,,,,Same and even games that are unsupported have performed well for the most part The community is great with help for what version of proton to use and patches launcher tweaks etc Currently switching between my desktop and Steamdeck playing Guardians of the Galaxy and the Steamdeck handles it pretty well although there are some game breaking bugs where the frame rate drops to nothing and I have to reboot so thats likely why the game is marked as unsupported Outside of that though its smooth and graphically damn good so once they figure out where the issue is then all good,lyx7tl5,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz17lxx,RealisLit,,2,2024-11-26 05:40:01,,,,I mean those are ps4 games,lyx7tl5,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz0w1kd,rolfraikou,,3,2024-11-26 04:10:33,,,,Arent most new PC ports of PS5 games using better graphics than the native PS5 versions anyway So it makes sense Essentially the Steamdeck can play games fairly well from when it came out I think you are right by the time the Steam Deck 2 comes out it will probably be on par with if not slightly better than the Sony handheld Handhelds will always be a bit behind It makes sense Im honestly shocked how close to handling modern games they are on systems like the Steamdeck and Steamdeck OLED Comparing it to just how far from a console experience the PSP and PSVita were when they came out the gap is slightly smaller I would say for modern consoles compared to Steamdeck,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz0z3mr,Jon_TWR,,5,2024-11-26 04:32:20,,,,I agree The Steamdeck is honestly very impressive even now I had a PS4 Pro when it came out and a PS5 now and the Steam Deck can get higher framerates than the PS4 Pro but not at the resolutions the PS4 Pro is capable of Basically the CPU is faster than the PS4s and the GPU is weaker than the PS4s Really an impressive handheld,lz0w1kd,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz164pd,EVMad,,1,2024-11-26 05:27:41,,,,I only got my Steamdeck a few weeks back and while Im a Linux expert so Im happy to tinker Im very impressed with the basic out of the box performance Its definitely last gen performance but thats still no bad thing because I bought into the hype and got an Xbox Series X only to find it barely improved over my One X and PS4 Pro and for that reason I decided to pass on the PS5 and especially the PS5 Pro Getting streaming running from my consoles as well as my desktop PC also allows me to play pretty much anything as does Emudeck Its a little powerhouse and superbly flexible It basically saved gaming for me,lz0z3mr,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxwfhi,TONKAHANAH,,4,2024-11-25 18:07:15,,,,I wouldnt hold my breath on a steam deck 2 any time soon You cant lump valve into the same group as Sony and Microsoft they dont operate with the same objectives or time lines if they did wed have half life 3 by now It would be nice but Im still amazed the first steam deck even happened at all and knowing valve time I just dont see a new one any time soon But Ive been plenty wrong before,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxxdkf,Jon_TWR,,1,2024-11-25 18:12:06,,,,Id expect the Steam Deck 2 to be announced in 23 yearsaround the same time Id expect this to come out if it is going to come out I could be wrong and maybe itll be 5 more yearswere all just guessing,lyxwfhi,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyy0ln5,TONKAHANAH,,2,2024-11-25 18:28:46,,,,Thing is Im not going to even expect valve to do a steam deck 2 until they announce it Valve is famous for making new things and then just not doing them any more Granted the steam deck is the first highly successful nongame project theyve done since steam its self so Id say chances are better than past projects but the track record stands Like were still waiting on another vr head set supposedly thats coming but nothing yet They said steam OS 3 was gonna come to desktops 4 years ago when the deck released and that hadnt happened yet Half life 2 saw like 3 different almost completed builds that got scrapped before restarting and half life 2ep3 got scrapped They drop stuff all the time and take 3x longer to do stuff than any one else They dont have any track record of releasing consecutive consoles on any kind of regular time like and they dont operate with the intent to compete against the other console manufacturers so trying to suggest a release lineup to compete is pointless Im not going to assume a deck 2 is even happening at all until it does much less try to guess a time window If steam deck 2 does happen then Ill make assumption on a steam deck 3 until then everything Ive seen from valve tells me not to get my hopes up until they actually announce something,lyxxdkf,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyyaahj,Jon_TWR,,0,2024-11-25 19:19:05,,,,Valve said theyre waiting on the Steam Deck 2 until theres been a generational improvement in performance So its not guaranteed but Ill bet they will release one within the next 5 years,lyy0ln5,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyyn9tc,TONKAHANAH,,2,2024-11-25 20:26:07,,,,Valve says a lot of things again still waiting on Steam OS 3 iso,lyyaahj,6.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lyzp9lx,Jon_TWR,,1,2024-11-25 23:50:08,,,,It is true Some PS5 exclusives that have come to PC have drops below 30 FPS on the Steam Deck Its not BS its just games requiring more powerful hardware than the Steam Deck,lyzkjbo,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxiktv,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,-1,2024-11-25 16:56:44,,,,What is it with the PC crowd and its If its not 60fps and ultra its shit 720p medium or low is still a great experience should be comparing to what switch can do anyway Anyone thinking the experience is going to be different with a Sony version is living in a fantasy,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxty52,DolphinFlavorDorito,,6,2024-11-25 17:54:40,,,,Yeah but the Deck struggles with Baldurs Gate 3 even AT 720 or 800 given the aspect ratio often chugging in the 20fps range Im perfectly fine with 720p30 on a handheld but it should be pretty much locked there,lyxiktv,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxr0z7,None,,2,2024-11-25 17:39:57,,,,If youre using the Switch as a visual benchmark in 2024 then well never progress,lyxiktv,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyy2leo,Revenge_of_the_User,,5,2024-11-25 18:39:07,,,,My switch gets occasional frame freezes with Stardew Valley in 16 its basically just what a souped up gamecompatible smartphone could do in 2017 Add in the joystick issues and the Required subscription for basic online functionsSwitch belongs nowhere in quality discussions,lyxr0z7,4.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lz5ujdu,blackrock55,,0,2024-11-27 00:01:59,,,,Unless theres a major generation leap in technology valve arent going to put out steam deck 2 I know the word was similar to that Cant remember specifics lol,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz60e0b,Jon_TWR,,1,2024-11-27 00:38:23,,,,There will be a generational leap in technologyitll just take a few years lol,lz5ujdu,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz62w71,blackrock55,,1,2024-11-27 00:53:57,,,,Oh yeah definitely Im denying it wont happen of course Its just valve arent going after lots of improvements and revisions of the deck Thats what Im trying to get at Theyre just releasing a good product until something genuinely worth it comes along,lz60e0b,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz67shr,Jon_TWR,,2,2024-11-27 01:24:32,,,,Sure but the rumored PS5P or PPS5 or PSP5 or whatever you want to call this portable device that will be able to play PS5 games wont be out for a few years either Thats why I made the guess that the Steam Deck 2 will probably be out around the same time as this or shortly after,lz62w71,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyy86ts,kurotech,,-5,2024-11-25 19:07:49,,,,But steam deck is still a full system this Sony crap is just an end point for a streaming server its a screen and controller with wireless nothing more you still need the hardware side to play the game weither this will be like stadia or the PlayStation portal is what matters one you need a PlayStation one you need a constant high speed internet connection,lywtnpq,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyyer4r,Jon_TWR,,0,2024-11-25 19:42:06,,,,Did you not even read the headline This would be a portable device that plays PS5 games A PS5P if you will Not the Playstation Portal,lyy86ts,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyzm2oo,Critical_Impact,,0,2024-11-25 23:31:14,,,,I dont think the hardware exists for that to actually happen If it did itd either be the size of a laptop or have 2 minutes of battery Theres a reason that valve havent made a Steam Deck 2 yet the technology to make something better doesnt exist,lyyer4r,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz2u23d,dakoellis,,1,2024-11-26 14:27:10,,,,other companies have made something better at least from a hardware standpoint Valve havent made a Steam Deck 2 because its a console not a phone If you release a new version every year or 2 with upgraded hardware people wont be happy with you Valve have an image of consumer first and I dont see them trying to throw that away anytime soon,lyzm2oo,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxqlr8,p_giguere1,,2,2024-11-25 17:37:50,,,,Should we expect the Sony handheld to have better optimization ie better performance for equivalent specs I think its generally accepted that consoles have better performance relative to specs compared to a Windows PC thanks to a mix of game optimization running a lighter OS and having hardware designed with precise software in mind Not sure how true that holds for the Steam Deck though which is somewhere in between a console and a traditional PC,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyzmi67,Critical_Impact,,2,2024-11-25 23:33:47,,,,That used to be true but as far as I can tell the multiplatform releases and heavy use of the unreal engine means that any singleplatform optimizations are giving far lower returns On top of that we used to expect companies to optimize for consoles and handhelds but they seem to be happy pushing games out in suboptimal states now,lyxqlr8,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz0guql,p_giguere1,,2,2024-11-26 02:33:23,,,,I see That seems to match my experience as well I used to be blown away by the Xbox 360PS3 graphics especially knowing specs were like 256MB RAM256MB VRAM Nowadays all Im asking is for Silent Hill 2 UE5 to run properly on PS5 and PS5 Pro and that seems to be a challenge for devs,lyzmi67,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxxvzw,gameonlockking,,2,2024-11-25 18:14:44,,,,That tech is from 2018 its gonna be 2025 quickly Get a rog ally or something newer if you go that route,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyx7w6q,Bootychomper23,,1,2024-11-25 16:01:10,,,,Yup especially if this handheld has to have dedicated ports made Whereas steam deck just lets you attempt to play whatever After they completely fucked over Vita unless this handheld can access ps4ps5 games without devs needing to step in and port them then Im not optimistic about support,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxzbf4,antara33,,0,2024-11-25 18:22:10,,,,As someone that owns a stupidly high end pc Im super willing to get a handheld that actually allows me to stream from steam to it so I can play from my bed LMAO Steam deck is expensive for this endevour but maybe there are good android based alternatives,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lz19ioz,Pidder_Paddy,,1,2024-11-26 05:56:26,,,,I also have a descent gaming rig and use moonlight to stream to my steam deck over wifi No noticeable latency especially with a single player campaign I do recommend steam deck and you can pick them up fairly cheap used at GameStop but if you want to try game streaming first the moonlight app works on phones and tablets,lyxzbf4,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxou4y,Jackal239,,-5,2024-11-25 17:28:49,,,,The crazy part is Sony and Microsoft are only doing this because of how successful the Steam Deck was,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxe1p8,DARR3Nv2,,-21,2024-11-25 16:33:34,,,,Laptops are also portable I question the intelligence of anyone who bought a handheld pc lol,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxgste,takiwasabi,,10,2024-11-25 16:47:43,,,,Your intelligence cannot comprehend why a handheld size device that doesnt require a table keyboard and mouse is more portable than an entire laptop Yikes,lyxe1p8,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxgwnf,DARR3Nv2,,-18,2024-11-25 16:48:17,,,,I understand the concept But to be convinced to buy it Dumb,lyxgste,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxj3ai,NecroCannon,,3,2024-11-25 16:59:21,,,,The Steam deck is probably the only one truly worth it since its sold at a loss like consoles The thing is its way better for portable gaming with a controller than a laptop I cant play on a laptop lying down as easily cant carry the laptop and things to game on easily and the only other cheap option A Nintendo Switch that can barely handle modern titles People with your mentality are dumb not the ones buying them imo,lyxgwnf,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxn63t,DARR3Nv2,,-10,2024-11-25 17:20:23,,,,Bruh the only argument Ive heard is I can play it laying down Aside from the people commenting with physical disabilities Yall bought an inferior piece of tech so you could be lazier than you already were Congrats lol,lyxj3ai,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyzo6lt,NecroCannon,,2,2024-11-25 23:43:44,,,,So not lugging around a gaming laptop power cable mousecontroller which takes way more space than just a handheld and a cable is lazy Why even use a gaming laptop then By your logic itd be more efficient to build a sffpc and buy a portable monitor to just plug and play wherever because gaming laptops are more expensive than PCs for what you get,lyxn63t,6.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyzpsff,DARR3Nv2,,-1,2024-11-25 23:53:13,,,,Uhhh yeah Super lazy Laptop will always be better Your argument is You have to make minimal extra effort What would you call that,lyzo6lt,7.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxkknw,takiwasabi,,3,2024-11-25 17:07:03,,,,Just because people have different use cases you think theyre dumb I think its more dumb that you cant comprehend that convenience and portability is a desirable trait Not everyone likes lugging around laptops A steam deck fits in a small bag or a purse You can take it out while on public transit,lyxgwnf,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxkb43,Pingy_Junk,,1,2024-11-25 17:05:38,,,,Laptops in general arent great at running a lot of the games I want and I hate using a computer with a trackpad Cant exactly use a mouse while Im lying down Steam deck has been a godsend for the days when Im physically too ill to sit up at a desk Also a steam deck plays completely differently from a laptop a handheld console feels very different from playing on a pc,lyxe1p8,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyy7b61,kurotech,,-2,2024-11-25 19:03:19,,,,You arent even running the games on this thing its a controller and screen its like the stadia service from Google so youre just streaming the game to the handheld anyway,lywiqv3,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyw200c,wicktus,,103,2024-11-25 11:18:29,,,,legit curious to see it and interested by it Psp was awesome psvita too but but not managed well Regarding the headline players are too attached to nintendos franchisesand as long as each one of your game costs hundreds of millions and nintendo can release much cheaper games that sell much more theres no competition Buttheres no rivalry to begin with it has always been different markets and complementary with the switch Its rare to see someone either picking up a switch OR a ps5pc it rather an AND it exists but rare imho,,0.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lywklhi,R3dbeardLFC,,51,2024-11-25 13:45:36,,,,I used to work for Sony and on the PS Vita production games not consoles It took no time at all for them to completely stop giving a fuck about the vita They are not good at promotingmarketing and keeping up interest They seemed to bail the very second sales werent incredible Also I play both PS5 and switch The ability for the switch to sync up to a tv helps a lot there though,lyw200c,1.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lyyfnbg,DaoFerret,,-1,2024-11-25 19:46:41,,,,More and more reason why I like consoles for gaming vs a gaming PC Less personal time on maintenance more on playing the game when I can find the time to play,lyw9q2y,3.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lywn6fi,None,,5,2024-11-25 14:02:15,,,,Handheld enthusiast here Id buy it But I am worried about battery life I hope it will be a native console and not a streaming tablet PS portal which retails for the same price as a real console Switch lite,lyw200c,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lywteby,Jon_TWR,,2,2024-11-25 14:40:50,,,,After owning a Steam Deck I believe Sony could make something that could play PS5 games at 800p1080p at 3060 FPS with technology that exists right now with ok battery life like 12 hours for high end games It would probably cost as much as a PS5 or PS5 pro But itd probably sell better than PSVR especially if they also sold a dock so you could hook it up to your TV even if it didnt have quite the same performance as the base PS5,lywn6fi,2.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lywu8dl,None,,4,2024-11-25 14:45:47,,,,Yikes 1 hour for high end games is not enough for me Id personally would rather have a portable PS4 console with a good batter life over a portable PS5 with a shitty battery life This is what kept me from buying steam deck until OLED came out which still has a mediocre battery but its more tolerable than it previously was Handheld consoles important aspect isnt specs its the longevity There is no point in a portable PS5 if I can only play the games for 1 hour or use an AC adapter Like we already had Atari Lynx and Sega GameGear which had this issue and thats why Gameboy had outsold both despite being a marginally weaker console,lywteby,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyx9zxo,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-25 16:12:18,,,,Guarantee put money on this it will have 36 hour battery life in general barely 3 or slightly under for intensive stuff,lywu8dl,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxacm2,None,,2,2024-11-25 16:14:10,,,,It better be I love handhelds but I hate the recent trend of making super powerful handheld at the expense of size and battery life Switch might be underpowered but atleast it has good battery life and is comfortable to move around,lyx9zxo,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxs8a1,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-25 17:46:00,,,,36 hours to me is SHORT to be clear To me that would be the bare minimum before its just annoyingly too low Nintendo actually makes 6 hour capable handhelds that you dont have to charge every single session feel like I have to be close to an outlet or carry a powerbank always,lyxacm2,6.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxw1zh,None,,1,2024-11-25 18:05:18,,,,Yeah but its better than 12 hours most Pc handhelds manufacturers think is okay Like Steam Deck Oled battery is still weak but its way better than its competition and you can play Fallout 4 for 5 hours with 30 fps,lyxs8a1,7.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyyrupg,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-25 20:49:27,,,,Yeah to me that is unacceptably low battery life like theres not even any point in having a handheld portable at that point might as well just get a laptop tbh,lyxw1zh,8.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyytzii,None,,1,2024-11-25 21:00:12,,,,Yeah Hence why I think 99 of all Pc handhelds are trash Like they are good but battery life is just too bad for them to be good products Steam Deck saves the day again Yet another reason why I love mine I hope Valve releases Steam Decks Steam OS which in term will make Linux more popular,lyyrupg,9.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxppsl,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2024-11-25 17:33:18,,,,Its going to be basically a steam deck in a Sony branded box slightly newer tech but not a major change living in a dream world if you think its going to be different,lyx9zxo,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxsl3h,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-25 17:47:48,,,,Yes but they can accomplish 36 hours which is extremely short still IMO but its the bare minimum if you ask me in that package They can make whatever cuts they need to the fidelity to achieve that,lyxppsl,6.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxpi29,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2024-11-25 17:32:12,,,,Its going to be the same thing as the steam deck and its clones maybe slightly updated but its still going to have the same issues,lywu8dl,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyx7d0g,BIGSTANKDICKDADDY,,1,2024-11-25 15:58:21,,,,My question is why they would pivot to an 800 device that plays PS5 games at lower quality settings lower resolution lower framerates for 12 hours when when they already have a 200 accessory for a 400 console that lets you play PS5 games on a handheld with full quality settings at 1080p60 for 79 hours AFAIK the vast majority of Steam Deck owners play primarily or exclusively at home All of this extra cost and engineering effort would be to to unlock portable play that most customers dont even want or use Im struggling to see the value proposition here,lywteby,3.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyxb9qn,_RADIANTSUN_,,5,2024-11-25 16:19:02,,,,Because the Portal requires already owning a PS5 It doesnt increase the PS5 install base to have the Portal its an additional accessory for someone who already has a PS5 as well A PS5P would be a separate device capable of playing PS5 games and catering to the portablehandheld market to add to the PS5 platform install base,lyx7d0g,4.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyz2zhk,BIGSTANKDICKDADDY,,1,2024-11-25 21:46:10,,,,What Im saying is that Sony can sell their current products to this hypothetical buyer today at a lower price If theres a customer out there who loves what Sony has to offer but really only wants to buy in if they can switch between portable and docked theres a 600 bundle with the PS5 Portal that satisfies that customer The PS5P would exist solely to cater to the customer who fits the above criteria and also wants to take their handheld out of the house on a regular basis where remote streaming would not be a viable option Based on both Switch and Steam Deck user behavior Im not convinced that latter demographic is meaningful in size or at least meaningful enough to make a dent on sales where the former group wouldnt The Portal already captures the majority of the handheld demographic the PS5P just grows it slightly more to cover that final sliver,lyxb9qn,5.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyzk2o0,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-25 23:19:32,,,,I think the price would be the key point and I doubt they would ever launch at 800 I would expect a 300500 handheld out of Sony for a PS5P Remember that they make INSANELY huge purchasing for consoles and get pretty much the best bulk pricing available,lyz2zhk,6.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lyx86jx,NobodyKnowsYourName2,,0,2024-11-25 16:02:41,,,,Ps5 pro pricing for a handheld Not realistic I am more than happy using a PS4 Controller with a 5 Clamshell that holds my S23 to play mobile games If I want to game AAA games I can book Geforce Now or just game a little via emulators I get it that the steam deck is a nice device but for my casual gaming this setup seems more than enough To shell out 800 for a mobile device is not going to attract a big enough market If I was Sony I would release a powerful phone gaming combo that can run PS5 games with an attachable gamepad I think the appeal of having a very powerful phone gaming combination unit would be awesome Same for Nintendo,lywteby,3.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lyyj7ov,None,,2,2024-11-25 20:05:12,,,,Yeah but we like me I already have a huge library on my PlayStation making a handheld that works this way is basically a device that I already have games for As long as you log in with your psn you should be able to download games you own So than who wont buy such They are missing the point steamdeck was great because everyone already had games they own on the steam store Its no brainer It means I wont have re buy anything And I have most of my games are digital I have a physical collection but ps5 games I dont have any physical ps5 game yet Most games I have on ps4 have a ps5 upgrade so I havent bought any ps5 game and most ps5 games disc base needs internet connection so it never made sense The new average consumer may have to pick But users who already have such would more likely buy it first,lyxwkjc,1.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lz1f112,PrincessKirstyn,,1,2024-11-26 06:47:17,,,,I would be down When the portal was announced I originally thought it was a waste and like why would you want it But having a baby now and more than one console the portal makes it a lot easier for my husband and I both to enjoy games So idk worth I guess What wasnt worth is the steam link we have because it barely functions But thats what we get for buying one when they were discontinuing it,,0.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lz1vhmq,dzone25,,1,2024-11-26 09:43:46,,,,Competition is rarely a negative I know Reddit is filled with people whod just buy a Steamdeck instead as would I but its not a bad thing if all these brands compete for our money Customers win in this scenario,,0.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lz2bv22,SmokesLetsGoBois,,1,2024-11-26 12:24:31,,,,As someone who bought a steam deck I can honestly say mobile gaming is not worth it if game developers dont want to support it Online only content ruins the experience and makes gaming impossible without an Internet connection I havent touched my steam deck in months and my job allows me a lot of free time to play games at work I can count on my hand the number of times I actually managed to pick up a game and play it without issues while at work with no reliable connection,,0.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lyw40jf,Atilim87,,-13,2024-11-25 11:38:05,,,,If this product in its early development and will run ps5 games then honestly thats not good enough By the time this launches ps6 will probably be on the horizon or available and those games need to be available in any future handheld,,0.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lywbaca,Teshuko,,5,2024-11-25 12:40:05,,,,Does it really matter The steam deck exists and runs games perfectly fine The switch is 8 years and still kicking Calling the ps4 old gen felt strange for a long ass time into the ps5s lifespan And most of the graphical advancements are getting more and more subtle so there could be corners to cut without affecting the product too much if it cant run games well,lyw40jf,1.0,1gzg5rg
comment,lywccal,eist5579,,2,2024-11-25 12:48:07,,,,Seeing as the majority of games Ive been playing on my ps5 are actually ps4 games I think they could release it at the spec of ps5 and wed be fine through the ps6 era Look at the steam deck they get away with a bit more because they lower the resolution for the smaller screen So at ps5 power it could probably irk out a bit more performance w lower quality settings and all,lyw40jf,1.0,1gzg5rg

comment,lyw9tvu,Snipedzoi,,-1,2024-11-25 12:28:28,,,,This is appropriate Handhelds with good battery life need to be weak to maintain battery life so PS5 power is still a gen ahead over what the switch 2 will be,lyw40jf,1.0,1gzg5rg
