comment,meau5lq,notjordansime,,2,2025-02-23 06:13:46,,,,so whats the wage for that voluntary paid labor According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons inmates earn between 1240 cents per hour for these jobs At that rate it would take you 18 hours of labor to buy a single Big Mac from McDonalds no fries or drink just the sandwich AKA slave wages More info about penal labor in the US Under the 13th amendment to the US constitution slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited except as punishment for a crime The person you replied to made that comparison because legally it quite literally is actual slavery,me28thc,3.0,1isr8cr
comment,mebxwmj,Blunttack,,-1,2025-02-23 12:30:27,,,,It doesnt matter what the wage is They VOLUNTEER Read that again A lot of that prison workforce is made up of people with no skills They are doing whatever job to get life skill for when they get out And they get to buy prison candy or some other little trinket You really think some crack head or murderer should be what making 40K so get out with a million dollars as they get free room and board for decades Learn what volunteering is and what interns are Then learn want slavery was come back and tell me they are comparable Wake up Its actually incredible how dumb people are,meau5lq,4.0,1isr8cr
comment,mec11e0,notjordansime,,2,2025-02-23 12:54:45,,,,First off thats wrong Its not voluntary Go educate yourself on the 13th amendment Its forced labor And even if what you said is true yeah brb lemme just go volunteer on the labor intensive assembly line or on a farm my guy Ive worked in agriculture and I volunteer in kitchens Believe me Im well acquainted with a hard days work shitty pay and the concept of volunteering Theres a difference between giving back to society by volunteering vs working manual laborfactory jobs I still think they should be paid minimum wage or even 75 of it at the very least Thats 15kyr before taxes assuming theyre working 40 hours 52 weeks a year They aint making millions even if theyre not paying rent Not just candies and shit either a lot of the stuff they buy is just for basic hygiene because the generic free stuff they have is borderline unusable That free board is a couple inch thick piece of foam covered in plastic draped across a cold metal surface You have no privacy for months or years on end But yeah free cot n 3 hots or whatever its worse than hospital food Its legally defined as permitted slavery under the 13th amendment to the constitution And no its not voluntary unless youre awaiting trial Look at the link I posted Youre forced to work for less than a dollar an hour From the previous link I posted However convicted criminals who are medically able to work are typically required to do so in roles such as food service warehouse work plumbing painting or as inmate orderlies It literally is slavery I dont know how else I can spell it out for you,mebxwmj,5.0,1isr8cr

comment,mdmvfi1,Jaerba,,2,2025-02-19 16:14:57,,,,True The domestic product will have room to increase its price despite being worse quality and the imported product will simply cost a lot more,mdmtjz8,3.0,1isr8cr
comment,mdky5i9,earthman34,,7,2025-02-19 08:07:38,,,,Theres multiple levels of irony Element was going to close their plant after tariffs were extended to all electronics component imports but they whined and got an extension This is proof that tariffs are a killer for American manufacturers that rely on imported components which they all do Theyre also under investigation for actually lying about the level of American content in their products And youre right they sell an inferior product that competes poorly against imported products with better specifications I would personally dispute the idea that a company that simply assembles imported parts is actually a manufacturer theyre really just an assembler,mdkppab,2.0,1isr8cr
