comment,lylg87z,weaselmaster,,12,2024-11-23 16:13:31,,,,Can we stop calling everything AI This was programmed by humans who learned a TON of information about how vocal cords make the sounds they do which muscles tighten and loosen to make different sounds etc Does the program then run and interpret all those different inputs Yes Is that AI No,,0.0,1gxy8cf

comment,lym4gfi,gsmumbo,,7,2024-11-23 18:23:15,,,,Breaking something down to smaller parts doesnt mean the bigger whole doesnt exist It was programmed by humans who learned about vocal cords Thats part of how this AI was made The program then runs and interprets those inputs Thats part of how this AI is run This is like saying he didnt run a lap He got out of his car walked slowly all the way to the track set his stuff down walked to the starting line then he just walked faster in an oval This is not AGI but it is AI,lylg87z,1.0,1gxy8cf
comment,lyorpzj,weaselmaster,,-3,2024-11-24 03:49:35,,,,If I write a program to look at data coming in from data sensor A vocal muscles say and compare it to data coming in from another sensor B vocal output say and then I write another program to use the correlations defined by the first program to guess which patterns of data source A means in the spoken language are we calling that AI now In my day thats called a computer program informed by a dynamic data source but I Wrote The Damn Thing its not AI,lym4gfi,2.0,1gxy8cf
comment,lylntch,Ldawsonm,,1,2024-11-23 16:54:48,,,,Well none of what youre saying goes against something being AIassisted If the technology uses AI then it uses AI It doesnt discount the fact that it required a lot of research and development by humans it just means the devices utilizes AI,lylg87z,1.0,1gxy8cf
