comment,mxzclwc,OneBigBug,,-9,2025-06-15 22:08:15,,,,I mean dont get me wrong Im happy to talk up how cool prosthetics are to an 8 year old who is worried about being different The technology we have now is very coolas assistive devices for people with disabilities But were not exactly signing up people to the Justice League because they have a regular heart rhythm are we,mxxromp,2.0,1lc07oj
comment,mxzertq,AreEUHappyNow,,8,2025-06-15 22:20:52,,,,Well thats just because your definition of cyborg appears to conflated with superhero A cyborg is a biological animal with embedded cybernetic technology Prosthetic limbs pacemakers cochlear implanta etc are all cybernetic Theres nothing to say they cant be better than the biological default theres also nothing to say they cant be worse,mxzclwc,3.0,1lc07oj
comment,mxzngql,OneBigBug,,1,2025-06-15 23:11:59,,,,I mean its not just the superhero I was just being pithy Its basically every example of anything ever being called a cyborg Resistance isnt futile because the enemy can talk despite having ALS either It is extremely commonly used to mean enhanced In fact its part of the origin of the term For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously we propose the term Cyborg So if both the originators of the term use it to mean an extension of existing ability rather than an assistive device for those with disability and also thats almost universally how its used in all other circumstances thenI think there is something to say that it cant be worse,mxzertq,4.0,1lc07oj
comment,mxxs0nb,Themasterofcomedy209,,17,2025-06-15 17:13:07,,,,The definition is just someone with artificial parts replacing some of their organic ones so like grandma wearing dentures is technically a cyborg,mxxcwi1,1.0,1lc07oj
