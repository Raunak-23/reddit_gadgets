comment,lwmv0ch,danielv123,,32,2024-11-11 20:12:44,,,,Even then the review text for the 9800x3d admits its far superior to Intels offering telling you to go for a low end chip instead yet when you compare it to the 285k the Intel chip somehow shows as faster on everything but memory latency In my experience the numbers have been very reliable in the past and the flavour text has always been good fun but now I am not so sure anymore How did they get those results,lwm1xsr,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwn5xov,stellvia2016,,12,2024-11-11 21:08:21,,,,Toms Hardware and Anandtech both maintained yearly benchmarks for CPUs and GPUs They were the gold standard afaik for written format benchmarks Otherwise there are a number channels that offer benchmark videos on Youtube but that would be more for the last 710 years instead of 1015 UserBenchmark was popular because they shilled the SEO game as hard as they could to be put at the top of results thats all Their numbers were always rather dubious even early on because IPC was what really matters And now even IPC is only part of the picture due to autooverclocking and thermal thresholds,lwlr3ps,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwnpbu6,TooStrangeForWeird,,2,2024-11-11 22:49:42,,,,Yup If you want something a little more comprehensive you can use CPU monkey Scroll down quite a bit and theres quite a few benchmarks to compare Problem is that theyre often missing benchmarks for some processors These are popular and old enough that theyre filled in pretty well but newer processors and lowmidrange processors sometimes dont get filled in So I still end up using CPU benchmark for quick comparisons,lwmtraf,6.0,1govhyh

comment,lwmvcv5,Impossible_Angle752,,1,2024-11-11 20:14:30,,,,Honestly just look up the CPU on YouTube and watch a launch review for whatever CPU from a channel with 1 million subscribers Preferably more Even if youre just looking at a launch review for an older CPU youll get a decent representation of where it stood at that point,lwlr3ps,2.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmvzf5,_EleGiggle_,,2,2024-11-11 20:17:42,,,,Im usually not looking up any CPU model but searching for a replacement for my existing one I want the best CPU for the money I spend and dont care much about Intel or AMD So if a site includes the current availabilities and uses uptodate prices its even better Especially if it considers the benchmark points per so Im getting the most value for my money It should also fit my GPU so Im not accidentally buying a combo where either one does barely any work If I search my current CPU model and replacement Im getting nothing recent because its too old what good are GPU benchmarks if 90 were sold out,lwmvcv5,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwngck4,stellvia2016,,2,2024-11-11 22:01:25,,,,Most of the YouTube reviews include things like that They show where they stand vs the current gen and usually 12 gens before that Original MSRP vs current prices etc Gamers Nexus even includes charts for stuff like per FPS increase in power vs perf for specific games or usecases etc Plenty of other channels like Jayz Twocents Linus Techtips etc,lwmvzf5,4.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnivym,_EleGiggle_,,1,2024-11-11 22:14:50,,,,If only I were just 1 or 2 gens behind They probably dont produce the new model anymore when Im looking for a new CPU Edit I think I remember my CPU Its a Ryzen 5 2600 from about 2018 Edit 2 As suspected the people asking for a replacement asked in 2022 on sites like Reddit Replacing this CPU usually comes with a motherboard and RAM DDR4 to DDR5 etc,lwngck4,5.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnk4dc,stellvia2016,,3,2024-11-11 22:21:25,,,,Does it really matter at that point then Even AMD only supports a socket for 45 years so at best you could buy a system when the socket was new then buy the last gen of CPU for that socket even if the upgrade happened 67 years later If you only buy new parts at the point youre always building an entirely new system simply look for whatever has the best bang for the buck for your usecase If youre still on AM4 the 5800X3D is still quite a good gaming CPU If youre on Intel then likely you need a full upgrade regardless because they only tend to support 23 years at a time,lwnivym,6.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnkxns,_EleGiggle_,,1,2024-11-11 22:25:46,,,,Kinda Im on a Ryzen 5 2600 with 32 GB DDR4 RAM and an RTX 3060 That was enough for Elden Ring before I finally got a PS5 Do I want to stay on AM4 or upgrade to AM5 or Intel Is my power supply strong enough or should I replace it just to make sure I have a RTX 3060 as well so I could keep that Or another option Do I wait with upgrades and keep gaming on my PS5 instead How does the PS5 compare to a computer What GPU is equivalent Thats why I want to compare my existing CPU like once a year if there was maybe a huge jump in performance that I can get for cheap but it seems like those days are over My first OS was Windows 98 so Ive been doing this for a while Currently Im mainly on my MacBook Air M3 and took a liking to the enormous battery life from an ARM processor So do I want to upgrade my Windows PC at all Edit Told you its no easy question,lwnk4dc,7.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnnjol,stellvia2016,,2,2024-11-11 22:39:56,,,,Really depends on what your budget is Assuming your board supports it you probably have to update the BIOS is all the 5800X3D would probably be double the performance in games compared to your current CPU as per the GN video Which does list the Ryzen5 2600 at the very bottom of the chart That would only cost you around 200ish USD Dont know what country youre in so it might be more Otherwise assuming you kept the same case PSU and storage etc A moboramcpucpu cooler would be around 800900 For you to jump to the 7800X3D or 9800X3D For PSU youd probably want at least a 650W Socket AM5 that the 7800X3D and 9800X3D are on they say will be supported through at least 2027 If youre relatively content with the PS5 Id probably simply drop in the 5800X3D into your current system and call it a day If youre using the stock cooler with the 2600 I would buy a new one for the 5800 Something like the Peerless Assassin 140mm are very solid cheap air coolers that should do a decent job,lwnkxns,8.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnu8qw,_EleGiggle_,,1,2024-11-11 23:17:25,,,,Unfortunately they arent selling the AMD 5800X3D anymore in Austria or Germany so am I supposed to get that one used Amazon and sites that crawl all electronics sellers didnt find a single listing in Austria or Germany Thats the correct listing am I right It just says Derzeit nicht verfügbar which means currently not available not even from third party sellers Im also not sure if this CPU needs more power than my current one I probably forgot to mention that I got a pretty good OC so Im probably not getting that much from the CPU Thats why I already have beefier cooler though A GAMMAXX 400 probably the first version because I just found a V2 and it looks older I definitely appreciate your effort though How much performance should I get from the new CPU on average Because IIRC I overclocked my current one from 34 GHz to a stable 4 GHz on all cores So Im a bit afraid of spending money to get a CPU thats basically the same speed Edit Technically I found a listing for 500 and theyll ship a new CPU sometime between 25 December 2024 and 28 January 2025 Seems like a scalper to me,lwnnjol,9.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnwsve,stellvia2016,,2,2024-11-11 23:32:12,,,,That must be why the GN charts most recently only showed the 5700X3D which is also on that chart So you could get that or a used one if you cant find a new one from Schengen sellers Clock speed doesnt tell you much about CPU performance these days which is why userbenchmarks site is so bad Instructions Per Second per core are what matters Also most games still only use 12 cores so 8 cores vs 1216 doesnt matter for games eg 14900K turbos to 62ghz but gets beat by the 7800X3D that only goes to 54ghz,lwnu8qw,10.0,1govhyh
comment,lwom85o,_EleGiggle_,,1,2024-11-12 02:01:54,,,,Edit I misread what you wrote We were talking about the same card after all The CPU with the lower number 5700X3D is from 2024 although the higher one 5800X3D is from 2022 but better Im not a fan of this CPU naming scheme but its crazy I can still use a socket from a board bought in 2019 for a CPU from 2024 Edit 2 Just to be sure is the Asrock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming K4 making everything out of that CPU Its in the CPU support list but does it use the X 3D VCache as supposed I could get AMD Ryzen 7 5700X3D instead for about 200 Its has CPU Mark score of 26355 instead of the 28302 from the 5800X3D Meanwhile my AMD Ryzen 5 2600 is still at 13189 Would that upgrade be worth it There are some older Ryzen 9 processors with a much higher score for the same price but they dont have the X3D so they arent that good for gaming according to the website I dont see how much that matters though the game benchmarks all used a 5800X3D to achieve more FPS Should I rather not upgrade and wait until the 5800X3D is in stock again Or maybe buy basically a new PC where everything is upgraded except the SSDs,lwnwsve,11.0,1govhyh
comment,lwpiwet,stellvia2016,,2,2024-11-12 05:50:44,,,,The reason for the peculiarity of the 5700X3D coming out in 2024 when the 5800X3D is from 2022 is AMD is using up the remainder of their wafers they purchased for that fabrication size of production They previously released a small amount of 5600X3D as well which were actually rejected 5800X3D where some of the cores were defective So they merely deactivated them and sold the 5600 as a 6 core instead of 8 core CPU I would update the bios just to make sure but it shouldnt have issues with the new one As far as if its worth it Everything else being equal it appears to be broadly a doubling of FPS for most games looking through the various benchmarks in that GN video Assuming were talking 1080p gaming If its not something you use all the time and you dont try to push brand new AAA games at Ultra on like 1440p or something I could see it buying you another 3 years np The alternative is a complete system rebuild of moboramcpu and possibly psu which will cost you 45x as much and be around 20 more fps than the 5800X3D Supposedly the 9800X3D is unlocked to allow overclocking as well but Im not going to count that bc most people wont resort to that,lwom85o,12.0,1govhyh

comment,lwlosd0,JMacPhoneTime,,36,2024-11-11 16:37:59,,,,Lol I was comparing CPUs awhile ago and wound up there as the first result It said the AMD CPU I was looking at was 50 better than my Intel CPU Then I got to the bottom and read the blurbs It actually helped confirm my decision to upgrade to the AMD It seemed so obviously biased and still said the AMD was much better so I figured it must be a good upgrade,lwlku15,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwnbfrt,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,7,2024-11-11 21:36:20,,,,but you can only fudge the data so much Their current favorite fudge is to talk about memory latency and how much it matters in games and how much better it is on Intel cpus And all of that is true but it doesnt change the fact that everything else is better on AMD and the 3d cache literally exists to make it irrelevant There really is no limit to their fudging They are pointing to a number that has been made irrelevant years ago as the sole contributor to gaming performance,lwlp9cd,4.0,1govhyh

comment,lwo1i9a,DriftMantis,,8,2024-11-11 23:59:53,,,,Its weird because this article is obvious bias However the point about cpus for gaming is not terrible It may make sense to get a lower end or last gen cpu if that raises the gpu budget Reason being is that your more likely to be gpu locked than cpu locked Your cpu can not boost your framerate if its waiting on the gpu I think a fairly balanced build is a good idea The obvious exception to this would be you game at a low resolution or really need to max out refresh rate to some ridiculous level for competitive gaming,,0.0,1govhyh
comment,lwyvsfi,cvelde,,1,2024-11-13 19:49:25,,,,The other obvious exception I find very much worth mentioning is simply games that are cpu bound Be it Simulators like Kerbal space Program strategy and 4x games like Stellaris or Total War colony builders like Rimworld or Dwarf fortress or even just simply Minecraft A surprising amount of games is cpu limited and specifically often limited by a single thread doing the most important stuff The FPS here is mostly secondary instead we care about turn and simulation speeds Measuring FPS in say Stellaris is practically worthless instead a measurement of how long a CPU takes to simulate a year of gametime is a more useful metric Thankfully a few outlets do this recently but there is much room for improvement,lwo1i9a,1.0,1govhyh
comment,lwz9xgv,DriftMantis,,2,2024-11-13 21:01:37,,,,Those are great points youve made There are also real time games like Microsoft flight Sim that are very cpu bound as well that benefit from more expensive cpus even at 4k resolution Its worth noting also that gpus that support frame generation can boost performance in cpu bound games that support that technique However of course they are not real rendered frames so you are not getting the reduced input latency that you would get from just boosting performance using faster cpu hardware unfortunately,lwyvsfi,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwpgl29,ga9213,,4,2024-11-12 05:30:06,,,,Its such a weird choice for me For the x3d chips to make a quantifiable difference you need to be running 1080p But then if youre spending almost 500 on a CPU youre definitely buying a good graphics card and if youre doing that why are you gaming at 1080 and not taking advantage of the massive fidelity boost with 2k or 4k and high refresh rate monitors I went with a 7700x for my 4090 after trying both it and a 7800x3d and at 4k there is no difference Actually I think RDR2 was worse on the 7800x3d,lwndaju,2.0,1govhyh
comment,lwrwog3,Ruty_The_Chicken,,1,2024-11-12 17:06:56,,,,the 9800x3d is clearly much better at 4k than the 7700x the difference only grows with more recent games and the more demanding they are the bigger the difference Besides a lot of these people will be getting the 5090 or whatever its called which will only make a bigger difference,lwpgl29,3.0,1govhyh

comment,lwv4vac,NeverComments,,1,2024-11-13 03:49:59,,,,why are you gaming at 1080 and not taking advantage of the massive fidelity boost with 2k or 4k and high refresh rate monitors High refresh rate is often a scenario where CPU bottlenecks become an issue since it doesnt matter how fast your GPU can render a frame if your CPU isnt able to prepare frames quickly enough to hit the low frame time targets If youve got a beefy GPU and only 23ms of each frame is render but the CPU takes 12ms to prepare it youre not going to be able to make the jump from 60Hz to 120Hz and beyond without upgrading the CPU thats bottlenecking the system CPU tests are conducted at lower resolutions because it puts the system in a scenario where this is true a high end GPU will crank through a low resolution frame in a short millisecond or two while the bulk of the work falls on the CPU and in a likeforlike comparison that allows us to see how two CPUs perform relative to one another That doesnt mean this only happens at low resolutions though it depends entirely on the game and scene in question CounterStrike 2 is going to be a lot easier to CPU bottleneck at 4k than Alan Wake 2 because the GPU isnt particularly stressed doing 4k renders in the former,lwpgl29,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwrw0nj,Ruty_The_Chicken,,0,2024-11-12 17:03:28,,,,That is absolutely NOT what the review says besides who the fuck is buying a high end cpu without actually getting a high end gpu People who buy a 9800x3d on release dont have a limited budget theyre looking for the best of the best for each part of the build,lwndaju,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwma66x,_dharwin,,6,2024-11-11 18:26:57,,,,Based on Steams hardware survey I would be shocked if most people were playing at 4k with those GPUs In the US a Ryzen 7 7700x is 270 while a 9800x3d is 480 at MSRP That 210 dollars is about the difference between most levels of GPUs 4060 4070 4070 ti super 4080 super Unless youre targeting 1080p w insane FPS most people would get better performance with the 7700x and getting the next step up GPU Moving between those tiers is roughly 30 performance improvement depending on resolution closer to 15 from 4070 ti super to 80 super A 7700x to 9800x3d is only 10 improvement at 1440p and 13 at 1080p when benchmarked with a 4090 removing as much of a GPU bottleneck as possible In other words if the option is spending 200 more for a 9800x3d or for a higher tier GPU in almost all cases youll get more performance from the better GPU Which is the point UB is making Youre better off spending the money on the GPU rather than the CPU for most gamers,lwlwsi7,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwme9lq,_dharwin,,2,2024-11-11 18:47:37,,,,Im not familiar enough with their history to know I read the actual UB review and its definitely slanted but not for the quotes we often see repeated Saying save money on the CPU for a better GPU is generally good advice Talking about Intel stock performance AMD advertising and recommending the 13600k and 14600k without mentioning the oxidation issues is where I think the review goes off the rails,lwmc0gn,4.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmfqpf,XDenzelMoshingtonX,,4,2024-11-11 18:55:08,,,,Yeah they exclusively use that save money on the CPU phrase when AMD beats intel at the topend of the product line Compare it to the 13900K or 285K reviews where they instead talk about Intels technical advancements or performance uplift from the previous generation,lwme9lq,5.0,1govhyh
comment,lwlzmrm,101m4n,,1,2024-11-11 17:33:37,,,,Aye obviously there are cases where you may want that and Im not disputing that its the fastest CPU for games It definitely is But when you look at CPU benchmark graphs today you see even midrange parts from 4 years ago are still pulling 150 frames or more I bet in 99 of cases getting one of those and dropping the savings on the GPU is going to net better results overall,lwlwsi7,2.0,1govhyh

comment,lwnwndb,zoiks66,,0,2024-11-11 23:31:18,,,,YouTube and Reddit are funny places when it comes to CPUs and PCs in general Their users dont understand what a small blip gamers are for overall PC sales Intel has about 80 of the overall client PC market No corporate IT department wants to buy a desktop or laptop with an AMD CPU as it would mean having to manage clients with nonIntel chip onboard Ethernet and WiFi chips Reddit and YouTube are full of people screaming at each other over 3 performance difference between CPUs when in reality those performance differences have effectively no effect upon CPU sales numbers,,0.0,1govhyh
comment,lxpv960,moderngamer327,,1,2024-11-18 06:14:19,,,,It departments are not going to care what CPU is in a computer in the vast majority of cases Also AMD has been gaining a lot of market share especially in the Mobile department,lwnwndb,1.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmoasz,burito23,,0,2024-11-11 19:38:37,,,,Well in reality yes Gaming performance is kind of saturating now If a game can go 2000FPS would you even notice it from 144 FPS Save your money,,0.0,1govhyh
comment,lxpvb1s,moderngamer327,,1,2024-11-18 06:14:48,,,,Still useful in CPU bound games or if you need it for other CPU heavy tasks,lwmoasz,1.0,1govhyh
comment,lwltkas,Greyboxer,,-18,2024-11-11 17:02:28,,,,Outrage brigade aside theyre right tho At 4K its 25 faster than a 13600k according to techpowerups charts Edit the outrage brigade found me,,0.0,1govhyh
comment,lwlwbp9,otaconucf,,15,2024-11-11 17:16:42,,,,Because at 4k your performance is being limited more by your graphics card than your CPU This is why the performance gains are higher at lower resolutions where the GPU stops being the bottleneck on performance,lwltkas,1.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnetkq,Dirty_Dragons,,1,2024-11-11 21:53:34,,,,This is why the performance gains are higher at lower resolutions Which is irrelevant if you are gaming at 4k I dont plan to ever game at 1080p again so I just dont care how many FPS games get at that resolution,lwlwbp9,2.0,1govhyh
comment,lx0vn8u,UglyFrustratedppl,,2,2024-11-14 02:26:16,,,,Its not irrelevant The CPU performance is still there just hidden under a bottleneck As graphics cards get better overtime more of the CPU gets utilized Somebody who bought a cheap CPU to run 4K might eventually find that its not able to keep up in terms of futureproofing,lwnetkq,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwm7729,Rxyro,,0,2024-11-11 18:11:51,,,,It depends on your game heavily,lwlwbp9,2.0,1govhyh
comment,lwlx2f0,Greyboxer,,-14,2024-11-11 17:20:31,,,,Did you feel like you needed to explain that to me for some reason Anyone with 4K and a 4090 doesnt need a 9800x3d or anything more than a midrange cpu Gains are minimal Its blatantly obvious The point is theres no reason outside of a uplift near margin of error to upgrade your CPU to the highest of high end when youre already at 4K with a 4090,lwlwbp9,2.0,1govhyh
comment,lxpvg1n,moderngamer327,,1,2024-11-18 06:16:04,,,,There are still plenty of games that are bottlenecked by the CPU at 4K,lwlx2f0,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmc9yd,GrompIsMyBae,,1,2024-11-11 18:37:38,,,,Its not blatantly obvious nothing stops a person with a 4090 and a 4K monitor from playing say competitive CS2 or Valorant in which case X3D CPUs are MUCH better than any i5 out there because those games are CPU bottlenecked even at 4K That said I somewhat agree with your sentiment somewhat,lwlx2f0,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwme6nt,Greyboxer,,2,2024-11-11 18:47:11,,,,You gotta admit though that what youre describing is a 1 use case of a person who already has a top 1 of hardware Making it relevant like 1 out of 10000 times,lwmc9yd,4.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmhe8b,GrompIsMyBae,,1,2024-11-11 19:03:32,,,,I really wouldnt go as far as saying its a 1 use case considering how popular competitive games are,lwme6nt,5.0,1govhyh
comment,lwmlid9,Greyboxer,,2,2024-11-11 19:24:25,,,,I think 1 is an overestimation of the rate of truly competitive valorant or CS2 players there are who would notice a 25 performance uplift out of the entire population of 4K players with a 4090,lwmhe8b,6.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnqgt6,iamcts,,0,2024-11-11 22:56:01,,,,This is gold right here Before AMD started dumpstering Intel the only thing Intel fanboys could still hold onto to was single core performance on their 500 CPU Now that AMD beats Intel in nearly all metrics theyre resorting to not needing a good CPU anymore because the price to performance ratio isnt there,lwlx2f0,3.0,1govhyh
comment,lwnss0r,Greyboxer,,1,2024-11-11 23:09:03,,,,who the fuck fanboys anymore is this the core 2 duo days or something its 2024 brother get with the rest of humanity No one fanboys a brand of CPU,lwnqgt6,4.0,1govhyh

comment,lwme4qz,XDenzelMoshingtonX,,7,2024-11-11 18:46:56,,,,Downvoted for at 4K in my case Doesnt mean anything since it fully depends on the games youre playing,lwlwwwo,2.0,1govhyh
