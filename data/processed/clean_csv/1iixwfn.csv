comment,mb9ni3d,--Arete,,141,2025-02-06 09:50:38,,,,Where is AV1 support We need a new Shield Edit Just go the Google TV Streamer 4k and I love it It is a lot faster in every app and it can decode AV1 flawlessly Cant believe I was stuck on the Shield for so long,,0.0,1iixwfn
comment,mb9r0je,AfroDiddyKing,,49,2025-02-06 10:26:32,,,,Yeh definitely new shield is needed Unfortunately old hardware doesnt support it,mb9ni3d,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mba9ec0,NoFeetSmell,,12,2025-02-06 12:59:15,,,,Does AV1 require a special codec chip or something Im having trouble wrapping my head around why doesnt old hardware support what I thought was just a codeccontainer Im a layman when it comes to video encoding mind so please pardon my ignorance Is it just that old hardware is too slow to decode the files in realtime And if thats the case why Is it like uncompressing a zip file for a huge file or something,mb9r0je,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbaawuu,Sopel97,,30,2025-02-06 13:09:04,,,,there are software decoders for av1 and they are fast but hardware like nvidia shield and the crappy software like netflix it is made to run is made in a way such that pretty much only hardware accelerated decoders exposed by the OS are usable use vlc on it and it would probably work fine,mba9ec0,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbevvv1,NoFeetSmell,,4,2025-02-07 02:51:45,,,,Yeah Ive VLC for every video since it was first released cos it was a slightly confusing somewhat opaque requirement downloading all the klite codec packs etc I guess Ive just never tried opening a file that my hardware couldnt handle yet but I dont own a Shield or anything similar and my phones screen res is so low that it doesnt even make sense trying to open a 4k AV1 file on it,mbaawuu,4.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbal0xy,alidan,,7,2025-02-06 14:08:46,,,,you can brute force codecs to work but that requires cpu power mobile phone chips dont have cpu power the reason they seem as powerful as they do is because of hardware based accelerators for specific tasks the need for av1 honestly isnt really there its a nice to have not needed for shield use cases,mba9ec0,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbeuyjw,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-02-07 02:46:29,,,,OK so because AV1 is apparently more efficient and can compress video files to a smaller size without sacrificing quality which can save on bandwidth costs so better for streaming text from Googles AI summary that presumably just means it takes more cpu or hardware juice to unpack the files Got it,mbal0xy,4.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbfv6ui,alidan,,3,2025-02-07 06:55:16,,,,smaller file sizes for the same quality same sizes for higher quality on a phone with limited battery toy cant brute force it due to power consumption or even the cpu just not being able to handle it unless something changed I am able to encode h261 at around 90120fps cpu only av1 is around 1fps with 100 utilization at best just to give an idea how much more it demands decode is a lot faster but its kinda hard to express it runs at the same framerate in a way that matters hardware encode and decode do excellerate everything encode is crappier than cpu encode just by its nature but decode is perfectly fine at some point services will hard transition over and not offer other formats in tandem so it will be an issue at some point,mbeuyjw,5.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbg05o3,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-02-07 07:42:21,,,,Its curious to me that efficiency in this case refers exclusively to how much compression it cant achieve instead of factoring in power draw too If it requires 100 cpu that sounds waaaay less efficient to me in realworld terms of power cost energy instead of just bandwidth usage though I know your example is about the initial encoding and not the decoding step thats more relevant for us users when were streaming it in which is what I was really talking about when asking why the Shield couldnt handle them Thanks for all the insights though mate I used to work in a small archviz studio so I have a basic grasp of the intricacies involved in encoding video but I was the 3d generalist there not the video guy handling final output so I didnt learn too much on the video side and it was 20ish years ago,mbfv6ui,6.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbg4o7q,alidan,,2,2025-02-07 08:27:16,,,,For the most part end users arent the target for high end encode most of the use for encode is streaming video to something or transcoding it and at this point a gpu encoder and a device decoder is good enough at any codec because you are going off a closed gbps network however the difference between is generally what h264 does in 42kb av1 does in 13kb and comes out 10 higher quality and that is an absolutely massive bandwidth save over time h265 for example is able to pull ahead and then also loose its place depending on target quality however h265 requires a licensing fee while av1 does not effectively for you whatever works I looked it up to reply more modern software renderers for av1 are only about 30 slower while compressing to 75 more and 10 better output is best if I had nvidia I would use a very high bandwidth h264 encoder for vr but I am on amd so av1 is my best option if I was going to store something I would use av1 given the disparity in encode time for an enterprisenetflixyoutube av1 would let them drastically cut down file size to store and more importantly file size to server the content while maintaining a level of quality you are ok with the extra 30 encode time ends up saving them a substantial amount of money long term,mbg05o3,7.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbgkioc,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-02-07 11:08:16,,,,Ah ok then That makes a lot of sense Thats all excellent info thanks again mate,mbg4o7q,8.0,1iixwfn

comment,mbcwy93,zzazzzz,,3,2025-02-06 20:44:48,,,,given their investment in a desktop arm cpu i could see them tossing out an updated shield down the road with some bottom of the barrel new chips that didnt bin well enough to go into a desktop cpu,mbav8q1,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mba6cv2,NickCharlesYT,,1,2025-02-06 12:38:23,,,,I gave up on the platform entirely honestly Held onto my 2017 model for as long as I could but the performance just wasnt there for 4k hdr content anymore Ultimately replaced it with an apple tv 4k when I saw the latest model shield was STILL somehow the 2019 with a major ram and storage downgrade and had barely any benefit elsewhere even if I were to bump to the pro model,mb9ni3d,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbb51bi,AustinLurkerDude,,12,2025-02-06 15:50:44,,,,Can you expand on this I have a 2015 and 2019 that I use daily and no issues with playing 4K content through KODI Even x265 content Id love a sequel but my existing usecases arent broken yet,mba6cv2,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbe2uaf,CAElite,,3,2025-02-07 00:10:14,,,,Ditto have the same 19 that hosts my Plex server and runs as my main media centre my old 15 Ive given to my mum who hits my Plex server Have never had any problems with performance if Im honest Good portion of my media is low loss 4K hevc Plex server leaves a little to be desired sometimes and if I recall correctly it occasionally doesnt get along will with mp4 contained media,mbb51bi,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbb8u2c,NickCharlesYT,,-19,2025-02-06 16:08:34,,,,Good for you Didnt work here on Plex or YouTube Probably app performance issues But the result is the same it was unusable,mbb51bi,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbbd7uq,AustinLurkerDude,,3,2025-02-06 16:28:58,,,,I didnt buy the newer cylinder shaped one but the older ones dont have the youtube codec because apparently its not free Youtube HDR unfortunately has never worked for me too PLEX and KODI both work for me with 4K ATMOS I wonder if youre doing transcoding Are you using PELX as a server or client on the Shield As a client it shouldnt have any issues unless its over wifi ps Is the Apple tv 4K better Im open to alternatives as compared to the rest of my AV equipment 150 isnt much Id find something that handles DolbyVision colormapping for my Epson projector to be worth upgrading,mbb8u2c,4.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbbdrfx,NickCharlesYT,,-10,2025-02-06 16:31:27,,,,No I didnt use plex as a server on the shield I have a dedicated box for that IDK what to tell you really most of my issues were with stuttery playback nothing I did fixed it except downscaling to 1080p or removing HDR I tried for years to fix it and that was why I was looking at an upgrade from my 2017 shield in the first place I guarantee you nothing you say now will have helped but maybe nvidia finally got their shit together and issued a software fix after I gave up on them Or Im frankly sensitive to microstutters so its possible you and many others that think their TV is fine have the same issue and just dont notice it at all Or maybe you have that awful motion smoothing enabled on your TV I havent a clue,mbbd7uq,5.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbddqig,Thanges88,,5,2025-02-06 22:01:26,,,,Were you video files in an mp4 container or mkv Plex has issues playing mp4 h265 content for whatever reason which may be device dependent but I know I have issues with that on shield client,mbbdrfx,6.0,1iixwfn

comment,mbam8iy,xkegsx,,1,2025-02-06 14:15:28,,,,Doing the same Holding out for the next gen apple TV before switching them all By then well know if apple updates to lossless audio passthrough and if Nvidia will make a new shield as the new switch should be out by then,mba6cv2,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbeyhcy,daslicious,,1,2025-02-07 03:06:39,,,,Id like an upgrade but my 2019 plays a 100bit 4k video So far theres nothing its had trouble with I assume we are all talking about the pro,mba6cv2,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mb9wvc1,ImpulsePie,,57,2025-02-06 11:22:24,,,,Pretty happy with my 2019 Shield Pro but its overdue for a refresh Id like to see new hardware with AV1 and YouTube HDR support with VP9 profile 2 Also a properly working system wide match frame rate feature would be great Ive otherwise just replaced the default launcher to improve performance and get rid of the ads,,0.0,1iixwfn

comment,mba08qo,TheCookieButter,,8,2025-02-06 11:51:29,,,,Oh yeah it could definitely do with a new chip A lowerend OLED LG B4 puts its AI upscaling to shame nevermind the fact it is missing newer codecs and full Dolby Vision support Id snap their hands off to buy a truly modern 2025 version of the Shield,mb9p2p0,3.0,1iixwfn

comment,mba8af0,Taur-e-Ndaedelos,,2,2025-02-06 12:51:48,,,,The Shield perplexes me I would not think the company whose shtick for two decades now has been throw more power hungry resources at the problem until it goes away would be the company to make a mobile gaming platform and its battery life seems to be fine to great And theyre not exactly known for keeping their proprietary tech alive for too long Thinking of Nvidia 3dVision here,mb9uoky,1.0,1iixwfn

comment,mbhixqi,kinisonkhan,,1,2025-02-07 14:57:05,,,,I bought two of the 3d Gen roundedcylinder media players After 3 years both are unusable due to the updates Menus are slow to load switching apps is painfully slow remote response is piss poor I have factory reset them removed the MicroSD card made attempts to debloat them via ADB but realistically the only solution is to downgrade the OS to a previous older version which cant be done as it requires a USB port which the media player lacks You post this in rAndriodTV or rnvidiashield and the most common response is get the 200 pro which also has the same problem but has a USB port needed to downgrade the OS So the solution is to buy a more expensive device that absolutely requires rooting out of the box Shields are nice media players but careful what you buy I had to replaced my two shields with Walmarts ONN Pro It started out great minimal menus and all then the ads took over,,0.0,1iixwfn

comment,mbcva7d,Tomatoo21,,1,2025-02-06 20:37:16,,,,Strange to hear this as well maybe Stremio is particularly heavy or something That said the UI never felt super smooth and would freeze up after waking on occasion so I dont know maybe I had a dud Tried factory resetting and all that and no improvements,mbabckp,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbhmxsn,kinisonkhan,,1,2025-02-07 15:17:38,,,,I mostly use Kodi on mine not sure what happened but I installed every update that became available Next thing you know it struggles just to boot up or switch to another app making the media player completely useless and bested by a 50 ONN Pro,mbabckp,3.0,1iixwfn

comment,mb9rg5w,ultrafud,,4,2025-02-06 10:30:55,,,,Ive had mine for years and its been a workhorse It does VERY occasionally stutter on the UI but its once in a blue moon and usually resolves itself in a minute or so My only complaint is the software update that pushed ads to the front page but that has nothing to do with the hardware itself which continues to do its job well after daily use for multiple years,mb9i5cp,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mb9sfg7,unepmloyed_boi,,4,2025-02-06 10:40:40,,,,People are downvoting you because a chunk of the android community is weird and takes criticisms of devices as personal insults towards their purchasescroll through any android device review video comment section for proof of this As long as they dont experience any issues in their limited use cases they see no issueeven though android is supposed to be more open The cylinder freezing up is a common issue theres threads all over about it with people recommending the pro instead Its almost guaranteed if you do things like use a web browser Sold it and bough a pro version and its been perfect apart from bluetooth dropping out or audio going out of sync if you walk too far with headphones,mb9i5cp,1.0,1iixwfn

comment,mbapodt,roflcyclone,,10,2025-02-06 14:34:12,,,,Its a settop box like Roku or Apple TV I have a 2019 Pro and the big draw when I got it was it could play just about every codec natively which is huge for Plex to get direct playback rather than transcoding It also offers AI image sharpeningupscaling and some more robust features than are typically found in settops,mbamei7,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbay6os,theoriginalmack,,4,2025-02-06 15:17:50,,,,Smart TVs are notorious for placing ads and other unwanted content in their UI Having a box inbetween eliminates all of that The sheild specifically also adds the ability for AI upscaling transcoding and the ability to run any android TV app Side loaded or otherwise As a heavy plex user who will do absolutely everything I can to avoid seeing an ad the shield is a must,mbamei7,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbb1o90,bryansj,,4,2025-02-06 15:34:44,,,,To this day it is one of the best solutions for TrueHD based Atmos playback of ripped UHD discs remuxes If there was a suitable replacement for this then Id throw my two Shields into the trash and buy it I also have a LG OLED,mbamei7,1.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbb6xfq,squattilyoupuke,,1,2025-02-06 15:59:35,,,,I see since I am pretty much only using my TV for streaming via Apple Netflix Prime etc and gaming with Xbox it wont really benefit me all that much,mbb1o90,2.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbbex04,akaender,,2,2025-02-06 16:36:47,,,,There are a few other features not mentioned yet Notably its Android based so you can side load apps of all sort built in Geforce Now Streaming built in GameStream to stream PC games to TV w full controller support This enables 4 player local coop for PC gamers which is otherwise a huge pain in the ass works well with external receivers that may be buggy with things like Dolby VisionAtmos HDR10 or DTSX Onkyo in my case smart home integrations connectivity with usb devices or blue tooth which is handy for some usecases users,mbb6xfq,3.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbd6lhp,squattilyoupuke,,1,2025-02-06 21:28:39,,,,Hm how well does the game streaming from PC work Like does it stream 4k60 or more fps without lag and visual artifacts So far I only tried Xbox cloud and it was ass even with 500mbit lan Currently thinking about drilling through a wall to connect PC via HDMI but if the shield can stream that well I might go for that instead Also just looked up some YT videos and theyve said they disabled game streaming Am I missing something,mbbex04,4.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbe7wxl,akaender,,1,2025-02-07 00:37:41,,,,I cant speak to the Cloud streaming services like Xbox or Geforce Now streaming myself since I havent used them Youd want to look around some other subs for that info I have used the stream from PC for several hundred hours though and can attest it works great The caveat though may be that to minimize latency youll want to have a prosumer grade local network I use Ubiquiti appliances and pulled cat6e cables which included drilling holes like it sounds like you would need to do but in my case I would be doing that anyway even just to stream movies Im also do this sort of thing for a living so it was just another day for me and I can see how thats a barrier to entry for others In my case it was much easier to pull ethernet where I needed it than hdmi though Im not trying to sell you on it one way or another Mainly just thought Id share of its rather unique features and that its been a reliable and flexible piece of hardware for me since 2019 so Ill be somewhat sad when I have to replace it,mbd6lhp,5.0,1iixwfn
comment,mbflg9n,squattilyoupuke,,1,2025-02-07 05:34:34,,,,I had a bit of a look into Moonlight and Sunshine and will probably try that first seems very easy to set up on the LG WebOS thx,mbe7wxl,6.0,1iixwfn
