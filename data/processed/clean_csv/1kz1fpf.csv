comment,mv2afxa,S_A_N_D_,,54,2025-05-30 13:18:32,,,,Lee recommends that affected users send the damaged CPUs back to AMD or wherever they bought them and say they are defective This is literally fraud They arent defective theyve been damaged by the motherboard Its never going to be prosecuted but its still fraud and more to the point its easy for AMD to just reject any RMA showing this kind of damage since it wouldnt be their responsibility,,0.0,1kz1fpf

comment,mv7k2ra,deejeycris,,1,2025-05-31 07:29:50,,,,Its not fraud if its all in the open Itd be just way too complicated to explain the circumstances during the RMA process say its defective and move on If AMD wants to find out why customers are returning the same faulty CPUs theyll find out Ps AMD certifies boards so its their fault too they should have checked the board better otherwise it wouldnt be called certification but licensing,mv2afxa,1.0,1kz1fpf
comment,mv3vdy1,correctingStupid,,-12,2025-05-30 17:50:59,,,,Doesnt mean its fraud because you dont like it If both systems are certified to work with each other then the failure of one due to the other is the responsibility of the manufacturer,mv2afxa,1.0,1kz1fpf
comment,mv3wmt2,S_A_N_D_,,12,2025-05-30 17:56:43,,,,claiming its defective when you know it was damaged by the motherboard and the method by which it was damaged is the sole fault of the motherboard manufacture which ASRock seems to admit here is deliberately misrepresenting the issue for financial gain The chip wasnt defective it was damaged and said damage is the responsibility of a third party Claiming it was defective would be fraud,mv3vdy1,2.0,1kz1fpf

comment,mv22bsp,RedditButAnonymous,,20,2025-05-30 12:32:01,,,,Not user error sorry What I meant was the chips were not faulty there was nothing wrong with the damaged CPUs The motherboard has caused the problem If I bought an AIO and it leaks AMD dont refund me for that the AIO manufacturer does sometimes So I dont see why they will accept refunds in this case unless its been agreed between the two companies,mv20wes,2.0,1kz1fpf

comment,mv2400b,CambodianJerk,,25,2025-05-30 12:41:59,,,,Dont understand why youre getting downvoted This is exactly what I was thinking during GN interview with their Motherboard VP Now that Asrock has confirmed the issue is caused by them AMD will very quickly turn around and start their own investigation to confirm they are not the problem and forward these back to User problem to resolve There is no difference here then if all our C13 power cables suddenly started nuking all electronics in the computer PSU Motherboard CPU Graphics RAM all dead because the power cable company made some faulty cables Would you expect AMDIntelNvidiaCorsair etc to accept back that kit under RMA and send you a new one Of course you fucking wouldnt thats ludicrous Youd want appropriate compensation from the power cable company Asrock need to own it,mv1wcvu,1.0,1kz1fpf
comment,mv2c4i9,_dharwin,,10,2025-05-30 13:27:42,,,,Thats not what Asrock said Whether you agree with them or not Theyre saying if the Mobo works with another CPU then the CPU is at fault and they will not compensate They also said some CPUs are fine once cleaned and put in another mobo in which case an RMA would be unnecessary and the working CPU would be returned If the mobo is broken does not work with another CPU and the CPU is broken does not work in another mobo then they would potentially compensate EDIT For his part Steve thinks theres something janky going on that so many of these systems can be fixed by cleaning and hypothesizes there may be issues in the manufacturing process where debris is entering the CPU socket Which would obviously be Asrocks fault but thats not what they admitted,mv2400b,2.0,1kz1fpf
comment,mv2ig8b,imaginary_num6er,,-9,2025-05-30 14:00:49,,,,This is why Gigabyte is the only good company left GN gave ASUS a bad rating due their RMA and BIOS update policy during Zen 4 X3D MSI has been banned by their channel for many years and AsRock is now having issues That only leaves Gigabyte as the default winner,mv2400b,2.0,1kz1fpf

comment,mv2ay70,WeirdSysAdmin,,9,2025-05-30 13:21:18,,,,Doesnt AMD certify the boards that have their chipsets Gigabyte had a similar issues a few years ago and they had to replace the CPUs because it was over bolting processors If its operating within parameters then the fried CPUs are on AMD,mv1wcvu,1.0,1kz1fpf

comment,mv2cj7v,nipsen,,-6,2025-05-30 13:29:54,,,,Essentially it was an amperage problem in the Precision Boost Overdrive PBO settings That might sound reasonable to some But there is no way to push the resulting effect of a pbooverclock past some kind of limit that will fry the cpu by itself What you have to do to accomplish something that draws a very high effect is to force a minimum clock up to a very high level and then adjust the curves so that a modest say the first part of the curve PBO2 increase in clock frequency drags everything along with it on a long boost And while thats possible in the same way that you could in theory make pl2 on Intel a pl1 boost and burn way too high or put every core at the same max frequency and wonder why a cpu thats scaled for very short boosts to that frequency fails its not trivial to accomplish it by just changing the bios settings Note that Asus also took the blame on a similar thing with the raptor lake disaster whats really going on is that people are buying the largest and most powerhungry of the processors putting them to insane overclocks that make no sense And that in a way the manufacturer has approved of in marketing because they want to sell bigger numbers and so on But which is just not how the cpu is set up it is designed to rest on fairly low clocks and then boost cores on demand Which works great because the memory bus is nowhere near as fast as the cpugovernor on any of these systems In 2002 an overclock on demand from a softwaregovernor might not have been quick enough to avoid pauses on a very targeted workload And because of direct driver architectures that rely on busspeeds for maintaining input latency and so on this has been a problem for system response way past the expiry date of very old computer problems Thats all true But with wdmdrivers and internal ondemand cpugovernors this is not an issue at all Even with servers this is not an issue the boostschema that Intel has made its entire lineup on does work Still some people just need to put the processor on max clocks somehow through raising the minimum clocks here no doubt in the belief that it increases performance And then are surprised and angry when it blows up The result of that is the following mainboardmanufacturers and laptopmakers among others end up clocking their products to a target that will be extremely low just in case they will end up with people blowing their computer up Or just lock down all the settings to whatever a support technician with no understanding of the system will decide on by their reading of the manual and the recommendations from the cpumanufacturer To the point where we really are right now laptops come with default cpu setups that throttle it from the first second after boot and that starve the gpu of power Or desktops that end up with ambient wattdrain on idle in the range of 50W extra on a 12 core setup The worlds most ridiculous industry just keeps rolling And Tech1 and GamerNexus really are enabling it as well suggesting very strongly here that its the mainboardmanufacturers fault for not locking down the cpu sufficiently on beforehand Or that its AMD and Intels for not technically forcing settings that are safe,,0.0,1kz1fpf
