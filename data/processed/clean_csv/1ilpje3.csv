comment,mbzb31e,chillaban,,91,2025-02-10 07:08:51,,,,Its illegal but Im not sure as a consumer what can be done Amazon has sold me new NVME drives with previous customer data to me and even when I complained to state and federal regulators they just contacted Amazon on my behalf who gave me a refund and an extra month of Prime for free And after that the regulators simply told me they found that the resolution was satisfactory I even hired my employers free personal legal services to consult with an attorney who didnt think I had a case either Its super frustrating when the law is written in black and white but large companies seem to have figured out a way to automate paltry settlements and call it a day,mby0pfz,3.0,1ilpje3

comment,mc0w8br,chillaban,,80,2025-02-10 15:07:28,,,,Some sort of criminal charges or escalating punitive charges in line with me as a civilian breaking the law If I have to discover something is used then fill out 5 pages of forms and wait for 6 months of bureaucracy and all Amazon loses is 4 dollars in monthly payments from me it feels like Amazon is gonna profit more from breaking the law than obeying it Its kind of moot claiming that selling me used shit as new is illegal If I run a red light or litter the punishment is way more than delaying my commute by 30 seconds or picking up the trash I dropped as an incentive to make sure I dont break the law Why shouldnt that be the case for a trillion dollar company,mc0kc73,5.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc26fly,igolowalways,,19,2025-02-10 18:52:53,,,,Spot on unfortunately it seems that the trend these days is to ignore the law and the rules pick and choose They please get a pick and choose who they want to protect They get to pick and choose as they want to prosecute If somebody clearly breaks the law the police can just say they didnt see it,mc0w8br,6.0,1ilpje3

comment,mc2m92m,Wishihadcable,,-2,2025-02-10 20:19:50,,,,Your analogy to a red light or litter is apt Every day people litter and run red lights They do it because there is no enforcement of the laws Im sure you littered in the past and accidentally run a red light I doubt you got a ticket unless you hit a car running the red Nothing happens to the companies when the violate the law like nothing happens to you when you violate the law,mc0w8br,6.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc2s45d,chillaban,,2,2025-02-10 21:01:34,,,,I dont know where you live where littering and red light running isnt regularly enforced but where I live theres a pretty significant chance that you will get pulled over and ticketed for that As you said when theres no enforcement of the laws or not grave enough of a punishment for said enforcement then theres no incentive to avoid illegal behavior That is exactly whats happening with Amazon and Newegg moving gray inventory For one of my jobs I moved to a state that requires a front license plate but the ticket for not having it was only 75 My car had an adaptive cruise radar where the front plate would go and its an entire front fascia swap for front plate compatibility around 3500 in 2005 money I half jokingly told a cop as hes writing a ticket that he needs to write 45 more of those to make me even think about paying for the front plate fix,mc2m92m,7.0,1ilpje3

comment,mc0ccu2,alidan,,0,2025-02-10 13:06:28,,,,the last time the government was audited god I dont even remember how long ago it was but what was found was 89 figures of money were just completely un accounted for and the news about it was slowly swept away and no one talked about it anymore when a plunger costs 800 and I will say this incase you dont know its one of the actual prices of shit the government actually pays for why does it cost 800 someone either got a real fucking good deal on a contract for the plunger in which case I want the people who okayed that contract fired and out or the 800 plunger is a way to syphon money into someone elses hand and I want someone in jail I dont think any government is clean of corruption but as long as ours is technically by and for the people I would love to have a transparent audit of where the money is going we dont need to be told top secret projects but an accnolagemnet of we know where the money went would be nice and to anything not top secret I would love to know exactly money I had to pay in goes I mean you want corruption the fact they cant pass a law on insider trading and the nancy pelosi stock bot quadrupled its money last I checked but oh they can put off telling you what money goes were for 180 days or so tells me corruption isnt hard to find its just that its not by the letter of the law illegal,mc08ywm,11.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc0dtg8,CatholicSquareDance,,3,2025-02-10 13:16:33,,,,youre tilting at windmills just because youre fucking obsessed with plungers and the idiots in office will destroy some of our most consumer friendly and citizen friendly institutions in US government instead of something like the US military the actual biggest source of government waste to appease your completely unfounded insecurities and those of uninformed voters like you in this audit which as an accountant I can say isnt even a fucking audit its just an inquisition,mc0ccu2,12.0,1ilpje3

comment,mc0matz,BetterThanAFoon,,5,2025-02-10 14:10:43,,,,the last time the government was audited god I dont even remember how long ago it was but what was found was 89 figures of money were just completely un accounted for and the news about it was slowly swept away and no one talked about it anymore Fair redditor you cannot remember past a year Every year every federal agency is audited by 3rd party independent auditors as required by law Each agency posts their results on their website as required for transparency sake Every year they post their Financial report which includes their report for how they executed the previous year and their budget for the upcoming year On top of that any dollar that leaves the public coffers is required to be publicly disclosed provided it is not a no kidding secret program Finally you have GAO the Legislative branch watchdog that reviews each agency and provides their own independent reports It is not uncommon to see findings of poor controls or poor accounting procedures of government programs but that does not equal fraud Many times it is administrative issues Regardless getting a clean opinion on your audits is importantand if there are issues those are also published annually The idea that there isnt transparency in how the government spends money is pure BS Those that do not wish to be spoon fed by Fox News or conspiracy theorists on Twitter can easily find this information It would be great if more people read and came up with informed opinions,mc0ccu2,12.0,1ilpje3

comment,mbzxq53,guyblade,,1,2025-02-10 11:04:53,,,,The way a consumer uses it in their desktop probably not The way a cloud provider uses it probably Think about what percentage of the time your desktop is making maximum usage of its hardware For most people thats going to be almost none of the time For a cloud provider they are trying to squeeze every bit of value out of their hardware That tends to mean that the average utilization is very high The reality is that silicon is less a question of wearing out than it is of the weakest piece fails Heavy utilization does seems to be correlated with error rate at least based on this decadeold paper which is the best source that Im aware of for largescale ram analysis Also that paper notes that older dimms seem to have higher error rates which implies that _something_ is happening,mbya9fo,2.0,1ilpje3

comment,mc38ev6,gratefulyme,,1,2025-02-10 23:08:31,,,,Im making the point that there are situations with FIAT that are identical to the situations with crypto I actually can go to the grocery store and pay with crypto I can also go to multiple stores and turn my crypto into cash or purchase crypto By saying that youre always 100 able to pay in 100 of situations and with crypto you cant ever use it to pay for anything everywhere youre making a false assumption Crypto is just as easily turned into FIAT as it is with the banking industry and there are situations where the hurdles for doing so are identical to the banking industry I dont think anyone whos being fleeced by bitcoin scams are any different than people who would be fleeced by FIAT scams FIAT scams have always existed they still do I highly highly doubt that financial scams have increased or decreased in recent times Id bet theres a pretty straight timeline on victims of financial crimes possibly with FIAT schemes rising due to the older generation falling for them more often Nothing will ever get rid of financial schemes there has always been ways to part a fool with their money the form of money doesnt change the equation The story with crypto has always been the same Its in the name cryptoCURRENCY Its meant to be used as a currency Its easy to move around its low cost to move around which if you check my original comment is how this conversation started,mc37d4p,14.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc38s47,DoubleJumps,,1,2025-02-10 23:11:41,,,,Youre ultimately arguing that if I go to a store that doesnt take ubiquitous forms of money or I go without money that Id have just as hard a time paying as I do if I was trying to pay with crypto now Youre arguing that crypto is as viable as going to the store without money you just dont know it somehow That just proves my point that crypto isnt what you all sold us on it being 16 years ago when you were saying it would be a viable alternative to actual money Its not You guys specifically built it up as an investment vehicle and not an actual viable currency,mc38ev6,15.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc3d9vu,gratefulyme,,1,2025-02-10 23:46:42,,,,Im not arguing that at all You brought up that crypto is difficult to utilize and that its not usable I pointed out that in some situations FIAT is equally as difficult to utilize You said that to use crypto I have to first turn it into FIAT then use the FIAT to pay I pointed out that to use FIAT there are situations where you have to first translate it into another form of FIAT the same way crypto would need translated into a form of FIAT The situations are identical you are ignoring that rather than admitting yes there are situations where FIAT has gaps Ever want to pay your friend but dont have cash Now youre using a transaction service You understand that you could just as easily use crypto in that situation right Its the exact same situation as if youre at a business and they onlydont take cash Sure you can turn around and go to another business Same as if a business only accepted crypto Just because you cant grasp that the difficulties of using crypto are identical to the difficulties with using FIAT in those situations does not mean they do not exist Ive personally be in a situation where I HAD to have cash and didnt so I couldnt buy something Ive also been in a situation where I HAD to have card and didnt so I couldnt buy something You might not have ever experienced those situations but to deny their existence does not mean they dont exist FIAT has gaps as does all methods of transacting business Saying crypto isnt a viable form of currency because it has situations where its use can be a hurdle is the same as saying FIAT isnt a viable form of currency because it has situations where its use can be a hurdle I dont know who youre saying as you guys but bitcoin has heavily been pushed as a currency more than a store of value Whats the most famous news story about bitcoin that immediately comes to mind For most people thats going to be the news story of someone buying a pizza with bitcoin or people buying drugs with bitcoin Both of those are examples of bitcoin being used as currency The store of value has been a recent adaptation mostly pushed by finance people in the last 5 or so years,mc38s47,16.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc3fdng,DoubleJumps,,1,2025-02-10 23:59:18,,,,You brought up that crypto is difficult to utilize and that its not usable I pointed out that in some situations FIAT is equally as difficult to utilize Yes by creating a hypothetical so outlandish youd have to go to extreme effort to encounter it Trust me you convinced me You made a stunning argument to crypto being just as useful in real life applications as leaving the house with no means to pay at all the same way crypto would need translated into a form of FIAT lol crypto is usable as money You just have to turn it into useful money first Hahaha wow Good job,mc3d9vu,17.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc3gd1m,gratefulyme,,1,2025-02-11 00:05:09,,,,These are all hypotheticals Hypothetically all businesses take cash and card and crypto Thats not reality Reality is some business takes all options some take one option some take two options Maybe if youre in a rural town youd have to go to extreme effort to encounter a variety of these options but when you live in a city area all of these options exist all over If only you had listened 16 years ago and bought a bit of crypto too eh Youd be real upset having to turn it into FIAT Im sure,mc3fdng,18.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc3gx9o,DoubleJumps,,0,2025-02-11 00:08:30,,,,My grocery store in reality doesnt take crypto None of them around me do Thats reality All of them take cash and cards Thats reality Im not even in a rural area You are literally writing out arguments for crypto as an alternative currency where you have to turn it into actual money first for it to be useful and think youre doing a good job,mc3gd1m,19.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc44y3m,gratefulyme,,2,2025-02-11 02:23:53,,,,My grocery store does take crypto So does the gas station around the corner from me Both also sell crypto The gas station doesnt take cash though The smoke store around the corner doesnt take card The farmers market doesnt take cards These are all realities Youre literally arguing against having a third option Whats the problem with not having an additional option thats usable in all the current options with lower costs easier access for small businesses faster use for large transactions and while adoption is taking place is actively increasing in value This isnt even taking into account the use cases for travel and international business,mc3gx9o,20.0,1ilpje3
comment,mc7y2l6,money_loo,,2,2025-02-11 17:58:53,,,,Its amazing youre even still here arguing with a dude so stupid he thinks everyone else is stupid because they understand how crypto works and hes stuck on how gold used to work Like literally we had a dude show up saying everything you already have at the very beginning here and he STILL thought that guy was being facetious Like whats even the point of carrying a conversation on with pigeons Meanwhile my crypto is up 25 just for the week and we can cash it out anytime to buy shit or leave it there to go up way more than other investments Only to this person is 5k dollars of crypto suddenly not worth anything,mc44y3m,21.0,1ilpje3
