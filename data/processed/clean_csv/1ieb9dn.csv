comment,ma7zeno,unpopular-dave,,-81,2025-01-31 16:49:54,,,,do you think 1000 is outrageously expensive for a highend GPU I think theyre pretty fairly priced now if youre gonna pay a scalper thats a different story But thats not on Nvidia,ma6iepj,1.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma84xf4,MateTheNate,,41,2025-01-31 17:15:25,,,,Back in my day a 80 Ti card would be the highest end one and cost 700 so yeah it is,ma7zeno,2.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8698q,unpopular-dave,,-34,2025-01-31 17:21:35,,,,yep Im almost 40 I remember But instead of adding TI they changed to the 90 naming system Corporations are gonna be greedy Water is wet A wise man once said youre worth what you have the capability to negotiate,ma84xf4,3.0,1ieb9dn

comment,mahgdua,KamalaWonNoCheating,,5,2025-02-02 02:21:28,,,,Theres a lack of competition in the market If there were more the prices would come down Nvidia is certainly taking advantage of that If thats a good or bad thing morally is the question,ma9rx9s,6.0,1ieb9dn
comment,mahgjvw,unpopular-dave,,1,2025-02-02 02:22:24,,,,I dont think its morally a bad thing But I do wish there was more competition Its just not really feasible The initial investment is astronomical And the ROI is risky at best,mahgdua,7.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma80r6j,cantevenwut,,19,2025-01-31 16:56:07,,,,But its midtier in reality as it is slower than the high end cards that came out in 2022,ma7zeno,2.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma81dpt,unpopular-dave,,-24,2025-01-31 16:58:58,,,,Thats just not true Its not midtier Its the second best card available anywhere It blows out the highest tier XTX in everything and its superior to the 4080 in every way The 4090 is an absolute beast Everybody agrees with that I didnt expect it to outperform the 4090 Especially for half the price is it as much of a jump as everyone would want No But its still an amazing card for a great value Its such a Reddit thing to be negative for the sake of being negative Its like people shitting on the model Y which is the best consumer car on the market obligatory fuck Elon,ma80r6j,3.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma83l56,cantevenwut,,26,2025-01-31 17:09:13,,,,Just speaking to the disappointing reality not being negative for the sake of it The 5080 is positioned as high tier certainly and it is by no means a garbage card Id buy one at 999 to replace my aging 3080Ti but relative to every other generation to generation jump it has the actual performance uplift one would expect from a 70 series card aka mid tier It should have been the 5070 Ti and a theoretical 5080 could easily have bridged some of the outrageous performancehardware gap between there and the 5090 even if it had to go back to the previous price point of 1200,ma81dpt,4.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma83tkq,unpopular-dave,,-2,2025-01-31 17:10:18,,,,thats a valid argument but calling it mid is why I responded Because its clearly not mid,ma83l56,5.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma859jv,cantevenwut,,5,2025-01-31 17:16:59,,,,Its definitely the high end of reasonably priced hardware,ma83tkq,6.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma89rto,unpopular-dave,,2,2025-01-31 17:37:47,,,,I would definitely call the second best card on the market highend,ma859jv,7.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8bdvq,cantevenwut,,4,2025-01-31 17:45:13,,,,That is reasonable For myself when it comes to the raw power of the card in this case as a sim racing in VR user where frame gen and DLSS currently need not apply it would go 5090 4090 5080,ma89rto,8.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8bqzk,unpopular-dave,,2,2025-01-31 17:46:56,,,,Oh of course I think everybody makes that distinction Its more about money than power when coming to that conclusion,ma8bdvq,9.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8c5lv,cantevenwut,,1,2025-01-31 17:48:50,,,,Indeed The 4090 is essentially not on the market anymore in reality,ma8bqzk,10.0,1ieb9dn
comment,macuiqy,SpeedflyChris,,9,2025-02-01 10:33:32,,,,and its superior to the 4080 in every way Just barely Given the performance gap to the 5090 and even the 4090 this 5080 is basically a 70series card with upper 80series pricing,ma81dpt,4.0,1ieb9dn

comment,ma8feqp,FixSwords,,10,2025-01-31 18:03:55,,,,Yes I dont think its high end or luxury 5090 priced around here would be fine but this is overpriced And as mentioned it doesnt work properly,ma8e3fb,4.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8gvoh,unpopular-dave,,0,2025-01-31 18:10:50,,,,One reviewer made a report That doesnt mean they all dont work properly It doesnt matter what you think is highend or luxury Its what the vast majority of people think When something is the second best option on the market Thats the definition of highend When its used to play video games thats the definition of luxury,ma8feqp,5.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8ix1h,FixSwords,,6,2025-01-31 18:20:24,,,,Kinda seems that at least on here people agree with my perspective and disagree with yours Have a good evening continuing this isnt how I plan to spend the rest of mine,ma8gvoh,6.0,1ieb9dn

comment,ma6qlwk,Ragnaroknight,,74,2025-01-31 12:51:32,,,,Can you just use PCIe 4 If its anything like 34 it probably doesnt make a huge difference anyways Edit Article says yes that does indeed fix the problem,,0.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma9n6vx,flyingthroughspace,,49,2025-01-31 21:30:20,,,,Gamers Nexus just did a video on PCIe 345 Theres almost zero difference between all of them definitely nothing 999 of gamers would ever notice,ma6qlwk,1.0,1ieb9dn
comment,maejvof,Domascot,,10,2025-02-01 17:13:47,,,,SO its just more headroom for PCIe 50 SSDs right I mean those sharing lanes with the gpu slot on various mainboards,ma9n6vx,2.0,1ieb9dn
comment,mapymsv,rurigk,,3,2025-02-03 11:32:47,,,,Yes but no Yes using pcie 5 gives more possibilities on other slots but the pcie lanes used for the first slot that you use for the graphics card is not shared and its connected directly to CPU,maejvof,3.0,1ieb9dn
comment,mas4wl9,Domascot,,2,2025-02-03 18:43:08,,,,Thats too bad Do you happen know why I mean its pcielanes not slots One could have 50 on the board just an example and only be able to use those which lead to an actually slotted device aka general purpose lanes if you get what i mean Why isnt that a desired goal,mapymsv,4.0,1ieb9dn
comment,mb066hq,rurigk,,2,2025-02-04 22:35:20,,,,Its because those PCIe lanes are physically connected from CPU to the GPU PCIe slot each pin on the slot is one pin on CPU The other PCIe slots some can be also direct connection and some are provided by the chipset There is a limit of PCIe lanes when you use different slot modes there is a controller that switch or redirects some lanes to other connectors Also the hard limit is imposed by the processor socket lanes are not virtual for example if you want more PCIe lanes you use something like a threadripper because it has more cpu pins for the PCIe lanes,mas4wl9,5.0,1ieb9dn
comment,magzpl4,Opetyr,,-13,2025-02-02 00:47:47,,,,Yeah and JayzTwoCents doing the exact same copying as GN since we need to have the same coverage twice say showed the same thing,ma9n6vx,2.0,1ieb9dn
comment,mahypu6,peoplejustwannalove,,11,2025-02-02 04:07:51,,,,I mean that is literally how science works in pursuit of reaching consensus so I dont get the whining about people who make videos on the topic overlap is kinda the point,magzpl4,3.0,1ieb9dn

comment,macmp0f,cloud12348,,15,2025-02-01 09:14:49,,,,His issue came off as a riser one but perhaps it was more than just a riser issue,ma9y707,1.0,1ieb9dn
comment,madstda,jktmas,,9,2025-02-01 14:53:34,,,,Im wondering how much the PCB extension board has to do with the signal issues Guess well have to wait for 3rd party cards to find out,,0.0,1ieb9dn

comment,mcm7jom,Aggressive-Sign-6233,,1,2025-02-13 20:56:48,,,,So a PCIE 50 slot doesnt have to be 50 I can set it to 40 if I have issues Ordering motherboard today,macs7an,1.0,1ieb9dn

comment,ma8dukq,1sttimeverbaldiarrhe,,27,2025-01-31 17:56:39,,,,Why This looks like an Nvidia issue As per the article However switching to PCIe Gen 40 eliminated all these problems Given that other GPUs worked fine in the same setup by deduction the problem likely lies with the RTX 5080 FE in particular its design,ma83yfg,1.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8icxw,SpamingComet,,-4,2025-01-31 18:17:47,,,,And given that only this one person has had an issue thus far it seems like just a faulty sample card,ma8dukq,2.0,1ieb9dn
comment,maasvsy,chadwicke619,,6,2025-02-01 01:07:31,,,,Its not only this person If I recall correctly that dude who built the tiny SFF build with the 5090 FE also experienced problems that seemed to stem from PCIE5 that were similarly fixed from forcing 4,ma8icxw,3.0,1ieb9dn
comment,ma8yxui,xPerriX,,-2,2025-01-31 19:35:22,,,,I agree its nvidia issue and as you pointed out switching to 40 fixed it Just like cpus amd we had problems they bios fix it but then come out with a new motherboard chipset such as b440 to b550 to solve some out of the box issues Regardless of the issues we will always see new hardware that will better utilize newly released hardware Plus PCIe 60 has been talked about and demonstrated since last year,ma8dukq,2.0,1ieb9dn
