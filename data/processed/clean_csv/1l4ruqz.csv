comment,mwc31vq,dsffff22,,172,2025-06-06 15:50:40,,,,This article is ridden with absolute nonsense quotes The exploit wont get patched anytime soon as the dev behind It most likely made sure theres no internet connection The switch 2 runs switch 1 games and also exposes a Browser via the WiFi login portal pages Its nice to see the Dev adapted the ROP Chain quickly to the Switch 2 But since the Switch 2 allows save game transfers and old Switch 1 titles there are plenty of entry points Its more interesting If the those entry points can reveal more info like the PS5 utilizes ExecuteOnly memory for their kernel which makes It difficult to dump the kernel code memory for example,,0.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwbgnxe,senortipton,,178,2025-06-06 14:01:58,,,,They may be able to brick for now but if someone is able to mod it one of the first things to go will be that little bit of code enabling the bricking,mwbdayn,1.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwc0y27,qa3rfqwef,,42,2025-06-06 15:40:40,,,,Well if I recall correctly whenever you updated the firmware on a Switch 1 it would physically burn fuses to prevent you from going back to an older version I could see them doing something similar to brick a console I imagine a lot of care will need to be taken to avoid accidentally triggering such a mechanism which could have all sorts of checks in the code to confirm that you havent modified your Switch 2 That is to say I dont think it will be as simple as removing some line somewhere that enables bricking specifically,mwbgnxe,2.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwclwxs,qa3rfqwef,,6,2025-06-06 17:21:20,,,,I know Im just saying theres a lot Nintendo could have done to implement a method of bricking that might trip up a lot of people trying to modify their console It goes beyond just a line of code saying if X Y consolebrick Ive got little doubt modders will prevail here and come up with workarounds and safeguards to prevent it from happening once its fully understood,mwckgqx,4.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwce94b,BuckZero,,16,2025-06-06 16:44:55,,,,Wait actually,mwc0y27,3.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwcfyix,qa3rfqwef,,36,2025-06-06 16:53:05,,,,Yeah it ultimately wasnt much of an issue in the Switch 1s implementation since you could get around the fuse burning by running custom firmware through a custom OS and using the right tools If you were smart about it you could theoretically keep a path open to roll back to the original firmware you were on when you first modded the console Not much reason to do it outside of specific hacks a modder might want to mess with though,mwce94b,4.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwbpj1h,Spazzdude,,6,2025-06-06 14:46:00,,,,I expected it was going to be rather fast when they started going so hard after Switch 1 emulators and card dumpers so late in its lifecycle Gave the vibe that they didnt think the Switch 2 would be robust enough to hold out for at least a year,mwbdayn,1.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwf32w5,DomLite,,2,2025-06-07 01:24:30,,,,Thing is thats only possible if you connect to the Nintendo network If you install custom firmwarehomebrew and have no intent of playing online then its a nonissue Personally I dont play Switch games online I dont care enough about Pokemon to battle online with people and someone made a homebrew that replicated the effects of Pokemon Home plus enhancements so if I wanted to use something like that it was available The only other game Id possibly play online was Mario Kart but even then Id be more likely to play inperson with friends than online I simply never needed to ever connect to the Nintendo Network on my Switch I know this is my personal experience and others might feel differently but I highly doubt that Switch 2 is going to offer anything that I cant live without online play for If its online only I can do without If youve got custom firmware installed then going online to play games in the first place is kind of a boneheaded move If they get CFW running on Switch 2 soon Id be more than happy to never go online with it ever in exchange for all the extra functions that enables Cant brick me if you never have access to me,mwbdayn,1.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwbggw8,bruh-iunno,,243,2025-06-06 14:00:57,,,,Im pretty sure there were no big firmware exploits over the entire lifecycle of the Switch 1 its basically the recovery method left in by Nvidia or a mod chip to run meaningful stuff this exploit cant run any native code or anything either,mwbajwa,1.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwbsn3v,shutupandfeedmecake,,93,2025-06-06 15:00:56,,,,Theres little reason to hunt for such additional exploits when such an easy backdoor exists When theres a will theres a way Pirates hobbyist hackers Homebrew devs and security researchers all have motive enough to go looking given enough skill and patience the chance of the Switch 2 being hacked is not zero Though its unlikely to be as quick as it was for the OG,mwbggw8,2.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwbvb6j,phoenixmatrix,,24,2025-06-06 15:13:51,,,,Sony has been pretty good at it with their last consoles though I think it was the PS4 that took forever to be truly hacked It did eventually but it took a while,mwbsn3v,3.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwby0yw,evo_moment_37,,42,2025-06-06 15:26:54,,,,Sony pays bug bounty Pirates still defeat them by not updating their console Its all a matter of patience PS4 is wide open at this point PS5 is a few firmware behind,mwbvb6j,4.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwc0aax,phoenixmatrix,,26,2025-06-06 15:37:34,,,,Yeah PS4 is wide open but from the info I can find and from my poor memory it took 3 years for the first exploit that allowed jailbreaking to come out In term of avoiding piracy 3 years is really good in this industry,mwby0yw,5.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwdp44g,CompletelyRandy,,6,2025-06-06 20:35:53,,,,On the other side of the fence the PS3 was hacked wide open but since the Xbox 360 I dont believe any of the Xbox consoles have been hacked Pretty impressive how they both have managed to keep their security tight over the recent years,mwc0aax,6.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwbmc1k,REDOREDDIT23,,70,2025-06-06 14:30:33,,,,Yes but it wasnt a firmware exploit it was a shortcoming on Nvidias part because it was a Tegra X1 exploit I dont think it makes sense to laugh at someone who clearly knows more than you do,mwblqnm,3.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwbof1n,shadowtheimpure,,8,2025-06-06 14:40:41,,,,See comment about bypassing every element of the consoles security with a paperclip The hardware was a sieve nothing stood in the way of people doing pretty much whatever they wanted with it The only reasons we didnt see much in the way of hardware mods is physical constraints Switch is crowded inside and the fact that the ever litigious Nintendo would have nuked any such attempts from low Earth orbit,mwbnw0k,8.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwbp1am,REDOREDDIT23,,-6,2025-06-06 14:43:39,,,,So the Switch hardware is a sieve because the first revision had one hardmod without a modchip Even though the later revisions had none And the reason it didnt have more hardmods is because Nintendo wouldve gone after the people creating them even though you can buy one of the many modchips on Alibaba right now for 5 This is why I almost never enjoy responding to debates on reddit What do you even say to this lack of critical thinking,mwbof1n,9.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwbpym4,DeviantStrain,,6,2025-06-06 14:48:05,,,,I think theyre saying its a sieve because of how simple it was to get through literal paperclip not that there were tons and tons of exploits which matches the mental image of a sieve better,mwbp1am,10.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwfxb35,FUTURE10S,,1,2025-06-07 04:55:04,,,,but the way they built that browser is just bad on a technical level Did you know that some GameCube demo discs actually use a web browser And even back then just some static images performed like absolute ass eShop has no reason to perform as badly as it does make it like the Wii Shop Channel if you have to stop the videos and just have static JPEGs,mwbrikd,4.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwccq1m,CandyCrisis,,0,2025-06-06 16:37:31,,,,Not sure how any of that excuses it Its painfully slow Nintendo controls the whole eShop beginning to end and wrote all the software involved If it uses a slow browser engine thats still Nintendos fault,mwbrikd,4.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwcev88,Unoriginal1deas,,5,2025-06-06 16:47:54,,,,Well yeah no duh I never said it was okay I said the guy was wrong for saying the hardware was the issue I have no doubt Nintendo wouldve redone the entire infrastructure for the switch2 eshop after it become a running joke how bad the switch eshop was otherwise it would still run bad regardless of what hardware it was on,mwccq1m,5.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwe6pyj,snaphat,,3,2025-06-06 22:10:31,,,,Imagine claiming it how its a hardware issue when it came out in 2017 and basic online stores like it have existed for more than two decades and ran fine on much much much worse hardware,mwcev88,6.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwcmwxl,thesk8rguitarist,,-1,2025-06-06 17:26:02,,,,Every single version of the eShop has performed like hot garbage until now Now if we could just let Nintendo pick and choose what goes on the eShop,mwbrikd,4.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwedduw,Hugehead123,,9,2025-06-06 22:49:04,,,,Internet security has gotten much better since the Wiis time I dont know how the Wii eshop worked specifically but nowadays everyone uses security certificates that verify the server youre connecting to is legitimate If the certificate doesnt match what the Switch expects it will just drop the connection without going any further Its possible that the certificates could be leaked but Id expect theyre using ones with fairly short 30 or 90 day lifespans Its also possible but much less likely that the root certificate theyre generating them from could leak Then you could generate valid certificates for any time but that happens very rarely,mwdvay0,1.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwcc5ji,Beaker_Biker69,,3,2025-06-06 16:34:45,,,,Could someone translate for a layperson On June 5 developer and security researcher David Buchanan retr0_id on Bluesky shared footage of a successful framebuffer graphics demo running on the console through a userland ReturnOriented Programming ROP exploit For reference its a technique that doesnt involve native code execution but still manages to draw graphics directly to the screen In this context userland or user space refers to code that runs outside the kernel meaning it doesnt have full system privileges or direct hardware access,,0.0,1l4ruqz
comment,mwcgkbq,AlexHimself,,12,2025-06-06 16:55:57,,,,Its just like your phone where theres a protected section of the system kernel that requires root privileges to do anything and then a user section where your game save files personalization etc are all stored Im using loose terms here for laypeople btw if somebody is going to harshly critique this Its a firewall where all the protected system activitiesfunctions are behind and they expose secure APIs to the rest of the system so the two sides can interact together The userside sometimes has MORE abilities than it should or the APIs arent secure enough and you can shoehorn actions that shouldnt be possible Regarding the ROP exploit think back to those graphic APIsimagine an API has a control flow like this completely made up example btw 1 Game starts and prompts you for your preferred name with a 40char limit JoeHacker and it then saves it to the user section on disk usernamejson 2 Game user space calls API using secure key that only the game has direct from Nintendo during development so it can receive an auth token to enable sending graphics to the screen This secure key is the keys to the kingdom but rarely exploited Instead they leverage the key to get other things 3 Game then retrieves your avatar and name from 1 and sends it to the kernel to display 4 Hacker is able to gain access to usernamejson in the less secure user spaceperhaps its saved on a removable SD Card He puts it in his computer and replaces the content in that file with 40chars an exploit immediately after 5 The kernel receives an auth token permitting the content and the username which is expected to be 40chars but in reality is 1000s and is exploit code 6 Everything from 41char gets put in memory and is a buffer overrun and inadvertently gets executed Theyve managed to bypass the security that way Again this is extremely simplified and I used a bunch of random semitechnical terms,mwcc5ji,1.0,1l4ruqz

comment,mwdok6b,Elk-tron,,0,2025-06-06 20:33:03,,,,This is roughly correct but I would also add that in this case since browsers are commonly attacked there is an extra layer of protection there The attack is still stuck in that extra layer of browser specific protection and hasnt even touched most of the user section,mwcgkbq,2.0,1l4ruqz
