post,1ij14vs,chrisdh79,MSI and Asus increase Nvidia RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 prices by up to 400USD | It's like 2021 all over again,2554,2025-02-06 12:13:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ij14vs/msi_and_asus_increase_nvidia_rtx_5090_and_rtx/,470.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mbab8g8,catcher82611,,344,2025-02-06 13:11:06,,,,Having a 3080 I knew Id be okay for a while but looks like Im really going to be riding this card into the ground until I upgrade again Id consider upgrading if the price OR performance made sense but with the trend Nvidias been following I have a hard time paying 5090 money for a 5080 that has the performance of a card that should really be called a 5070 The higher end of the enthusiast price bracket has been milked for every penny and I have no idea how people can drop this kind of coin for such middling upgrades Definitely going to look hard at AMD when I do finally feel the need to upgrade but at this rate I might just keep my PC until it dies and return to buying stuff on console first,,0.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbavkfe,JSoppenheimer,,102,2025-02-06 15:04:47,,,,Yup RTX 3080 is hitting the point where it still runs everything alright with some compromises but it would be nice to upgrade and get stressfree high framerates on ultra settings again if there was a sensible upgrade option available And while it is undeniable that RTX 5080 would be a big upgrade if you just solely look at the performance delta between 3080 5080 everything else about the launch just feels scummy as hell Pitiful generational increase from the last gen even more pitiful availability high prices dubious amounts of VRAM all that very much kills my enthusiasm for upgrading until it becomes a real necessity not just a would be nice option,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbb6u6m,audigex,,51,2025-02-06 15:59:10,,,,1080 gang here Its starting to show its age but Id rather drop to medium settings than drop 1525k on a graphics card,mbb3d29,3.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbbf94s,joomla00,,6,2025-02-06 16:38:19,,,,Recently got a legion go rather than a 4060 super Which probably woulda req me to upgrade my 3rd gen i5k too Its been a great buy I think Im done with desktop PC gaming Unless I plunge into vr or something,mbb6u6m,4.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbbp3wh,audigex,,8,2025-02-06 17:23:28,,,,Yeah I spend a lot of my gaming time on my Steam Deck now and Im lucky that I play a bunch of older games rather than primarily new AAA titles eg OpenTTD Factorio Minecraft World of Warships Star Trek Online arent very demanding I can afford it but I just cant justify the cost to myself to upgrade with these ripoff prices for my usage,mbbf94s,5.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbckb2f,madmofo145,,1,2025-02-06 19:46:44,,,,Yeah Id be happy to upgrade but the best option in the range Ive been willing to spend would be a 60 series and performance there has been stagnant,mbb6u6m,4.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbd95wb,Sabotskij,,1,2025-02-06 21:40:25,,,,I mean i recently got a 7800xt for less than 500 which is cheapish here You dont have to buy nvidia to upgrade Sure its not the aboslute best you could maybe get a 4070 for the same price as the 7800xt and itd be slightly better but if youre happy with a 1080 the difference between them is not going to matter to you,mbb6u6m,4.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbcujty,shaky2236,,3,2025-02-06 20:33:54,,,,My 1660ti still does enough for me tbh I dont really play graphically intensive games on my PC and use it mainly for strategy games or older games If I wanna play something that looks fancy I just play on console Id love a fancy GPU but Im fine with what I have for now and might upgrade in another year or 2 I just cant justify to myself paying that kinda money,mbb3d29,3.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbcyniq,jawshoeaw,,1,2025-02-06 20:52:29,,,,Is a 5080 a big upgrade It would be lower power usage Otherwise it seems like for most use cases itd a moderate upgrade,mbavkfe,2.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbd9y06,Dave10293847,,1,2025-02-06 21:43:56,,,,I think this is their business model now though DLSS extends lifespan plus game graphics are hitting diminishing returns So if youre nvidia expecting people to upgrade every other year is just non existent like it used to be So jack up the price and target people getting entirely new computers In other words theyre targeting a sale every four to six years instead of every third,mbavkfe,2.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbdkoma,JSoppenheimer,,2,2025-02-06 22:34:54,,,,Trying to get one at release was truly a struggle but considering what you got for the price it was worth every last cent I paid for it zero doubts about that Basically a superb GPU with a horrible launch Now it feels like you get the worst of both worlds having to fight over a product that brings very disappointing improvements when compared to the previous gen and one that has some worrying shortcomings if you consider the future VRAM OK I admit it 3080s 10 GB VRAM also hasnt aged that graciously but in 2020 nobody really expected that VRAM requirements would rocket up so damn fast in the following 4 years Meanwhile 5080s 16 GB is already cutting dangerously close in some extreme scenarios and if it does so now its not hard to guess how it will be with the most demanding releases 24 years from today,mbdf4w4,3.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbhhxx5,Piett_1313,,1,2025-02-07 14:51:51,,,,I opened the Newegg app after a discord pinged me they were in stock Literally blind bought my card I was moving so fast and had to I failed multiple times before Got EVGA FTW3 and then decided to embrace RGB for the first time Seems like the 50 series is a similar paper launch that the 30 series was in Fall 2020 I cant believe Ive had this card for over four years now time just doesnt feel real anymore And honestly Im not playing anything crazy on my PC so itll definitely hold up fine for whatever compromises I need to make on the settings My pal just got an AMD card when the word came out about the 50 series not reviewing super and now the card he got is completely out of stock Im glad I dont need to play the buying a GPU game and will hold off as long as I can,mbdkoma,4.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbeuhrm,Earthbound_X,,1,2025-02-07 02:43:50,,,,I have a 3070 and I think an over 10 year old CPU and I can still play a lot of games at 60FPS some at max settings or near max at 1080p1440p Or some at least medium or high of every game Ive tried Even something like Doom Eternal I could play at 4K if I wanted to but thats ID they still optimize their games unlike seemingly everyone else,mbavkfe,2.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbc036n,SehrGuterContent,,7,2025-02-06 18:13:40,,,,The 3080 is slowly becoming the used market goat They go for around 300400 and theres absolutely nothing new thats even close to that price point They have 6070 of the performance of the 10001200 MSRP 5080 and its market price is even higher,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbfswu3,cretek3,,1,2025-02-07 06:34:52,,,,dude idk ill just say I had a 3080 and picked up a 5080 and the gain feels greater than that feels closer to twice as fast solid upgrade would definitely keep an eye out for one if you can I still have my 3080 not sure what im gonna list it for yet,mbc036n,2.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbcoxpt,droppinkn0wledge,,2,2025-02-06 20:08:00,,,,I built a new system last month with plans to upgrade from a 3080 to a 5090 Wound up just buying a 4090 and I dont regret it at all The 4090 is still expensive but it crushes 3440x1440p 240hz Upgrading and price and value is all relative I have rifle optics worth more than a new 5090 But the availability and minimal uplift from 40xx to 50xx is what made me settle for the 4090 It also gave me the excuse to build a whole new tower and take advantage of DDR5 ram,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbbkrof,DDRDiesel,,2,2025-02-06 17:03:22,,,,Got myself a 3060ti during the height of Covid thanks to luck and following the right discord servers for drop info The down side is I paid 800 for that card so you better believe Im getting every last frame from this card before I retire it,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbc3yq7,fuzzy_man_cum,,1,2025-02-06 18:31:40,,,,Before reality kicked in I had considered selling my 4070TI and getting the 5080 paying the nominal difference But theres just no point and now they want to gouge you further for that MFG might have been a good reason to upgrade but only if the raw performance increased enough but its just not there Now we are dealing with scarcity and price shenanigans its just like there hasnt been a release at all Just wait for the 60 series for Nvidias upgrade on the 40 series 50 series is definitely worth your attention if youre a low end 40 series user or still running a pre40 series card but I just feel you lot are getting fucked out of your cash and Im fed up with it all too,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbc6eux,Icy_Dream_3028,,1,2025-02-06 18:42:56,,,,My 1080ti was still pushing out 4K 60fps on certain AAA games depending on how well they were optimized well into 2020 I upgraded to a 3080ti and can run the majority of AAA games with everything set at ultra and Im still getting 80 to 100 FPS Ill be damned if I see a compelling reason to upgrade my GPU before it dies,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbdagol,couchfucker2,,1,2025-02-06 21:46:16,,,,As a 3090 owner yeah thats exactly what I thought to myself including middling upgrade Perfect description Maybe Im just used to the 2000s but I want no less than double the performance when I upgrade I guess a caveat here though is Id also appreciate less power and heat to some degree Ive never been in a situation where Im essentially creating a space heater using GPU running computations as my filament,mbab8g8,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbatnpk,JadowArcadia,,3,2025-02-06 14:55:10,,,,Realistically I was only considering a 5080 Seems like the only kind of upgrade that would make sense but as more info came out I kinda feel like its difficult to justify I still get great performance in 90 of games on day 1 Id essentially be buying a new card purely for the fake frames for certain specific games Would be cool to 100 frames in Cyberpunk instead of the 4570 I currently get but I dont think thats worth 1000 Id say save the money or spend it on a different part Maybe your CPU could use an upgrade or something I just spent my money new bass guitar instead,mbamk0w,4.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbb6lb7,audigex,,37,2025-02-06 15:58:01,,,,Is it them hoping to cash in on the fomo Basically yes Fundamentally its just supply and demand if youre running a company aiming to make a profit then your aim is to maximise profit Therefore your aim is to sell all your stock at the maximum possible price Why sell it for 2000 when you can sell it for 2400 Usually the risk is that another competitor comes in and sells theirs for less but with astonishingly high barriers to entry so much of our tech industry has become a duopoly at best and thus theres not enough competition to force prices down At the end of the day prices will always be set at what people will pay If they sell out at 2400 theyre gonna keep selling it for 2400 or even test higher prices than that,mba6jmg,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbdd6dl,Psychast,,1,2025-02-06 21:58:51,,,,I got good news for you A 300 dollar card literally any of them today will decimate that 1070 in every game You dont have to pay a single red cent more than what you paid all those years ago Here you go bro 300 dollar 6650XT You can even play 1440p at good frames with this one Theres no reason to be a martyr just because value is really bad right now compared to 5 to 10 years ago Then again Graphics demand is also shifting in a time of changing video game landscapes Like you said 99 of the games you actually play run fine on an 8 year old card Why is that I think its because so many games now are built for PC AND mobile Fortnite for instance and a huge increase in good games made by small teams Hollow Knight for instance that anyone who only plays just those basically needs the barebones minimum of GPUs This apparently hasnt offset demand but it is interesting that theres a whole genre of players out there that basically never touch AAA games and thus havent had an actual need for GPU upgrades in a long time,mbacv6m,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbfnypy,ModsRTryhards,,1,2025-02-07 05:53:32,,,,Omg say the GPU cost 500 The GPU costs 500 the same as the ps5 Say its free The total price of the PC still costs a lot more and online gaming isnt a financial factor I feel this is cut and dry and you are discussing something else A steam deck is not a PC You are entirely missing the point,mbdif9h,8.0,1ij14vs

comment,mba5s9f,IndyPoker979,,3,2025-02-06 12:34:16,,,,That is a great chart What that says to me is that in the past 6 years gamers have decided the cost is becoming too expensive and so theyre keeping the cards they have as games have not needed to upgrade I would love to see a larger chart to see if the past 56 years is a distinct change or if it was just a blip when everyone upgraded to a new card 10802070 to 30704070 I will say that this past few years the trend seems to have changed but for me that indicates they are pricing themselves out of the GPU market for the average user Really nice visual though,mba44cd,2.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbad3mg,kevihaa,,-7,2025-02-06 13:22:37,,,,Care to elaborate Were basically 3 generations deep into the vast majority of games being developed for consoles with PC as an afterthought Like Cyberpunk released 4 years ago and is still used as a benchmark both for whether PCs can finally run it maxed out at 100 FPS still not possible without DLSS and as basically the only example of when there is a truly significant gap in visual fidelity between a 600 console and a 1500 GPU,mbaafgg,2.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbaeydn,Dirty_Dragons,,9,2025-02-06 13:33:52,,,,The primary reason why I prefer pc gaming is mods And of course I want my games to look good I dont care about getting 300 fps I just want 4k 60 Which unfortunately the vast majority of games on console arent Final Fantasy Rebirth on PS5 is 4k 30 Or 1152p 60 Am I an elitist for not wanting to play at 30 FPS,mbad3mg,3.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbaxs0w,btown1987,,3,2025-02-06 15:15:50,,,,I completely agree Thats why this whole current GPU conversation is just completely unhinged The reality is that cards from two generations ago will play fine at 4k with dlssfsr at 80 fps These idiots are shelling out thousands to watch an fps counter go higher and wouldnt even be able to tell a difference without the counter turned on,mbaeydn,4.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbb63hh,ModsRTryhards,,2,2025-02-06 15:55:41,,,,I agree with you but he doesnt make a terrible point It will all come down to preferences and But there are a decent amount of games that run 4k at 60 I just finished Cyberpunk thats one of em I think going forward the 40k at 60 is going to be pretty prevalent So if thats all you need and you arent loaded or craving mods a console is a fantastic option I want a gaming PC I havent had one since 2019 when I lost a job and sold it to my friend since I needed to keep paying bills I have a PS5 because in the mean time it was an affordable option And Im still not buying all the components for a PC for a while Im guessing For someone who doesnt already own a gaming PC consoles are a great option in this current market I thought that was his main point I duno,mbaeydn,4.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbbq4c9,Dirty_Dragons,,2,2025-02-06 17:28:06,,,,I agree with you but he doesnt make a terrible point It will all come down to preferences and It irked me a little when he made it seem that a 1500 GPU is required for PC gaming which of course isnt true Also he made it seem that he only benefit to PC gaming was high FPS The other major benefit to a gaming PC is emulation Right now the best way to play Bloodborne is on PC I think going forward the 40k at 60 is going to be pretty prevalent I hope so Nobody should be playing at 30 FPS in 2025 Sucks about you losing your job and having to sell the computer Hopefully youll be able to get another soon And yeah the 5000 series GPU is rough,mbb63hh,5.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbalbe6,gbghgs,,1,2025-02-06 14:10:22,,,,The obvious rejoinder is obviously that much more budget friendly cards exists that give comparable performance to consoles compared to these top end cards which go for ridiculous prices The less obvious one is that the costs even out a lot more once you consider the yearly subscriptions fees console players end up paying out for over the lifetime of a console and that your game libary on pc isnt tied to specific hardware the same way console games are,mba7k6h,1.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbg8fmw,Less_Party,,1,2025-02-07 09:06:24,,,,Would be cool if there was actual competition instead of AMD going well heres a card thats almost as fast but lacks half the features for the same price and Intel focusing exclusively on the highly coveted immediately obsolete segment,,0.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbmofg4,Tangentkoala,,1,2025-02-08 08:31:59,,,,When are they going to make a graphics card for the everyday man I thought we would have a graphics card war to see who can make the cheapest yet efficent graphics card once we met the 4k threshold We got tricked into the fps war and now we have settings up to 360 fps Do we really need a 500 fps monitor The fucks the point in that,,0.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbasi4l,compound-interest,,1,2025-02-06 14:49:15,,,,Id love if there was an investigation on whether stock levels are manipulated to keep demand and prices high In a low competition market it wouldnt surprise me if even the nondata center silicon allocation isnt being sold in good faith Its one thing if they simply didnt allocate any but its another if they are sitting on chips and trickling them out long term to manipulate markets,,0.0,1ij14vs

comment,mbara2b,RaNdMViLnCE,,0,2025-02-06 14:42:47,,,,What could I possibly do with this new card that I cant already do on a 4060 TI for less then 600cad Hell a basic 4060 can play every single game made has Ray tracing and all the other fun features doesnt it And thats like 450 CAD Im just not seeing the appeal As a casual gamer anyway everything runs great for me as is So serious question what does one gain from upgrading from a 4060 to one of these new cards Slightly higher FPS when I already dont have FPS issues,,0.0,1ij14vs
comment,mbbc4go,AmStupid,,2,2025-02-06 16:23:58,,,,I was using a 3060ti for the longest time and pretty much said the same thing until I upgraded my monitor recently Just a quick example a 4080S is still unable to drive a Samsung 57 ultra wide to full 7680x2160 240Hz on ultra settings not even close Even at 5120x1440 240Hz on high setting once a while it may dip into the 30s FPS range when playing neweraction games like Forza I am not complaining I am at my happy place and I am not going to upgrade to chase that last bit of performance my old eyes cant catch up anyways Though on the production side solidworks blender and such I did get a nice boost from upgrading so I assume the newer gen will give a slight edge too,mbara2b,1.0,1ij14vs
