comment,m2z7q5d,drmirage809,,32,2024-12-20 13:19:27,,,,Looking very likely Valve have been adding a lot Lenovo Legion specific stuff to Steam OS lately But also ROG Ally support They did say that the plan was for Steam OS to be publicly available for installing on everything eventually Them bringing Steam OS to the Lenovo handheld and ROG Ally would be a good start towards that,m2vaimt,1.0,1hi02m9

comment,m33vxjx,dzikakulka,,1,2024-12-21 07:52:01,,,,That sounds great I love SD as a casual player but I imagine people that really want to play AAA games are in a mediocre spot right now Win on handhelds really is rough,m2vcnsw,1.0,1hi02m9
comment,m2yrukd,MattBrey,,11,2024-12-20 10:57:25,,,,We need SteamOS to become a viable OS for third parties I have a dream about a bunch of consoles from Lenovo MSI Asus etc all running the same OS and competing in specs like PCs but completely geared towards gaming so that theyre as efficient as possible How can these be profitable Idk because a huge part of the console business model is revenue from their own stores But I can dream,,0.0,1hi02m9
comment,m2zxz51,R4VANG3R,,7,2024-12-20 16:04:02,,,,So like steam machines,m2yrukd,1.0,1hi02m9
comment,m2zu0c3,AutistcCuttlefish,,1,2024-12-20 15:41:37,,,,Theyll be profitable the same way other categories of hardware are by pricing themselves accordingly The odds that any of these will undercut the steam deck on price without major hardware cuts are basically null Its pretty safe to say that these handheld consoles will be priced more like laptops than consoles,m2yrukd,1.0,1hi02m9
comment,m33gz3t,DaoFerret,,1,2024-12-21 05:23:29,,,,OP isnt talking about competing with SteamDeck Theyre talking about a SteamOS console competing with PlayStation XBox,m2zu0c3,2.0,1hi02m9
comment,m353919,AutistcCuttlefish,,-1,2024-12-21 14:42:00,,,,Well thats not happening either Like I said the profitability model is gonna be more like a laptop than a console or the steamdeck Any SteamOS console that tries to compete with XboxPS5 will have a bunch of hurdles the least of which will be a necessarily higher price A lack of DRM and Anticheat support will be much bigger obstacles and not one that consumers that would traditionally buy consoles would be willing to put up with,m33gz3t,3.0,1hi02m9
