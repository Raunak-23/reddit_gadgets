comment,m8n7l0t,ShadowPhynix,,8,2025-01-23 01:06:13,,,,If they rereleased an identical copy of the 6p but with modern hardware Id buy it in a heartbeat I was gutted when the big core fail issue happened to me if anyone has one with this issue and lost photos as a result theres a fix on XDA now,m8k2r2f,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8o9n6c,_Spectre0_,,1,2025-01-23 04:47:28,,,,Big core fail You mean the battery dying faster than a candle in the wind Or was there a different major issue plaguing that model I say this as someone who loved the design and both copies of that phone outside that issue RMAd the first to get the second then switched to an iPhone before it could affect the second too which it eventually did but thankfully I wasnt reliant on it Still wouldnt buy a google phone again anytime soon but glad to see Apple rip the good parts of that design off,m8n7l0t,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8p0r4l,ShadowPhynix,,3,2025-01-23 08:43:53,,,,The performance CPU cores had a critical issue that could cause them to totally fail resulting in a bootloop because initial boot would occur with the smaller cores then when they tried to initialise the bigger ones it would crash restart loop tbh I wish I could go back Id take incompetence accidentally killing the battery than competence intentionally killing the battery cant wait to get rid of my iphone now that android watches have started to finally catch up,m8o9n6c,3.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8pwvhy,ShadowPhynix,,1,2025-01-23 13:25:52,,,,I only found out earlier today when I decided to google the issue to make sure I wasnt completely misremembering it so I cant vouch for it but comments seem rather positive Use your own judgement and all that,m8pr2zl,3.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8pb5xp,Florian422,,1,2025-01-23 10:33:25,,,,Never tried the rear finger print reader but I still use my honor 20 Huawei nova 5t with the finger print reader being on the power button on the right side Its been years and its still working perfectly doesnt take any space and works every time I dont know why so few phones used that the placement is perfect too and falls right under my thumb at any time,m8k2r2f,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k7brx,ASK_ABT_MY_USERNAME,,0,2025-01-22 16:37:16,,,,I find on screen ones just as convenient maybe even better,m8k2r2f,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kdd55,Fomentation,,21,2025-01-22 17:04:34,,,,The biggest part for me is the groove for the scanner on the back of the phone that was a non visual indicator of where the finger should be Id have it unlocked as it was coming out of my pocket On screen fingerprint readers just dont have the same physical indicator Probably doesnt matter for people that can get the muscle memory down but its something that I find myself missing on modern hardware,m8k7brx,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kqezw,kooldude700,,2,2025-01-22 18:03:02,,,,Dont know how long you been using on screen scanner for but for me it was annoying at first especially since the s10s scanner is tiny however I got used to it pretty quickly and could nail it down everytime Honestly not that big of a deal especially since phones have bigger ones now too,m8kdd55,3.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8l2lkh,RGB3x3,,0,2025-01-22 18:56:56,,,,Its godawful on Pixels at least pixel 8 and below The thing barely ever registers my thumb and fucks up constantly At least the ultrasonic ones are much better than the optical,m8kqezw,4.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8l5hpf,Lrauka,,0,2025-01-22 19:09:51,,,,I have a 6 pro and it works every time unless my finger is not on the sensor correctly or something like that But I can pull my phone out and muscle memory my finger onto the screen and have it opened up before I even see the screen itself You may have had a bad scanner,m8l2lkh,5.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8m05ls,toomanymarbles83,,3,2025-01-22 21:26:33,,,,The screen one on my Pixel 7 is absolute junk Doesnt recognize my finger most of the time,m8k7brx,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k5esc,Tzayad,,1,2025-01-22 16:28:13,,,,Yeah fuck this in the display shit Only works 30 of the time if Im lucky and if you do it in low light like in the middle of the night in bed the flash from the finger reader is fucking blinding,m8k2r2f,1.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8k06h2,blacksoxing,,42,2025-01-22 16:03:56,,,,I loved my Nexus 6P but remember all the issues it had So many issues that Google went hey umm send us your 6P and well send you a brand new Pixel Note I did and the mic in my Pixel went out a month after its warranty ended and it hurt my heart so much that I left the Google lineup and eventually went to IOS It was just pitiful that the only way I could talk to someone was via bluetooth and worse that Googles CS was like yeah you can take it to iFixit but it will be about 300,,0.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kchij,Acceptable-Truck3803,,3,2025-01-22 17:00:33,,,,And the nexus 6P was my fav with cyanogenmod It took a lot to pry that phone away from me even after the warranty ended,m8k06h2,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k3r9q,SpicyRice99,,5,2025-01-22 16:20:32,,,,Same story with my Pixel 6 display lol,m8k06h2,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m9nyr8v,One_Stranger7794,,1,2025-01-28 17:08:37,,,,Almost identical story got the 6P and loves it until battery started dying at 30 side button and headphone jack stopped working etc Got a Pixel as a replacement and it was good for a month The coolest thing about it was the squeeze for assistant but that and the screen gave out a few weeks later Unless otherwise proven I dont really have any faith in Googles hardware design,m8k06h2,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m9nz7pq,blacksoxing,,1,2025-01-28 17:10:57,,,,I agree and honestly if those two things never happened Id be a person who would probably be rocking whatever the latest Pixel is right now Instead Im now using an iPhone 13PM and frankly have zero desire to even attempt to change it,m9nyr8v,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m9oj6ug,One_Stranger7794,,1,2025-01-28 18:42:02,,,,Ya I feel like Google fumbling the Pixel line in its early days is still causing a lot of others to think the same,m9nz7pq,3.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8jy1if,objecter12,,29,2025-01-22 15:54:02,,,,Maybe unpopular opinion but I dont think Apple should shed its style for that Im all for changing things up every few gens but aping googles camera structure isnt the answer,,0.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8jyjgw,correctingStupid,,63,2025-01-22 15:56:20,,,,A symmetrical high up camera bar is undeniably better than a phone that wobbles on a desk and doesnt fit cradles well,m8jy1if,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k00d7,garry4321,,10,2025-01-22 16:03:08,,,,Right Apeing a style is a GREAT call when your style makes no fucking sense and is functionally illogical They literally make phones that cant lie flat without a case,m8jyjgw,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k32ef,gadgetluva,,5,2025-01-22 16:17:22,,,,Theres really not too many ways to build out a camera system these days if you want to have 3 lenses You either go vertical Samsung horizontal Google or cluster them on one side iPhone or in the middle OnePlusChinese OEMs Apple moving to a horizontal layout may be stealing from NexusPixel but its probably the best option for a new design since Googles phones are the least popularrecognized in the market,m8jy1if,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k88o9,TedClaxton94,,2,2025-01-22 16:41:26,,,,Personally I think were underestimating the power of Apple branding I dont think an average consumer will look at this and think it look like a pixel Theyll look at pixel and think it looks like the new iPhone Of course you may have a different reason for wanting them to keep their current style or do something other than this But thought Id give my two cents on the branding angle,m8jy1if,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8prsqt,NuclearReactions,,1,2025-01-23 12:53:11,,,,Its ok if its the superior design So tired of my phone wobbling when i use it while its laying on the desk,m8jy1if,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kpdf7,leo-g,,0,2025-01-22 17:58:21,,,,It is expected to house the front camera elements too The rest of the body can go as slim as the usbc port will allow them but the camera has a minimum thickness due to how light works Its incredibly Applelike to have these sort of visual trickery in a good way,m8jy1if,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kptp0,leo-g,,8,2025-01-22 18:00:21,,,,I dont think anybody realise that this design is pretty smart in the context of Apple The thick bump is expected to house the front camera elements too The rest of the body can go as slim as the usbc port will allow them but the cameras has a minimum thickness due to how light works Its incredibly Applelike to have these sort of visual trickery in a good way,,0.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8krrpg,jamesbecker211,,3,2025-01-22 18:09:07,,,,I guess Im confused as to why Apple thought make them even thinner was what we wanted We want long lasting batteries and useful features A thin phone will sacrifice both of those for the sake of being thin and light,,0.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8ohbno,aBunchOfSpiders,,2,2025-01-23 05:44:04,,,,The goal of making devices thinner pushes innovation into slimming down components and also makes the devices be perceived as higher end by consumers If you have two identically equipped devices and one is thicker just because the battery lasts longer will look less futuristic and impressive to most consumers That part sucks but the push to make components smaller and more efficient is quite useful in the long run Also smaller devices means less material used Might be a tiny amount per device but multiply that by tens of millions of devices and the company could be saving a big chunk of cash on raw materials Not saying I agree with this direction fully but these are some of the big reasons With how phones have been perceived lately I think releasing a skinnier phone actually could bring some excitement back to users even if its all superficial,m8krrpg,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8ps1k2,NuclearReactions,,1,2025-01-23 12:54:50,,,,I dont want thin i want smaller Iphone 4 sized,m8krrpg,1.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8kdmye,PlaneCandy,,0,2025-01-22 17:05:49,,,,Yall are calling Apple out for copying but there are only so many variations that can be done on a rectangular slab with 3 cameras in the back that have to be out of the way of your hands,,0.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8l2k0m,IE114EVR,,1,2025-01-22 18:56:46,,,,In this case it looks like 1 camera so it begs the question why does the visor stretch across the back It seems like an aesthetic choice Unless this could this be how they will arrange their 23 camera array for other iPhones,m8kdmye,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8lqvax,proanimus,,2,2025-01-22 20:45:33,,,,Yeah I wonder if this is intended to standardize the layout across their lineup Same camera bar regardless of the number of cameras and sensors,m8l2k0m,2.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8k02x2,Fritzschmied,,-10,2025-01-22 16:03:28,,,,Honestly it looked shit on Google phones and it still looks shit Modern phones are just so bad looking without a case that makes it uniform on the back Why cant we just have a slightly thicker phone both banger battery life and no camera bump That hole making it thinner for no reason is fuckin pointless,,0.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k5oiw,gadgetluva,,3,2025-01-22 16:29:30,,,,Because thick bulky phones dont sell well People want large screens but slim devices Why do you think every company goes after thinness and touts it in their marketing materials Big batteries are great but not at the expense of size and bulkiness,m8k02x2,1.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8k89v5,Fritzschmied,,1,2025-01-22 16:41:34,,,,I dont say that the phones have to be really thick But one mm more that what are the current iPhones wont hurt anybody and the camera would already be able to be flush And honestly I often read comments all over the internet that are the same opinion Especially the people that actually use their phones for work and not just run after the newest trend Also its just not possible to buy a flagship with a flat camera So you dont really have a choice to express it with your wallet Maybe people do want it Or if they actually dont want to make it thicker then they should at least try to make the camera smaller and not an eyesore Honestly the camera quality is already good enough for a phone and most of the quality comes from the post processing anyways No need to include bigger optics And if you actually want to make nice pictures a phone doesnt cut it anyways,m8k5oiw,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kzrag,gadgetluva,,1,2025-01-22 18:44:30,,,,Phones would need to be 23mm thicker to be flush with the cameras which is pretty substantial since phones are only around 8mm thick thats a 2535 increase in thickness May not sound like a lot on paper but it translates to a far worse bulkier feel in hand Thick phones just dont sell Ill also point out that I see a lot of comments about wanting flush phones too but its easy to have an opinion about a hypothetical but its different to actually follow through with a purchase,m8k89v5,3.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8l3pnr,Fritzschmied,,1,2025-01-22 19:01:54,,,,Would take it Because it would be the same as now I just wouldnt use a case because if the camera is flush its useless anyways,m8kzrag,4.0,1i7e1tt

comment,m8k9hh3,Fritzschmied,,0,2025-01-22 16:47:03,,,,Why is it so hard to understand to people that 1mm thicker wouldnt hurt anybody but it would just make it a better phone in every aspect,m8k8me7,2.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kagks,HooHooHooAreYou,,2,2025-01-22 16:51:28,,,,Not for everyone I would prefer a phone as you said because I often go long periods of time without being next to a charger My wife can charge her phone on a wireless desktop charger all day and wants her phone to be thinner lighter and easier to fit into pockets and other places To overcome most camera bumps and signficantly improve battery life were looking at impactfully more than 1mm,m8k9hh3,3.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kbdti,Fritzschmied,,1,2025-01-22 16:55:37,,,,Yea I understand that those people exist that want thin phones but why is there just not an option for a slightly thicker flagship phone with no fucking camera sticking out and more battery life Thats the thing I mainly criticize Not that the thin phones exist but rather that the thick phones dont exist besides some gimmicks like the one you mentioned,m8kagks,4.0,1i7e1tt
comment,m8kc2hl,Fritzschmied,,1,2025-01-22 16:58:42,,,,Also if you charge you phone all the time its shit for longevity because the battery goes to shit faster If you have to charge your phone only ever 23 days it will last you way longer in general which in turn is also better for the environment,m8kagks,4.0,1i7e1tt
