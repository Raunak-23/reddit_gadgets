comment,m6al0yn,TheFlusteredcustard,,1,2025-01-09 21:25:35,,,,Sounds like an easy way to kickstart industrialization in a growing nation As long as your population isnt frothing at the mouth in rage that they cant get one you can ask whatever you want and get big tech to pony up Thats why it could never kill trade its only really viable for luxury items being sold by companies who are pretty close to the limit of their current market area,m67qlmp,3.0,1hwk4vp
comment,m65ey4q,DarkTreader,,-1,2025-01-09 01:09:58,,,,Wait bizarre Why is this bizarre Bait meet click If you believe the cynical view or a generous view this is about clout iPhones have a much greater chance of being a long term investment and require more expertise overall 1 billion investment in a 401k is a better investment than 1 billion in a 2 savings account for example Apple is still trying to lowball them no mater whose side you are on My only beef with this is calling something so transparent as bizarre,,0.0,1hwk4vp
comment,m6alm51,TheFlusteredcustard,,2,2025-01-09 21:28:28,,,,Bizarre is a stretch but I think it meets the criteria of _unusual_ at least Ive never heard of a country doing this although the article claims others have in the past I hope it works out for them though,m65ey4q,1.0,1hwk4vp
comment,m65udeo,LupusDeusMagnus,,-4,2025-01-09 02:39:40,,,,I hope more countries demand that if only to see how Apple would do logistics at some point too many plants spread through too many countries would just be a hindrance for a bunch of reasons The article mentions Indonesia as a market for 246 million people but thats not exactly true Indonesia might have nearly 250m but the vast majority of the people cant afford iPhones What if a country like Mexico I think Apple already is putting some production centers there asks for it Mexico might have a much lower population but the iPhone market is much bigger currently about twice as Indonesia as its a richer country Same with Brazil nearly three times the Indonesian market Maybe even some eastern EU countries Do it countries,,0.0,1hwk4vp
comment,m65veap,SQL617,,0,2025-01-09 02:45:47,,,,The average income across Indonesia is 186month Population wise Indonesia is huge spending wise theyre a relatively small market especially when youre a company trying to sell 1000 phones,,0.0,1hwk4vp
