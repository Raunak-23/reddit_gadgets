comment,m953d00,TapTapTapTapTapTaps,,3,2025-01-25 19:31:59,,,,Yep this will show Apple has completely lost their way Just following niche trends and having no competitive advantage to doing so,m94xmgm,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m953ljh,watduhdamhell,,2,2025-01-25 19:33:08,,,,Apple is not known to innovate just to do what works So I agree Dont innovate apple Stick to what works after others figure it out,m953d00,2.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m953uq8,TapTapTapTapTapTaps,,3,2025-01-25 19:34:23,,,,They do whats already been done but usually way better and innovate on whats been done There was already an iPhone like device tablet device etc they did it better There is nothing about fold screens thats going to be done better to a point that people will care,m953ljh,3.0,1i9u7l0

comment,m94zxnf,RhetoricalOrator,,4,2025-01-25 19:15:25,,,,Ive got a couple friends with them who like them Now that Im semiretired and not doing rough work that would immediately destroy one I would actually consider a foldable Not Apple but someone with a good foldable that gives me more screen real estate with an equivalent footprint in my pocket than a slab phone,m94ycbg,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m950s1p,Hextorz,,1,2025-01-25 19:19:29,,,,Good insight thanks Have they figured out the crease in the screens over time,m94zxnf,2.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m951o32,RhetoricalOrator,,3,2025-01-25 19:23:48,,,,I cant speak for all models but just looking at the Samsung Fold its looked like theyve made significant improvements to the crease from the first gen to current gen And Im not sure that they are the best Mrwhostheboss has shown some foldables that may just be available in the Chinese or EU markets that look way better than anything Samsung has,m950s1p,3.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m95g4m4,puf,,3,2025-01-25 20:36:14,,,,17 month user of the Motorola Razr 2023 model here I simply love the form factor of my phone It fits comfortably in my pockets I can pay without opening it and scanning notifications on the external screen is a breeze That said there are plenty of cons too The cameras on this model are not great the processor is slower than what I was used to from Pixels before that and the usage of the external display is suboptimal seriously its shameful how bad Google Maps uses the available space on it Over the time Ive had the phone the crease has come very noticeable and by now the phone doesnt fully open flat anymore Neither hinders my usage of it but YMMV Ive said since I got this phone that I love the flip form factor and am glad Motorola is providing good options but the moment Apple or Google makes one Id switch to that,m94ycbg,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m98kfhi,highgravityday2121,,1,2025-01-26 08:35:47,,,,Chinas top phone sellers are all foldable Theyre a huge market for Apple,m94ycbg,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m9fzao3,Leftieswillrule,,1,2025-01-27 12:48:49,,,,My friend has the pixel fold and he loves it but it seems to have a pretty limited applicability Hard to get excited about a screen twice the size of a normal smartphone when its still smaller than an ipad and I spend all my time around 27 monitors and 55 TVs anyway,m94ycbg,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m94zycs,CatPhysicist,,0,2025-01-25 19:15:31,,,,Its gimmicky at best but you know Apple has toyed with designs and has some prototypes,m94ycbg,1.0,1i9u7l0

comment,m94ykep,MetalBawx,,1,2025-01-25 19:08:46,,,,What we actually know Apples sales have taken a small dip and they belive it to be due to rivals putting out foldable phones So a foldable iPhone is on the way,,0.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m954e8p,watduhdamhell,,1,2025-01-25 19:37:02,,,,Just like they did with moving away from refusing to make large phones to only making large phones when their sales were slumping in 2012 as a direct result of Android moving that direction Apple has long been a follower in this space at least since the iPhone 4,m94ykep,1.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m9d4tcx,anonymousjeeper,,1,2025-01-27 00:18:27,,,,Bring back the 3GS form factor Phones are too damned large,,0.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m94yzyt,mbelmin,,-1,2025-01-25 19:10:52,,,,Does anyone think Apple wants to make premium device with a plastic screen,,0.0,1i9u7l0
comment,m950afh,RhetoricalOrator,,2,2025-01-25 19:17:09,,,,Im probably too optimistic but Im hoping when they finally release their take on foldables itll be something innovative with something significantly more durable than the current foldables which can be scratched by fingernails,m94yzyt,1.0,1i9u7l0
