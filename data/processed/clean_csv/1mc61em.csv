comment,n5t00ck,ch_limited,,13,2025-07-29 15:08:19,,,,This is what I learned very quickly about a decade ago and my enthusiasm for smart home technology rapidly dissipated Now what I use is unfortunately from the biggest brands that are sketchy in other ways and I still know that it will just turn to garbage overnight even though its still perfectly good,n5ref0e,1.0,1mc61em

comment,n65hjor,dgj212,,1,2025-07-31 12:17:25,,,,Same thankfully for people who are into it theres tons of videos online on how to make stuff smart on your own Still its saddening the amount of people who still go for this stuff like the folks who signed up to get a free TV that spies on them and feeds them ads whenever it detects they are around,n5t00ck,2.0,1mc61em

comment,n5sjvn8,shifty_coder,,8,2025-07-29 13:49:42,,,,Not natively but its a problem being attacked on two fronts the people lobbying to require the industry provide an offline or endoflife solution and the people reverseengineering devices to homebrew solutions that spoof the dedicated services,n5sb0zd,2.0,1mc61em

comment,n5rgf2r,rnilf,,77,2025-07-29 09:10:33,,,,As of June 26 though those core features require a 1188 NOK about 11656 annual subscription fee turning the smart home devices into dumb ones if users dont pay up Home Assistant running on a home server cloudbased bullshit Every Single Time FOSS no internet required no subscription more control Need I go on,,0.0,1mc61em
comment,n5sb7ra,Znuffie,,29,2025-07-29 13:02:33,,,,FOSS no internet required no subscription more control Need I go on HaOS has a huge entry barrier and its not for the faint of heart I keep seeing people suggesting HA in these kinds of threads but its really not simple for the average consumer,n5rgf2r,1.0,1mc61em
comment,n5sgmng,dakoellis,,11,2025-07-29 13:32:31,,,,Forgive me if im missing something due to my comfort with servers but is it still a difficult entry Im someone who has been using home assistant for years so I remember a bunch of the difficulties in getting setup but now they have hardware you can purchase and you can control everything via gui right whats hard for an average consumer to deal with at this point this is a legitimate question not an argument edit fixed a word,n5sb7ra,2.0,1mc61em
comment,n5t7pty,schmidtyb43,,8,2025-07-29 15:44:33,,,,9 out of 10 people will even be confused with you saying GUI let alone setting up a home server,n5sgmng,3.0,1mc61em
comment,n5tmneu,dakoellis,,3,2025-07-29 16:53:52,,,,Have you seen home assistant green Its basically an appliance you plug in and setup like one of those app based routers or a chromecast or something You dont need to setup a server with it and you dont need to know what GUI means to be able to use one,n5t7pty,4.0,1mc61em
comment,n5x20te,TheBeatGoesAnanas,,0,2025-07-30 03:33:27,,,,I know what GUI means and Id never heard of Home Assistant before opening this thread one minute ago,n5tmneu,5.0,1mc61em
comment,n5yvy5m,dakoellis,,3,2025-07-30 12:39:21,,,,So youre the target customer for Home Assistant Green Not sure what the relevance is for that statement,n5x20te,6.0,1mc61em
comment,n5z3njj,TheBeatGoesAnanas,,2,2025-07-30 13:22:30,,,,The relevance is that not knowing things like Home Assistant even exist is part of the barrier to entry for most people,n5yvy5m,7.0,1mc61em
comment,n5zhxgi,dakoellis,,1,2025-07-30 14:35:29,,,,advertising isnt part of a barrier to entry A barrier to entry is whether or not you have the tools you need to climb a wall to start using a product lack of advertising means you dont know the wall is even there,n5z3njj,8.0,1mc61em
comment,n5sjeqz,qa3rfqwef,,23,2025-07-29 13:47:16,,,,Youre coming at it from the perspective of someone with experience running a server Just setting up a server buying the hardware choosing your OS like Unraid or TrueNAS figuring out the right components for your Home Assistant getting the software running on whatever Linux kerneldistro youre using is already a massive barrier to entry compared to something you just buy turn on and walk through a firsttime setup with Theres a lot of knowledge and effort needed to do what youre saying All my friends who are pretty nerdy most have or could build their own gaming PC definitely have no idea how to buildrun a server never mind someone who maybe only uses a computer for their work sometimes How many average consumers even truly understand what a home server is,n5sgmng,3.0,1mc61em
comment,n5skhs6,AmericanBillGates,,12,2025-07-29 13:52:51,,,,Home assistant Yellow is a little appliance Plug and play Home assistant still benefits from a savvy user buy its getting easier The hardware is a non issue with the yellow project at least,n5sjeqz,4.0,1mc61em
comment,n5slgd3,qa3rfqwef,,4,2025-07-29 13:57:45,,,,This is cool Probably not idiot proof yet but something like this does greatly reduce entry barrier not looked into the space in a bit and didnt know of devices like these Thanks for sharing,n5skhs6,5.0,1mc61em
comment,n5sqb0f,AmericanBillGates,,5,2025-07-29 14:21:50,,,,Apparently there is yellow and green now Green is the friendlier version while yellow still lets you tinker a bit with the hardware Have a good day,n5slgd3,6.0,1mc61em
comment,n5vvoqk,DragonSlayerC,,3,2025-07-29 23:23:40,,,,The green is practically idiot proof Just plug in power and Ethernet and it works The yellow that was mentioned in the original comment does require a small amount of assembly but its easy and straight forward enough that even most nontech people could probably do it,n5slgd3,6.0,1mc61em
comment,n5ssokc,dakoellis,,2,2025-07-29 14:33:29,,,,yeah Home Assistant Green is what I was talking about it seems like a very similar setup to a lot of other commercial home automation hubs where you just plug it in and dont have to worry about any of the things you mention in the first paragraph but I cant say for certain since I havent used it,n5sjeqz,4.0,1mc61em
comment,n5tmcuw,Znuffie,,1,2025-07-29 16:52:32,,,,I think the target for HA YellowGreen is people who are already investedfamiliar with the ecosystem You dont really want to buy an appliance to realize then it doesnt really do what you wantdoesnt fix your issue Im also very familiar with servers as Linux servers have been my career in the last 15 years but Some bits of my adventure Wanted to install it on a small SBC I have but where I already run stuff Unfortunately thats not really possible it is its own OS which may or may not support my SBC You can obviously use the Docker version but thats extremely limited to the devicesintegrations supported as you cant really add extra addons to it Because I do work professionally with all sort of virtualizations techs and have access to many resources I do not really keep extra PCsservers around my house so I didnt really have another target to slap it on except my PC where I do my work but I also run VMWare Workstation Pro So the obvious solution is to download the OVA and import it Downloaded done Ok importing fails Why does it fail Well something about sha checksum missmatch OVA are just zip files so lets unpack it Unpacked checked the manifest file sha checksum was a match to the vmdk file disk image so no idea why it failedcomplained Had to delete the manifest to be able to import it Once that was done it booted just fine more or less and I had it running on my network in bridge mode First of all didnt really see any of my IoT devices the only thing it automatically detected was my Android TV So I had to manually add my devicesintegrations First was Sensibo its a shit device btw but its the most accurate temperaturehumidity sensor I have right now in my house For that I had to create an API key on the Sensibo website and then add it manually No local control it seems all trough the Cloud Next was the AC The local module for my AC is no longer working some firmware versions no work so you need to use the cloud So this is the only one working but to install that I first need to install HACS which is not just clicking a button and that actually annoyed me a bit cause it wasnt exactly intuitive even after I installed the installer for it The 3rd part was just me having to write an automation for the stuff I wanted but that was also a pain because the point and click builder wasnt sufficient so I had to do YAML Again Im a happy case because I have all the tech knowledge behind but a normal person wants shit to just work,n5sgmng,3.0,1mc61em
comment,n5se0c8,sockgorilla,,3,2025-07-29 13:18:10,,,,Especially when the alternative is getting up and turning the lights on,n5sb7ra,2.0,1mc61em
comment,n5vvacf,DragonSlayerC,,1,2025-07-29 23:21:28,,,,Home Assistant Green is plug and play though Literally just plug in the power cord and an Ethernet cable and configure through a web browser or the app,n5sb7ra,2.0,1mc61em
comment,n5stsr6,EconomyDoctor3287,,1,2025-07-29 14:38:50,,,,Whats the deal with HA Never used it myself I run everything through Nodered and then MQTT for the communication And then the important parts get a telegram bot integration Am I missing out on something by not using HA,n5sb7ra,2.0,1mc61em
comment,n5t0cye,Znuffie,,2,2025-07-29 15:10:00,,,,Vibrant community that churns out custom integrations For example my AC requires me to use the native app and has no local control possibility but someone made an integration for HA which while still uses their cloud allows me to still control the AC unit and it does so with all the functions available Theres obviously other3rd party stuff I could use like IR blasters to control it but it doesnt really handle all the functions my AC has which is frustrating,n5stsr6,3.0,1mc61em
comment,n5xx2zx,ClassicGOD,,2,2025-07-30 07:55:44,,,,HA integrates beautifully with NodeRed I run HA as a GUI and a glue that ties all the integrations together but I do all my automations in NodeRed All HA devices and actions are available in NR and you can expose nodes like a button to trigger some script or a sensor with data processed by NR to HA and use them in the HA interface It is amazing,n5stsr6,3.0,1mc61em

comment,n5rf6pn,DigitalStefan,,23,2025-07-29 08:58:32,,,,My understanding is the owner boss higher up of the original company has another company that now owns the product and the new company is charging subscription Luis Rossman and now some other org has put a bounty out to effectively unlink the hardware from the service with the aim of allowing customers to continue to use the device they paid for without being held hostage Allegedly In my opinion,n5rcyql,1.0,1mc61em
comment,n5smk3n,flow_fighter,,6,2025-07-29 14:03:20,,,,This is how it works in the IPpatent world Company A performs poorly after x amount of time but still retains licenses or patents or assets on potentially useful items in the future Company A files for bankruptcy having to sell off all assets Company B is formed and generally happens to come along with the same ownerexecutives and buys up all of the IPassets of Company A A good and fairly recent example of this is GI Sportz Paintball who just recently filed for bankruptcy and all assets were sold off to lo and behold Kore Outdoor a sister company to GI that was relatively dormant until GI went bankrupt,n5rf6pn,2.0,1mc61em
