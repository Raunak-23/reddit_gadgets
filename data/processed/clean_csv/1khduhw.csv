comment,mr6u9sq,Racxie,,47,2025-05-08 03:58:16,,,,It admittedly looks really nice though and I kind of want one Funnily enough just learned about Japans lottery culture and lo and behold this is based on a lottery system in order to buy one but at least this kind of makes sense,mr68idc,1.0,1khduhw
comment,mrmx0bz,kurotech,,1,2025-05-10 19:34:03,,,,A lot of places use the lottery system hell thanks to it my kids both got into our dream school for them but yea its a cool thing to do for limited marketing campaigns that you dont want scalpers ruining for your fans,mr6u9sq,2.0,1khduhw

comment,mrr0kec,trainbrain27,,1,2025-05-11 14:02:28,,,,Since theyre only making 50 this is really a gadget and not a useful tool Instead of hoping on a lottery it can be fun to take a drive on its way to recycling and open it up while running There are small torx star screws including one under the label It will ruin the drive of course but wont harm the rest of the computer,,0.0,1khduhw
