comment,m30goba,HalobenderFWT,,-23,2024-12-20 17:47:40,,,,I mean its a glorified analog calculator watch with a smaller screen and less functionality than a smart watch at double the price How many more pictures do you need,m309z34,1.0,1hij4bg
comment,m316b5r,StressfulRiceball,,37,2024-12-20 20:10:44,,,,Its a novelty item that exists for the sole purpose of piquing interest through its aesthetic So to answer your question that number is probably greater than ONE FUCKING PICTURE,m30goba,2.0,1hij4bg

comment,m2z6mdj,OddNothic,,67,2024-12-20 13:11:25,,,,One of the main features listed in the article is that the 800USD watch is a conversation starter But Im not sure that are you an idiot is a conversation that most people want to start,,0.0,1hij4bg
comment,m2zjo9v,Dependent-Zebra-4357,,46,2024-12-20 14:40:06,,,,That isnt one of the main features listed in the article These are The watch has a builtin GPS a digital display and a working keyboard Its also programmable built atop an opensource framework that is compatible with a number of coding environments including Arduino and Python So if you have some features youd like to run its open to input The watch also has an 8channel digital IO port which opens up the possibility of using the watch to control or interact with breadboard interfaces development enclosures and robotic device per Apollo Instruments product description Conversation starter is mentioned only briefly at the end of the article But at a minimum its probably the only cool calculator watch and a decent conversation starter Is this a practical watch Not really but what and how theyve developed and what its based on is pretty cool if you are into space history,m2z6mdj,1.0,1hij4bg

comment,m31y6a0,OddNothic,,1,2024-12-20 22:54:14,,,,What They vary in accuracy even much more powerful computers do which is why they sync with time servers and by proxy atomic clocks By inference this watch does via GPS satellites but they article never states it,m2zmh66,4.0,1hij4bg
