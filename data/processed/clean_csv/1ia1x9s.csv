comment,m9a92w2,TheCookieButter,,12,2025-01-26 16:10:43,,,,My gaming laptop has an expandable ethernet port How thin do laptops need to be that they dont have room for like 60 of an ethernet port Its as stupid as leaving out a 35mm on phones and especially tablets That laptop also has an easily replaceable battery fans two M2 drives HDD 2x SODIMM ram slots network card All with a single Phillips screwdriver Its heavy but thats the cooling system metallic body and HDD I dont seen any reason why that level of replacement isnt possible on 90 of consumer laptops,m980bd7,5.0,1ia1x9s

comment,mb85ytf,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2025-02-06 02:45:52,,,,hardware design I assume you mean the printer by the context and I 100 agree They still have it lol It still works They told me a gear was replaced in like 2000 when I was 7 and hardwarewise they never had to have anything else replaced Apparently it did need a little machine oil every three years or so lol Pretty sure its supposed to be every 612 months but it still works But yeah those cheapo inkjets die on purpose If they actually ran a decent maintenance process theyd keep the print heads running for years Instead they just DUMP ink every 612 months and waste the hell out of it while doing almost nothing to actually keep themselves alive But then you might keep it longer lol Cant have that Meanwhile theres a HP 1020 Deskjet printer from 2006 still running at a nearby store lol The internal page counter either broke or rolled over because it should be WAY higher than the 50k pages it reported when I checked They use 23 cartridges a month pretty consistently They rent expensive equipment and print out the entire contract every time someone rents something That should be a few thousand pages a month I mean Im not sure they bought it in 2006 but the owner is a good friend of my mom and he said when he bought it it was the very newest small model The thing should be at somewhere around a million pages It sounds fucking ridiculous and Im sure someone will come along to tell me Im lying but Ive been there Ive seen it When I have to go back again its pretty infrequent Im going to try to remember to check the tag and see if I can find a manufacturing date,mb529bx,8.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m98bq9o,zxc123zxc123,,4,2025-01-26 07:09:33,,,,Im just a fucking moomer who just uses desktops When I need to go mobile then I use my phone Honestly its because I always felt laptops are worse bang for buck followed different rules from desktops and were much harder to buildmaintainrepair due to size restrictions compatibility power constraints going bad once user interfaces fail etcetc But if the industry standardizes things more and makes partsrepairingbuilding more accessible then Im all for it,m97dr26,3.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9a1dh2,Arthur-Wintersight,,1,2025-01-26 15:32:48,,,,This is why I was looking at framework laptops before realizing they cost more than standard laptops so an even bigger price gap vs desktop,m98bq9o,4.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m98g0id,ptoki,,4,2025-01-26 07:51:37,,,,They dont have to be Currently most motherboards in laptops arent even as wide as their keyboards It is simple enough to have face to face connector between cpu and gpu so no need to make the whole device that much thicker Usually hdmi and ethernet ports make laptop thick enough to house almost everything you may need But on top of that you can have a gpu connected with thunderbolt or usbc in a docking station That works too,m97dr26,3.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99d6tm,New_Enthusiasm9053,,5,2025-01-26 13:08:31,,,,Yeah the demise of dvdsBluray must have been a god send for laptop designers Suddenly they had basically a third of the space back Then they made them thinner but now thats pretty stagnant So its getting to the point where modular designs make sense because innovation has stalled,m98g0id,4.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9e1lmo,ptoki,,3,2025-01-27 03:03:14,,,,I dont get that thinning thing Those flat keyboards arent ergonomical Making laptops a bit slanted and thicker towards the back hinge would not make much difference for use but it would give a ton of space for cooling and modularity But on the other hand The modularity is sort of over hyped Most of desktops are built once and then maybe ram is expanded or disk replaced Often they just run till their death with the initial cpu The gpu swap is happening sometimes but often the option to upgrade the gpu is not optimal cpu becomes the bottleneck for example so it ends up again full replacement Funny thing is that the modularity actually helps vendors more than customers in a statistical sense Still I am all for it It is better approach overall,m99d6tm,5.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9ekz0r,New_Enthusiasm9053,,1,2025-01-27 05:05:48,,,,True the driving force economically is not customer demand itll be design and warranty costs Idk if laptops are truly stagnant enough though for that to happen,m9e1lmo,6.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99ub4a,joselrl,,4,2025-01-26 14:55:39,,,,What make this article a bit ironic is that Intel are the ones changing the chipset design every other year and would make upgrades basically impossible after 3 years even if the CPU wasnt soldered I just recently got a thinkpad E16 gen2 and I was fairly happy when doing research finding out that I have 2 non soldered m2 storage bays and 2 SODDIM slots which is a weird think to be happy about but yeah not the most common thing to encounter in 2025,m98g0id,4.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9c7oxf,ptoki,,2,2025-01-26 21:39:43,,,,The thing with laptops is that the consumer grade ones are as you mentioned soldered shut The business ones are very often expandable nvmesataram but the cpus are always soldered I dont remember a laptop younger than 10 years which had cpu on a socket I dont know how the gaming laptops do I suspect the disks are not soldered that is pretty common on intel platform and probably ram too But I have no idea if gpus are on a daughter boards or not But the arm is imho even worse offender as a platform Usually you get ram and emmc soldered and only maybe nvme or sata available,m99ub4a,5.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9caumz,joselrl,,3,2025-01-26 21:54:10,,,,Even business laptops those going for thinner and lighter builds premium often come with soldered ram and storage nowadays Gaming laptops dont come with socketed GPUs other than very few exceptions like the Framework 16 actually And RAM is starting to be soldered even in bulky laptops for the sake of performance you see laptops advertising 7467 Mhz DDR5 speeds for example which is always soldered Does those speeds matter Not in the slightest But marketing like bigger numbers,m9c7oxf,6.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m9927ps,SeyJeez,,3,2025-01-26 11:35:16,,,,Thing is I use my laptop as a mobile workstation I do not care too much about weight or size the performance is more important to me And I think Im not alone with this I cant use a desktop though as I need to be mobile and move around,m97dr26,3.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m97vdmb,TheModeratorWrangler,,-9,2025-01-26 04:53:44,,,,You seem to not realize that even NVidia cant make their GPUs better The irony is that Intel gave AMD the ability to make x86_64 CPUs Yes increasing performance per watt is an extremely important metric and AMD is winning the game You were saying Edit NVDA can only accelerate it cant run natively Now while NVDA could go the Steam Deck route Microsoft will literally say no,m97v2n9,7.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m975pv0,Starfox-sf,,13,2025-01-26 02:11:25,,,,MXM really wasnt a standard since each vendor took that specs and made it so that it worked on one particular model but not other models using MXM let alone different vendors Difference like power req heatsink size etc I had a Dell Inspiron 6400 which could do onboard or MXM I think ATI or nVidia card but you had to choose at order since MB was different from integrated vs dedicated GPU IIRC,m96ufwk,1.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m98i9ej,AspiringTS,,3,2025-01-26 08:13:51,,,,I have a laptop thats perfectly good for me needs Even fine for my casual gaming Its battery is replaceable Not as easy as some older laptops where The problem is the dont make them anymore and the nongenuine alternatives were all sorts of sketchy the last time I looked So it stays put and plugged in which isnt ideal for a laptop I want to move around,m96ufwk,1.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99522n,OperationMobocracy,,1,2025-01-26 12:01:59,,,,Yeah it seems like the battery packs are custom sized to fit the space inside the laptop But arent they all just shrinkwrapped packs made with standard cells of some kind I feel like it should be possible to rebuild the pack with new cells though I dont know how complicated this is Im guessing theres some management circuit inside the pack so it probably involves soldering and of course wrapping it again is its own thing I only buy new OEM batteries from Dell for our work laptops Ive had experience with dodgy aftermarket batteries but the OEM ones seem decent,m98i9ej,2.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m98rdbn,MachinaThatGoesBing,,7,2025-01-26 09:46:34,,,,No Did you even read like the first paragraph of the article The proposal is for standardized components like motherboards and input devices as well citing Framework as an example These have basically always been noninterchangeable even within similar models from the same brand Again citing Framework as an example youd be able to upgrade your whole laptop piecemeal including new processor generations including ones that might use a different socket while reusing the same chassis screen keyboard storage etc And if any of those are damaged you can just get a standard replacement instead of having to find a replacement specific to that model Or if the chassiscase gets damaged you can replace just that and keep all the internals Thats very different from how things were in the past Even in the period youre talking about replacing a screen or motherboard hell even some keyboards could be a huge pain Also easy replaceable and upgradable RAM storage and batteries are still very much a thing on most laptops and desktops not made by Apple,m96ufwk,1.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m97tkjc,xCeeTee-,,12,2025-01-26 04:40:54,,,,From their blog Modularity can be approached at three levels depending on manufacturers product positioning market dynamics costs and other factors 1 Factory Modularity is a level of modularity that can only be exercised at the factory For example whilst ordering a car the manufacturer provides different choices of engines Depending on what the user decides the factory fits the car with the requested engine This level of modularity can only be exercised at factory setups hence the name This level of modularity provides for flexibility and high levels of design reuse and hence lower costs manufacturing carbon footprint and scalability benefits 2 Field Modularity is the next level of modularity that provides for fieldlevel changes but does not require a factory setup yet might still require skilled labor and a specialized tools to make the necessary upgrades or changes For example quite a few cars provide different tire sizes as options When a customer decides on a specific set of tires sizes and wheelsets the dealer not the factory gets involved The cars are still manufactured with the standard set of wheels but based on customer requests the end dealer swaps the factoryfitted wheels with custom ones These changes still require a field specialty setup but can be done effectively outside of the factory setup 3 User Modularity is the last level of modularity that allows the end user to change the settings or components within a product at will at the convenience of their home or office Good examples are WiFi dongles user upgradable memory and storage etc These provide the ultimate level of modularity to the end user do not require the intervention of the dealer or the manufacturer and can be done using standard tools by the user anytime during the effective lifetime of the product ETA so in essence its not going to be Intel that can file patents but the laptop manufacturers HP can create their own design and patent that Whilst Lenovo could easily create a very similar design the modular components will most likely be the same form factor Or at least one of a few different form factors like with desktop motherboards Some manufacturers might try to make their own form factor like Apple always do So youre forced to purchase their parts,m96zhzq,1.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m98cjog,alphonse03,,2,2025-01-26 07:17:27,,,,I mean a lot of brands already use the same layout for the PCB on several motherboards They just make them not compatible between them via positioning the CPU slightly off so the old heatsink doesnt match granted this is fixed by getting the correct one or using different connectors for some daughterboards If they are going the framework way replacing the whole motherboard if you want to change the CPU they have it pretty easy tbh I dont see them going back to socketed CPUs but it would be nice for a change It was good to have the option to upgrade at the start of the core i era even if it was a pain in the ass to teardown a laptop with so many layers back then,,0.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m98vi59,heppyheppykat,,2,2025-01-26 10:28:31,,,,I have a gaming asus laptop and have been swapping out parts for years The result is a laptop which is 6 years old and runs very well Some parts i swapped on my own others I have trusted cheap repair guys do it So long as I dont mess up the motherboard I dont plan to do anything else I would love a modular laptop like the ones from Framework but I still dont think I would buy an intel I just dont trust them,,0.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99230i,alidan,,2,2025-01-26 11:34:00,,,,I think we should go the way of 100 modularity I think a top loaded cpu in the design of lga mixed with a contact frame like mount either to the laptop behind it or to the back of the board would allow for swappable thin mount granted I dont think this is necessary as long as the cpu is soldered to a motherboard that would make swapping out common parts of the motherboard that went bad viable like power delivery memory video or storage memory went to soldered because of the traces in laptop memory not allowing faster memory speeds when the cpu is also the gpu the faster memory does make a massive impact on preformance dell has a standard to replace the current one that shaves down speed issues to be near if not equal but it hasnt beed adopted as as im aware I think the biggest thing laptops need to do is become something else at end of life make a case for the motherboard make an enclosure for the monitor let it be used outside of portable laptop at eol and it will be prefect for many people as a desktop people who need a laptop will still get a laptop people who want a desktop let me be honest im on a 1700 cpu im only STARTING to feel the need to upgrade my cpu is about the per core equivalent of a 14 year old intel cpu the fact this power is only not enough in games screams any laptop could easily be a desktop and used if it wasnt for the hardware and form factor its forced to be used in,,0.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99ag7n,ToMorrowsEnd,,2,2025-01-26 12:47:41,,,,This keeps being tried over and over about 5 years ago HP and Lenovo set up a standard for upgrade modularity for their micro PCs that are basically laptops there are two ports that can be changed to nearly anything as its a tiny pci port they both abandoned it a couple of years later We used to have a video card standard for laptops dead because nobody made any cards and only a couple of laptop makers adopted it for a short time,,0.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m9bff0e,dleewee,,2,2025-01-26 19:30:18,,,,Hardware repairability is great and all but the majority of ewaste I see generated these days is from manufacturers deciding they dont feel like providing firmware security updates anymore Where are the big companies raising this issue or better yet advocating for open source firmware,,0.0,1ia1x9s

comment,m998mdc,OperationMobocracy,,5,2025-01-26 12:32:48,,,,Weight and size are about the only thing my users will gripe about they definitely prefer laptops which are easier to haul around I buy pretty basic Dell Latitude 54xx which arent total nightmares for simple stuff like RAM batteries or SSDs But I maybe crack open 10 of them for any of that My overall experience is that laptop physical wear is a big driver of replacement very seldom is it I need to open bigger spreadsheets can I get a new CPU People with performanceintensive jobs get laptops that will do performanceintensive things up front Even tired batteries dont seem to be a big deal theyre accustomed to plugging in Im surprised they dont gripe about this more but those that do Ill swap the battery And if they make it to 5 years so much is just worn from hard use that no upgrade would make sense I love the modularity idea but I dont think the juice vs squeeze will get much traction outside of the hobbyisttinkerer crowd,m97wwxo,2.0,1ia1x9s
comment,m99dypk,taimusrs,,2,2025-01-26 13:14:04,,,,In this proposal CPUs are still soldered More like Framework laptops that you change the whole motherboard but you can 3Dprint a case for it to use as a PC Intel who changes its CPU socket every two years like clockwork aint gonna catch up to that just yet,m97wwxo,2.0,1ia1x9s
