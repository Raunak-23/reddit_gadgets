comment,m2567m7,KidNueva,,11,2024-12-15 08:41:36,,,,I play in a band and our studiohouse is a shared space with someone who records local artistrappers in our area and hes got the same mentality too He is VERY creative when it comes to recording and really knows his stuff but he swears certain cables manufactured a certain way with special oxygen free material etc make all the difference We took a couple to a show one time and midway through this 100 guitar cable just shit out on us Unlucky Maybe but of course it was one of his cables Out of all the cables our band has ever owned none have ever failed I seriously think a lot of features for expensive cables are just gimmickssnake oil,m244ee2,5.0,1he2zyj

comment,m28usvb,HungryAd8233,,5,2024-12-15 23:24:32,,,,And even then we have quantitative metrics to measure how good a cable is All that adjectival mumbojumbo doesnt make any actual testable claims Those sort of placebo cables seem to have a higher fault rate than standard ones as well presumably because theyre made by and for people who believe in mystical metals instead of testandmeasure equipment,m25z4ui,7.0,1he2zyj
comment,m2tl6l3,internetlad,,1,2024-12-19 13:47:27,,,,Yeah It got grandfathered in from a time when analog audio cable quality may have given an audiophile level difference in quality That said even then it was like nearing sommelier levels of discernment Most people dont care as long as they can understand what The Simpsons are saying,m25z4ui,7.0,1he2zyj
comment,m28go14,KidNueva,,1,2024-12-15 22:04:38,,,,Growing up in my teens I definitely did hear a small difference between goldplated and nonplated headphones but now that Im older its not worth making it a deal breaker for audio or signals in general That energy and money is better spent somewhere else,m25z4ui,7.0,1he2zyj
comment,m2tli91,internetlad,,1,2024-12-19 13:49:35,,,,Not sure if your age but likely at that time it was analog audio which would transmit on a waveform Oscillations could certainly distort sound quality Digital is either a 1 or a 0 so either the signal arrives or it doesnt Theres no noise on a digital cable it just cuts out completely Its the same as saying the laser used to read a CDDVD will affect the quality Theres literally no way it can happen because either the laser is good and its a carbon copy of the original or it doesnt come through at all and the disc doesnt play due to read errors All that said it was probably still a placebo effect lol We like to like nice things Same reason people shit on cheap stuff for being cheap despite it being fine for the job Its an easy way to give our brains the good chemicals,m28go14,8.0,1he2zyj

comment,m28vdxe,HungryAd8233,,3,2024-12-15 23:27:58,,,,But was the headspace that was holding you back about the audio fidelity This song would have been LIT if only the cable hadnt raised my noise floor by 1 dB SURE a BAD cable will ruin things But a fine basic cable isnt going to sound qualitatively different than no cable at all,m28fgf3,7.0,1he2zyj

comment,m2b87ph,clarity_scarcity,,1,2024-12-16 10:47:56,,,,lol best buy Back in the day working at HQ Monster Cables were all the rage in the Audio department imo because the markup was astronomical and even after the employee discount 40 they were still overpriced At the store display I was not able to hear a difference between them and the next tier down so whatever Chalked it up to just another marketing scam Cant speak to the build quality but safe to say these were marketed towards those who wanted to pay for name recognition,m23r6fi,4.0,1he2zyj
comment,m27jzni,IAmTheMageKing,,2,2024-12-15 19:11:03,,,,I know this is satire but the idea that all cables are the same isnt quite right either The problem fancy cables solve just noise distorting the waves its also the reflections and distortions you get on those waves Every cable is an inductor and a capacitor and that causes distortions to your signal Those distortions can cause the data to be unusable different HDMI cables are rated for different data rates and especially when you have a longer cable you need the pricer versions to support higher resolution,m21l2bh,3.0,1he2zyj

comment,m24vrod,Opoz55,,4,2024-12-15 06:48:07,,,,Yeah I needed a 30 foot 4k120 as well and unfortunately had to spend some money for a decent optical one as I didnt want an active one Some expensive hdmi cables serve a purpose but none of that gold plated crap,m24vmve,3.0,1he2zyj

comment,m2lsnwd,marc-andre-servant,,1,2024-12-18 03:34:24,,,,Assuming the HDCP handshake is passed through the cable without authenticating the cable itself or forwards the authentication to the sink device any manufacturer can build a HDMI 22 cable that will function just fine if either 1 They pass official testing with the HDMI trademark holders Then they can use the HDMI logos and trademarks without consequences 2 They selftest the cable to HDMI 22 standards and market it as HDMI 22 compatible dont use any trademarked logos while respecting the existing UCC laws against false advertising which would be easy to disprove with tons of 1star reviews showing the cable is not actually working Theres no need for 100 cables just wait until Amazon Basics or Monoprice gets in the game,m20w1fe,1.0,1he2zyj

comment,m27brhx,spdcrzy,,0,2024-12-15 18:28:20,,,,It depends on the length I have 24 and 48 long cables and those are VERY expensive The active ones are the really REALLY expensive ones because those are optical HDMI cables At those lengths yes the quality of every component connector cable shielding AND retimer if need be matters Heres what would be used in something like a home theater install,m20w1fe,1.0,1he2zyj
comment,m27ehnr,bigtallbiscuit,,2,2024-12-15 18:42:23,,,,Ive yet to install an optical cable but Ive installed a handful of systems using hdmi over cat5ecat6 You can do 4k up to about 150 Plus it uses a poe switch so you only need power at one end and it splits the signal into 8 channels The one in my house does 4k from my PS5 to 5 rooms in the house and 1 out in the garage That system currently runs about 270 not including the cat5 but there are single channel ones out there for about 30,m27brhx,2.0,1he2zyj

comment,m20jl7g,majorziggytom,,908,2024-12-14 13:50:45,,,,Is it just me who thinks that updates to a connection should be somehow visible Eg every HDMI update comes with a new color for the port and the plug Its just inconvenient that there is no visual difference that immediately lets us know what the underlying tech is,,0.0,1he2zyj

comment,m22kto6,silverbolt2000,,81,2024-12-14 21:06:03,,,,The ludicrous thing is having a usbc port on a laptop that doesnt accept power because PC laptop manufacturers are cheap You dont get that problem on a MacBook where all usbc ports are capable of accepting power,m211kzf,4.0,1he2zyj
comment,m22mlz4,hi_im_bored13,,89,2024-12-14 21:16:40,,,,and every port on the macbook is capable of thunderbolt which is great for tech illiterate people Its so weird explaining to people that only one of their laptop ports works with the dock and one is display but not thunderbolt and one is only usbc and I cant blame them because they all look the same,m22kto6,5.0,1he2zyj

comment,m234xs4,alidan,,13,2024-12-14 23:07:45,,,,the expensive part would mostly be the motherboard traces to accommodate every port being everything honestly wish we had modular ports that functioned as pcie so we could swap out what we wantneed in a relatively standard way,m22osxp,7.0,1he2zyj

comment,m2472q1,RRR3000,,3,2024-12-15 03:22:45,,,,I mean thats just dongles youre describing The exact thing people hate in Apple laptops that require expensive dongles for everything instead of just including the different ports in the laptop,m234xs4,8.0,1he2zyj
comment,m287x2u,alidan,,0,2024-12-15 21:17:44,,,,look at framework their system is what I was thinking of but if that kind of a system was standard across all laptops a dongle is only needed if something I need is not on the laptops io if I can make the io exactly what I want no dongle needed,m2472q1,9.0,1he2zyj
comment,m28oes5,RRR3000,,1,2024-12-15 22:47:21,,,,Framework is quite literally just dongles It has 4 USBC ports and you can order dongles if you need other ports The dongles have a nice matching design to the laptop so they arent as noticable by not sticking out the way some others do but its still just dongles and the exact same thing as Apple is doing with their USBConly connectors on recent MacBooks that require dongles for other ports,m287x2u,10.0,1he2zyj
comment,m29x7cf,alidan,,0,2024-12-16 03:21:03,,,,what I would like is a generic standard port area for directly tying into pcie lanes that way you can have full fat whatever you want frame work is the closest to it and I dont want to call them dongles just because dongle is in reference to a short cable plugging into something I think mostly used in reference to consoles till macs removed near all io from their laptops,m28oes5,11.0,1he2zyj
comment,m277ql2,liatris_the_cat,,1,2024-12-15 18:07:31,,,,Like the old AT motherboard days where everything was hanging off a slot vs board integrated I could get behind having more PCIe slots and less onboard ports so I could pick and choose what my connectivity options,m234xs4,8.0,1he2zyj
comment,m28kgw0,None,,1,2024-12-15 22:25:35,,,,Apple is still guilty of confusing people On the M4 max you can have four external displays while on the M4 pro using the exact same thunderbolt 5 ports you can only use two external displays So now you have to explain to people that their triple monitor dock doesnt work because they didnt pay apple enough despite having the exact same thunderbolt 5 capabilities,m22mlz4,6.0,1he2zyj

comment,m27o4m1,silverbolt2000,,1,2024-12-15 19:32:34,,,,Partly But it also goes towards A much better display A battery that lasts 3 times longer than any other PC laptop A processor with performance that blows away the nearest PC equivalent A solid case made of proper metal rather than cheap plastic painted to look like metal An operating system that doesnt require a reboot every few days and also doesnt push unwanted ads or features on to you at every opportunity Theres probably more but those are the obvious ones that spring to mind,m27g61o,6.0,1he2zyj

comment,m21o0tx,Redthemagnificent,,4,2024-12-14 17:56:16,,,,May I introduce Dell power share lol Some laptop makers have a lightning icon thats just different enough to be legally distinct from thunderbolt but still confusing customers Asus also uses a similar icon on usbc ports that are not thunderbolt just for extra confusion Notice how its slightly different than the thunderbolt symbol,m214kdo,5.0,1he2zyj
comment,m21arkv,GeorgeRRZimmerman,,1,2024-12-14 16:41:44,,,,because thunderbolt can provide 100W And most things with a thunderbolt port also work with other PDBC standards Its how I figured out that a 65w keeps my laptop running as long as Im not playing games rendering video or hitting the build button in vscode every 2 minutes,m214kdo,5.0,1he2zyj

comment,m2364os,alidan,,1,2024-12-14 23:15:12,,,,how do you want to solve the issue then specific connectors for power we did that and everything not usb c was dog shit want to go back to barrel jacks where every product has a different size and god forbid you loose the wall wart honestly im ok with this as there are a few projects that are making old barrel jack stuff work with usbc all we would need to do is possibly some pogo pins on the input and we could make them not backwards compatible with old barrel jacks but allow a data handshake that gets the correct power and voltage delivered you want to make a different input type but make it standard for power good luck with that im sure it will work out just fine usbs main problem is 2 fold 1 cables that advertise higher specs then they can actually do 2 not every feature of the spec being required to be supported,m21p08r,6.0,1he2zyj
comment,m271t34,Lamballama,,1,2024-12-15 17:35:28,,,,Print the spec on the connector housing But also change the spec names to display voltage and data throughput instead of generation standard since theres so many optional features in the spec They could also be standard colors of silicone from the manufacturer instead of having to come up with your own system of buying white 120W cables and black 240W ones USBA was supposed to do this on the plastic in the connector though its not consistent,m2364os,7.0,1he2zyj

comment,m233dtz,obi1kenobi1,,10,2024-12-14 22:57:57,,,,Back in the old day we had different connectors for each new spec You could use passive adapters to convert devices but it was super duper easy to tell if your port or cable supported certain features because the HDMI cable couldnt plug into a DVI port for that matter a DualLink DVI cable couldnt plug into a single link DVI port And as a bonus the ports were usually though not always different enough that even the dumbest people wouldnt try to plug the wrong thing in and could tell that two things werent compatible with one another Then somebody decided that every standard needed to use the same connector for the rest of time Which is theoretically convenient in that old devices can plug into new devices particularly in the case of HDMI where the popular existing connector was retained But now in the world of USBC you have absolutely no way of knowing which devices and cables support which standard Is it fullspeed USB 3 or just USB 20 Does this cable support video and charging or just data Can it do power delivery and if so what is the capacity Or is it Thunderbolt instead Then youve got the cheap gadgets that charge over USBC but dont support Power Delivery so they cant communicate with any of my USBC chargers or power banks I need to dig around to try to find a USBA to USBC cable and USBA charger any time I want to charge those devices And thats not even talking about the countless products that use USBC connectors but dont follow USB standards USBC was supposed to make everything simple and foolproof but were pretty much back to the point where you need to keep specific cables for each device because they all have different capabilities and arent compatible except now its worse than it used to be because all the cables and ports look identical despite having wildly different features and capabilities At least with HDMI they usually either label the ports on the devices or you can guess based on the specs of the device like resolution and refresh rate Cables are kind of in the same boat as USBC since ones made in 2003 when HDMI was little more than an alternate connector for DVI and ones made in 2024 for 8K TVs look exactly the same,m20jl7g,1.0,1he2zyj

comment,m234gmb,alidan,,1,2024-12-14 23:04:44,,,,I think that a 10 change should be a new hard requirement to fall in the standard I think any 01 update should be new functionality that they found works though current cables but may or may not be supported on end products I think that any xx special name here should be exempt from needing to fully follow the requirements however it should not be able to be a standard a or c plug in the case of usb though not sure how important this is for hdmi I only know of one product that used hdmi as a generic connector I think this is the best way any organization should go I also think for lets say a tv to advertise hdmi in any way it needs at least 1 port that supports the full standard up to whatever point revision it wants to say,m20jl7g,1.0,1he2zyj

comment,m27011u,Buzstringer,,2,2024-12-15 17:25:45,,,,Unfortunately its when the TV does some processing if you can turn off any audio conversion the TV does that might help For filmsTV not really an issue as most devices let you have an offset But for games its unusable Its hard to notice in some open word or RPG games but play a 2D platformer and its really obvious and painful Most of the time the TV adds the delay so theres not much you can do about it Upgrading your audio system wont help The best way to avoid it is to connect everything to your soundbar or sound system and pass through just the video to the TV But thats not always the perfect solution either because a lot of soundbars do not have video out or enough HDMI ports for all of your devices An HDMI switch can help but some of those have their own issues This is one of the best videos for testing audio sync,m26uwlp,3.0,1he2zyj

comment,m21wcq9,Durahl,,8,2024-12-14 18:43:41,,,,But why Besides there not being any content or the means to distribute such content to devices that would benefit from the increase theres also no need for it outside of IMAX sized Screens Before making the change to my now SONY KD77A1 HDR OLED screen I had a SONY D75S9005B which at some point developed a dead Pixel I only noticed being there when I walked past the Screen at less than half the usual viewing distance while it had a uniform white background displayed on it Increase the distance to like ⅔ the regular viewing distance an the Dead Pixel was practically not recognizable anymore LONG gone if you had actual content being displayed instead of just a uniform background Youd have to watch 4K Content on a 150200 screen while still only at 75 Screen Viewing Distance which for reference is like 3m to PERHAPS see the individual Pixels thus making 8K viable but again where do you get such content from A stack of 34 Blurays for one Movie Low Bitrate Streaming completing the purpose of 8K Even worse for Gaming Any Game where youd WANT to play at 8K like Cyberpunk 2077 you cant because theres simply no hardware out there capable of pushing the Specs at reasonable 60FPS and any game that can be run at 8K youd hardly would give a shit about So yea WHY,,0.0,1he2zyj
comment,m25bl1w,Buzstringer,,2,2024-12-15 09:42:50,,,,While it can support resolutions noone can use yet thats really just marketing so people can understand what they upgraded The real key is the increased bandwidth which allows for more features features that may not be ready yet for example they may implement daisy chaining like DisplayPort and thunderbolt So instead of 8K120 or whatever you can link 3 x 4K monitors to each other at 60fps or so Also some of that bandwidth could be used for higherres audio for home theaters or have a single port for video and networking ethernet Or higher bit colorspaces Things like that would eat into the bandwidth lowering the maximum resolution but adding features,m21wcq9,1.0,1he2zyj

comment,m22qf89,naynaythewonderhorse,,2,2024-12-14 21:39:06,,,,Ohhhh thanks Thats great incite I sort of roll my eyes at 8K news because its a promise that will probably never be kept for consumers There is next to zero 8K content in existence outside of film negatives and raw camera footage that hasnt been edited or mastered in any capacity To cite a few examples for anyone curious Pixar didnt start true 4K until 2019 and their rendering Process is used for a lot of films both live action and animated Also a few years ago they scanned but didnt remaster The Wizard of Oz in 8K which is the ONLY time Ive heard of 8K scans happening probably happened more since then Suffice to say 8K content is currently next to being a complete scam and 8K TVs are just an excuse for places to sell you TVs in the future The reality for the TV manufacturing companies being that there arent too many places where TVs can improve to justify the prices,m22c299,2.0,1he2zyj
comment,m23168t,ElDoRado1239,,1,2024-12-14 22:44:04,,,,Yeah for now its kinda pointless with the only exception being if you have it hoooked up to a PC with a 4090 or the 5090 released in January I have a 50 TV as my monitor about arms length from my face and switching to a 1080P desktop feels just as bad as switching to something like 800600 back when I was used to 1080P So I can easily imagine 8K being great for desktop and me getting used to it again shifting my idea of large enough But I sure dont have a 4090 rather a 660Ti so I only game in 4K if the game is 2D and watch some 4K content but not everything works Cant say I really know even just 4K gaming at its best still 8K probably does look great so if you already have the GPU paying a little extra and getting something like the 65 Samsung QE65QN700C instead of the 55 version might make sense Though if all you want is movies TV live broadcasts YouTube who knows how long will it take for all content to catch up with 8K You will most likely buy a new 8K TV and still be waiting for 8K content by the time its about to die on you Since they will likely start making all nonsubpar TVs 8K within a few years I dont see how it makes any sense You cant even hope for 8K console gaming to become a thing,m22qf89,3.0,1he2zyj
