comment,mdiul3l,fraseyboo,,590,2025-02-18 23:48:16,,,,116 million down from the 750 million 1 billion they originally tried to sell for Offline functionality will still work but the cloudbased functionality is unlikely to be supported if youre in the 90day return window then you can get a refund though I cant imagine many people are buying these things after they were universally panned,,0.0,1isqufv
comment,mdj3bpn,Strawberry3141592,,332,2025-02-19 00:34:47,,,,Honestly I have no idea how they got 116M for it The entire product was a horrible idea from the start I have difficulty seeing where HP thinks theyre going to make any profit from this,mdiul3l,1.0,1isqufv
comment,mdj7j1m,fraseyboo,,220,2025-02-19 00:57:06,,,,The acquisition comes with 300 patents supposedly so maybe HP is banking on some of them being viable Its obvious that the tech needs way longer to cook but as AI models get cheaper to run there might be some iteration thats commercially sound,mdj3bpn,2.0,1isqufv

comment,mdoqsbt,80sCrack,,5,2025-02-19 21:15:49,,,,Just did some research on this it seems to me that ex parte reexamination is only really relevant when youre claiming that you had worked on a patent prior to a different party beating you to the filing Meaning youre having a dispute regarding who owns the patent This is not the same as when some obscure patent is claiming youve got some obscure patent claiming youre infringing on their patent not a disagreement on who the right owner of the patent is I could be wrong Im not super informed on patent law but this is my interpretation of the reading Ive done this afternoon,mdmmrq9,8.0,1isqufv

comment,mdlla5x,alidan,,1,2025-02-19 11:51:14,,,,the tech doesnt need longer to cook it needs societal change anything ai based that is not in a form or smartwatch form factor is going to near require ar glasses to be worth a damn what we need is ar glasses to be a thing and acceptable to wear in public see every single time someone thinks they are being recorded freakouts as what needs to change from here we need either wireless connectivity to the glasses for displaying the info or any kind of wire needs to be no thicker than an iems cable this solves 2 of the major problems the display method being crap along with a better use interface once those are solved the software will be far more useful but I honestly dont think ai will take off in a major way till we get at home ai servers so much of ai is cool and all but the moment it costs significant money per query or bricks 500 under a year old purchases because the server goes away gg on selling it to people,mdj7j1m,3.0,1isqufv

comment,mdqg76j,birds-0f-gay,,1,2025-02-20 02:30:21,,,,the moment you are ever falsely accused of anything and have to prove innocents This makes no sense You dont have to prove your innocence when youre accused of something the state has to prove your guilt when you are anywhere in public you have 0 privacy By privacy I think they meant the ability to go outside and not have everyone you interact with record said interaction which would be miserable,mdp6pfg,6.0,1isqufv
comment,mds9kvi,alidan,,-2,2025-02-20 11:22:29,,,,yea people dont give one fuck about that get accused of touching someone when you did nothing its your word against theirs legally you are clear but nothing you ever say will make people believe you didnt do it just that the system is broken because it didnt find you guilty It also doesnt help that being in the wrong place at the wrong time can make you look guilty look at how often someone who was innocent is found on death row hell one of the east cost states had a prossicuter out right say in cases of an accusation against a child 95 of the time we have no evidence that anything happened besides the accusation and we still get conviction innocent till proven guilty is an ideal that no one really wants to uphold anymore,mdqg76j,7.0,1isqufv

comment,mdmma13,dsfhfgjhfyhrd,,4,2025-02-19 15:32:10,,,,There is no reason why personal ai software should run on anything else than your phone If you want to interact with it through some other device that device should act as an interface connected to your phone The problem with this is that it makes the ai into just another app And no one is willing to pay 599 plus a 29month subscription for an app Thats why you get gadgets like the humane pin and the rabbit r1 Its a way to charge way more for an app by disguising it as a gadget,mdlla5x,4.0,1isqufv
comment,mdp7efr,alidan,,1,2025-02-19 22:31:30,,,,im willing to have ai be part of a smart watch mostly because to me it seems people are far more willing to ignore someone being awkward with a smart watch than with a phone I also think glasses are necessary because at least to me anything I would want ai to do would be game changing with with ar,mdmma13,5.0,1isqufv
comment,mdrhz9x,dsfhfgjhfyhrd,,1,2025-02-20 06:52:03,,,,Sure but that watch and those glasses will be accessories for your phone An extra interface using an ai app running on the phone They wont be a standalone ai watch or standalone ai glasses Thats the issue with the ai gadgets we see today They are underpowered standalone devices because thats the only way they can charge stupid amounts of money for what should just be an app on your phone,mdp7efr,6.0,1isqufv
comment,mdsa9dh,alidan,,1,2025-02-20 11:28:35,,,,I honestly dont think a phone is powerful enough to ai otherwise we would have had local ai models on phones I personally think a phone is a good intermediary between lite devices ar glasses or smart watch to extend functionality or act as a bridge watch phone internet ideally a personal ai server at home here take for instance a language model for speech to text a personalized model will take about 2gb of ram to run a general model takes about 6gb of ram to run I just tested my tablet if I turn off internet I cant dictate to it there is simply not enough resources on a phone to run them locally however connecting to a server you can offload alot of the resources to somewhere else,mdrhz9x,7.0,1isqufv
comment,mdmrhen,parisidiot,,4,2025-02-19 15:56:40,,,,AI is worthless garbage that will never provide useful information and it will only degrade over time as AI generated slop is fed into the learning data sets it doesnt matter if it is delivered in a pin or a phone or AR glasses it sucks it not only doesnt work the way these theranoslevel companies pretend it does it is also built on stolen data and it requires so much energy to run that it is blowing past our carbon pollution goals that we need to meet to not die so it sucks and it is killing us come back to reality,mdlla5x,4.0,1isqufv
comment,mdp9d0m,alidan,,2,2025-02-19 22:40:54,,,,ai already is able to simulate putting chemicals together faster than we ever could test and find improvements in chemical engineering now I can google very specific info for a video game and take 1020 minutes trying to parse forums and reddit to get an answer or I can ask ai is there anything in casic theul or ssra temple is charmable and ai will give me an answer which is usually correct fast enough that im not pissing my groups time away look into grammar of different languages while current translation algorithms are fine especially when everything is standard and grammatically perfect but how often is that the case toss ai at it and you will get a better translation that needs far less human interaction to smooth the weirdness and ideally even incorrect grammar or spellings could be parsed as for ai only getting worse you curate the data set and have an algoritmen to weed out already ai generated crap given ai is fed mri and xrays and it picks up things humans just dont perceive and does it faster im going with it doesnt suck actively helps us but is going to make so many people unemployable pandoras box is open it will never close and realistically because everyone is racing to make something good we dont have the enshitification aspect of it yet,mdmrhen,5.0,1isqufv
comment,mdt1i9q,parisidiot,,0,2025-02-20 14:29:33,,,,youre very stupid you dont understand how generative AI actually works and youre buying into propaganda congrats it doesnt do any analysis it is basically a complicated markov chain it just spits out what is likely these things cant even do simple multiplication there is no thinking no analysis no understanding,mdp9d0m,6.0,1isqufv

comment,mdj7bkc,TheFlukeBadger,,38,2025-02-19 00:56:00,,,,The interface being a projection onto the hand was conceptually interesting quite a few reviewers remarked on how it wasnt consumer ready but promising in that regard HP might just be buying it for patents and whatever research they had going on behind the scenes not the halfbaked product they rushed to launch to appease investors,mdj3bpn,2.0,1isqufv
comment,mdldox1,vincentofearth,,7,2025-02-19 10:43:12,,,,Yeah and HP does have a projector business so maybe they think the patents will be useful there,mdj7bkc,3.0,1isqufv

comment,mdkg3c7,AtOurGates,,25,2025-02-19 05:28:02,,,,Its unfair that Juicero gets all the ridicule when the Keurig Kold existed It was a nearly 400 dispenser that slowly oozed out soda from concentrated capsules that cost more than buying it in cans at the store tasted worse and could only produce one 8oz soda every 90 seconds Amazingly Keurig spent 100million developing the thing because noone at the company ever took their head out of their asses for a second to say wait whut,mdk8r5y,3.0,1isqufv
comment,mdlwmt0,heinzbumbeans,,4,2025-02-19 13:11:58,,,,yeah but at least you had capsules and needed the machine to make the drink so the machine was neccesary if you for some reason wanted to use the capsules and i can kinda see the reasoning behind possibly wanting capsuals they take up less space and are lighter so you can carry more from the store the Jucero was completley pointless you could squeeze the juice packs for it yourself and get as much juice out of them as the machine,mdkg3c7,4.0,1isqufv
comment,mdmrojp,parisidiot,,4,2025-02-19 15:57:35,,,,i think their tests found you could get more juice actually and the processing of the fruit made them lose money lol,mdlwmt0,5.0,1isqufv
comment,mdl6an4,phire,,7,2025-02-19 09:30:03,,,,HPs press release makes it super clear this is mostly an acquihire HP are getting a functional team with quite a bit of experience in the AI for consumers space They dont want the product The product concept was shit but the team did manage to delver it And delivering is actually worth something Probably not 116M but something I suspect all the AI hype has just created a lot of competition for AI team acquihires,mdj3bpn,2.0,1isqufv
comment,mdlxffy,heinzbumbeans,,3,2025-02-19 13:16:55,,,,I thought the concept was fine but they didnt deliver it I would pay good money for a badge i could tap and tell it to do stuff with my devices and ask questions and make calls and stuff it would basically be a star trek com badge but that wasnt what was delivered at all,mdl6an4,3.0,1isqufv
comment,mdpp7er,phire,,1,2025-02-20 00:02:13,,,,Its not that the concept is inherently bad its more that the concept cant really be delivered with todays technology Battery life is a big issue Humanes AI Pin was already too big and bulky for some situations yet you can only fit a really small battery in there Maybe you could do an alternative formfactor with a badge that only contains a camera speaker and microphones connecting wirelessly with a larger pocket sized device Ideally that device would be your smartphone The second issue that todays LLMs just arent good enough to implement this kind of user experience The latency between the device and server is frustrating they cant really get enough context about what you are currently doing to provide good answers and they have problems remembering things because things fall out of the current context There is also the issue that voice based interaction just isnt suitable for everything Sometimes information is too sensitive for others to overhear or you dont want to disrupt others There needs to be an alternative method of interaction Humane went for their laser projector but that was painful to use,mdlxffy,4.0,1isqufv
comment,mdr0aor,heinzbumbeans,,1,2025-02-20 04:33:44,,,,Yeah I agree with everything youve said What i dont understand though is why no company has made a scaled down version that does work I currently use my voice via google home to contol my lights and heating and it works quite well you get smart speakers that work with google home too so why has no one made a badge that connects to you phone that you can wear around the house and tap and it activates google home to control these things with your voice without having to pull out your phone the tech is all there and i could live with a little latency for these tasks I suspect google doesnt allow such a device to use its services because they want you using their device to do that instead but i dunno,mdpp7er,5.0,1isqufv
comment,mdr6oeo,phire,,1,2025-02-20 05:18:56,,,,They do actually make that product except its a watch not a badge Fitbit Pixel watch or Samsung watch The watch form factor has many advantages over a badge You can wear a watch even when naked and dont need to worry about transferring it to new outfits There is enough space for a screen to show textimages and scroll through lists Its firmly attached to your wrist you can get away with a bit more weight than something flapping around on your shirt Since it has direct contact to skin it can monitor biometrics such as heart rate Watches are already normalised in society so people dont really notice smartwatches I guess there is nothing stopping you mounting a smart watch as a badge IMO the only advantage the badge form factor has over a watch form factor is that you can put a camera on it and that camera will see roughly what you can see Though the general public seems to get really weirded out by people wearing cameras its continually killed any attempt at the smart glasses form factor I suspect humane went with the badge form factor as an attempted endrun around this general distrust as people are much less likely to notice something chest mounted For your smart home usecase there is also the option of buying several smart speakers and distributing them around the house They are reasonably cheap and have decent range for picking up your voice and are designed for this usecase,mdr0aor,6.0,1isqufv
comment,mduw8fi,heinzbumbeans,,1,2025-02-20 19:40:53,,,,yes smart speakers can do that but the thought of something constantly listening is unsettling to me even though i suspect our phones are already doing that wiretaps are so against the funemental human need for privacy that they traditionally need a court ordered warrent in order to install one but people now volunteer to have them in their homes I would like a device that only listens when i ask it to,mdr6oeo,7.0,1isqufv
comment,mdmrwle,parisidiot,,1,2025-02-19 15:58:38,,,,quite a bit of experience in the AI for consumers space well seems like kind of worthless experience considering how dogshit the product was HP IBM etc have not exactly been making good products theyre surviving off of their mainframes and other corporatelevel shit throwing whatever they can at the wall to see what sticks trying to avoid their inevitable bankruptcy,mdl6an4,3.0,1isqufv
comment,mdkjoip,silverbolt2000,,7,2025-02-19 05:56:28,,,,HP will probably bundle it with their laptops and require voice command using this shitty device to login to Windows Because if theres a way to make HP laptops even worse they will surely do it,mdj3bpn,2.0,1isqufv
comment,mdlv7oa,heinzbumbeans,,2,2025-02-19 13:02:58,,,,I wouldnt say the whole concept was awful from the start I imagine quite a lot of people would like a star trek com badgeesq thing you could wear and tap it to ask questions and have it do stuff and the suppsed projected screen was a nifty idea it just didnt work anything like that Like at all,mdj3bpn,2.0,1isqufv
