comment,mt5h76m,None,,71,2025-05-19 17:09:00,,,,Motion sickness is caused by sensor mismatch Either from sensing movement changes with your ears without seeing it or seeing movement without sensing it elsewhere Probably has less to do with anything else anyone here is suggesting than it does with what app was being used and how much focus was put on it Either the app had too much movement or the user was moving a lot while focusing their eyes on stationary gui tools Like reading in a car but the car is you,mt4w5ap,4.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt7c18j,maaku7,,11,2025-05-19 22:48:15,,,,Im someone that gets severe VR motion sickness I was able to use a friends AVP with no issue whatsoever Was kinda cool to see what the hype was aboutnot just AVP but VRAR in general I dont know what theyre doing if it is just lower latency higher refresh rate more pixels or what But it works Still not paying 3500 though,mt5h76m,5.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt8f4gj,honestbleeps,,4,2025-05-20 02:47:26,,,,The main thing is that all the avp experiences were stationary Did you get motion sickness doing truly stationary things in vr Or were you playing games where you move Its the movement through space in vr when youre not actually moving that is the cause of motion sickness for most folks Thats why they can play beat saber and not get sick but not other games Youre standing still,mt7c18j,6.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt8kyve,maaku7,,1,2025-05-20 03:28:44,,,,Ive never played a VR game only stationary app experiences Im not a gamer Just having the goggles on makes me sick Its something to do with the disconnect from reality whether it is latency or resolution or what I dont know But something is off and thats enough to trigger it Its like a physiological reaction to the uncanny valley of reality simulacrum AVP didnt have that The passthrough and the rendered imagery was good enough to approximate the real thing that it didnt trigger whatever VRsickness variant I get,mt8f4gj,7.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt7d47h,None,,2,2025-05-19 22:54:29,,,,For sure I know in my case the amount of contrast makes it way worse Old gritty lowres battlefield type games or even the view bobbing they added to Minecraft on PC it feels like the more I have to work to properly see what Im looking at the easier it is for the visual to dominate my motion sensing And when you arent actually moving that makes you sick,mt7c18j,6.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt63xzr,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-05-19 18:58:40,,,,I never get sick if Im reading in a car but I remember feeling seasick when below deck on a boat when I was young My dad suggested going up ondeck to be able to see the horizon and it definitely helped quell the nausea Ive never tried VR but I imagine the virtual movement vs the lack of physical movement would be pretty strange and akin to stepping onto an escalator or travelator thats not turned on so instead merely functioning as stairs or a footpath respectively They always give that initial sense of acceleration when first stepping onto them because your body is expecting it even though its literally just stairs or a stationary ground when turned off,mt5h76m,5.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt50gq6,Candle1ight,,34,2025-05-19 15:46:37,,,,The first week of playing I had to limit my time pretty significantly because it would make me sick After about a week of short daily playing it went away completely and didnt come back even after year long breaks Obviously dont do it if you dont want to but it does seem like playing up until you start feeling uncomfortable then stopping builds up your VR legs for most people,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt5j8pc,underbitefalcon,,1,2025-05-19 17:18:49,,,,None of the games made me sick on quest 2 until I tried to play ace combat I think it was Ww2 flying I tried a dozen or more times and it kicks my ass as far as nausea is concerned,mt50gq6,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mtahnw6,thelingeringlead,,1,2025-05-20 13:18:37,,,,Yeah I had this experience with my first high refresh rate monitor It took about 4 days of using it on max refresh for the disorientation and headaches to stop None of it was bad enough to ditch the monitor and at first I thought I was just getting sick in general A quick google search told me its completely normal,mt50gq6,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt59511,opmwolf,,11,2025-05-19 16:29:38,,,,Its the lower end lens the Quest 2 has The Quest 3 has better lenses that dont suffer from this While using the Quest 2 your eyes have the sharpest focus looking straight ahead but once you look anywhere else you lose focus The brain subconsciously focuses onto what youre looking at No problems right Until you look again towards the center being out of focus again The near constant refocusing is what causes nausea and headaches in my experience Two things I found to nearly completely eliminate the nausea 1 Buy an aftermarket head strap because the stock one is trash and cuts off blood flow to the brain in my experience This noticeably helps during long play sessions if youre a person who wears the strap really snug 2 Train yourself to turn your head with your eyes looking straight ahead or close to it not looking off to the side turning your head then returning your eyes back to the center your eyes just adjusted focus twice doing this Mainly after doing 2 I can play more than 15min in VR without nausea or headaches The longest session Ive been in VR is around 3 hours,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt8unjn,Xaverri,,1,2025-05-20 04:44:08,,,,I would also add that having a fan blowing on you preferably from straight ahead tends to help,mt59511,4.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt5eu35,elev8dity,,1,2025-05-19 16:57:35,,,,Could be a refresh rate issue I used to get VR nausea from smooth movement games but I adapted over time and dont have the issue anymore,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt5indz,doc_holliday112,,1,2025-05-19 17:15:58,,,,Same here with the psvr 2 Never experienced motion sickness before but that gets me after about 1015 mins and then sticks around for the rest of the dayThey say it gets better with use but i just ended up giving up after being on the verge of puking every time i played Its too bad because the system works great and is really fun,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt5w2ra,Funandgeeky,,1,2025-05-19 18:20:07,,,,Ive never been more motion sick than when using my Quest 2 Its why I cant do the flight sim type games Im better at games where I can stand still like Beat Saber,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt6veal,jl2352,,1,2025-05-19 21:15:43,,,,The motion sickness is because on a boat or a plane you can feel the motion In VR you cant and your body freaks out because you can see yourself moving but cant feel it Some people kind of get used to it A bit You can learn to cope with it It is a major issue that isnt really a great solution for Most games solve this through teleporting or limiting the FoV during movement neither of which is ideal as it can limit what can be done with gameplay,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt6xdia,Epitaphi,,1,2025-05-19 21:26:02,,,,Im the same as you but Ive found some games in VR will put me on my ass within seconds while others I can play for as long as I want It all depends on the game,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt6zwxl,snorlz,,1,2025-05-19 21:39:33,,,,yeah VR legs are real You do get used to it but it also helps to turn your body like you are on a skateboard instead of just facing the direction you are walking in game,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt73lmg,poomperzuhhh,,1,2025-05-19 21:59:30,,,,This happened to me too with the PS4 VR headset I dont get motion sickness or anything like that either I never have I do recall when HD TVs first became a thing myself and a friend were in an electronics store observing the new screens as closely as possible eyes against the screen marvelling at how small the pixels were 10 minutes later we both got a headache at the same time Perhaps just viewing fast moving tiny brightly lit details so closely aint for us,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt7lksu,brad1775,,1,2025-05-19 23:43:31,,,,thats because this is a different type of issue your eyes are having to focus at 2 m focal plane while the convergence to detect 3D has your eyes moving at a variable distance that is called the vergence accommodation conflict Motion sickness as youre describing it is due to a mismatch in the eyes ability to maintain horizon caused the vestibular ocular reflex,mt4fez1,3.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt98k07,Emperor-Commodus,,3,2025-05-20 06:50:43,,,,The decision to not give the AVP controllers is probably one of the most boneheaded tech decisions made by a company in recent memory I would guess that at least 90 of all time spent in VR is gaming and not having controllers both 1 Makes it much more difficult to port existing titles to AVP 2 Forces AVP games to use inferiorinmostrespects hand tracking It was no surprise that on launch the vast majority of VR game developers just shrugged their shoulders and ignored it And because most VR users are using them for gaming they cut themselves off from most of the use cases that their headset had Its really pretty shocking that they didnt see it coming,mt6pbak,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mtdbq7s,CaptCurmudgeon,,1,2025-05-20 21:45:22,,,,That may be true in the recreational sense but for professional applications the Vision Pro is significantly improved Being able to interact with AR objects and manipulate them is a superior feature that allows for a different type of application,mt6pbak,4.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt6ygd8,TwoBionicknees,,6,2025-05-19 21:31:41,,,,im guessing its more like if you talk about games it doesnt sound like a business product At 3500 this was targeted at business A lot of it was targeted as like you can seem like youre in the office have a large desk space but work from home and see what your kids are doing while checking your emails etc So its not the consumer they are selling to The guy wondering if an apple pro and sending everyone to work from home would help the company is who they were selling to telling that guy hey if you buy this theyll totally be able to play games while at work it would immediately be a no I do get why they would not allow games and certainly porn based on who this was aimed at if they sold a apple home version that was 700 and they marketed with no porn and no games it would be insane But this was targeted at people who might by 5k for their company,mt6f3lh,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt7cxpp,marcthenarc666,,12,2025-05-19 22:53:26,,,,Business Ha When you looked at the ads it was the most disconnected vision of how this would serve business You have one woman with the headset in conference with other people with no headset And how were they supposed to watch the Vision owner She didnt have a camera She had a device covering her eyes An avatar maybe They started to experiment with that I think but you get my point,mt6ygd8,5.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt99cxv,Emperor-Commodus,,6,2025-05-20 06:58:36,,,,And how were they supposed to watch the Vision owner She didnt have a camera She had a device covering her eyes An avatar maybe Apple acted like the EyeSight feature would make it look like you could see the users eyes through the headset They heavily misrepresented how visible the EyeSight feature was in use you can barely see the users eyes due to how dim the EyeSight screen is and the heavy blue glow effect they apply at all times and IMO they straightup lied by making it appear as if the EyeSight display could make your virtual eyes appear where your actual eyes were instead of on a 2D screen placed an inch ahead of where your eyes actually are which is what it did end up looking like,mt7cxpp,6.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt5eosh,peabody_here,,1,2025-05-19 16:56:53,,,,Downvotes and upvotes are meaningless so dont fret But yes your opinion is valid as is mine VR is incredibly niche so unless youre paying attention to VR a lot of its going to go under the radar Theres just so much good stuff Native games like Batman Walkabout Into the Radius Vertigo Ghost Town to name a few The modding scene is endless in whats available and racing and driving simulators are just perfect I honestly have a huge backlog of vr games at this point that I dont touch flat games anymore other than helldivers as I said earlier My taste though was already aligned with what VR is offering so Im eating good But if youre someone thats into RPGs or MMOs yeah VR isnt going to give you as much,mt582ri,8.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt4padm,yungfishstick,,25,2025-05-19 14:50:28,,,,Even on PCVR most of the games are just glorified tech demos which probably doesnt help Then theres the fact that very few people want to strap a somewhat heavy pair of goggles to their face potentially deal with motion sickness and have to get up and move around VR is great for simulators but other than that its sort of gimmicky It reminds me of the Wii in many ways,mt41onr,1.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt5kyal,yungfishstick,,2,2025-05-19 17:26:55,,,,On the PC side theyve all but solved the heavythingonyourface problem with headsets like the bigscreen Sure but that thing costs a little over 1K and you already need a pretty beefy PC that probably already costs over 1K to consistently run most VR titles well enough Someone whos just getting into PCVR or even standalone VR are going to go for the cheaper more accessible options like the Quest 3 or Pico 4 and not the expensive unicorns like Bigscreen Beyond My neck already has to support my largerthanaverage head so most headsets Ive tried dont feel heavy to me whatsoever but I can see how theyd feel heavy to the average person,mt4x623,3.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt55o20,Less_Party,,7,2025-05-19 16:12:21,,,,People do tend to think they want giant epic AAA games in VR until they actually get one of those and find out something like Skyrim is unfortunately just a lot more enjoyable when youre sitting in a chair in a pleasantly zoned out flow state compared to when youre stood in the middle of the living room waving your arms around for 60 hours,mt4padm,2.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt5mszr,TotoCocoAndBeaks,,5,2025-05-19 17:35:44,,,,to when youre stood in the middle of the living room waving your arms around for 60 hours You are doing it wrong then You play keyboard and mouse or with controller just with the VR view Its pretty chill until the various effects of VR get you Tbh for me its the constant pressure on my head and the eyestrain,mt55o20,3.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt6py5s,Andrew5329,,1,2025-05-19 20:48:26,,,,Well yeah its a catch 22 People dont buy VR because there isnt enough content to justify the price tag At the same time people dont make VR content because there arent enough active users to justify the cost of development The only way to really break that cycle is for the hardware maker to eat the cost of building a library of launch titles and hope it builds enough momentum,mt41onr,1.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt785q0,yamsyamsya,,1,2025-05-19 22:25:36,,,,Its because there arent a lot of games with complexity and depth on them yet Its only been recently that actual true VR games are starting to come out Before they are mostly glorified tech demos Games like Halflife Alyx are super uncommon But also using my Quest 3 for VR racing or playing elite dangerous is really awesome,mt41onr,1.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mtd2vwi,dmfreelance,,1,2025-05-20 20:59:47,,,,I disagree The thing that makes racing games different the in cockpit view gives you a frame of reference that doesnt move the motion sickness people get from playing VR games is due to the unnatural movement the disconnection between what your eyes see and with the organs in your inner ear are telling you about the motion you are experiencing Having something in the foreground that doesnt move something that your mind tells you is moving with you the player that can help with the motion sickness For some people they can actually tolerate it if they also take Dramamine while playing In my case I can play VR racing games for literal hours before I start to need to take Dramamine for the motion sickness With a normal 3d VR game and without dramamine I get motion sick within 5 minutes Its nauseating I hate it Racing games are the top tier vr experience imho,mtd28ft,3.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt4sylu,kuldan5853,,4,2025-05-19 15:08:55,,,,Well to be fair Im also watching movies on my Quest 3 I simply have no way to fit a 120 screen into my apartment even if my wife would agree to it And no watching on a 100 TV is simply not the same experience If I had the space to install a dedicated home cinema room with 120 screen and a decent sound system sure Id prefer that but my options are either using the Quest 3 or the 60 TV we have in the living room or setting up a temporary foldable screen and a projector in the living room we do this for movie nights with friends but the effort of putting it up and taking it down is prohibitive if I just want to watch a movie to relax by myself,mt4i3jr,7.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt4oy2d,wtfmatey88,,-1,2025-05-19 14:48:42,,,,Thats all Im saying lol Im not defending Apple Vision Pro but theyre totally different products and should not be compared,mt4i3jr,7.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt7kvc9,dreadcain,,1,2025-05-19 23:39:24,,,,Same resolution is same resolution The quality wont be better or worse Theater may look a little less sharp if youre sitting too close just because of the size of the pixels but if both screens are the same resolution and youre sitting at distances such that both screens take up the same amount of your field of view the image would be practically identical Audio quality isnt hard to replicate either though I understand not wanting to annoy your neighbors Theater audio is usually way overkill on the bass But really like I think you just dont remember what 480 actually looks like if you have a 2k tv 480 was VHS quality Theres absolutely diminishing returns on quality but no one wants to go back to watching vhss,mt7b2a3,10.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt5qrbl,Sopel97,,0,2025-05-19 17:54:26,,,,You miss the fact that the TV size doesnt matter past a point you can comfortably recline your legs in front of it The experience is a function of size and viewing distance Unless youre bad at interior design or want to accomodate more than a handful of people you dont need more than 65 inch for a comfortable cinematic experience,mt491q9,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt68cwj,zefiax,,2,2025-05-19 19:20:53,,,,I have a 77 TV It still doesnt compare to going to the theatres because there is a sense of scale that is derived from the distance of the screen itself Unless you only have one eye that plays a huge factor in scale,mt5qrbl,5.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt42mbo,Gamebird8,,149,2025-05-19 12:43:26,,,,Smart Glasses that offload all the compute logic to your phone is arguably the only successful version of this technology I could ever see succeed People really just dont want to wear bulky headsets VR can justify that existence because you really dont wear it that long and youre able to justify the bulkiness because of what it can do But the usefulness of AR doesnt really get you anywhere unless it is legitimately less cumbersome than lifting your phone up to look at it,mt3y9q3,1.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt62pse,BaronVonMunchhausen,,2,2025-05-19 18:52:43,,,,Didnt they spectacularly failed at VR Isnt that a downfall Call it their Achilles heel I couldnt care less You are missing the point Apples issue will always be its closed ecosystem If they had a more open ecosystem the would bring talent from all over the place They would destroy windows pc Sure its ok for tech illiterate folk who just want to browse But any serious application you either go to Linux or Windows Even android Because of being able to tweak things to your needs is a very powerful quality VR is in its infancy and the reason other VR systems work and improve is not only the price range because we all know there are VR headset more expensive than apples out there but its sideloading and user driven innovation which is making tons of progress All VR headset out there are benefiting from OpenXR improvements while apple is in their corner eatign their buggers in AR and doing a lot of damage to the technologys adoption by misrepresenting VR to a large user base You can fanboy after Tim Apple all you want but this was a major fuckup IF you dont believe me you can read the article on the post,mt5tpcy,2.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mtf69yd,kevi959,,1,2025-05-21 04:30:27,,,,VR and AR has never felt to me like it left early adoption phase in usage Sure many people owned a form of vr but its much like Guitar Hero or rock band Peripherals that just dont match the ease of use of just sitting on the couch and watching tv or gaming And I love VR,,0.0,1kq9y3d

comment,mt4rndp,BobbyP27,,2,2025-05-19 15:02:19,,,,Its a solution looking for a problem It works just fine for what it does but nobody has managed to come up with a compelling reason to use it Sure it has a few niche applications but in terms of mainstream appeal there just isnt any reason for someone to actually want to use it People have been hyping it for over a decade insisting that it will be the next big thing but that just isnt happening,mt4as6q,2.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt4s1bw,DarthBuzzard,,0,2025-05-19 15:04:16,,,,Its an early industry with clunky immature hardware so its not viable for average people right now Early adopters on the other hand understand the usecases things like fitness live events communication media consumption gaming,mt4rndp,3.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt4vnqb,BobbyP27,,1,2025-05-19 15:22:28,,,,It isnt an early industry though The Occulus Rift the start of modern consumergrade VR headsets launched in 2012 13 years ago 13 years after the first GSM network went live commercially we had phones like the Nokia RAZR 13 years after the IBM PC first went on sale we were looking at the imminent release of Windows 95 13 years after Tim Berners Lee invented the concept of the world wide web we had Facebook and Twitter It only took 15 years from the first commercially manufactured automobile in the US to the launch of the Model T Ford For a technology that actually makes a difference in the consumer space that is more than enough time to make it out of the clunky immature hardware and early adopter phase The fact that VR has not made it past that raises serious questions If not now then when,mt4s1bw,4.0,1kq9y3d
comment,mt4vzvk,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-05-19 15:24:10,,,,13 years after the IBM PC first went on sale we were looking at the imminent release of Windows 95 IBM PCs came out a decade after the PC market started So yeah VR is early Its also worth noting that VR is a harder set of engineering challenges today than PCs were back then,mt4vnqb,5.0,1kq9y3d
