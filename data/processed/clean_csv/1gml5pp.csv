comment,lw3q2nn,9J8H,,20,2024-11-08 16:39:41,,,,That is very true GPU prices were outrageously high at the time of the PS5 release Ultimately though I got a build with a 3070 after it cooled off and it was about 1200 Youre right though the PS5 was definitely a better value at MSRP at that specific time,lw3pobr,3.0,1gml5pp

comment,lw3df3j,Hippobu2,,107,2024-11-08 15:38:03,,,,Looking at the number of 360 and PS3 sold then the number of XBO and PS4 sold Id argue that Microsoft probably sold 1 PS4 and PS5 for every 2 that Sony does What Im trying to say is that the total market hasnt expanded much between 360 and PS3 vs XBO and PS4 people just shifted from 360 to PS4 in droves and MS is the reason for that,lw3cl99,1.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3hklb,Elmodipus,,113,2024-11-08 15:58:24,,,,Its crazy that MS had the world in their hands after the 360 and then proceeded to fumble every step afterwards,lw3df3j,2.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3jpk9,Will_Lucky,,75,2024-11-08 16:08:54,,,,Combination of Kinect and software from both Microsoft and Sony Microsoft have a lot of hits on the 360 until Kinect some after but not the same quantity Sony seemed to recover from the missteps of the PS3 about a year or so before Kinect and proceeded to release banger after banger Microsoft instead of pivoting double downed on Kinect for the One as well as the whole its a media box not a console obsession Mistake after mistake they just never recovered from,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3uvp5,Edofero,,27,2024-11-08 17:02:41,,,,Funny as thats exactly what Yahoo did they desperately wanted to be seen as a media company and not a tech company Then Google which focused on tech just blew them away Thats what happens when corporatebusiness leaders get in positions of power instead of tech enthusiasts,lw3jpk9,4.0,1gml5pp

comment,lw3q7vj,Bloatfizzle,,27,2024-11-08 16:40:23,,,,Their Xbox One E3 conference is a 5 minute ted talk on how to tank a company They introduced digital games too soon and from that point on so many people chose PS4 and stayed within the ecosystem,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp

comment,lw56cvb,None,,3,2024-11-08 20:57:30,,,,Yeah the mandatory Kinect and used game restrictions really killed their momentum and they ended up folding on both of those things so it was completely pointless I disagree about the second part though The superiority of Xbox Live during the PS3 era is one of the big things that carried them I honestly think that a lot of their current customers were people who bought into their ecosystem with the 360 and never left Without the success of the 360 and Xbox Live Xbox would be totally dead now Had they not fumbled with the Xbox One and kept a majority of those 360 customers I think they would be in great shape right now because the PS4 generation was the generation when the online gaming stuff became extremely important The PS4 launched early enough that there were plenty of people who werent so invested in the Microsoft ecosystem that they werent willing to switch over Tons of 360 owners bought PS4s and thats why Microsoft is sorta fucked now,lw3q7vj,4.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw5h4sr,VidE27,,3,2024-11-08 21:52:56,,,,They lost the worst generation to lose in The PS4XBox One gen was the first gen with the x86 ongoing platform so future backward compatibility will be easier and where digital download really took off People with massive libraries collected during this era will of course stick to their platform of choice MS shouldve stick to x86 for their x360,lw3q7vj,4.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3uy7u,NotAGingerMidget,,7,2024-11-08 17:03:02,,,,By the end of the generation the PS3 had surpassed the 360 in sales it took a while to get going but by the time PS4 was coming out the tides were already changing that E3 conference just sent it in overdrive,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw4qfzp,CaptainSnatchbox,,9,2024-11-08 19:37:02,,,,Microsoft got smoked in the 360 era by Sony too The sales for the 360 are juiced up by people buying 2 of 3 of them because they had a 60 failure rate and no one was going to toss out all the games they bought for it The 360 sales are bullshit to me because the number makes it seem like they had a way larger player base than they actually did,lw3uy7u,4.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3x06w,comm02,,24,2024-11-08 17:13:02,,,,I used to work for a major gaming company its a truism but games sell consoles Xbox back in the 360 days was known as shooter box Shooters outsold any other genre on Xbox by a huge amount so much so that a lot of publishers didnt really push out anything original on Xbox just ports Halo Gears CoD were the big hitters on Xbox at the time Xbox never diversified its base audience and when it fumbled Halo there was no reason to stick around on Xbox as the shooter genre was evolving Also gen z and gen a consume games differently than millennials and older They only play two or three games but they invest a ton of time into the game and spend a lot on that game think Fortnite Roblox CoD This is dangerous for console makers as it lowers the number of games sold on a console My hot take got no evidence is that the console user base is greying out and the younger generations arent buying enough games to sustain the typical console model going forward I call one more generation of standalone Xbox hardware and two more generations of standalone PlayStation hardware before consoles move to a lower cost thin clientcloud based and byod model,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw57a0g,None,,6,2024-11-08 21:02:07,,,,People keep hyping the Cloud but I just dont think itll ever happen People dont want to need to be online 100 of the time to play games necessarily and the latency issues will never totally be solved But I could be wrong,lw3x06w,4.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw60c98,CompletelyRandy,,1,2024-11-08 23:38:54,,,,I was under the same impression till I used it My TV comes with Xbox Game Pass just connect my controller and Im playing Forza 5 in a few seconds Granted its as good as my gaming PC but it certainly replaced a console for me I have no real issues apart from a small stutter here and there I do only use it for light use my main gaming is done on my PC,lw57a0g,5.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw6d4v7,craftsta,,3,2024-11-09 00:53:48,,,,nah only because there will always be a market for a prepackaged gaming PC and who better to deliver it than the games companies that exist and even new entrants like Steam Cloud wont work without serious infrastructure adoption of edge computing tech in a way thats almost certainly more than a decade away So hey maybe you are right after all,lw3x06w,4.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw4r21l,ChafterMies,,4,2024-11-08 19:40:06,,,,As soon as I saw the E3 2013 presentation I knew Xbox One would be a failure If they at least had backwards compatibility at launch they might have kept another ten million gamers in their ecosystem,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw4e89t,Realistic_Condition7,,3,2024-11-08 18:36:40,,,,Kinda unfortunate too because I think they make a great product but PS4 was the worst generation to lose because that was the rise of digital gaming which locks you into an ecosystem and it was also kinda the big wall of diminishing returns generation so there really are no gimmicks to make people want to jump ship no matter how comparable the Xbox is unless Sony just fucks everything up,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp
comment,lw3kc6s,The_Retro_Bandit,,4,2024-11-08 16:11:58,,,,More like after Halo 3 Exclusived slowed down after that and none of them made the same cultural waves Then Sony exclusives started ramping up to the point where PS3 actually overtook the 360 near the end of their life cycles,lw3hklb,3.0,1gml5pp

comment,lw581y1,None,,10,2024-11-08 21:06:02,,,,Yeah but its in a pretty different category honestly Its the midway point between a handheld and a proper console Nintendo basically combined their two income streams into one It was a pretty huge success but they cannibalized their GameboyDS business in order to make it happen It was also 100 cheaper than the other consoles at launch which really helped In any event I think comparing it to the PS4PS5 and the Xbox line is an applestooranges comparison,lw47159,4.0,1gml5pp

comment,lw5a2xp,None,,1,2024-11-08 21:16:19,,,,The 360 was better early in the generation I think and usually had better multiplatform games like GTA but Sony picked up steam later one when they were able to get out a bunch of mustplay exclusives like Uncharted and TLOU I owned both machines at various points Early PS3 was sorta a shit show To Sonys credit though they were able to turn it around and tie it up late in the generation Both were great machines ultimately,lw44dxd,3.0,1gml5pp
