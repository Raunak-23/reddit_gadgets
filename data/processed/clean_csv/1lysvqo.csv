comment,n2xzpvh,NikolasDude,,8,2025-07-13 18:52:31,,,,It doesnt sound the best without the subwoofer for sure with the subwoofer though its pretty good The bummer about this model is not being able to see and confirm that you are getting DTS or Dolby Digital Digital Plus As far as I can tell this one only has a way to tell you if Dolby Atmos is activated,n2xwmc7,1.0,1lysvqo
comment,n337s7s,mkvii1989,,2,2025-07-14 15:14:52,,,,Needing a subwoofer to sound good is a deal breaker for me Im going to get a sub anyway but if you need one to sound good it means the crossover is going to be set so high the sub is filling out lowmids like male voices which is far from ideal,n2xzpvh,2.0,1lysvqo
comment,n34l5dh,NikolasDude,,1,2025-07-14 19:05:19,,,,That definitely makes sense and I may have over exaggerated but the subwoofer definitely comes to good use and I wouldnt ever see myself in any situation turning it off when playing games watching movies or listening to music With all the pieces in play this soundbar provides a decently impressive sound for someone like me who used to be big on finding high quality masters and rips for my Sennheiser HD650s back when I still had them,n337s7s,3.0,1lysvqo
comment,n31m7uf,robben1234,,2,2025-07-14 08:55:09,,,,I dont think worrying about whether the Atmos channels are playing with a crappy device like this is productive at all The only purpose the flawed design which are soundbars have is to make sure you can hear dialogue via distinct center channel if your content mastering was lazy enough to fail to include 20 track and instead only has 51 If you actually care about height channels and dont want to throw money at the wind you should be getting an AVR capable of at least 7 channels and mounting speakers at the ceiling level,n2xzpvh,2.0,1lysvqo
comment,n34kkx9,NikolasDude,,1,2025-07-14 19:02:36,,,,Have you tested this particular model yourself and deduced it was crappy Or did you see the Samsung name and then make the assumption I will not come out and say Samsung soundbars are an audiophiles dream or that Samsung is the single best possible option for this price range but I will say they make for excellent upgrades to TV speakers especially when you dont have the space or wherewithal to set up 7 channels throughout a room Even for those where it may fit and they dont need to worry about angering their landlord by screwing holes into the wallsceiling many people dont like the look of having dedicated speakers all over the place and would prefer the one simple and clean soundbar that provides them with a sound they are more than happy with This isnt the audiophile subreddit and I totally understand this soundbar isnt for people like you but that doesnt mean it doesnt provide a good solution for others especially if you enjoy being able to control your soundbar quickly and easily through the SmartThings ecosystem,n31m7uf,3.0,1lysvqo

comment,n2zcfu8,SuperSaiyanTupac,,-8,2025-07-13 23:03:45,,,,We have had sound systems for decades now they could easily make a theatre quality experience in one small box if they wanted Soundbars and subwoofers are horseshit The tech is never going to improve Just the same overpriced bullshit,,0.0,1lysvqo
comment,n2zkwvc,bonesnaps,,6,2025-07-13 23:51:43,,,,Subwoofers are good in combination with studio monitors Soundbars are a bit of a meme though,n2zcfu8,1.0,1lysvqo
comment,n30fqq2,Evo1889,,3,2025-07-14 02:57:24,,,,Care to share some examples I still have bookshelf speakers and a subwoofer Would like something smaller,n2zcfu8,1.0,1lysvqo
