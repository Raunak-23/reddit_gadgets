comment,lxgw7a8,DataWaveHi,,2,2024-11-16 18:27:17,,,,Their naming is completely fucked The issue they had was PlayStation was on PS3 while Xbox would have been called the Xbox 2 Dumb consumers especially parents buying consoles for their kids would automatically buy a PS3 because a 3 is bigger than a 2 so it must be newer and better So to combat that they called their second gen Xbox the Xbox 360 Also 360 sounds bigger than just the number 3 Well that screwed them with naming because their next Xbox they called the Xbox One PlayStation moved to PS4 And I truly thing the name Xbox one is also one reason it wasnt as successful as the ps4 not counting all the always online and Kinect crap that killed them that generation Now they have series x and series s but again the naming convention is confusing for non gamer consumers buying consoles for their kids or spouse etc,lx8icz8,1.0,1grq021

comment,lxd90r2,BlazeOfGlory72,,33,2024-11-16 01:58:58,,,,Thats honestly not nearly as bad as I thought Makes me wonder why Microsoft is so set on throwing in the towel on the console war Make a few of those upcoming ActivisionBethesda games exclusive and they could probably have narrowed the gap somewhat especially with Sony seemingly struggling to put out AAA games this generation,lx9n7s0,1.0,1grq021

comment,lx8f91v,Jamvaan,,16,2024-11-15 08:30:42,,,,Itll be interesting to see where everyone is at 4 years from now presumably when this current console generation ends Im sure the Xbox Division will want to design a new Xbox if they arent already but when it comes time to throw the lever turn on the money and start building will it make sense to do it Same for Sony I really feel like we could be getting a longer gen this time out with just how expensive it will be to build a next gen console to not being able to sell it for a reasonable price,lx8cfkb,3.0,1grq021
comment,lx8fqih,Trosque97,,10,2024-11-15 08:35:33,,,,People really havent been paying attention to diminishing returns graphically speaking The fact that the Xbone my brother has can still play a ton of games because of Gamepass has me genuinely surprised One would think the eyesore that was the launch of that console would make them want to discontinue it and instead they gift us backwards compatibility The customer centric approach from Microsoft really makes me think theyre gonna come out on top one way or another as console upgrades become as optional as PC upgrades as time goes on Unless of course Sony has their hand in it they really seem to enjoy fucking with their customers,lx8f91v,4.0,1grq021

comment,lx9o16v,skeetmcque,,1,2024-11-15 14:28:29,,,,I think with the sheer size of Microsoft and the low profit margins from gaming that its fair to wonder if Microsoft would even consider Xbox a valuable part of their portfolio long term From a shareholder perspective Xbox might provide more value if they can spin it off as a separate company and use the money from the IPO to invest into more profitable segments of their business like AI and cloud,lx8fqih,5.0,1grq021
comment,lx9qc18,Trosque97,,3,2024-11-15 14:41:13,,,,3 to 4 bil a year on console profits alone not counting the money earned on PC or Playstation sales of Xbox games not exactly low profit Even if you count in the 70 bil for the activitision acquisition thats like saying your monthly salary is unfortunately too small to pay off your house in less than a year Although I do think youre on to something in the sense that Xbox is definitely using a very different strategy that might already be going in the way you predict just not exactly the way you think But who knows maybe time will prove us both wrong,lx9o16v,6.0,1grq021
comment,lx9ttzz,skeetmcque,,7,2024-11-15 14:59:57,,,,They made around 3 billion in console revenue last year not profit Most of the growth in gaming came from the Activision acquisition I just think for a company like Microsoft gaming is such a small part of their business that its fair to wonder how much their current strategy makes sense long term They could capture 100 of the gaming market and it would still be smaller than their other segments,lx9qc18,7.0,1grq021
comment,lxct5iu,stackjr,,2,2024-11-16 00:18:28,,,,You are absolutely correct For a long time Xbox was just a rounding error for Microsoft but that changed when Activision Blizzard was acquired for an ungodly amount of money Now they MS need Xbox to be significantly more profitable than they currently are but they are still struggling with first party titles even though they have bought up some huge studios Something has to give and sadly I think it will be the console division Full disclosure I own a Series X PS5 and gaming PC I simply love gaming no matter the platform,lx9ttzz,8.0,1grq021
comment,lxd3h5b,skeetmcque,,1,2024-11-16 01:23:14,,,,Im not necessarily saying Xbox will go away more that it might not make sense for Microsoft Perhaps by acquiring Activision the goal is to build up the gaming division so it can be a stand alone company and have a profitable IPO If Microsoft can spin off Xbox for a 200 billion IPO and get a small stake it might make more sense from a shareholder value perspective,lxct5iu,9.0,1grq021
comment,lx9s3mi,Metaloneus,,0,2024-11-15 14:50:47,,,,Sony isnt doing better than Microsoft but PlayStation is objectively doing better than Xbox Once you isolate the gaming element of each company its pretty crystal clear Xbox still hasnt made any public commitment that they have made any profit on GamePass making it likely that they are juggling massive amounts of debt to keep it running Expenses of catalog are probably more than revenue of subscribers This isnt even mentioning acquisition costs Meanwhile their market share continue to drop year over year PlayStation Steam and Nintendo all take slightly more of Xboxs piece of the pie annually To respond Xbox continues to spend ridiculous amounts of money that goes into acquisitions and programs that dontdo anything for brandhardware loyalty Phil Spencer is either out of the loop here or lying to save face The future of Xbox ironically as they phrased it to Nintendo is not selling games on its own hardware I say all of this as someone who grew up with an Xbox upgraded to the 360 and then bought an Xbox One with my first few paychecks as an adult Xbox chased their people away and have continued to do so,lx8cfkb,3.0,1grq021
comment,lx9w5of,ripamaru96,,2,2024-11-15 15:12:10,,,,I definitely dont play enough games to have the knowledge others do anymore since kids and life and cancer took my game time away But for me the existence of game pass automatically defeats PlayStation Especially since I can use my brothers subscription lmao I got a series X and thats the final gaming expense for me for the most part Nothing Sony does better can overcome having to buy every game I want to play again,lx9s3mi,4.0,1grq021
comment,lxa2mcb,Metaloneus,,3,2024-11-15 15:44:52,,,,Which is great except again not a single commitment that GamePass has made a profit ever Only that it has impressive revenue This is a public company they arent just being humble Either GamePass will be a failed platform or they will need to drastically increase the cost of GamePass Think early DoorDash It wasnt profitable It was virtually the cost of food and a tip and turned no profit Today you are charged a delivery fee handling fee and uncharged on any food you ordered Thats objectively the future of GamePass Especially as their market share continues to dwindle and they have less console users to advertise it to PC GamePass is a thing but it doesnt even dent into Valves market Best of luck with your battle Im rooting for you,lx9w5of,5.0,1grq021

comment,lxa5jle,Inkjg,,3,2024-11-15 15:59:29,,,,Nintendo does have crazy good will also being the place to play Pokemon and Mario games certainly helps But on a more controversial take most of the people who bought it dont give a shit that its 30 fps fps numbers only matter to relatively small number gamers compared to total switch sales It being portable and having the previously mentioned series is way more important than any fps numbers,lx9t5k5,6.0,1grq021
comment,lxa87cb,Metaloneus,,1,2024-11-15 16:12:46,,,,Im in the middle of you and the comment above mine My daily user now is a Steam Deck so depending on the game I could be playing 30 40 60 or 120 fps A smooth 30 just isnt a slideshow like the comment above mine portrayed it thats a ridiculously spoiled take Its like complaining that meatloaf is bad because youve only ever had to eat prime grade steaks The change is noticeable and Nintendo should work on it but it also is perfectly playable Some people have never had to try to run Halo or Minecraft on a low spec family computer and it shows,lxa5jle,7.0,1grq021

comment,lxajuqb,hyperforms9988,,2,2024-11-15 17:10:04,,,,100 this but people want what other people have and people want to continue building what they have Xbox as a home console business and maybe the business of the entire platform cannot afford to have a drought when they are losing market share andor dont have the dominant position in market share If everybody has Playstation then theres no desire to get an Xbox If you want to gain market share you need to give people a reason to make a switch if theyre not already on that platform You are asking people to give up a library of games under Playstation to give up their friends list their trophies if youre into multiplayer and the games arent crossplay then youre giving up multiplayer communitiesplayer numbers etc to make that switch and thats a very tall order Without giving people that reason to switch people are just going to stay where they are For Playstation that means it can sit on its roost and do nothing Xbox doesnt get the same luxury unless its happy with what market share it has its happy with sales numbers for their software and they arent looking to grow more than where they are right now As a publicly traded company staying in your lane is never the MO so I cant imagine that Microsoft is not looking to grow They should be in overdrive mode if they want to grow the way Nintendo was after the Wii U bombed and they were like holy shit this could be the end of our entire video game centric business if we dont course correct and thats how we got the Switch and the absolute fucking barrage of Nintendo software that that console got within its first 3 years or so,lx96q6r,3.0,1grq021

comment,lxa71rn,OldTeaching84,,0,2024-11-15 16:07:02,,,,Its so funny that Microsoft decides to expand their gaming division but yet people especially Sony fanboys dont say the same things about in regard to Sony I think whats pathetic is the fact that a lot of people especially Sony fanboys still believe that Sony cares about them even though Sony has been dropping their first party games on pc and those games arent exclusives anymore Im confused as to how a lot of people especially Sony fanboys dont see the writing on the wall already Why do you think Sony is so fixated on making live service and subscription games I think Sony is trying to compromise and change the way they go about business because they understand that this is the only reason as to how they can stay afloat You guys think that now there are more ways to about playing Xbox games which is weakening the Xbox brand I can understand if there are people dont like seeing this direction because they still believe in this whole console exclusivity which is not true anymore because Pc gaming has been getting all of sony first party allegedly exclusives games and Sony didnt care about locking those games down as exclusives You dont need a PlayStation console to play those quote unquote exclusive game which you know the same argument that people especially Sony fanboys use towards Xbox What I find confusing is the fact that a lot of people especially Sony fanboys have so much confidence in the concept of exclusivity even though Sony is essentially backdooring their customers by putting all the major exclusives on pc and nobody says that would disvalue the PlayStation console The highest selling games on PlayStation 5 happen to be Xbox games which are Diablo 4 call of duty and sea of thieves A lot of people especially Sony fanboys are mad at the fact that Microsoft has expanded further past the whole concept of a console and this is how how theyre making their money Microsoft has outgrew the concept of console gaming and they realize that they can make money off on mobile platform pc platform and even from Sony fanboys Thats why Sony is struggling and Microsoft Xbox isnt Microsoft is able to offer their games on Xbox ecosystem through subscription service for their consumers while Sony fanboys have to pay for those games on their ps5 Lets be honest Sony always does things late and PlayStation 5 is just Xbox one of this generation Microsoft decided to put their games on pc during the Xbox one era and moved it to something else Sony will follow suit and Sony are always known for copying Microsoft Xbox Since PlayStation owners didnt pick up an Xbox console and Xbox owners didnt pick up a PlayStation console all this time now Microsoft xbox and Sony have to find a way to bridge the gap so they can continue to make money,lx9718l,3.0,1grq021

comment,lxb644a,Pitiful_Dig_165,,4,2024-11-15 19:00:16,,,,A fucking Xbox cant do that either Having playable games at less than 4k is absolutely doable and is whats enjoyed by the overwhelming number of PC players Dont forget that a PC also doubles as a fully functioning computer that does all the other things you might otherwise buy an expensive laptop for The peripherals too extend beyond a single generation of machine and usually last much longer than something like an Xbox controller with a lot less defects,lxb5986,4.0,1grq021

comment,lxai9db,Optimus_Prime_Day,,1,2024-11-15 17:02:10,,,,I agree Steam is great and its got longterm games but you buy consoles for the new gen games not old games To do that youd also need a new GPU on PC That cost factors in to play the latest games Either a console or a GPU and sometimes entirely new PC hardware,lxaf8l5,3.0,1grq021

comment,lx915nt,JadowArcadia,,-2,2024-11-15 12:01:13,,,,I think its one of those things where you decide when to put the work in Between upgrades my PC gives me zero stress I upgraded back in 2020 and spent 700 on a 3080 and have no need to make any other changes I only upgraded my CPU recently because my friend needed my own parts otherwise Id probably have spent no money on it until next gen Even then Ive often experienced my parts lasting far into the next generation PCs are definitely more work but its pretty easy to be getting a better experience than console for a good price if you plan your upgrades decently You just have to look at it over time rather than as an initial purchase on the day My friends on consoles have ended up exceeding the price of my PC based on paying for online and other console awkwardness Its subjective to a degree though,lx8qkpe,2.0,1grq021

comment,lx8qi69,Hippobu2,,1,2024-11-15 10:25:52,,,,You guys think the Steam Box can make a comeback now Idk I just expect MS to stop making consoles and instead turn Gamepass into a platform and let other manufacturers make their own consoles that run that platform like a PC or a phone But then Steam did this Not even that long ago And they failed miserably How did that happen,,0.0,1grq021

comment,lx8wuym,CoverEconomy5523,,4,2024-11-15 11:25:51,,,,The main difference is games are a completely different way to consume media Most movies and shows are 30 minutes to 2 hours A video game is usually shortest 6 hours but often upwards of 20 Sure thats similar to binging a TV show but its also way less passive than watching TV I think because of its lack of passiveness and the passion people have behind gaming people will still want physical games more than ever,lx8ds37,1.0,1grq021

comment,lx871u7,CosmicCreeperz,,3,2024-11-15 07:12:30,,,,How is selling 30 million consoles a failure Sure it didnt sell as many as the PS5 And the XBOne didnt sell as many as the PS4 But if MSFTs XBox division is profitable and it is its not a failure,lx84m6b,1.0,1grq021
comment,lx8akru,KAKYBAC,,-7,2024-11-15 07:45:18,,,,30 million is a failure Theyll likely get one more spin at the wheel but release another 30 million console and theyll be done I predict the next gen will be the last anyway and I think they will push a one for all solution trying to marry their elongated back catalogues with their future games as service models,lx871u7,2.0,1grq021
comment,lx8blut,CosmicCreeperz,,5,2024-11-15 07:55:02,,,,Eh this is not a zero sum game If they make a profit they make a profit Theres no magical bonus award for selling more consoles than competitors other than the potential for more subscriptions games sales and more profit Microsoft is worth well over 3 trillion They can do this as long as they want And if it makes a profit why not,lx8akru,3.0,1grq021

comment,lxa70vq,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-15 16:06:55,,,,Except its not a failure You really should look at the numbers Xbox gaming revenues increased by 165 in 2023 compared to 15563 billion in 2022 This is an increase of 256 billion Nintendo is slightly down revenuewise at least for calendar 2023 The company made about 1208 billion in 2023 down 4 from last years 126 billion So is Nintendo a failure Should they just shut down as a company since they are in third place even though they are also profitable in fact their margins are the highest Note Xboxs divisions profit margins were HIGHER than PlayStation last year High revenue without profit isnt winning for such mature businesses,lx8h4lm,5.0,1grq021

comment,lxa8ad2,CosmicCreeperz,,0,2024-11-15 16:13:10,,,,Bare what I love it when people without a proper high school education try to do business Xbox division had a higher profit margin than PlayStation last year Who gives a shit about unit sales or revenues companies care about profit Samsung sold more phones by unit count than Apple last quarter Does that mean they are winning,lx8rm8r,3.0,1grq021

comment,lxacy4s,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-15 16:36:11,,,,No youre uneducated because you know clearly know nothing about basic corporate accounting or business strategy I have been in strategy meetings with both companies in the last few years Its funny to see the different perspectives Sony is always concerned about the bottom line and allocating their still limited resources effectively though they are in better shape now and Microsoft just has this crazy confidence because they know their company prints money and gaming has Nadellas full support MSFT paid 70B for Activion FFS Sonys entire market cap is less than twice that which is 4 of MSFTs,lxaawu6,5.0,1grq021
