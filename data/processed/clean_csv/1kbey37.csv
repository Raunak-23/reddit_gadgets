comment,mpu2kgc,bielgio,,126,2025-04-30 13:15:02,,,,A couple of years ago we got a new proposal for PC power supply standard it would use 24v for high power application like GPU and CPU instead we got high efficiency standby power and connectors melting,,0.0,1kbey37
comment,mpua3v5,ChoMar05,,47,2025-04-30 13:56:18,,,,The problem is that PCs are a very legacy market Everything is supported very long And while you can get cheap adapters for other old things like PCI and IDE even more so when those technologies where used parallel to what we have now building a PSU with 12 and 24v and maintaining high efficiency while staying in the form factor will probably be very expensive So youll have to switch GPU CPU PSU and probably fans unless the Mainboard transforms that voltage which probably will hurt efficiency and additional stuff like drives or RGB I mean its still not a bad idea but every time someone tried to implement a completely incompatible standard in the PC Market they failed so I can see why no one is doing it,mpu2kgc,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mpug6cd,bielgio,,36,2025-04-30 14:27:29,,,,The proposed standard were fully compatible Today we could fit two 1kw units in the same form factor for the same price as 1kw consumer unit server standard shows that,mpua3v5,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mpyf028,re_carn,,6,2025-05-01 02:47:06,,,,Legacy in PCs is pretty oneway you could connect for example an old motherboard to a new power supply but the other way around wont work theres no extra power connector for the CPU And that was fine with everyone Adding new connectors for connecting highconsumption devices would not create any problem if you want a new video card buy a new power supply unit this is relevant even without the new standard,mpua3v5,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mpxqfo5,redittr,,6,2025-05-01 00:23:20,,,,You are thinking of negative as 0 volts being the only possibility The difference between 0v and 12v is 12volts The difference between 12v and 0v is 12volts The difference between 12v and 12v is 24volts As mentioned currently this rail only can provide a small amount of power,mpx8k00,4.0,1kbey37
comment,mpycgog,TooStrangeForWeird,,-5,2025-05-01 02:31:33,,,,It provides no power at all Do you know how electricity works Not trying to be mean but you seem to be under the impression that the negative or neutral wire provides power It doesnt There isnt positive and negative electricity Positive is where the electrons are flowing from and negative is where they flow to Its easier to think of it as a loop where your device like a processor just uses some of that electricity The rest of it just flows back down the loop Its a simplified explanation but AC power like for your house is pretty much exactly that DC currents like computers use are slightly more complicated its the same idea overall though,mpxqfo5,5.0,1kbey37
comment,mpz4wec,hi_there_im_nicole,,7,2025-05-01 06:02:25,,,,This whole comment is very inaccurate What matters is the voltage potential between two conductors It doesnt have to be a positive wire and a ground wire it can be any wires at different voltages You could even use a 12v and a 5v wire and youd get 7 volts across them Any electrical device connected across this circuit cant even tell the lower voltage wire isnt at ground potential without a ground reference It doesnt matter at all This principle is how North American houses get 240v for large appliances like electric stoves dryers and water heaters There is no 240v line running to the house Instead the appliance is connected across two splitphase 120v conductors Being 180 out of phase with each other at a point in time one is at 120 volt potential while the other is at 120 volts giving the appliance a total of 240 volts RMS Its a neat way to make higher voltages and powers available in a circuit while simplifying the power supply and in the case of residential AC power maintaining a lower safer maximum differential from ground,mpycgog,6.0,1kbey37
comment,mq0fm6t,suicidaleggroll,,1,2025-05-01 13:01:41,,,,What matters is the voltage potential between two conductors It doesnt have to be a positive wire and a ground wire it can be any wires at different voltages You could even use a 12v and a 5v wire and youd get 7 volts across them While true you would get 7V across them that doesnt mean you could use that 7V to power something In order to do that the 5V rail would need to be able to sink current Many DC supplies can only source current they cant sink so if you tried to use it as the return for your 7V supply youd just end up pulling that 5V rail up to 12V and most likely damaging something,mpz4wec,7.0,1kbey37
comment,mpypi40,redittr,,4,2025-05-01 03:57:38,,,,Do you know how electricity works It has been a while since I was at school but I have a good enough idea Firstly this is wrong There isnt positive and negative electricity Positive is where the electrons are flowing from and negative is where they flow to Electrons flow from negative to positive Electrons are negative charged Protons are positively charged Neutrons are not charged either way Protons and electrons want to balance each other out so the loose electrons flow from negative to positive but you seem to be under the impression that the negative or neutral wire provides power It doesnt Negative and neutral are different things Negative doesnt provide power Neither does positive either really Its the difference between the two which is the power,mpycgog,6.0,1kbey37
comment,mq0f41j,suicidaleggroll,,1,2025-05-01 12:58:41,,,,He got his terminology a little off but the result is the same The 12v rail in a computer PSU can only sink a small amount of current so it cant be used to maintain a 24V differential with the 12v rail at high current If you try to push more than an amp or so into the 12v rail it will collapse and potentially damage the regulator thats generating it,mpycgog,6.0,1kbey37

comment,mpu8qnw,hungry4pie,,62,2025-04-30 13:49:04,,,,Its fucking wild to me that theyre still clinging to 12VDC especially since PC power supplies have been pulling more than 10A at 110VAC for like 10 years now the more high end ones at least This isnt as big a problem in Australia and Europe since we use 240V but its going to become a problem eventually But by then gaming PCs and graphics cards will become so expensive that only the 9 richest kings of Europe will afford them,mpttk8s,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mpualng,lunas2525,,23,2025-04-30 13:58:53,,,,Yeah imho nvidia and amd are both going in the wrong direction the power requirements should not be pushing the limits of household wiring And if a gpu is going to need 600w they either have to do something about the amperage thicker wires or more of them and current balanced which is part of the issue here or they could go to a 24v or 48v standard Or gpu can have their own dedicated power brick and isolate from system power Imagine a laptop barrel jack on the back of the card and a 12v48v power brick Apparently the main reasons not to go over 12v is increased emi and the size of components Still they either need to stop throwing more wattage at the issue and work within a envelope that does not meltdown when at full use Or they need to figure out how to safely do it,mpu8qnw,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mpx8uth,TooStrangeForWeird,,5,2025-04-30 22:44:09,,,,The raw power going through them is the problem Sure we got better at filtering interference but an overclocked 2001 Athlon cant pull 600 fuckin watts lol,mpx76xl,4.0,1kbey37

comment,mpuxf2a,lunas2525,,12,2025-04-30 15:51:17,,,,It was designed for 450w and 600w Cards that have 350w loads are still melting because for some odd reason the card and psu decide all 300w need to come over 1 or 2 18 gauge wire,mpuvruw,2.0,1kbey37
comment,mpuz1h6,Moscato359,,7,2025-04-30 15:59:02,,,,So that is a card side defect and not an issue with the connector If all 4 corners had pins that were power balanced then that would not be a problem,mpuxf2a,3.0,1kbey37
comment,mpv15vc,lunas2525,,7,2025-04-30 16:09:26,,,,Yes in theory if the card had proper seperation and current limiting so each of the 6 pairs only provided 100w at max these connectors would not be melting But nvidia decided to force psu manufacturers to work that out According to the current card side specification the 12v and ground are tied together as 1 on the card Any and all load balancing is to be done psu side Each pair should be current limited to 834 Amps,mpuz1h6,4.0,1kbey37
comment,mpv2byp,Moscato359,,4,2025-04-30 16:15:07,,,,Technically you dont need power balancing on all 6 pins pairs you need them on the corners If all corners check resistance then it guarantees a solid connection from a geometric standpoint Too much resistance Stop,mpv15vc,5.0,1kbey37
comment,mpv4yx0,lunas2525,,4,2025-04-30 16:28:04,,,,That is only going to cause pairs in the center to melt This is not an issue if the plug being partially in or in crooked the cards or psu are in the cases it melts are providing as much as the card wants over 1 2 or 3 wires instead of current limiting and balancing over all 12 wires This can be fixed 3 ways make each pair an individual seperate rail that is current limited psu side change the whole thing to be 6 gauge wire and use a xt120 connector rated for 60 amps at 12v linus did this or load balance on the card So 1st option everyone needs a new psu and psu makers need to have a expensive new circuit for high amperage in it 2nd option thick cables with a different connector 3rd make more complicated power management on the card increasing card cost Imho dumping this shit connector and doing option 2 probably best Each pair not just the corners needs to be limited to only be able to provide 8333 amps,mpv2byp,6.0,1kbey37
comment,mpwuvnc,Moscato359,,1,2025-04-30 21:28:41,,,,I was under the impression that the failures were due to insufficient contact In the image above it looks like they clicked the connector but the connector got bent which is why EVERY pair had one pin melted on one side The side which doesnt click got loose likely due to a bend Why did the non clicky side of this connector in the OP melt Every single pair had one bad connection,mpv4yx0,7.0,1kbey37
comment,mpxaf26,lunas2525,,2,2025-04-30 22:52:57,,,,It is happening in situations that isnt the case either besides it should not be so fragile that it cant be tweaked less than 3 mm or the wires anything but straight But that is the reason nvidia gave in their investigation As for the op hard to say we only have what the op has said to go by My guess is the cable was bent more than 179 degrees All 6 12v pins burned And the reason is it yellow is if you see color it is not fully seated so it not being fully seated is unlikely The article in the op said it was drawing 400w for 2 hours So it cant deliver the rated current to all pins without melting Humm yeah not gonna buy anything using 12vpwr,mpwuvnc,8.0,1kbey37
comment,mpwxmkp,ABetterKamahl1234,,2,2025-04-30 21:42:53,,,,But nvidia decided to force psu manufacturers to work that out TBF blaming nvidia here isnt unwarranted But why the fuck are PSU manufacturers allowing their pinouts to go above ratings per pin They literally have a single job stable power delivery Blowing out a pinouts ratings isnt that Having them do it too means that fuckups are kind of guarded against and its way easier to blame a card manufacturer They have power ratings on connectors for a reason it shouldnt be open season for me to pull an obscene amount of power on these things Cant say that this continued news is exciting me on PSU companies Spec should never be well give until something fails regardless of where in the line of power you are Fixing this monumental oversight would actually solve a bunch of smaller problems mostly fires,mpv15vc,5.0,1kbey37
comment,mpx73zk,lunas2525,,3,2025-04-30 22:34:17,,,,Never said nvidia was alone in the blame Anyone who supports the 12vpwr connectorstandard shares blame Psu yes coming out of the psu should be limited And card side there should be some sort of limiting on what it can draw not just open the flood gate and as much power as you can dump into it I think linus managed to dump over 1000w into a 40 or 50 series after modding the connector with some 4 or 6 gauge wire Amd makes me sad and upset they picked up the 12vpwr connector When this shit first started i thought nvidia might back track and drop the thing Nope full send,mpwxmkp,6.0,1kbey37

comment,mpxut9m,HKChad,,0,2025-05-01 00:48:37,,,,The issue is the the gpu expects more watts than a single connector can supply if one of the pins isnt fully seated or comes loose the gpu will pull all the power from the other pins overloading and melting the ones connected So the fault is shared amongst power supplies gpu and the connector standard as any of them could avoid this,mpttk8s,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mpy0n29,lunas2525,,2,2025-05-01 01:22:24,,,,The gpu only has 2 connectors at least on the 50 Series The gpu doesnt expect anything it pulls whatever it can regardless of if it should Where the gpu should hit a current limiting wall it doesnt,mpxut9m,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mputfze,sarhoshamiral,,14,2025-04-30 15:32:14,,,,Because you need a 7 or 9 gauge wire which would not be flexible at all At this point what we need is GPUs not PSUs to have an external power connector Put a 12v DC adapter plug on the back and have an external brick All problems solved and it would cost maybe 20 extra,mpuqa27,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mpuxzk4,sarhoshamiral,,5,2025-04-30 15:54:00,,,,You dont have to increase the 12v run length Most 12vhpwr cables are usually 2ft today Thats more than enough length to have a brick with 12v and 120v wires on both end and where 12v run can be limited 2ft If you search Amazon for 12v 600w adapter you get plenty of options to get an idea You can even make the external brick smaller since most people wouldnt be opposed to the idea of using a single PCIE plug providing some of the power that way Cost of these circuity would be far below what the GPU itself costs anyway,mputwh1,4.0,1kbey37
comment,mpwzs2n,jeffsterlive,,1,2025-04-30 21:54:08,,,,The idea is to not run a wire from the PSU to the GPU but an external transformer plugged into another outlet The case would have a hole for the power connection,mputfze,3.0,1kbey37
comment,mpxhogj,sarhoshamiral,,2,2025-04-30 23:33:39,,,,The GPU would have the power connection on the back of the card instead of where it is right now That way you can have a dedicated power supply just for the GPU not having to worry about ATX specs connectors etc This may be a necessity if power consumption goes higher then 600w anyway At this rate in 2 generations power consumption of a single PC will exceed 15A capacity of 110v circuits in US,mpwzs2n,4.0,1kbey37
comment,mpy4z1g,The_JSQuareD,,2,2025-05-01 01:47:49,,,,FYI your original comment says that PSUs not GPUs should have an external power connection which makes it a bit confusing,mpxhogj,5.0,1kbey37

comment,mpwytkf,ABetterKamahl1234,,7,2025-04-30 21:49:10,,,,Id argue that the specs could be fine if people actually cared to not just shift blame and follow some goddamn specs Nvidia is being shitty for not load balancing But PSU manufacturers for some reason dont load balance either Why the fuck not their whole reputation is providing to spec power reliably it makes no sense that a PSU would even permit such an imbalanced load The fact its taking this kind of crap to highlight it is maddening to me Thats not OK and actually might explain a bunch of fires over the years that get posted in PC gaming communities No pinout should be allowing any pin to feed 600W alone Thats stupid as fuck From what I see this flaw PSU side exists in other pinouts too Theyve always relied on the enddevices to selfregulate power inputs Thats dumb from any electrical standpoint Theres a reason my breaker is in my feed panel and not in my lightswitch,mpu1xes,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mq49w5y,pyroserenus,,1,2025-05-02 00:53:34,,,,PSUs can only really load balance by shutting everything off like a breaker A breaker doesnt load balance it JUST disconnects when amps are exceeded Load balancing needs to be on the gpu side the psu cant force certain amps on certain wires it can at best just disconnect the gpu if there is an anomaly Volts are pushed and amps are pulled Of course GPUs absolutely SHOULD shut down for anomalous amperage being drawn but it cant actually fix the problem at hand,mpwytkf,2.0,1kbey37

comment,mpvxl06,akeean,,7,2025-04-30 18:45:47,,,,The cable comes with the PSU so the PSU side has been tested and guaranteed by the manufacturer The GPU side often has a 90degree bend and fittingcontact issues of the pins can cause more resistance in the cable wich leads to more heat But I think damage on the PSU side has been reported as well GPU side usually is worse since a 1500w PSU is a 400 part with high availability and a 90 tier card is a fucking nightmare to acquire or replace an usually holds the lions share of value in a gaming PC,mpvqyd7,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mpxjzgy,ChrisFhey,,3,2025-04-30 23:46:34,,,,It doesnt There have been cases where the PSU side is melted as well The most recent case I can think of was a Corsair SFX PSU that had damage on the PSU side Its in the megathread on the Nvidia subreddit,mpvqyd7,1.0,1kbey37
comment,mpwqd1v,JuicySmalss,,1,2025-04-30 21:05:49,,,,Ugh this honestly brings back memories of when I first built my PC last year and had similar issues with my graphics card I went allin with an RTX 4080 and when I first plugged it in everything seemed fine But after a couple of weeks I started noticing this weird yellowish tint showing up on the edges of the GPUs fan It wasnt quite as bad as what this guy is describing but it definitely had me freaking out Im not exactly the most techsavvy person so I figured I probably just got a bad card or something and started stressing about potential overheating issues or worse I ended up reaching out to the manufacturer and after a few emails and backandforth they ended up sending me a replacement It was a huge relief when the new card didnt have any of those weird marks but it made me so much more cautious about these highend components With tech getting so advanced you kind of expect them to just work perfectly out of the box but Ive learned that its not always the case From my experience if youre ever in a situation like this its worth reaching out to customer support sooner rather than later because companies seem pretty good at addressing these issues especially if its a known defect It still blows my mind how much we rely on these gadgets and even a small issue can be so stressful when youve invested that much money into them Has anyone else had a similar experience with their highend GPUs or was it just me being unlucky,,0.0,1kbey37

comment,mpwuamg,pizoisoned,,1,2025-04-30 21:25:42,,,,Even if you were to make the argument that the 12vpwr is safe its not its clearly not safe in practical implementation Not only is there no load balancing on the wires but the cables are often bent at angles into the card because of the connector position sometimes at high angles It doesnt take a genius to realize that high energy moving through the cheapest tiny connector that has stress on it is going to likely cause problems The issue is Nvidia and others are trying to play the user error card but the reality is the connector is a bad design,,0.0,1kbey37
comment,mpx0b19,ABetterKamahl1234,,7,2025-04-30 21:56:53,,,,The cable itself is fine Like its fully electrically sound of a design and absolutely can run this level of power without any problems or risk Its the load balancing thats throwing all of that out the window PSU manufacturers are at fault too as in no way shape or form should a PSU be allowing a full 600W to be pulled on a single connector in a cable that is bundled to be rated for that A single connector rated to handle that load is pretty fuckin thick and might actually classify as an actual risk to most users even experienced builders Theyre pretty scary things in hobbies that use them and often have some pretty big safetyoriented connectors,mpwuamg,1.0,1kbey37

comment,mpwz0qz,kog,,3,2025-04-30 21:50:13,,,,Neither of you is wrong here My first thought on reading this is that I want a pic of the cable before the problem because I suspect PEBCAK Not saying this is definitely PEBCAK but Ive seen a lot of wacky shit with cabling done by people who claim they know what theyre doing But it could have also just failed,mpwmqj3,2.0,1kbey37
