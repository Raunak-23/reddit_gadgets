comment,lyfhya5,MrT0xic,,1,2024-11-22 15:49:24,,,,This exactly the problem with it The businesses that are trying to push it have no idea how to implement it into peoples everyday lives without it being simply used for work Its essentially the same as getting the productivity talk from your CEO trying to get you to put every single second of your 8 hour work day into the job CEOs and other executives are built differently than the average worker and have a drive for their work the average worker just wants a pay check The CEOExecutives whole life is the office and as such they have no idea what to use the metaverse for other than that,ly12dgt,2.0,1guymu1

comment,lydhvnf,Sethithy,,2,2024-11-22 05:54:07,,,,They are allowed to experiment with bad ideas because the one idea they got right Facebook funds it all Id rather they spend it trying to further technology for the general public versus investing it in evil stuff like warfare and private realestate Heck not even all their ideas are stupid the Quest headsets have popularized VR development more than any other platform,ly1vqbr,1.0,1guymu1
