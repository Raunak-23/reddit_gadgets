comment,lw3a6t6,alvenestthol,,3,2024-11-08 15:21:55,,,,No its not bad for me Im not buying this generation I have other things to spend money on But it is probably bad for you when youre spending maybe 50 more money for maybe 20 more FPS when you could just wait for another 2 months and save that money And if youre in a position where your CPU is so bad games dont play at all you probably dont have the money to be paying for scalped prices Onrelease scalpers arent anything like Nvidia doing the scalping themselves or highdemand scalping with Crypto or AI with no supply chain issues they lose steam in a month or two and move onto other goods,lw36a0l,4.0,1gmcfil
comment,lw3hzzn,TortiousTordie,,-1,2024-11-08 16:00:28,,,,me im paying a premium to make sure i can get it dont play games you forget yourself i can do whatever i want youre the one with limitations i have a choice i can get A or B and B is slower Sure A cost more but cost is a _you_ factor they could add zeros to the prices and it would have _zero_ affect people buying from scalpers are not concerned with money theyre concerned with getting the goods,lw3a6t6,5.0,1gmcfil
