comment,mu6zsh9,Strokeslahoma,,1,2025-05-25 16:24:25,,,,I replaced all my fans with Noctua a couple of years ago and theyre still extremely quiet Its the GPU fans that I hear That being said when I bought them the stealth black ones were 10 or 20 dollars more expensive so I do have the ugly brown ones but its not like theyre in a visible location,mtzos32,4.0,1ku84gn

comment,mu17vmm,Illyrian5,,-2,2025-05-24 16:45:21,,,,When people like you and the ones who upvoted need to realize that paying 40 for a fan that will last you 5 years is better than buying multiple cheaper options during that period that will add up to be more expensive in the end Noctua really is a true High end product Now if this was about a Corsair product a wannabe high end brand that actually is overpriced you and your upvoters would have my full support good sirs,mtzkgu5,3.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu32rnt,etheran123,,7,2025-05-24 23:05:29,,,,Do people have issues with fans frequently Ive had the same 120mm fans on my last few builds Probably 10 years old I completely get that issues probably happen but I feel like they are being blown haha way out of proportion Not sure Ive ever had a fan fail I think I maybe replaced one after it started making a ticking sound occasionally If you want to buy a fancy brown fan be my guest Not really hating Ive spent more money on stupider things,mu17vmm,4.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu1e2da,TheLegendD4RK,,4,2025-05-24 17:17:53,,,,The product can be good and overpriced this is 1 example of it also I have arctic fans that lasted 5 years so far your point There are brands like phanteck that have fans that are as quiet and better you can disagree without being so aggressive,mu17vmm,4.0,1ku84gn

comment,mu2fvyi,magicwuff,,1,2025-05-24 20:47:36,,,,I think create gaming mouse with fan implies they invented it If ford said they created a car with a steering wheel I would interpret that as them claiming to have invented it or at least created the first car with it Not that they just created another car,mu1m3k3,2.0,1ku84gn
comment,mtzn1xt,EnderB3nder,,109,2025-05-24 11:00:50,,,,Noctua is putting a 4x4 cm 157 x 157 inches fan inside a competitive gaming mouse made by Pulsar Gaming Gears Why dont they use its proper name Its a 4010 fan 40x40x10mm Also these are the most commonly used type of fan on a 3D printer You can print your own mouse and stick a 4010 inside it for much much less than 180,,0.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu0i1jh,Polymorphic-X,,40,2025-05-24 14:28:32,,,,I was about to mention this exact thing 4010s are under 5 on digikey and silicone mounting would kill a lot of the vibrations people are worried about Honestly though I feel like an activecooled mousepad with a cage fan think air hockey table vented mouse would be better for this if vibration was a concern,mtzn1xt,1.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu1nkak,cali2wa,,7,2025-05-24 18:07:37,,,,I thought about something like youre describing except with a heater attached My hands get cold so I use a little desktop space heater but incorporated into a mouse pad and air being directed attoward the hands specifically would be way better,mu0i1jh,2.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu1ogo9,Polymorphic-X,,10,2025-05-24 18:12:31,,,,Heater would be even easier You can get vinyl heat mats for 1530 USD designed for plant sprouting Slap a mousepad on top and go they max at around 90F and some are adjustable like a heated blanket,mu1nkak,3.0,1ku84gn

comment,mtzvh2c,Xc4lib3r,,29,2025-05-24 12:08:39,,,,The main problem with most of these is vibration If you play some competitive games those small vibrations might get very annoying as it can fuck up your accuracy Im not sure if Noctua would solve this problem though gotta wait for review,mtzn1xt,1.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu3cp6v,corgi-king,,11,2025-05-25 00:08:05,,,,Why go to restaurants when you can make your own food from scratch Not everyone has a 3D printer and not everyone has the skill and time to do it And who can guarantee to make a good one in the first try,mtzn1xt,1.0,1ku84gn
comment,mu4jzdy,Klekto123,,8,2025-05-25 05:20:41,,,,Maybe im misunderstanding your comment but how exactly is printing and building your own mouse a realistic solution for the average person Its gonna take more than just sticking a small fan inside a 3d printed frame lmao,mtzn1xt,1.0,1ku84gn

comment,mu126ys,JukePlz,,5,2025-05-24 16:14:38,,,,Its depressing how these companies have started to push marketing for these ultra lightweight mice to convince everyone that the thing that is the cheapest to manufacture for them is also somehow the best shit ever invented and worth 200 even if their BoM is the lowest ever their body shell design probably done by some underpaid intern in a weeks time their internals reused from previous mice designs and their QC inexistent I hope they get fucked by cheap Chinese clone brands matching their quality,mtzn1xt,1.0,1ku84gn
