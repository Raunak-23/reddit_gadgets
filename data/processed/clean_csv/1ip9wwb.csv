comment,mcy3l9y,techieman33,,1,2025-02-15 19:12:06,,,,SMR isnt a big deal for media storage if youre just keeping it on one drive The problem comes when youre using a RAID array to store your data The first write goes fine there too The problem comes if you have a drive failure and need to rebuild the array with a replacement drive Your drives are constantly reading and writing data for days depending on drive and array size to do it It puts a lot of stress on them and can cause other drives in the array to fail It takes a lot longer for SMR drives to rebuild an array So there is a higher chance of more drives failing and losing your whole array in the process Not a chance most people want to take,mcr5u7x,3.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcqa75m,tastyratz,,68,2025-02-14 13:50:56,,,,Most likely if history repeats itself they will cost a premium per TB over existing drives maybe between 30 to double the cost Today a 20TB WD gold is 418 on amazon and a 26TB is 724 Thats about 21TB with the last 6TB costing 51TB If we went with a 51 premium and scaled it to 44tb that would be a 1224 premium tacked on top of that 418 and this assumes no rampant inflation over the next few years I would be surprised to see these launch under 1000 and there is a good chance this is just going to come out as a 1500 drive They would completely destroy the rest of their SKUs product line if it cost much less,mcq20yt,1.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcto6nq,shunabuna,,12,2025-02-15 00:19:57,,,,yep I bought a NAS for backing up a little bit of data I didnt need anything crazy so I looked at 2tb hard drives It was cheaper to buy 2tb SSD than it was to buy a nas grade hard drive Hard drives should be at 10TB but it has actually went up in price a standard consumer 2tb hard drive in 2021 was 60 but now its 100 Based on the most popular result when searching 2tb hdd on amazon,mcr04h0,3.0,1ip9wwb

comment,me75y7g,alidan,,1,2025-02-22 17:44:00,,,,size and how many platters you can have in a single drive there is a bare minimum cost for the drives hardware to read and then passed that you get some degree of paying less for more then when you hit the ass edge of capacity it spikes up again personally I will probably make a nas of sorts and just use referebedrescued drives from reputible revferbers and pay for a full drive 0 before they send it about half the cost per drive and I could justify 810 drives with several for redundancy smaller drives but all they will do is be mass storage and backup so if I loose 1 or 2 drives I can hopefully hot swap a backup in and order new backups,mcrnsm4,4.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcqkw89,CoreParad0x,,12,2025-02-14 14:52:28,,,,Not only will these be expensive but honestly I cant even see much use of these out of big enterprise stuff anyways This much density in most consumer or home lab NAS is not a good idea unless you just arent really all that concerned about the data,mcqa75m,2.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mcqpxcf,tastyratz,,27,2025-02-14 15:19:23,,,,Thats an argument as old as time Big hard drives are risking a lot of data to 1 piece of equipment The same could have been said for the 20TB drives when they launched The reality is that we have outgrown the redundancy of raid over a decade ago and moved entirely into filesystem redundancy for data safety like btrfs Any kind of data requires a good backup plan this just emphasizes that,mcqkw89,3.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mcqz3li,CoreParad0x,,6,2025-02-14 16:05:17,,,,Not sure we disagree if you were disagreeing But I agree with you I also only use software solutions like ZFS these days hadnt used raid in a while I will say the same arguments that were said for 20TB drives are still valid and these even higher density drives just exacerbate them,mcqpxcf,4.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcs962x,CoreParad0x,,2,2025-02-14 19:50:09,,,,Im assuming youre referring to his comments about memory and if so I think you misunderstand Im not saying these size drives arent useful or that well never need them Im saying that for your average consumer getting these is probably a bad idea for various reasons related to data integrity and the complexity and considerations necessary to properly setup a storage system with drives this dense And that because of the cost of the drives themselves the cost of actually properly setting something up with them it will most likely price out most consumers and relegate them to big enterprise setups with big budgets and niche homelab enthusiasts,mcrnobn,4.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mcs77tf,Elios000,,1,2025-02-14 19:40:34,,,,i mean thats just what happend every time there been a big leap in drives if production is simple enough that doesnt cost that much more build these of any other drive youll see them 100 to 300 buck prices just like current drives,mcqa75m,2.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mct4qcj,rebbsitor,,1,2025-02-14 22:28:40,,,,My first hard drive was 20MB I remember getting a 2GB drive in 1996 and thinking there was no way Id ever fill it I was adding 6GB more less than two years later Then bought a computer with a 20GB drive in 2000 Data just expands to fill available space,mcq2kfv,1.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mctfpdl,thedanyes,,3,2025-02-14 23:29:49,,,,Western Digital has made some absolute garbage models Seagate has probably made more junk overall though Toshiba and HGST were reasonably consistent in my experience If you buy only drives targeted at enterprise random io applications youll probably do okay If you buy a cheap consumer external you will often get what you paid for If you buy literally any current 25 HDD I have to assume dont care about your data at all,mctd1tz,4.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mctgwxh,GrimDallows,,2,2025-02-14 23:36:58,,,,My use would be mostly external storage and copies of files Mostly from college and other courses but also books Why are externals so bad out of curiosity I didnt even know HDD were sold in different models according to their usage just looking at Toshibas page right now,mctfpdl,5.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mctjdeq,thedanyes,,1,2025-02-14 23:51:26,,,,Good question Im not sure I think theyre just targeted at impulse buyers so low price point is the biggest priority Maybe people dont complain as much about failures because the devices dont actually see much use overall Probably lots of people have grand visions of copying all their stuff from iCloud and then turning off their subscription but the drive ends up sitting unopened in their closet until the next garage sale Thats not to say there havent been some true deals where reasonablygood drives were randomly used for a certain period of time in a certain model of external but its always luckofthedraw and just because someone bought an external with a certain model of drive in it yesterday doesnt mean yours will have the same one,mctgwxh,6.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mcv79ig,Emu1981,,1,2025-02-15 06:53:43,,,,HGST were reasonably consistent in my experience Western Digital has owned HGST since 2012 started integrating it into the main company back in 2015 Chinese regulator stuff and fully phased out the HGST as a subbrand in 2018 These days all we have left is Toshiba Western Digital and Seagate,mctfpdl,5.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mctj31f,skalpelis,,2,2025-02-14 23:49:45,,,,Its not that Even in a raid array the rebuild time is so ridiculous that your healthy drive can fail while rebuilding especially if theyre the same model from the same batch For a 100 TB drive youre looking at about 2 weeks to rebuild but if they are slower like those shingle drives its going to be so much longer,mctdjsj,3.0,1ip9wwb
comment,mcvczrz,flac_rules,,1,2025-02-15 07:51:42,,,,2 weeks That is in no way the case even if you have more platters which slows down the process Higher densities increase the write speed as well Maybe 2 days maximum,mctj31f,4.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcqkb9r,WhyOhWhy60,,-1,2025-02-14 14:49:17,,,,My 8TB 7200rpm 256MB cache 35 drive has sustained write speeds of about 180MBs IIRC The first 2 25GB is typically wittten in a few seconds less than 3seconds from my observations then I assume cachesbuffers are saturated so write speeds drop to a steady 180MBs approx Edit As for the new drives mentioned theres no specs other than capacity mentioned in the report Id expect similar performance to my standard 8TB drive,mcqe4a1,1.0,1ip9wwb

comment,mcqdr1t,ledow,,0,2025-02-14 14:12:06,,,,My Netgear NAS that holds my Plex and a lot of other more important things is currently 12TB 4 x 4TB in RAID5 and sssh I know RAID5 isnt ideal thats why I have two of them identical models and one is powered off all the time except to update I can literally buy a single WD Red Pro drive twice the size of that entire array now Its ridiculous I was looking at expanding my NAS a little and for the price of the nextdriveup on each of them I could buy two single drives that each have enough storage to hold the entire arrays data So Im kind of at a crossroads buy new drives and even a new NAS or try to keep expanding the current NAS Im not sure it will ever grow enough to justify it that 12TB isnt full and I cant really see me filling it to the brim before those drives die Im tempted to go for a chassis to build my own NAS but Im worried that what will actually happen is Ill end up managing it far too much I do enough IT during my day job thanks Or do I bite the bullet and go for an Asustor NAS with both SATA and NVMe RAID and again fight with low capacity drives but arrange them in RAID Its tempting in order to reuse my current drives in a RAID with an NVMe to save having to manually do the data transfer if nothing else But the pace of drives is just ridiculously fast and Im wondering whether its time to bite the bullet on spinning disks even Red Pro and move to NVMe There are literally WD Red NVMe now But the 4TB is the biggest they do Were at the point now where large capacity drives are cheap enough to just buy and have entire copiesmirrors of your data on each drive than an equivalent RAID,,0.0,1ip9wwb
