comment,m7tw9dw,Suired,,1,2025-01-18 17:14:33,,,,Every time If you are too dumb to figure out how to get modded games you dont need a molded console Its not an untapped market its likely a honey trap set so the big N has undeniable proof that you provided the service N can cry about nodded consoles but thats mainly legal to do depending on the method Once you install pirated games on them or even mention how to install them youre ninja fodder,m7n3gw2,1.0,1i3ikzi

comment,m7nil99,Fickle_Competition33,,25,2025-01-17 16:43:20,,,,Yes videogame companies sort of turn a blind eye on piracy as they know many of those people would never buy the game and play it so it is better to have them helping the game become more popular But when you try to make money out of it us where they draw a line,m7nbwic,1.0,1i3ikzi

comment,m7ph55q,lordraiden007,,15,2025-01-17 22:29:16,,,,The original XBox was pretty easy to mod its the X360 that was a pain,m7pd8x0,2.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7pdtvu,rabidelectronics,,4,2025-01-17 22:11:51,,,,its been so long but I remember it being fairly easy to mod the original Xbox once the physical mod chips were released I modded tons for both friends and bought them used to mod and sell on ebay or craigslis Installed the modchip new HDD new OS and FTPd over tons of ISO files of games and emulators was a fun time,m7pd8x0,2.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7perh3,Le_Sadie,,3,2025-01-17 22:16:42,,,,I just did my ps3 and it was relatively easy so I looked into my 360 and was like noooope it involves taking the thing apart and like soldering and shit I thought you had to similarly take apart the original,m7pdtvu,3.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7pfgfp,rabidelectronics,,4,2025-01-17 22:20:21,,,,you definitely had to take apart the original needed to get hex allen wrench set but as long as you had the right tools it was really not too bad I am not sure if it still exists but there was a website called Xbox Scene that had all the best tutorials and once I got it down it was pretty easy I never ventured into the realm of the 360 so not sure what that process is like but I did mod my ps3 back in the day and Wii as well I have read up a lot on modding the Switch and I may finally give that a shot once the Switch 2 is out just for fun It has been many years since I have done anything like that,m7perh3,4.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7pgfc4,Le_Sadie,,2,2025-01-17 22:25:29,,,,Yeah Ive done all my handhelds as well the vita was so similar to the ps3 it helped me learn wtf I was doing a lot faster Ive been looking into the Switch too but it doesnt look like the old R4style flashcarts are going to fly this time lol I also worry about how vigilant nintendo has gotten and online consequences Sony doesnt give a shit about their ps3 or vita anymore but nintendo was still adding updates to the 3ds well after they decommissioned it to try to evade modders They do NOT like their stuff messed with,m7pfgfp,5.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7phge3,rabidelectronics,,2,2025-01-17 22:30:56,,,,I never had a Vita but the PSP was a perfect little handheld emulator for a long time Im sure the Vita is even better and yeah thats why I am holding off on messing with my Switch but once I have the 2 which is confirmed backwards compatible both digital and physical aint got much to lose modding the Switch 1 it seems Just wont use it online and see how it goes I remember when I modded my PS3 and booted it up the first time that feeling of success was so good haha hope you have fun with it I miss my PS3 sometimes,m7pgfc4,6.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7piw2o,Le_Sadie,,2,2025-01-17 22:38:33,,,,I actually modded it mainly to play ps2 games and omg it was harder to figure out anything with that stupid classics player and Apollo and changing the iso for compatibility than modding the system itself But when I figured all THAT out man I have been playing games Ive wanted to play since they came out and I couldnt afford them ever since I modded my psp too the worst part was turning back the version but it was otherwise easy and a modded vita can emulate psp games too so I use that now And yes still play it all the timethe number of amazing games stuck on a system no one got is depressing,m7phge3,7.0,1i3ikzi
comment,m7pocvo,rabidelectronics,,2,2025-01-17 23:08:31,,,,haha you are bringing back memories I definitely remember turning back the OSfirmware version and all that PS2 is another system that I somehow never messed around with much despite its popularity and how common they were but I know there are tons of classics that I missed maybe if I ever get a steamdeck or other newer handheld console I will dive into those consoles that I missed a friend of mine just got the Retroid Pocket 5 and I got to check that out and it seems great He is mostly using it for Gamecube games since that was a console that he missed but always wanted to check out We played a bunch of two player games the other night and it worked pretty flawlessly even docked on his tv pretty rad,m7piw2o,8.0,1i3ikzi

comment,m7nacrw,LoogyHead,,14,2025-01-17 16:03:56,,,,Youre not wrong but thats kind of a fallacy Shouldnt address this unlawful act focus on this instead Lots of issues worth addressing big and small In this case I think it dumb to arrest for modding hardware Full stop If they can prove he was stealing from his customers or putting them at risk of something maybe thats worth it Not against Nintendo though,m7n5jkp,1.0,1i3ikzi

comment,m7nu5lg,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-01-17 17:38:55,,,,Ya but why would he be arrogant if he already got caught Sounds like a guy who both 1 should almost certainly know how bad the risk of reoffending was and 2 yet determined its necessary to roll the dice again anyway indicating how bad things must be in order to choose to make such an obviously bad decision Not that he made the bad decision because hes just arrogant and thought he could simply do it again,m7npmcg,4.0,1i3ikzi
