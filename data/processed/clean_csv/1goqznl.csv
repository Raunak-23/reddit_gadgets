comment,lwngvb7,_EleGiggle_,,1,2024-11-11 22:04:08,,,,Damn some of those use cases are crazy Although one scene where she holds it in her hands folded open and its wavy instead of flat looks like how it might look IRL and its pretty bad It almost looked like a wet plastic rag I cant tell how much of the video is real and what is edited or fake I mean how does it change so seamlessly into a tattoo thats completely see through on skin Because that didnt happen when she wrapped it around her arm like a bracelet Im also not sure whats the use case of pulling it to make it longer if its elastic and instantly reverts back Are they showing different products off that kinda use the same technology But yeah you should actually watch the video,,0.0,1goqznl
