comment,lx7zg1k,bonesnaps,,1,2024-11-15 06:06:02,,,,I wonder what the obsession with laptop weight is I switched to a smaller laptop recently like 50 lighter and the only concerns of mine are a smaller screen and getting less exercise from my backpack travels,,0.0,1grhib3
comment,lx9czz1,RedditBlaze,,1,2024-11-15 13:23:28,,,,It probably does matter to some folks depending on their portability needs but I agree More tech savvy folks focus on the detailed specs and for me the weight just is what it is I guess its a thing like processors advertising clock speed metrics and iPhone thickness Just a marketing talking point that might be easier to push for consumers to compare at a glance,lx7zg1k,1.0,1grhib3
