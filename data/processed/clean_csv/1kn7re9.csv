comment,msh3nal,badger906,,185,2025-05-15 16:37:31,,,,Intels biggest hurdle is fanboy culture I still know people who refuse to buy amd processors and cite reasons based on things that happened 20 years ago,,0.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshyehy,_CatLover_,,75,2025-05-15 19:06:45,,,,Doesnt even have to be fanboys necessarily just friction against swapping away from the brand youve always used Amd also used to have big driver issues throughout the early 2010s which tarnished their reputation among enthusiast users especially for GPUs Things got better with Ryzen but it still took multiple generations for them to become really popular first choice for gamers Personally i was choosing between i79700k and R7 2700x in 2018 but because i had used intel in my previous build it felt like the safer choice with no other major differences present For GPUs nvidia has really not delivered for the 40 and 50series so theres absolutely an opportunity for intel to get their foot in the door through the budget market if the B770 can offer 5060 ti 16GB like performance at a lower price Im really excited to see what their next gen will look like now that their designs have had 2 generations time to mature More competition on the GPU market is a win for everyone except nvidia,msh3nal,1.0,1kn7re9
comment,msidvh6,hijodeosiris,,15,2025-05-15 20:22:37,,,,That enthusiast part is bullshit Enthusiast users can easily identify when a product platform provides clear advantages over others regardless of brand or color you want the best Adobe software and single core usage sure intel want the best multithreadpower consuption performance ok AMD and so on so on im simplifying it Are dumbfuck fanbois who consume we stupid marketing and influencersyoutubers of shit reputation and questionable ethics who stick with brand and just repeat the same shit arguments to discredit not switching to XY product Enthusiast are the one who already have moved the X3D chips to ensure they get the best of the best when talking about games or Epyc Threadripper for productivity or the ones who still buy 5090s for the the AI productivity and not to AMDs we high end they have,mshyehy,2.0,1kn7re9
comment,msio0al,_CatLover_,,8,2025-05-15 21:11:52,,,,Huh yeah the enthusiasts would be the one knowing AMDRadeon had bad drivers The first X3D chips were for the 4th gen of desktop Ryzens Which is exactly my point too it took multiple generations of Ryzen to become the main choice despite earlier gens already being competitive Imo when speaking about the PC gaming community for lack of a better word i think its fine to use the term enthusiast for anyone building their own PCs and doing a bit of extra research about all parts and maximizing for their budget not only the people buying the most expensive parts The fanbois are a very small but vocal minority online There are massive amounts of people who buy prebuilds and cant remember what parts they have outside of intelnvidia They had something that worked and they keep buying newer models of the same stuff Thats a common trait among consumers across all markets And something like 510 better value for money isnt gonna make them break their pattern,msidvh6,3.0,1kn7re9
comment,msr8u3s,akeean,,1,2025-05-17 06:48:04,,,,The most popular GPU on Steam is a 4060 laptop GPU Then probably a lot of stuff from prebuilds and other laptops The DIY market is tiny compared to those segments wich is why it gets the dog treatment in terms of pricing and availability,msio0al,4.0,1kn7re9
comment,msxkrps,tornado9015,,1,2025-05-18 10:13:52,,,,People get used to trends Intel had a significant edge in the top tier cpu market for roughly 50 years AMD typically offered better performance at the same price point but if you wanted the best the answer was undeniably intel Not everybody has time to carefully review benchmarks or performance per dollar comparisons for everything they buy If intel has been the best for the last 45 years it seems like a safe bet they would continue to be the best why would that change This can absolutely apply to enthusiasys who have spent hundreds of hours researching and coming to the same conclusions again and again for over a decade At some point you just take for granted that this particular thing doesnt change and you spend your limited time on this earth researching other things more likely to change But sometimes surprises happen,msidvh6,3.0,1kn7re9

comment,msi8iub,Neriya,,5,2025-05-15 19:56:39,,,,I just swapped to a 9070XT No issues so far aside from some games that had better DLSS than FSR support but I can deal with that But it helps that Ive never been brand loyal and my house which has three computers in it has always had a mix of vendors Up until recently I was the only Nvidia GPU in the house my wife and kid both had 5700XTs Over time that got swapped and now wife and kid run 3070Ti2080Ti respectively and Im now the lone AMD user with my new 9070XT Nobody but me can even tell a difference,mshsdti,2.0,1kn7re9

comment,msj1hkx,MiloIsTheBest,,2,2025-05-15 22:23:08,,,,Yeah so the issue that I had was almost certainly a faulty GPU in retrospect but it was such a finicky thing thats its hard to justify that it was broken and wasnt just some software issue Thats the problem Its not shitting out glitches or hard booting the machine its timing out a driver every so often during a game and returning to desktop Sometimes once every couple of days sometimes once a day sometimes once an hour Makes it SEEM a lot like a software problem I can tell you no AMD fanboy ever even suggested I had a faulty GPU when I was investigating the issue Everything was a problem with something I mustve done Holy moly the suggestions ranged from incorrect bios or registry settings to my literal mains power being dirty The fact is that the issue was either faulty hardware or faulty software In the end I got rid of both so I could finish just one goddamn Flight Sim session,mshvwfr,3.0,1kn7re9
comment,msiliee,NightFuryToni,,2,2025-05-15 20:59:26,,,,Ive actually had a long streak of ATIAMD GPUs my first recent one was my RTX 2060 and now my 4070 Super Before that the last nVidia GPU I had was a GeForce 4 Ti 4200 and never really had major driver issues with either brands over the years,mshsdti,2.0,1kn7re9

comment,mti7zi1,VYDEOS,,1,2025-05-21 17:15:32,,,,I mean even in this day and age amd is still objectively worse in gpus In fps per dollar and value sure amd wins all day but in actual features raster performance and especially in productivity its not even close In CPUs you have a point Amd is objectively better than Intel right now although you can argue Intel is better value In gaming amd CPUs are all kinda the same Very little difference from 9600x 9700x 9900x and 9950x The x3ds of course smoke the normal processors but the difference between 9800x3d 9900x3d and 9950x3d isnt huge and the last two are way out of most peoples budget Just a few generations ago Id argue Intel was still better Bluescreening and overheating aside 14900k is probably a better buy than say 7950x3d But then the quality issues happened and Intel completely dropped the ball with core ultra and lga 1851 which is already dead Its really only the last generation or two amd became better and its more so due to Intel and Nvidia messing up than amd actually becoming better,msh3nal,1.0,1kn7re9

comment,msgyeyr,unabletocomput3,,93,2025-05-15 16:11:33,,,,I swear intel is basically sitting on their butts while Nvidia and AMD are both shooting each other in the foot on pricing with their gaming gpus They just need to release something at this point as long as the drivers function and it doesnt cost an arm and a leg,,0.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshbbo5,DogmaticLaw,,58,2025-05-15 17:14:23,,,,While there are many things to critique Intel on releasing GPUs is a weird one to choose since they have released a solid number of them and seem to be using the investment to improve their integrated graphics as well On top of that the drivers work and they dont cost an arm and a leg,msgyeyr,1.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshjmwx,unabletocomput3,,12,2025-05-15 17:53:38,,,,Yes but it would be nice to know anything about what theyre planning for the rest of this lineup Currently the gpu market is a mess The b570 and b580 are a solid choice for those that want 40604060ti performance at 200300 without the drawback of 8gb of vram andor lacking bandwidth That being said theres a pretty big hole in the 400600 price range with the 5060ti and 5070 being pretty underwhelming for the price they ask and the 9070 series costing 200300 more effectively putting them at 750900 If Intel put something somewhere inbetween with decent vram capacity and possibly close to 5070 performance they could easily win the lowmidrange market My issue is that were 5 months in to this generation yet we have next to no info regarding higher end battlemage gpus They have the perfect opportunity to gain ground against even Nvidia and they only just started saying expect some news soon,mshbbo5,2.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshpnmz,Dripdry42,,1,2025-05-15 18:22:59,,,,they are building the hype on this All the other companies do it and why telegraph their intentions ahead of time so Nvidia or AMD could potentially steal their thunder,mshjmwx,3.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshsyys,tastyratz,,7,2025-05-15 18:39:34,,,,AMD and NVIDIA clearly are not stealing anyones thunder they cant even produce their own cards they make today I have been desperate for a msrpfounders 9070 xt for months and the whipped up market adjustment runaway reseller and 3rd party manufacturer market is out of control As far as Im concerned the mid to upper gamer gpu launches are borderline paper launches while they focus on the AI hype Its bitcoin mining all over again while they abandon their core markets If Intel can actually get competitive GPUs in the hands of real life gamers at price points even approaching the competitions launch msrps thats a huge advantage Nvidia AMD cant seem to even hit in a captive market In case you cant tell Im with everyone else it seems and pretty salty over it all,mshpnmz,4.0,1kn7re9
comment,mshvurh,unabletocomput3,,2,2025-05-15 18:53:59,,,,Im not annoyed that theyre building hype Im annoyed that they could be passing a golden opportunity to prove that theyre an actual option in the gpu market Showing what the specs are could cause the competition to pivot but in this case AMD and Nvidia have released possibly most of their lineup and nobody has any idea what to expect with the b770s performance You cant really hype anything up if nobody knows what to expect,mshpnmz,4.0,1kn7re9
