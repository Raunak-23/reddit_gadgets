comment,mtd9cn0,TheChickenStrip,,54,2025-05-20 21:32:55,,,,Its not the first Nvidias Ampere aka RTX 3000 chips were also produced by Samsung Of course the Switch 2 also uses an Ampere chip so it makes sense,mtd75cd,2.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtb86gu,Gamebird8,,3,2025-05-20 15:34:55,,,,I would have to assume that it perhaps is talking about support processors that are not onboard the main SOC like VRAM for example But who knows maybe this is just someone trying to get clicks because the Switch 2 is a hot button topic,mtb14dn,2.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtga59f,repocin,,1,2025-05-21 10:53:26,,,,Why would they have Order policy says they charge your payment method 714 days before shipping and were still a bit off from that And fwiw I got an email from them last week saying that theyll start processing my order soon ordered from Nintendo DE,mta5anf,1.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtgamug,None,,1,2025-05-21 10:57:23,,,,Because on preorder it specifically says payments can start from 31 days before release date It is normally 7 days this one time that is not the case,mtga59f,2.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtanjhj,RagefireHype,,24,2025-05-20 13:51:46,,,,Hot take The price is fine Do people really think its a 350 dollar console They basically added on 50 dollars and accounted for inflation from the original Switch launch which is fair considering its 7x more powerful than the Switch,mta8oim,1.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtaun2l,GrayDaysGoAway,,4,2025-05-20 14:28:44,,,,Im not mad about it or anything but IMO its more than a bit ridiculous that the Switch 2 costs more than a PS5 does Of course it wouldnt be so offensive if they werent also doing 80 games Which will never go on sale,mtanjhj,2.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbkyf5,Remy0507,,7,2025-05-20 16:37:41,,,,Its hard to compare directly like that Yes the price is comparable to a base PS5 and yes the PS5 is more powerful But the Switch is a handheld device Building a mobile device like that introduces design challenges that arent present when building a fullsized console The Switch 2 also has a high quality display built in which is a nontrivial additional cost And the Switch 1 cost as much as PS4 at the time it launched in spite of also being a much less powerful device,mtaun2l,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtby9qy,GrayDaysGoAway,,-6,2025-05-20 17:40:56,,,,Switches arent really handhelds imo The undocked performance and battery capacity flat out suck And I was of the opinion that the OG Switch was priced above what it should have been too,mtbkyf5,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtc5ekq,Remy0507,,10,2025-05-20 18:15:00,,,,Its in a handheld form factor which is what restricts the power of the components involved The fact that it runs at higher clock speeds when its plugged into power doesnt really change all that much about its capabilities And I dont know what you think an appropriate price would be A midrange Android tablet costs as much as a Switch,mtby9qy,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtc9zvn,GrayDaysGoAway,,-1,2025-05-20 18:37:31,,,,Its in a handheld form factor Which goes back to what I said in another comment Switches are jack of all trades master of none devices Docked or handheld theyre just subpar in virtually every possible way Every aspect of them is a compromise I honestly think the Switch should be around 250275 Recent years iPads go for sub300 every day of the week and have vastly superior hardware to the Switch,mtc5ekq,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtcmcka,Remy0507,,7,2025-05-20 19:38:06,,,,I mean if youre argument is that the original Switch should cost less than 300 NOW then Id agree The reason it doesnt Because people keep buying it I dont think 300 at launch was a bad price for it though and I dont think 450 for the Switch 2 at launch is a bad price either given the current economic climate,mtc9zvn,7.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtcp5om,GrayDaysGoAway,,0,2025-05-20 19:52:07,,,,Oh Im well aware of why it doesnt go down in price Same for why Nintendo games never have signifigant discounts Doesnt mean Im ok with it though Yeah 300 at launch for the OG wasnt bad I do think 450 for the new one is bad though Its specs dont come anywhere near justifying that price imo And the fact that theyre double dipping on price increases with the 80 games just makes it that much worse and less acceptable to me,mtcmcka,8.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd0pma,MerryDingoes,,0,2025-05-20 20:49:10,,,,I think people also forget that Nintendo usually dont sell consoles at a loss unlike Sony and Microsoft with their consoles Thats a rather smart financial decisions on top of them knowing that games sells consoles which weve known that Microsoft really failed in the past two generations and Sony seem to recently rebound with the PS5,mtcmcka,8.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd296r,Remy0507,,1,2025-05-20 20:56:39,,,,Yep Nintendo likes making a profit on everything they sell And honestly theyre well within their rights to do that People are obviously willing to buy their products so theres no reason they should start selling them for a loss Now if they start missing their sales targets maybe they need to rethink some things But they just recently passed 100 billion in market cap for the first time ever so there really isnt much incentive for them to change their business model at the moment,mtd0pma,9.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd8jsi,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,2,2025-05-20 21:28:47,,,,Now if they start missing their sales targets maybe they need to rethink some things They already decided to eat the tariffs on the main console and only raised prices on accessories It wouldnt surprise me if theyre now selling the consoles at a small loss given that The consoles are always low margin,mtd296r,10.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd6rok,MerryDingoes,,1,2025-05-20 21:19:38,,,,Yep I agree with everything that you said My friend is learning Japanese atm and he read the news how Nintendo contributes to something like 3 of Japans GDP They dont have the historical influence that Samsung has on Korea but a lot is still riding on them to be successful,mtd296r,10.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbv78d,None,,8,2025-05-20 17:26:32,,,,The ps5 is going up in price tho ATP the only affordable way to game is look for used pc builds You can find something that competes with a ps5 for a decent price when the market gets more stable and the games are dirt cheap,mtaun2l,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtby1jd,GrayDaysGoAway,,-3,2025-05-20 17:39:50,,,,Sony said it might be going up in price But that was in response to ridiculous tariffs which probably arent going to really be a thing at this point so I doubt it will,mtbv78d,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbyptq,iLaurens,,6,2025-05-20 17:43:00,,,,Prices already went up by 50 euro on April 14th in Europe in response to the US tarrifs Makes sense right,mtby1jd,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbzp2d,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-05-20 17:47:36,,,,Very little about our economic system is making sense to me at this point tbh,mtbyptq,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb4wod,TingleyStorm,,6,2025-05-20 15:18:57,,,,its more than a bit ridiculous that the Switch 2 costs more than a PS5 does what A base PS5 is 450 retail for the digital only version 500 to play physical games In order to play remotely you need a 200 accessory that has a 1080p 60hz LCD screen The Switch 2 is 450 retail and can play physical games In order to play remotely you just remove it from its dock to play on a 1080p60hz720p120hz LCD screen Thats a 250 savings over the PS5,mtaun2l,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbpsmb,SaltyStU2,,-3,2025-05-20 17:00:49,,,,You can remote play your PS5 without an accessory btw Its literally a phone app,mtb4wod,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtc3yiu,flycasually,,-4,2025-05-20 18:08:01,,,,i thought the switch 2 doesnt play physical games when you buy physical games it just gives you a code to download it online,mtb4wod,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd82wr,ARGHETH,,2,2025-05-20 21:26:23,,,,Thats false only some are Notably Cyberpunk is going to be an actual cartridge according to a company exec,mtc3yiu,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd8zp2,flycasually,,-2,2025-05-20 21:31:04,,,,So its not really false if its true for some games at the very least Dont know or care enough to look up whether your statement is accurate since I dont plan on getting the console anyway,mtd82wr,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtda1i9,ARGHETH,,3,2025-05-20 21:36:34,,,,i thought the switch 2 doesnt play physical games This statement is literally false though,mtd8zp2,7.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtdmau8,flycasually,,0,2025-05-20 22:43:32,,,,Okay Ill take your word for it,mtda1i9,8.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd95gy,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,1,2025-05-20 21:31:53,,,,There was an article pointing out that most of the third party launch titles are going to do that But most of the third party launch titles are just ports anyway Well see if that turns into a common practice Regardless all the titles which do that come with big warnings on the package So at least you know which games to avoid,mtc3yiu,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtc5zg8,CrossbowSpook,,-5,2025-05-20 18:17:50,,,,You also dont own the console or games only the rights to use it Nintendo can remotely brick modded switch 2s,mtc3yiu,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtc7aku,TingleyStorm,,6,2025-05-20 18:24:17,,,,They could and did do that with the Switch too Thats nothing new,mtc5zg8,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb6m0n,GrayDaysGoAway,,-15,2025-05-20 15:27:17,,,,Frankly I dont care about remote play If anything its emblematic of the problems with the Switch 2 Its a jack of all trades master of none Its mediocre as a docked console and mediocre as a standalone handheld But they want top dollar for it and its games Thats not real cool Also virtually nobody outside of reddit gives a shit about physical media anymore That is not a selling point for the vast majority of the market,mtb4wod,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb721x,TingleyStorm,,11,2025-05-20 15:29:28,,,,No no no you go back and tell me how a PS5 is somehow cheaper than a Switch 2 Thats what your complaint was and its a blatant lie,mtb6m0n,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb79f7,GrayDaysGoAway,,-6,2025-05-20 15:30:28,,,,It literally is lol I can go buy a PS5 bundle right now for less than the price of a Switch 2 edit 399 for new in box PS5 bundle at Walmart Sorry you suck at shopping uGamebird8,mtb721x,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbbsvg,Gamebird8,,9,2025-05-20 15:52:35,,,,On Amazon everything is more than 500 which is the cost of a Switch 2 Bundled with Mario Kart GameStop there are bundles at 44999 which ties with the base Switch 2 So not for less but there is more value you are technically correct Best Buy All I can find is an open box no bundles Nothing on Target or Walmart that is cheaper And if you wanna pull out the Theyre cheaper used card Do you even understand the argument here,mtb79f7,7.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbqdpj,weegee19,,2,2025-05-20 17:03:40,,,,Its not ridiculous cos youre making the wrong comparison look up Steam Deck prices and suddenly the price tag aint so daft Heck mobile tech and PC tech are not meant to be compared cos squeezing power within a smaller form factor is much pricier,mtaun2l,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb0i8l,raccoonbrigade,,3,2025-05-20 14:57:30,,,,and the ps4 was 10x more powerful than the ps3 but launched at a lower price slop eaters all,mtanjhj,2.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbq1dx,weegee19,,4,2025-05-20 17:02:00,,,,False equivalence PS4 was launched with barely midrange specs for its time PS3 launched with a supercomputerclass CPU from 2001 granted but still and at a time when memory was a lot more expensive oh yeah lets not forget that BluRay was novel tech at the time As a matter of fact the PS3 was even the cheapest BluRay player in the market at the time too,mtb0i8l,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtd2wbn,MerryDingoes,,3,2025-05-20 20:59:51,,,,Yep Launch PS3 was 600 which would be more considering todays inflation numbers not including potential tariff prices too Excluding todays economic trade wars the PS3 would be worth around 950 today From the above link the Samsung BluRay player was released at 1000 1580 in todays numbers Toshibas HD DVD player was released at 800 1270 in todays numbers The PS3 was insane and ultimately won the longterm with BluRays being the format that won This is my theory I think that Sony also tried to pull the same moves with the Vita in its proprietary memory card and charging port but it lost in that regard,mtbq1dx,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtdbvyu,weegee19,,3,2025-05-20 21:46:13,,,,Sony was selling at a loss by 300 per console for a time too it was a massive gamble that paid off extremely well in the end PS3 was literally the herald for the next era of gaming in almost every way,mtd2wbn,5.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtj75uz,poofyhairguy,,0,2025-05-21 20:02:57,,,,How was the PS3 the herald of the next generation of gaming Its weird CPU was not the direction CPUs went its nonunified shader GPU was dated day one its big push was Blu Rays and now physical media matters less than ever before and its barebones but free online service is not how any console currently operates The 360 on the other hand was the future It had the first unified shader GPU ever now every device has one How it had unified memory is how every current console is designed How it handled paid online is now what every console company does How its digital storefront focused on indies and previous generation rereleases is now what fills every console online store,mtdbvyu,6.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtja8yg,weegee19,,2,2025-05-21 20:17:44,,,,In terms of having major features namely using the Blu Ray format HDMI output 360 did not have that until a couple of years later a multithreaded CPU to name a few the PS3 was ahead The poor GPU was down to Sony basically placing all of their chips on the Cell processor,mtj75uz,7.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtb36p2,i7-4790Que,,-6,2025-05-20 15:10:34,,,,which is fair considering its 7x more powerful than the Switch you really told on yourself adding that in Not so much a hot take Just really really stupid one,mtanjhj,2.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbcoyn,Gamebird8,,4,2025-05-20 15:56:54,,,,Its hardware specs are 6x as powerful literally 6x the compute cores The cores are also fastermore efficient but the real world performance is probably somewhere in the 24x range on account of software overhead There are ways that the performance could be far greater if for example the Switch was hampered by a CPU bottleneck that has been fixed with more and beefier CPU cores but until someone sideloads Linux onto a system and races it against the Switch we wont have concrete numbers in a way where we can define definitive performance gains,mtb36p2,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtda0j7,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,1,2025-05-20 21:36:26,,,,Its not a stupid take because its wrong its a stupid take because it doesnt matter Its like condemning a motorcycle because it doesnt have as much horsepower as a car Its just a dumb comparison,mtbcoyn,4.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtbh5l0,CaptainDouchington,,-5,2025-05-20 16:19:01,,,,It absolutely is a 350 dollar console Anyone thinking otherwise is naive PS5 is 500 bucks and far more powerful This shits a glorified tablet They are not even in the same ballpark in terms of power or actual cost to produce,mtanjhj,2.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtbqmtc,weegee19,,1,2025-05-20 17:04:53,,,,Its priced a bit more than the Steam Deck with arguably better specs a much better display joycon tech AND a dock,mtbh5l0,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtcw9q0,CaptainDouchington,,1,2025-05-20 20:27:30,,,,Arm is not better than steam deck And are you seriously comparing 3 year old tech to something new The steam deck is an actual PCthe switch is a powerful tablet Absolutely does not have a better display,mtbqmtc,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtdcvjy,weegee19,,-1,2025-05-20 21:51:25,,,,Switch 2 has a 1080p120Hz HDR display even the Steam Deck OLED which costs a tad more only has a 800p90Hz display its only advantage being an OLED display I suggest you double check lmao Steam Deck also lacks DLSS,mtcw9q0,5.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mta43q8,Boop0p,,20,2025-05-20 11:51:27,,,,The general rule of thumb is that the smaller the number of nanometers the more advanced and efficient the technology but Nintendo reportedly opted for the 8nm technology to ensure cheaper and more reliable production Will Nintendo ever drop their withered technology philosophy Im guessing not when they can let others focus on the bleeding edge and they can just keep making great games and laugh all the way to the bank,,0.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtaxxv4,ChrisFromIT,,2,2025-05-20 14:45:01,,,,Is it backporting tho Or could the Ada architecture have those features because they were designed originally for the T239 Its the latter since the T239 was taped out before Adas tapeout and release,mta9d4y,4.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mta9ycr,kbn_,,1,2025-05-20 12:31:09,,,,Or Blackwell for that matter Though there wasnt a Lovelace Tegra and the Blackwell hasnt been released yet so in an odd way Ampere actually does make some sense,mta9d4y,4.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtcfpsv,ResoluteGreen,,8,2025-05-20 19:05:19,,,,Nintendos are for families with little kids whereas older teenagers and young adults get PlayStations and Xboxs Nintendo is certainly the most child and family friendly but theres plenty there for adults My gf and I both have one that we play regularly The draw isnt the performance its the type of games the exclusive titles that get you Plus with the Switch and Switch 2 the hybrid nature of the console is very appealing,mtb6zz0,3.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtclzom,m0rogfar,,3,2025-05-20 19:36:20,,,,At the end of the day the Switch 2 is already pushing how high in price conventional wisdom would suggest that you can even go with a massmarket handheld with an HDMI dock so keeping down BOM is the name of the game Sure they could potentially have made a semicustom order with Nvidia to get a premium A725Blackwell chip but itd be at a completely different price tag And lets be honest here how many people who are looking at the Switch 2 and not buying it would buy it if it was say 700 and had the technological improvements of Ampere Blackwell Im sure you could find someone thats psyched enough about frame generation to take that stance but its hardly a significant amount compared to the people that youd almost certainly lose with such a price hike,mta43q8,1.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtdd3ij,master2873,,1,2025-05-20 21:52:36,,,,Will Nintendo ever drop their withered technology philosophy Issue is theyve always done this except for a couple of examples which didnt do well N64 GameCube but the point of using older tech is to make it more affordable Yet were getting 5 year old tech for 450 and games that run on that tech that will be older than Switch 1s tech on release for up to 80 while also allowing publishers to abuse the Key Card system which negates the Switchs plug and play aspect it has over all other platforms and alianiates users who might be in rural areas or just in areas that still to this day dont have good internet access While also including the new hardly used and EXPENSIVE SD Express Card that even the company themselves that created it think its unnecessary for todays use for the time being Then you have the Nintendo president who even admits the hardware is pricey and you have investors asking many questions about pricing and other concerns Nintendo has basically defied their history of being affordable and innovative with this generation Youre right either way with your final statement They really dont need to concern themselves with bleeding edge tech Edit I should have clarified in the final statement of mine about you being right either way I should have said youre not wrong about anything either just in case it wasnt clear enough I can be blunt sometimes to the detriment of myself lol,mta43q8,1.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtdvu50,TheTinRam,,1,2025-05-20 23:37:43,,,,Doesnt help how they price games I saw FFX is still 50 Didnt it come out 6 years ago And it was already nearly a 20 year old game THEN And so now a nearly 25 year old game is still 50 I guess its technically two games but FFX2 is worth 50 at most so still 4950 for FFX is criminal,mta43q8,1.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtapdno,Kindness_of_cats,,2,2025-05-20 14:01:39,,,,That was a major and probably THE major factor but there were absolutely others that played significant roles Its weak specs and difficulty to port to was a big one that caused early third party support from larger names like Ubisoft to drop it EA straight up called the console a piece of crap by the end Its library and constant content droughts was another and compounded by the loss of third party support Nintendo was spreading its development resources too thin across the 3DS and the Wii U which meant youd go significant periods of time with minimal releases for their home console And the releases you did get rarely felt like the tentpole games they were supposed to be Hell the consoles mainline Zelda title for most of its life was a WW remaster BotW didnt come out until the Switch launched,mtaeyr4,3.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtcmi91,brianvan,,1,2025-05-20 19:38:52,,,,It would put it at one of the top console releases of all time I wouldnt read anything into it either way The original Switch is an amazing platform S2 will be better and will come with competitive launch games and features which will be both attractive to many and no rush to upgrade for many especially with reports of waiting lists for orders Over the lifespan of the S2 satisfied S1 owners will likely upgrade Console units moved matters somewhat but if there is some sort of market pullback theyll ramp down console production and still sell plenty of physical carts digital game downloads including licensed titles where profit risk is borne by another software company Its a good business to be in if you are good at marketing while being prepared for both shortages and oversupplies,mta76z1,1.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtaa335,nezeta,,1,2025-05-20 12:32:01,,,,Do Nintendo and Samsung have plans to use 4nm or 5nm nodes in the future to reduce power consumption similar to how Sony and AMD moved to TSMC 6nm node from 7nm to save around 2030W,,0.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtcrh8o,m0rogfar,,3,2025-05-20 20:03:38,,,,It doesnt seem too likely in the short term but never say never I guess The thing with 7nm 6nm was that it was a very cheap upgrade TSMC could upgrade existing 7nm production to 6nm and 6nm was designcompatible so AMD barely had to do any work on their end to make things work Samsung 8nm is a very different situation since it doesnt have any real upgrade path Samsung switched to EUV with 7nm so the tooling doesnt have any upgrade path on their end and newer nodes are not designcompatible so it would require significant work from Nvidia to port it to a newer node Making matters worse the NintendoNvidia partnership is Samsungs only major customer on 8nm which means that Samsung is highly incentivized to offer extremely competitive pricing to keep them as a customer The only reason I wouldnt straightup rule it out is that it happened with the Switch 1 with the jump from 20nm to 14nm which had many of the same technical challenges but even then there were some pretty unique circumstances there with TSMC really wanting to get out of the 20nm node due to severe issues with the node and likely cutting aggressive deals to customers to offer fab space on better nodes to get rid of any obligation to keep it going for many more years,mtaa335,1.0,1kr2rrm
comment,mtcah8x,haahaahaa,,2,2025-05-20 18:39:52,,,,Doubtful NVidias 3000 series Ampere cards were on Samsung 8nm Using that node was far and away the simplest way to go AMD has been developing new laptop APUs designed around the same archetectures in the PS5 SOC This layed the groundwork to make that move,mtaa335,1.0,1kr2rrm

comment,mtckdgl,m0rogfar,,3,2025-05-20 19:28:20,,,,Secondly cant Samsung use the blueprints so to speak to help design their own chips Potentially but with the asterisk that Nvidias architecture is patented so they couldnt actually ship anything that theyd steal and trying to do it anyway would essentially cause their 200 billion investment in chip manufacturing to go up in flames overnight since no one would ever hire them to make stuff again so theyre not going to do that,mtchwd8,1.0,1kr2rrm
