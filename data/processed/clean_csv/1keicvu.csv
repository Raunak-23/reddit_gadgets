comment,mqjfm7u,Cowabummr,,246,2025-05-04 14:18:05,,,,Over the PS3 lifespan its CPUGPU chips had several major die shrinks as IC manufacturing improved going from 90nm to 60nm 45nm and finally 28nm in the final slim version each of which brought the cost down significantly Thats not happening anymore,,0.0,1keicvu
comment,mqk3w37,togepi_man,,107,2025-05-04 16:25:13,,,,To this day Im still impressed with what IBM pulled off with the PS3 CPU Sucked it was powerPC but truly an engineering masterpiece,mqjfm7u,1.0,1keicvu
comment,mqk4771,Cowabummr,,56,2025-05-04 16:26:50,,,,It really was and still is Especially with the primitive by todays standards silicon design tools Im replaying some PS3 exclusives games and they still hold up incredibly well,mqk3w37,2.0,1keicvu
comment,mqk6bix,togepi_man,,35,2025-05-04 16:37:47,,,,For sure Just stepping back to realize itll be 20yrs next year thats a freaking eternity ago in semi conductors 20yrs before that the NES was the best you could get gross simplification That CPU has also made emulating or porting games to x86 without a recompile a major challengeI havent checked in a few years but Im not sure if ps3 emulation is completely solved,mqk4771,3.0,1keicvu

comment,mqkzd0x,whoknows234,,-3,2025-05-04 19:04:13,,,,Nintendo is just greedy and they always sell their consoles for a profit unlike Sony and MS The switch was already on an older 20nm process when it was released TSMC has 2nm chips coming this year and Intel 18nm Switch 2 is supposed to be on old tech as well as it in 8nm,mqjfm7u,1.0,1keicvu
comment,mqm0bbr,dark_sable_dev,,12,2025-05-04 22:21:07,,,,It would be literally impossible for Nintendo to use TSMCs 2nm process at any sort of scale 1 Its brand new tech meaning it has much higher failure rates until it matures 2 Its wildly more expensive than older process nodes because its the latest and greatest 3 Even if Nintendo did decide to sell a 1400 Switch 2 TSMC wouldnt be able to make it because new fabrication facilities are booked years in advance and the 2nm process node is allocated exclusively to Apple at least for the near future Those contracts are ironclad and its not like TSMC can just magically produce more fab capacity for other customers Even Nvidia couldnt switch to 2nm right now if they wanted to,mqkzd0x,2.0,1keicvu
comment,mqmpgum,whoknows234,,1,2025-05-05 00:49:28,,,,Steam deck released 3 years ago on 7nm 6nm for oled process Nintendo has had plenty of time to plan out their supply chain but they were to busy milking their golden goose Obviously its impossible right now for Nintendo to use TSMCs 2nm process atm as I have already stated that its not yet released However there are other chips they can use that are newer and more power efficient than 8nm without much additional cost Nvidia could switch to 18a in the near future if they chose to do so I would imagine if they wanted to they could compete with Apple for the advanced process nodes But why do that when you can sell 32000 5nm chips Im pretty sure if Nvidia has more wiggle room on a 32k GPU vs a 15k phone,mqm0bbr,3.0,1keicvu
comment,mqnco0z,Server6,,6,2025-05-05 03:13:49,,,,The smaller nodes are more power efficient for the size which is more important for mobile devices Nvidia is less concerned about power efficiency and has no problem with huge hot power hungry chips,mqmpgum,4.0,1keicvu
comment,mqp947g,Cowabummr,,1,2025-05-05 13:08:28,,,,In the PS3 era die shrinks brought big cost savings Now its a costUP for multiple reasons including the severely constrained fab capacity of small featured chips,mqmpgum,4.0,1keicvu
comment,mqkov3x,ThisIs_americunt,,0,2025-05-04 18:10:12,,,,because manufacturers dont want to spend 10 million on a new production line to implement the new product when the old one works fine IMO its a good thing but bad in this case cause it creates a bottle neck for the tech to advance,mqjfm7u,1.0,1keicvu

comment,mqjqmwo,IIIaustin,,119,2025-05-04 15:16:34,,,,Yeah Manufacturing semiconductors is probably the activity humans are best at and it takes up a pretty sizable chuck of all of science and engineering We might have invented AI and a big part of that if my understanding is correct is just doing a revolting amount of linear algebra,mqjojjn,2.0,1keicvu

comment,mqk1x4k,IIIaustin,,40,2025-05-04 16:15:02,,,,I have no idea if we have hit max or how close we are but the process complexity and expense is increasing exponentially We are not using SiC the Semiconductors im discussing thought we are still using Si Othet substrates have been investigated but its really hard to compete with Si because we are ridiculously good at processing Si Any competitive substrate needs to complete with a half century of a significant amount of all human scientific and engineering effort Which is Hard,mqjxnla,4.0,1keicvu

comment,mqnlzm8,IIIaustin,,2,2025-05-05 04:22:07,,,,I havent heard of diamond in this context Sounds like a very creative grant proposal We would have to get probably millions of times better at growing artificial diamond before it could compete with Si on size or defect density,mqn7fex,6.0,1keicvu

comment,mqk80xi,PumpkinKnyte,,35,2025-05-04 16:46:29,,,,When I built my first pc my GPU was on a 22nm process Then only 10 years later they had gotten that down to 4nm and stuffed nearly 80 BILLION transistors on that microscopic space Honestly scifi shit if you think about it,mqjakul,1.0,1keicvu
comment,mqlzbch,dark_sable_dev,,6,2025-05-04 22:15:22,,,,Slight correction because I couldnt tell if you knew from your comment A 4nm process node doesnt mean theyre cramming 80 billion transistors into a 4nm square It means that the length of a gate inside each of those transistors is roughly 4nm Each transistor is closer to the order of 50nm in size on the whole Its still extremely tiny and extremely densely packed but not quite as scifi as it might seem,mqk80xi,2.0,1keicvu

comment,mqnkzc8,im_thatoneguy,,14,2025-05-05 04:14:02,,,,Smaller tends to mean less power draw Also the more chips you can get out of a single wafer the cheaper all else being equal Eg if you print an 85x11 sheet of paper that costs 1 to print and need to cut out 4 pictures thats 025 each but if you can print 16 smaller pictures thats 005 each,mqmic5v,2.0,1keicvu
comment,mqo00o6,chinomaster182,,1,2025-05-05 06:29:43,,,,Its sorta similar to a car to draw more performance from a chip you usually add more voltage to it to make it work faster that electricity generates heat that needs to be dissipated At some point it gets really hard to control so much heat so one solution is to make the pieces smaller to make it so it doesnt produce as much heat as before Add some other extra engineering efficiencies on top and thats how weve been able to get more and more powerful chips for so long,mqmic5v,2.0,1keicvu
comment,mqo38c4,SympathyMotor4765,,1,2025-05-05 07:02:47,,,,The smaller a chip is more transistors you can pack in and the more transistors you have the more complex your circuits can be thus improving performance All processors are basically billions of really fast switches turning on and off at ridiculous speeds the more switches you have the faster it works,mqmic5v,2.0,1keicvu
comment,mqp8jd6,Some_Derpy_Pineapple,,1,2025-05-05 13:04:56,,,,The more transistors you can pack into a given area of silicon the more you can do with a limited amount of power in a given cycle of the chip Additionally computer chips are fast enough that bigger chips have to deal with latency and signal integrity issues that are less prevalent in smaller chips due to the physical distance electrical signals need to travel so manufacturing small chips generally makes the most sense for most devices So every time a smaller chipmaking process becomes reliable enough to mass produce chips processing power for small chips in consumer devices increases by a lot,mqmic5v,2.0,1keicvu

comment,mqmoqnu,SchighSchagh,,1,2025-05-05 00:45:02,,,,The chips improving steadily is basically everything to society right now Yeah the steady march or Moores Law before it started tapering off ended up driving increases in computing demand which matched or surpassed increases in compute capability Once games started taking years to develop they started being designed for the hardware that was assumed will exist by the time the game is out Eg if someone in 2005 started working on a game they plan to release in 2010 they designed it from the getgo for 2010 hardware Notoriously Crysis went above and beyond and designed for hardware that wouldnt exist until years after launch But either way the very same improvements in hardware that were supposed to address problems with compute power eventually drove much higher demand for compute,mqizcd0,1.0,1keicvu

comment,mqp8vvq,AStringOfWords,,0,2025-05-05 13:07:04,,,,Youre talking to me like I dont know what multitasking is or what having hundreds of chrome tabs open is like Fact is theres zero compelling reason to upgrade any CPU equal or better than 8 cores 16 threads Weve had those CPUs in the mainstream for more than 7 years at this point and a lot longer in enterprise The gains after that point are absolutely marginal and rarely if ever experienced on everyday workloads Yes if you work in professional video editing software thats the one exception but most people dont ever do that So forgive me if I fail to be impressed by the latest 32 core Frankenstein CPU from Intel which has downclocked Efficiency Cores to save power and a bunch of random different cores and a weedy little GPU jammed together on a die instead of anything that actually revolutionises performance,mqogof0,10.0,1keicvu

comment,mqjkza2,LeCrushinator,,8,2025-05-04 14:46:54,,,,Not really a nothingburger For decades wed see doubling in transistor densities every 23 and that alone meant that prices would drop just due to the gains in performance and reduction in power draw That is no longer the case The improvements are still happening but its happening at maybe half the rate that it was and will continue to slow down A new breakthrough will be required to see gains like we used to something that is beyond reduction in transistor density If you want a clear picture on how the progress was slowed an easy way to spot it is the RAM usage over time and its easy to see in console generations PS1 1994 35MB of RAM PS2 2000 36MB of RAM 10x increase in 6 years avg of 16x increase per year PS3 2006 512MB of RAM 14x increase in 6 years avg of 23x increase per year PS4 2013 8GB of RAM 16x increase in 7 years avg of 23x increase per year PS5 2020 16GB of RAM 2x increase in 7 years avg of 03x increase per year PS6 likely 2027 Likely 24GB of RAM Easy to spot that transistor increases really slowed down some time after 2013 You could see since in CPUs as well you used to need a new CPU for a PC every few years to keep up with games now a good CPU could last you 78 years,mqiyv3z,1.0,1keicvu

comment,mqp4tq5,nipsen,,1,2025-05-05 12:41:34,,,,Oh gods Here we go again The argument he makes literally rests on a proposition Moores Law that the author himself somehow has now studied to learn now after the industry has been selling it as a thruthism in the absolutely wrong context from the 70s So if you take the argument he makes at face value there hasnt been done much in terms of progress since the 70s and 80s long before x86 was even conceived And thats true because the consoles he specifies rest on RISCarchitectures which we have not programmed for outside of specific exceptions the SNES wii Switch the Ps3 arguably the ps2 and the various Mispbased other consolearchitectures Meanwhile the Switch is based on an ARMchipset with an nvidia graphics card instruction set fused to the cpuinstruction set islands with an isolated chip so that the instruction set doesnt have to rest on hardware that is extractable through sdk And this Tegra setup is now over 15 years old even though the tegra x1 released in 2015 didnt find its way to the Nintendo Switch after being lampooned universally in the dysfunctional ZiffDavis vomit we call the gaming press in 2017 The maybe most successful gaming console in recent years in other words is based on a lampooned chipset that Nvidia almost didnt manage to get off the ground with the ION chipset two decades before som muppet in Ars finally finds out that there hasnt been done much new stuff in hardware recently That the Intel setups that rely exclusively on higher clock speeds to produce better results have not substantially changed in over 10 years does not in any way trigger this kind of response Of course not That Microsoft and Sony both release a console that is an incredibly outdated PC using an AMD setup that allows the manufacturer to avoid the obvious cooling issues that every console with any amount of similar graphics grunt would have doesnt trigger anything That a gaming laptop is released with less theoretical power but that soundly beats the 200W monsters that throttle from the first second in benchmarks run on something thats not submerged in liquid nitrogen doesnt register No of course not And when Nvidia releases a proper graphics card that has infinite amounts of grunt that cant be used by any realtime applications unless they are predetermined to work only on the frontbuffer directly as the PCI bus from the fecking 90s is not quick enough to do anything else When BAR is introduced and it sadly suffers from the same issues and resubmit pauses are incredibly high completely shuttering the OpenCL universe from any traditional PC setup no no one at Fucking Ars registers that But what do they register Ill tell you what the release of a console that makes use of nvidias great and new and futuristic bullshitsampling and framegeneration technology otherwise on the same hardware as the Switch Because Nintendo doesnt succeed in selling some bullshit by buying off a Pachter to lie to people on beforehand Then they realize and argue like pointed out that there hasnt really been that much progress in computing since the 70s as some people in the industry says in a MountainDewridden blodfog And then some of us come along and point out that efficiency on performance in the lower watt segments has exploded to the point where 1080p60fps gaming is available to us on 30W oh we dont care about that When we point out that spudesigns on an asynchronously transferring memory bus as opposed to the synchronous one were stuck with with programmable computation elements as in ability to send programs to the cpu rather than let the processor infinitely subdivide these operations themselves at 5Ghz rates That are the equivalent of a long instruction running on say 20Mhz in entirely realistic situations When we do that then Arse doesnt want to know In fact no one wants to know Because that narrative is in confrontation with Intels marketing bullshit drives The stupidest industry in the world Bar none,,0.0,1keicvu
comment,mqp6gu4,Pitoucc,,1,2025-05-05 12:52:05,,,,Gaming consoles started at off the shelf parts that were very much available due to an abundance of fabs and vendors Now the latest generations are sitting closer to the edge of bleeding tech basically focused on 2 vendors where the fabs that make them are very few,,0.0,1keicvu
comment,mqqzxeo,GStarG,,1,2025-05-05 18:24:09,,,,Id imagine a lot of reason costs arent dropping as fast as they used to is also due to a gargantuan amount of chips on the market going to AI and crypto More demand higher prices Before the crypto and AI booms gpus fell off in price a lot harder and faster Certainly fast progress in the technology was also a big factor but I think in more recent times this is more relevant,,0.0,1keicvu

comment,mqjsqk0,Walkin_mn,,1,2025-05-04 15:27:33,,,,Thats not what is killing price cuts I mean yes its one of the factors but look around Were living in the enshittification age Every single company is doing everything they can to extract as much money they can from the consumers in exchange for the least value they can manage COVID happened which increased prices but what happened after that Prices of everything were kept high and then increased even more Meanwhile every big media was talking about how big companies were struggling but surprisingly turns out these same companies were reporting record profits why could this happen Also in the meantime the orange thing decided to start his tariff war which has destabilized the whole global market Just look at Nvidia the company who designed and sell the SoC of the Switch and Switch 2 they have globally increased their prices on everything because yes some increased prices by Tsmc and some other manufacturer price increases but just because they can get away with it All their new GPUs are being criticized for charging more for less increase in performance or for the same performance while their support is getting more enshittified And for the industry theyre now trying to be the solution for almost everything on the pipeline to also extract as much money as they can from them too while costing more also Im just tired of looking at headlines blaming the obvious thing the big companies want to pass the blame to so the consumers dont look at the big picture of whats really happening The Switch 2 is definitely not expensive only because Moores law is relatively dead,,0.0,1keicvu

comment,mqkdqw8,FlyingBishop,,1,2025-05-04 17:14:51,,,,Really disappointed in the analysis in this article The question of whether or not Moores law is dead is an interesting one However I think if you rigorously examined stuff like power consumption per perf useful screen area refresh rate etc and normalized for inflation you would see a pretty significant speedup The fact that the author blithely suggests zero price increase is a reasonable expectation for a new console in the face of higher inflation just seems silly,,0.0,1keicvu
