comment,mui25uf,pizoisoned,,155,2025-05-27 11:59:11,,,,A good portion of the problem is you have way too much power being drawn through these cables and no real guaranteed load balancing going on to ensure no one wire is carrying too much power The whole thing needs to be redesigned,,0.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muhv1ui,YertletheeTurtle,,108,2025-05-27 11:06:40,,,,This was supposed to be that new connector Full design deployment for something better would take some time leaving board partners the options today of falling back to 3 4 pin with some power restrictions or 4 4 pin for full equivalent,muhrhb3,2.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muhvrww,b_a_t_m_4_n,,97,2025-05-27 11:12:23,,,,Theyve have a few years now to come up with something this is not a new problem When they introduce new connectors like DisplayPort board partners have no problems keeping up So this is just an excuse frankly,muhv1ui,3.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muiwq29,Sub_NerdBoy,,21,2025-05-27 14:54:07,,,,This is only so true Once a new thing is introduced and not found to be a big problem until in market means what they currently have designed for the next unreleased generation is probably too far along to change This is why its common to see 2 generations of bad design like this before its actually fixed,muhvrww,4.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mui9jr1,nikolai_470000,,8,2025-05-27 12:47:14,,,,I mean that is what it looks like from the outside but behind the scenes they usually are sharing nonpublic info months in advance before they actually release anything so partners can actually design and build out tailored solutions to the new products Changing it now on that level would still take months That would also probably be the least of their worries because a move like that is going to piss off a lot of people legal departments especially,muhvrww,4.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muinb0q,b_a_t_m_4_n,,19,2025-05-27 14:05:11,,,,changing it now yes my point being its too late this shit should have sorted after the 4090 debacle There is zero excuse for this to still be a problem,mui9jr1,5.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muiwqwj,BensForceGhost,,5,2025-05-27 14:54:14,,,,Yeah no excuse for this failure in design repeating Frankly they shouldve designed a new connector when they learned of the new specs power draw These connectors melt because its too hot due the power needed to run these newer Nvidia cards Just boggles the mind,muinb0q,6.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mui0hc5,nooneisback,,25,2025-05-27 11:47:32,,,,The problem is that the design is usually not up to them nVidia is horribly strict when it comes to literally every part of it All boards are literally the same all boxes are the same layout with a different background image and all connectors are the same They only get to make their own coolers and backplates as long as they meet minimum requirements Theres a good reason why AMDs partners dont use this connector AMD itself is probably a big reason but I doubt many would want to go with this garbage of a connector anyways even if they had the choice,muhv1ui,3.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muigh1c,SundownMarkTwo,,17,2025-05-27 13:28:01,,,,Theres a good reason why AMDs partners dont use this connector Sapphires Nitro cards for the 9070 and 9070 XT use a 12VHPWR connector IIRC theyre the only one using it out of all of the board partners and _only_ on their Nitro cards,mui0hc5,4.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muijj0w,fudsak,,10,2025-05-27 13:45:03,,,,If the problem is the connector design itself then having an adapter isnt going to solve it one end of that adapter still has to pass the same amount of current through that connector design,muhrhb3,2.0,1kwjgvr

comment,mujcojl,Alan_Shutko,,2,2025-05-27 16:09:07,,,,The connector is not the problem The GPU is the problem since it blindly draws current hoping that its even across wires,muhrhb3,2.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mujgl1y,b_a_t_m_4_n,,9,2025-05-27 16:27:57,,,,Yes the connector Is the problem Why does it need multiple wires Becuase it needs multiple pins Why does it need multiple pins because the pins used are not rated for all the current being drawn This failure mode has been designed into the system Artificially throttling the load is a kludge workaround thats begging to fail and burn your house down The connector should have been redesigned there really is no excuse,mujcojl,3.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mujwpny,Fantastic-Newt-9844,,6,2025-05-27 17:42:41,,,,No the dude was right Using multiple pins per connection is common and normal The issue is load balancing and lack of headroom when one wire sees a little extra resistance than the other,mujgl1y,4.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muijjat,Shoshke,,14,2025-05-27 13:45:06,,,,Ad load balancing as a requirement in the standard and boom 95 of issues disappear The smallest defect in a connector or the crimp to the wire or the wire or the PSU side connector and the load on one or more cables becomes wildly out of spec,muhqlee,1.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mulrmd1,shadow_of,,3,2025-05-27 23:13:22,,,,load balancing as a requirement is nice but they also need to implement impedance monitors on both ends so if it passes a certain threshold reduce current whether thats underclockingundervolting and as a last resort shut the whole damn thing down with their vast resources cant believe these mfers chose color coded pins as a solution,muijjat,2.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muj5rjs,IamGimli_,,5,2025-05-27 15:36:34,,,,Not really If the load is unbalanced its because the resistance of each wires and its connection varies Forcing equal load when the resistance varies will only move the burning from the overloaded wire to the one that has a higher resistance Its still going to burn up The solution is to develop a connector that is less likely to have varied resistance between conductors which will require physically strongermore reliable connectors and build more overhead into the standard which will require physically larger wires ie reengineer what the 8pin connectors already do Another solution would be to make a new 8pin clamping connector with 12 gauge wires which could safely transfer 80 amps of current ie 960W12V The clamping connector itself would need to be pretty beefy and would be expensive to manufacture but could ensure a much stronger connection therefore reducing the risks of unbalanced resistance The whole thing would also look ugly and 12 gauge wires arent easy to bend tightly which would make small form factor builds much more difficult to do,muijjat,2.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mujlmco,xantec15,,3,2025-05-27 16:51:45,,,,The 8pin connector only has three power deliver pins With 12awg 20amp wiring it would be good for 720 peak watts 576 watts at 80 Still a big step up over the 150 watts they give now Of course the problem with reusing the same connector would be uninformed people wondering why their GPU under performing with the old 150w cables There would be a lot of returns because the buyer didnt know their PSU was out of date and just thought the GPU was broken And good luck to the store associates trying to explain that,muj5rjs,3.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mujmtqg,IamGimli_,,1,2025-05-27 16:57:16,,,,The current 8pin connector has only 3 power delivery pins but a new one could have 4 and 4 grounds Nobody suggested reusing the same connector I specifically stated Another solution would be to make a new 8pin clamping connector Just because it has the same number of conductors doesnt mean its the same connector I dont believe the current 8pin connector would be reliable enough to carry that much current as it wasnt engineered to do so,mujlmco,4.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muiqv0o,Mental_Medium3988,,3,2025-05-27 14:23:57,,,,i feel like ltt had the best answer for this just put a positive and negative going to a card and a standard connector that has proven to be reliable and robust in environments no pc would ever encounter,muhqlee,1.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muj3qjg,GregTheMad,,1,2025-05-27 15:27:07,,,,They should just adapt _older_ standards Transcription just use established highvoltage connectors,muhqlee,1.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mukd8po,Kiseido,,1,2025-05-27 18:59:46,,,,If many existing products suffer from this problem which they do and the fix is to have some current distribution circuitry to loadbalance on either the GPU or PSU side then there exists a fixedsized market for a gobetween device to perform the same function That is to say we should be seeing a 12VHPWR loadbalancer hitting the market momentarily A small 12VHPWR12VHPWR solid connector for maybe 5 base cost,muhqlee,1.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muiug80,FF7Remake_fark,,-2,2025-05-27 14:42:42,,,,Is it a problem with the cable when almost every instance goes back to either third party cables that have been burning since the 30 series and now this specific MSI adapter Or would the more logical conclusion be that there are serious QC issues with adapters,muhqlee,1.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muhscsn,hjadams123,,447,2025-05-27 10:45:03,,,,So its official at this point right There is technically nothing you can do to insure this does not happen Putting it in all the way or buying the best quality cable Buying a particular type of PSU etc Whether it happens to you is totally luck of the draw,,0.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mui64we,Takyomi,,153,2025-05-27 12:25:46,,,,Pretty much yeah At this point its clearly a fundamental design issue with these connectors Doesnt matter if you do everything right still rolling the dice with a 2000 card Wild that were just supposed to accept this,muhscsn,1.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muiatmd,IT_techsupport,,97,2025-05-27 12:54:56,,,,not supposed we are actively accepting it this is why nvidia doesnt care People need to wake up relevant look at uFormalBread526 s coment right below yours,mui64we,2.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muk4u8f,tastyratz,,-2,2025-05-27 18:19:56,,,,This is a function of the connector itself not being capable of delivering the amperage requested is it not In that case it is a vendor agnostic issue impacting most the vendor with the highest power draw at the moment right Im surprised government agencies are not mandating firmware updates with tighter power limits on cards using HPWR honestly,muiyddx,4.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muk584m,TheLuminary,,18,2025-05-27 18:21:45,,,,I mean you can defend Nvidia all you want But they are the ones who designed a product that overloaded the standard connector in the 4000 series And then designed a product that overloaded the standard connector in the 5000 series They knew exactly what would happen and they did it anyways,muk4u8f,5.0,1kwjgvr
comment,muk7qc4,tastyratz,,1,2025-05-27 18:33:39,,,,Dont confuse my understanding of the PCISIG 12VHPR standard with defending Nvidia The spec was created and agreed on and the cards should be within design parameters it was just a failure of the 12VHPWR design If AMD or Intel decided to launch a 600w card tomorrow they would have the same problem Hell the Sapphire 9070XT has also had problems with this The 12VHPWR spec needs to be overhauled,muk584m,6.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mukpe6c,machinarius,,8,2025-05-27 19:58:08,,,,If by overhauled you mean dropped sure 12vhpwr was change for changes sake theres nothing truly new to gain from it Smaller cable footprint does not outweigh the risk of burning your house down,muk7qc4,7.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mumi0yf,tastyratz,,0,2025-05-28 01:42:18,,,,Considering the 6 pin connector was good for 75w and the 8 pin connector is rated for 150w even a 2x8 is rated at just over half the power 525w 12VHPR was supposed to deliver With new cards drawing more power the PCIE 2x8 and 2x6s definitely started getting pushed 12VHPR never should have released the way it is but the reality is we will continue to see more cards launched with more transistors that need more power and the premise of a better high power connection wasnt the problem the execution was,mukpe6c,8.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mup26ui,Jonnyflash80,,3,2025-05-28 13:24:53,,,,When there is a need for a higher power connector engineers typically design it with thicker metal contacts and more contact area not less 12VHPR is a horrible engineering blunder,mumi0yf,9.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muikfw7,galactica_pegasus,,42,2025-05-27 13:49:59,,,,Right Seasonics PSU cant fix the root cause but it can mitigate a catastrophic failure by cutting power A gamesystem crash is better than killing a GPU and starting a house fire This connector disaster was well known in the 40series cards and Im shocked that nVidia didnt make it a standardrequirement that cards had to diff current between the pins It would have been an easy thing to do in the name of safety and I would think a nobrainer to protect your brand image Yet here we are Even with nVidia not mandating it Im equally surprised more board partners arent voluntarily doing it I guess they think consumers would choose a competitors product with less safety if it saved them 510 and they dont want to eat away at any margin to include it for the same price,muik6q2,3.0,1kwjgvr

comment,mumenfo,Verbose_Code,,5,2025-05-28 01:23:00,,,,Fewer thicker gauge wire would be less flexible even for the same total cross section the cross section along with material and temperature is what determines the linear ampacity of the wire You can bend 12 steel cable easily with your hands a 12 solid rod not so much Even 34 cable can be bent easier than 12 steel rods You can buy high stand count wire and its super flexible You can also use silicone insulation as opposed to the PVC insulation thats most common Both of these things add cost The issue here is the connector its trash When you have many smaller pins its easier for them to be misaligned or not seated fully Making the plastic that seats into the mating connector on the GPU a different color is nice but it does nothing to stop the sockets inside that connector from popping loose and not fully seat Anecdotally I have experienced this exact failure mode before with these types of connectors I would not be surprised if thats what happened here,muiw9zn,1.0,1kwjgvr

comment,mulfagg,hansonhols,,5,2025-05-27 22:05:55,,,,These type of MiniFit connectors not talking about 12VHPWR here have been around since the 60s 70s They were not originally designed to supply the current required by these graphics cards 600 watts at 12v is 50 amps Each pin in the connector is rated for a MAX of 13 amps according to the datasheets for these connectors and the crimps within them 4 pins are sharing that 50 amp load each bearing 125 amps 4 for positive and 4 for negative It only takes one of those connector crimps to not be in full contact with the receiving pins for the remaining pins to have to take up that extra load which puts them into overload straight away Even with tighter fitting crimps with longer sleeves it only takes a slight misalignment to mess your day up Add to that the DIY element to many of these builds they really are not fit for this purpose anymore Best practice is to push fit the connector into place then wire by wire gently push each wire in 1 by 1 to the fitted connector to ensure every pin crimp is fully inserted and in full contact with the receiving pin Mistakes i see often is the plastic connector housing is clicked in securely but the crimp is only 23rds the way down onto the pin I believe Super Sabre or MegaFit connectors by Molex should be used but what do i know Edited to add the 12VHPWR is utter dog shit and is no better than a Microfit,,0.0,1kwjgvr
comment,mulgs1h,HowlingWolven,,4,2025-05-27 22:13:51,,,,Other option is more voltage Instead of pushing dozens of amps through parallelled pins let the GPU take a new 48VDC rail supplied by the PSU at up to 15 amps or so for 720 watts of fluff you over 22 normal PCIe sized pins Keep the dangerous firecausing currents in the card itself once that 48VDC is bucked down to a volt or so,mulfagg,1.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muhy21e,undeleted_username,,9,2025-05-27 11:29:49,,,,Problem is in the contact points But when one does not make good contact the current flows through the other wires and that causes the overheat If you put fuses on the cable when one wire carries too much current the fuse will blow current will then go through the other wires and the other fuses will blow too,muhvcxq,4.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muizekq,3DprintRC,,6,2025-05-27 15:07:00,,,,The wall socket is only good for about 1020 A depending if you live in 220V110V country sustained The GPU relies on regulated switched low voltage from the PSU If you had a direct connection to the wall youd need an additional switching power supply on the GPU itself with regulation down A better option could be to add a 24 V GPU bus to the ATX standard This would halve the current demand on the GPU power connector The problem then is regulating high from 24 V to sub 1V on the GPU itself instead of from 12 V to sub 1 V Personally I think they should stop marketing icreasing power demands are progress Its gonna reach 1 kW in two generations If they cant produce the performance gains with the same power levels as before then they failed,muia3oc,1.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muloewx,HowlingWolven,,2,2025-05-27 22:55:45,,,,The wires are fine assuming theyre actually 16awg and anything from a reputable manufacturer is Theyll warm up sometimes a lot but theyll take the full GPU current The Minitek Pwr 30 connector family and how its used is the issue here the rated 12V22 spec pushes the pins inside the housing almost right to their rated max spec unlike the old PCIe triple 8pin setup these GPUs wouldve used a few generations back This is theoretically fine each pin is at or below rating assuming each carries the _same_ share of the current the card draws And what you assume makes an ass outta u and me In practice the contact resistance between pins varies somewhat and the power rail on the card just busses all the pins together As a result a pin that doesnt _quite_ seat as well as its neighbours doesnt pull its weight This is an issue because of how close to the limit the spec has been written There is no real tolerance for any missing or high resistance pin The remaining pins now pass more current and heat up more until eventually one pin exceeds its rating overheats under load and melts the connector around it Its resistance increases dramatically the next pin overheats and pretty soon your GPU either quits or catches fire at the power connector But hey at least 12V22 is smaller than three 8pin PCIe power connectors,mujv6x1,1.0,1kwjgvr

comment,munaf2d,Dreams-Visions,,1,2025-05-28 04:45:43,,,,Seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere Surely the foolproof part of the cable is simply allowing the user to visually confirm their connector is funnily inserted into the GPU rather than partially inserted In that it is foolproof If you dont see yellow you can be assured that the cable was fully inserted But we know that incomplete insertions arent the sole reason for melting cables so Im not sure what the headline is trying to say 5090 cables are melting because of imbalanced loads creating higher than expected current and heat concentrating on 1 or 2 cables causing them to potentially overheat and melt No part in the chain is able to dynamically correct if this begins to happen because Nvidia has designed these cards to be incapable of doing so read enshitification The closest anyone can get now is the Asus Astral line which per pin monitoring that can at least alert an owner if there is a load imbalance with a warning on the computer But that cant fix the balance or prevent damage Just give you a heads up so you can save your system in a worst case scenario If you arent around for the alert under load the cable can melt there too So yes cables can melt whether foolproof connectors or not Because the connectors were never the single point of blame You can seat any cable properly and an unknown load imbalance extreme enough can produce this result,,0.0,1kwjgvr

comment,mui6iwc,DimitryKratitov,,2,2025-05-27 12:28:17,,,,Whats common to you This connector was already known for having issues and being a potential firehazard Stats say 05 of 50series GPUs melt Well fine thats not common in the strict sense of the word Just way more common than it should be Especially for the price point these things are sold at A couple of them melting for every 1000 units sold is not acceptable I mean people mock Teslas for catching fire when the chance is 1100000 But 51000 super expensive GPUs melting is somehow quite good,mui2n8n,3.0,1kwjgvr

comment,muidypk,DimitryKratitov,,4,2025-05-27 13:13:33,,,,My point was always that they melt The original post is that they melt The statistics I sent are that they melt Youre holding on to the word fire because you know youre wrong and prefer to be pedantic over admitting it which is just being sad and pathetic Theres nothing wrong with being wrong its how you learn Whats even dumber is that some really do catch fire and a quick search will net you those results Even spent an extra minute to try to find an actual fire to show you But either way what I said was potential firehazard and melting is literally that a potential firehazard meaning even in your pedantic world you wouldnt be correct,muic8db,7.0,1kwjgvr
