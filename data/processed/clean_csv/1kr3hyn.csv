comment,mtaav2h,TheSchlaf,,124,2025-05-20 12:37:04,,,,So they have money to pay for GSync licensing but not Dolby Vision licensing Interesting,,0.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtb367q,drmirage809,,39,2025-05-20 15:10:31,,,,I believe thats because they got their own fancy HDR standard that theyre trying to push Not a lot of success on their end with Dolby Vision quickly becoming the standard for HDR content,mtaav2h,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtcic2c,Lokon19,,19,2025-05-20 19:18:15,,,,They support HDR10 which is an open standard and free They are just cheaping out The good news is that the biggest streaming companies are now offering support for it so its not completely dead,mtb367q,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtacxcf,user11711,,24,2025-05-20 12:50:12,,,,I was thinking the same thing What in the actual hell Really sucks I dont even look at Samsung TVs anymore because of this I have one from 2016 but at the time it was all new In the year of the lord 2025 there is no excuse,mtaav2h,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtadgkg,TheSchlaf,,20,2025-05-20 12:53:29,,,,They also dropped DTS passthrough via eARC because of licensing issues LG finally added it back in the C4 and later TVs Sony has always kept both,mtacxcf,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtadm80,user11711,,23,2025-05-20 12:54:26,,,,Lawddddd yea thank god for RTings literally wont touch a TV without reading there extensively,mtadgkg,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtchy8d,Lokon19,,6,2025-05-20 19:16:23,,,,LG just got rid of some DTS support on their 2025 models,mtadgkg,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtap3hp,dammerung2010,,4,2025-05-20 14:00:08,,,,LG removed it again on the 5 series OLEDs,mtadgkg,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtaqsf3,TheSchlaf,,3,2025-05-20 14:09:08,,,,Yep Stupid Why not allow users to pay for the licenses they want They already have the programming in the OS,mtap3hp,4.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtfljrf,Elon61,,1,2025-05-21 06:46:28,,,,Its probably more complicated than youd think and would probably be substantially more expensive perlicense,mtaqsf3,5.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtfy947,Hitori-Kowareta,,1,2025-05-21 08:58:34,,,,Itd also require the license holders to support that and I imagine theyd much rather every single product in a lineup paid the fee rather than an indeterminate number of endusers,mtfljrf,6.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtbcr68,shhhpark,,5,2025-05-20 15:57:12,,,,I think the reintroduced it in the C4 generation but removed it again in the latest 5 generation lol I havent checked on my G5 but think o saw someone mention it,mtadgkg,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtaln34,Emotional_Insect4874,,6,2025-05-20 13:41:19,,,,I bought a 4k Samsung tv and the capacitors powering backlight started to fail making the screen flicker like its having a seizure literally a week after the warranty expired The smart TV cpu is also way underpowered and laggy and slow AF I will never buy another Samsung product ever that company has jumped the shark A cheap ass TCL TV Ive had for 10 years still works better,mtacxcf,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtapg95,The8Darkness,,5,2025-05-20 14:02:02,,,,Wouldnt say the cpu is underpowered the software is just crap bloat Like a 2016 flagship samsung tv runs circles around any of the newer ones when it comes to os performance Like even bargain bin tvs and like 1020 streaming sticks usually feel better performing because their os isnt bloated to hell and beyond,mtaln34,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtb7vlf,ScoobiesSnacks,,3,2025-05-20 15:33:27,,,,Ive been team LG for a while now Doesnt Samsung have a pretty bad reputation for their products not holding up long term and having poor customer service,mtacxcf,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtfdvpa,ECHLN,,1,2025-05-21 05:34:12,,,,Its infuriating because Im in the market for a new OLED C5 or S90F Ill have to skip Samsung because Ive seen some owners reviews of how their TVs sometimes handle Dolby Vision content and Im strongly going to avoid them for now,mtaav2h,1.0,1kr3hyn

comment,mtabxsg,NuPNua,,27,2025-05-20 12:43:56,,,,Its just a proprietary VRR format most top level TVs already support VRR via the standard format,mtaa1an,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtah7i3,H3LLGHa5T,,13,2025-05-20 13:15:57,,,,its not proprietary any more just a certification at this point,mtabxsg,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtdbdju,YertletheeTurtle,,3,2025-05-20 21:43:31,,,,The article clarifies that only the monitors are getting GSync The TVs are getting GSync Compatible which is incompatible with GSync but supported by most modern GPUs,mtabxsg,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtab1s0,Tankerrex,,5,2025-05-20 12:38:16,,,,So that the salesman can glaze the product to better convince the family before him to commit to a 24 month payment plan,mtaa1an,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtac053,NuPNua,,10,2025-05-20 12:44:22,,,,If youre going to be using your TV for gaming VRR tech is pretty beneficial,mtab1s0,2.0,1kr3hyn

comment,mtakcs9,jack_the_beast,,0,2025-05-20 13:34:00,,,,Vrr tech is gsync isnt,mtac053,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtc043q,BassGaming,,1,2025-05-20 17:49:37,,,,You are getting downvoted while being correct VRR is very useful Gsync is just Nvidias implemention where they have to pay for the license and the thing which makes it interesting for the manufacturers certification Freesync for example works just as well But being able to slap Gsync ready on the box is a selling point for some reason Whats even funnier in this case it is literally just the certification They dont even have gsync hardware integrated Its literally just the certification to slap it on the box as a feature There is no advantage for the user,mtakcs9,4.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtaay54,TheSchlaf,,2,2025-05-20 12:37:36,,,,No screen flickering or weird glitches with Nvidia GPUs in VRR mode,mtaa1an,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtahne3,BenadrylChunderHatch,,4,2025-05-20 13:18:32,,,,GSync doesnt fully prevent flickering at low fps in VRR even with the hardware module,mtaay54,2.0,1kr3hyn

comment,mtancgp,TheSchlaf,,6,2025-05-20 13:50:41,,,,Low Framerate Compensation Basically doubling the frames until you get to the lowest Hz that VRR will support Looks like you are right and GSync doesnt support that Its up to the monitor manufacturer,mtakdcv,5.0,1kr3hyn

comment,mtawfpb,lucky6877,,8,2025-05-20 14:37:37,,,,Stopped buying Samsung tvs when they stopped adopting Dolby vision and switched to LG never going back to Samsung again until they adopt Dolby vision,,0.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtgflln,PUMPEDnPLUMP,,1,2025-05-21 11:35:29,,,,I switched from 2019 Samsung to 2025 LG this year its incredible The only downgrade is slight banding in certain games,mtawfpb,1.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mti22eh,lucky6877,,1,2025-05-21 16:47:45,,,,Sorry to hear about the banding issue I have the C1 which is a couple of years old but touch wood no issues so far In regards to your banding issue couple of my friends mentioned they bought a high end HDMI cable expensive ones and it sorted out the issue Other friends mentioned they started refreshing the pixels on regular basis and that helped resolve the issue so not sure if that helps Cheers,mtgflln,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mti27zm,PUMPEDnPLUMP,,3,2025-05-21 16:48:28,,,,I have a good cable and its brand new I think its just the way the screen processes gradients,mti22eh,3.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtz6pg7,Stargate_1,,1,2025-05-24 08:16:11,,,,What is banding I have a LG OLED as well hut a monitor not a TV and I dont think I experience banding maybe I do,mtgflln,2.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtal56r,SaVaTa_HS,,5,2025-05-20 13:38:30,,,,Meanwhile they support FreeSync since 2018 Interesting Is it just a nvidia approved label that it works with gsync or they will have the actual hardware gsync module Edit according to the article it seems that there will be no gsync hardware involved,,0.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtcm3pl,kritsku,,6,2025-05-20 19:36:53,,,,Bought my first 77 Samsung OLED last year Never again The menus UX decisions lag and remote control are shockingly bad And this wasnt a cheap TV My cheap 55 LG 13 years ago was so much better to interact with Modern LGs are no stellar UX specimens but at least theyre not infuriating to interact with It shocks me that no one talks about how insanely bad the Samsung UI is And yes having no Dolby Vision or DTS but including gsync is insane,,0.0,1kr3hyn
comment,mtdeofc,Lumpy_Pain27,,1,2025-05-20 22:01:00,,,,glad to see it coming to the flagship model now just hoping it rolls out to the rest of the line up without too much delay,,0.0,1kr3hyn
