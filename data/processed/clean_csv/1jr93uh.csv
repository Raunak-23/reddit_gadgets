comment,mlcthco,Funnygumby,,2525,2025-04-04 11:15:36,,,,Even if we start manufacturing gadgets here we will still need to import materials to build them Well need to pay a price to build them because Americans arent going to build them for 5 an hour and they will be more expensive than Americans are willing to pay Im all for bringing manufacturing back to the US but Americans will have to get used to paying much more than they are used to,,0.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlddq1s,hainguyenac,,307,2025-04-04 13:31:08,,,,Im not sure how it works on the international level but I think trust has been broken and its not coming back Sure the countries will negotiate and try to keep the trade with the US for a foreseeable future But in the long term they will diversify and rely on different trade partners China seems like a saint these days compared to the Trump USA,mlcy5xd,3.0,1jr93uh
comment,mldiplh,Both_Canary1508,,139,2025-04-04 13:59:03,,,,idk about yall but china is not exactly the best ally right now with my country Canada due to multiple reasons but most notably due to the fact we deported a Chinese citizen in Canada to the US for arrest several years ago and since then our relations have soured gradually They just executed a few Canadians last week for dealing drugs and when our government condemned the execution of Canadian citizens the Chinese government basically told us to go suck an egg and then imposed 100 tariffs on our canola oil not to say that trump is in anyway better just that china isnt exactly a safe ally right now either even for countries being attacked by trump Tarriffs have helped Canada build stronger relationships with a lot of other countries but china isnt one of them At least yet,mlddq1s,4.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlduwo1,luv2hotdog,,71,2025-04-04 15:01:20,,,,Australian here I feel like a lot of what trumps doing is based on an underlying assumption that well what are they gonna do about it Abandon us and turn to China Because realistically you cant turn to China either China is every bit as tenuous an ally as the US has become What team trump probably didnt dream could even be a consideration in other nations minds is what were hopefully seeing the beginnings of now ex US allies turning to each other instead of either US or China,mldiplh,5.0,1jr93uh

comment,mle0fi4,luv2hotdog,,10,2025-04-04 15:28:55,,,,Thats what it looks like from the outside too Feels like America is a sinking ship and every other nation is distancing itself as quickly and tactfully as it can I know Australia has been working hard on trade relations with other countries Hopefully something comes of it and has been working on general relations with other pacific countries ever since 2022 when the current govt got elected just so that we wouldnt be too badly wedged into a potential choose China or America situation We have to be extra careful China is our neighbour and a strong trading partner and for decades weve walked the line between were friendly enough for good tourism and trade and China is not the mind of country we want leading the world I cant see how the US situation is going to work out well for the US I cant imagine any easy ways out of the spot you guys are in,mldzb4q,7.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlg2fio,futuresdawn,,2,2025-04-04 21:47:33,,,,Also Australian and looking at America I dont know how America can remain one country after this The international damage to America trump has done will last for decades but the hatred the right has for the left just doesnt seem like it could be heeled beyond something so demonstrably awful happening that it forces people to unify,mldzb4q,7.0,1jr93uh

comment,mle4us6,Msk-XX,,1,2025-04-04 15:50:46,,,,Exactly Closer cooperation between places like Australia Japan South Korea Canada and the EU countries and probably some others is a nobrainer Everyone will still maintain some relationships with the US just not as closely or to the same extent Theyll leave the US to do its thing and move on with each other Clearly the US wants to withdraw become inwardlooking and keep largely to itself I think thats totally fine its their prerogative and the rest of the world should just respect that and move on Beyond the short term I dont see that as a problem,mlduwo1,6.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlfp674,TrineonX,,12,2025-04-04 20:36:09,,,,Fellow Canuck here China has the advantage of being much more predictable than the US at the very least We normally know why they do what they do and they are willing to work a deal that makes sense The Canola thing was a predictable response to vehicle import tariffs The two Michaels was a response to Meng Wanzou and they were released as soon as she was we never actually deported her to the US just required her to stay in Canada under supervision while the case was run through the courts The executions are unfortunate but the entire continent of Asia is pretty famous for having the death penalty for smugglers I dont see why Canadian citizenship should exempt you from that Their secret police stations on Canadian land is absolute horseshit though In short Canada and China dont have the best relationship but it is entirely the result of predictable tit for tat diplomatic stuff Most of the diplomatic stuff they have taken issue with is related to Canada acting on behalf of American interests China is more than willing to come to the table and work with us I would much rather have a rational trade partner that is good at long term planning than whatever the fuck is going on down south,mldiplh,5.0,1jr93uh

comment,mle0icr,bravosarah,,10,2025-04-04 15:29:18,,,,most notably due to the fact we deported a Chinese citizen in Canada to the US for arrest several years ago and since then our relations have soured gradually And we did this because Trump I asked us to We held her for 3 years at the request of the US because we are good neighbours She fought extradition here in Canada but it didnt matter the US made a deal with her and we were allowed to let her go ruining our relationship with China Trump screwed us royally,mldiplh,5.0,1jr93uh

comment,mleouk7,PageOthePaige,,43,2025-04-04 17:31:01,,,,Trumps tariff plan had no way of working Full stop it is a stupid plan produced by a stupid man The tariff situation only works if you have a monopoly on materials manufacturing AND customers kind of a monopsony In that situation you add a premium to interacting with your space because youre so far ahead of the curve and no one can afford not to The US economy has been dependent on international relations and movement for decades and cutting that off is economic suicide of the highest order Even if it internally stabilizes therell never be demand for others to be involved with that market because the US cannot outcompete the entire globe working together,mle021b,4.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlfo238,IGAldaris,,2,2025-04-04 20:30:24,,,,Depending on your intentions there are cases where protectionism via tariffs can work If you have a domestic manufacturing or ressource sector and you value having that more than overall lower prices then it can make sense to introduce tariffs to make the domestic option the overall more attractive choice But that approach is targeted and deliberate For example youre mining iron and coal and have a well developed steel industry Along comes the international market and offers that steel at lower prices Now a long term consequence would probably be your steel industry shrinking and eventually going under if they cant compete with those prices and your iron and coal mining might follow because the domestic demand for those will drop off along with that So you might introduce tariffs on foreign steel just enough to keep your industry domestically competitive and going Now you wont dominate the world market with that strategy but youll preserve jobs in those sectors and you might want a steel industry around for strategic reasons In that case it can make sense But you have to keep in mind that youre essentially taxing all your domestic steel users extra money to make that happen The danger is that other countries might reciprocate to fuck with your exports which endangers other industries So youre facing a choice how important is domestic coal iron and steel to you Are you willing to let your say textile industry take a hit to keep them around So depending on what you want to achieve targeted tariffs can make sense What doesnt make sense is saying free markets are for losers well hit everyone and everything when you have neither the ressource base nor the manufacturing base and then hope that desperation will make those things appear in sufficient quantity to make up for the shortfall,mle241o,7.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlnnt3r,Lokon19,,1,2025-04-06 05:30:00,,,,When you live further apart it necessitates the need for car ownership Cars are not artificially driving up costs and increasing GDP if you cannot afford a car in the first place That would be akin to some place in Africa where you would be walking instead if you lived further away Yes car prices will likely increase due to Trumps actions and US consumers will pay the price But the flip side of every equation is that the Europe also exports a lot of cars to the US which will now not be sold because they are too expensive This will inevitably also lead to job losses in Europe and European automakers will now have to make a decision on whether to move production to the US to placate Trump or accept the loss in sales and consequences of such This economic war that he has unleashed on the world has no winners but the reason it is causing a global shockwave is because the US is still the worlds preeminent economic superpower and cant be easily replaced,mlnn1c1,15.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlns1xa,None,,1,2025-04-06 06:08:47,,,,Yes it will lead to job losses in Europe that is a fact We export a lot to the US which itself doesnt produce all that much In the current politici and economic climate I dont see a lot of companies moving production to the US because the uncertainty caused by rapidly changing stances of the regime does not bode well It takes a long time and loads of money and effort to build new factories and it might be for naught if there are no parts and raw materials to build with US car dependency is not simply a matter of things being further apart because its big For long distances you travel by plane No the car dependency is built at the behest of oil companies who bought politicians There could have been living areas interlaced with commercial areas and thus also employment opportunities so that you can walk or ride a bicycle to work Instead they have endless suburbs with stroads Europe was going in the same direction in the 19601970s but people opposed that succesfully and were still cleaning up the scars You are not just going to have a car price hike but a car shortage,mlnnt3r,16.0,1jr93uh

comment,mldin0t,Netmantis,,2,2025-04-04 13:58:40,,,,What service jobs service international customers When looking at international trade there are precious few service jobs outside of real estate or finance And those require talent and education to do Not everyone has the talent to be successful and not everyone can afford or complete the education The median is a funny thing Once you start dealing with commission jobs the pay can skyrocket However just like OnlyFans not everyone is a success story Most barely scrape by or leave for non commission work with better base pay The median only looks at the midpoint of pay So if you have a million fast food employees and ten high power business executives the pay will be between the two but most wont ever see it The average will be lower but also still out of reach of the fast food workers The mean on the other hand will be the most common pay at the level of the workers not the executives,mldc01q,4.0,1jr93uh
comment,mldjrtn,Lokon19,,1,2025-04-04 14:04:47,,,,You have it backwards The mean will distort averages and the median is what gets you the truer average The US runs a 280B service trade surplus that is obviously going somewhere and not just to bankers and yes its true most service jobs probably cater towards domestic customers but everyone has to get their paycheck from somewhere And if you cherry pick the lowend like fast food workers of course the numbers are bad but most people arent fast food workers,mldin0t,5.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlghjbz,typeguyfiftytwix,,0,2025-04-04 23:17:20,,,,Yes a foreign country can impose worker standard restrictions and then have no method of enforcement and people like you can pretend you arent part of the problem Thats not how the real world works If we imposed US worker rights standards and were allowed to use the US marine corps to perform random factory inspections and prosecute or deny companies that are caught violating maybe But you really think a toothless agreement stops a country like China from employing child labor or treating its workers like shit despite all evidence to the contrary then youre either unimaginably naive or just in denial Throwing money at power structures and asking them to pretty please play nice doesnt work and never has Trade as a concept isnt bad Trade with bad actors can absolutely be bad This is not a novel concept If you sell arms to terrorists you are considered part of the problem If you buy from plantation owners that have slave labor you are considered part of the problem If you buy plastic bullshit from chinese factories you are still part of the problem We arent saving them from poverty by making them dependent on our buying their bullshit were perpetuating the systems that abuse them Youre a clown for pretending otherwise,mlgcmt2,8.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlgqvnl,306bobby,,1,2025-04-05 00:15:11,,,,A lot of people say this but lets say someone is trying to tariff to move manufacturing but intelligently unlike Trump Wouldnt you only tariff exported manufactured goods and not the raw material To then create manufacturing here and create a tradeline of raw in exported goods out I understand thats NOT whats happening just a hypothetical but logically a tariff would not be a blanket thing right,mlesccc,3.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlgs1es,lordreed,,2,2025-04-05 00:22:38,,,,Yes that is what you do Target the specific good like when it was about cars It made some sense to try to encourage local manufacturing by tariffing imports But it is completely bone headed to tariff both the finished goods and the raw materials because now even your local producers who rely on foreign raw materials will have to increase their prices making it a wortless move,mlgqvnl,4.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlhbx6a,PaulblankAgain,,1,2025-04-05 02:33:49,,,,First what we wouldve done if done smart was spend 1015 years building infrastructure and use government loans on the scale of 3050 years so its easy to pay back with super low rates Then yeah usually economics wise you want to import raw and export goods and you dont even need tariffs just free trade worked fine and is what made America the top dog in the first place But no never should you do blanket tariffs The only time it would be smart is for stuff that we already are producing and competition against it is fierce for American consumersconsumers of American goods Example say we make cars here for 20k and cars from country X makes cars for 16k and sells it here for 18k We decide we cant get our costs down so the best method then would be to impose tariffs on country Xs cars to put them more in line with American cars like a 1520 one This way you dont destroy the competition completely but you lessen the likeliness that cost is the factor that keeps customers loyal to that brand over an American one Competition is good for the consumer thats why monopolies are supposed to be illegal,mlgqvnl,4.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlf0zsj,bearsaysbueno,,1,2025-04-04 18:31:38,,,,Also since the tariffs dont really have a logic to them and werent done properly through Congress the tariffs dont have a predictable and stable foundation that companies need to rely on to make the investments in infrastructure tooling and training needed to bring manufacturing to the US which could take decades to pay back,mld6dkx,1.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlcyyme,swollennode,,240,2025-04-04 11:56:40,,,,Lets see 1 Building a factory takes years and a lot of money Who knows whats going to happen in 4 years Maybe the tariff stays maybe it goes away Companies are reluctant to build new factories if in 4 years tariffs go away or gets reduced Building a factory is going to be even more expensive when construction materials face tariff 2 manufacturing products still require sourcing parts and materials from outside the country So the tariff still gets passed on 3 manufacturing in the US is expensive,,0.0,1jr93uh

comment,mldgfdx,None,,1,2025-04-04 13:46:34,,,,Also other countries dont want to buy a lot of stuff from the US because its not healthy The kind of shit you find in US food products are simply prohibited elsewhere because they either fuck up your health or the environment,mlcxjb2,1.0,1jr93uh
comment,mldo5ax,Korvun,,-6,2025-04-04 14:27:35,,,,I dont disagree with you but youve oversimplified your claim here other countries dont buy from US because they do not need stuffs from US It isnt that other countries dont need what we sell its that other counties tariff the shit out of US imported goods so theyre very much more expensive so theres no incentive for them to not just buy the cheaper local product In addition to that many US made products arent the same abroad because there are restrictions on US products being made from certain ingredients Take Kraft Macaroni Cheese for example In the US its made with Yellow 5 In the EU thats illegal to use so it doesnt contain it So not only does Kraft need to have a separate product to sell to the EU that meets their regulatory standards which is more expensive theyre also tariffed so a pack of 5 that runs about 5 here in the US is about 16 in the EU thats almost 18 USD Why would anyone bother paying more than 3x the price when they can buy a European alternative Knorr KäseSahneKräuter being the more common options at just under 2 a pack,mlcxjb2,1.0,1jr93uh
comment,mle7q9t,DoopSlayer,,4,2025-04-04 16:05:06,,,,I dont see how your math adds up for the mac and cheese Krafts Mac is HS 19021140 prior to all this both the US and EU applied 64 tariff on it maybe youre looking at the cost of some specialty import of american goods rather than mass produced pasta,mldo5ax,2.0,1jr93uh

comment,mleq3bw,Korvun,,1,2025-04-04 17:37:04,,,,I didnt say it was And its not from a novelty shop The price is the same on the DE Amazon site I only said the prices for US goods are more expensive and that tariffed price increases are a factor in the increased price which in turn is a factor for why Europeans tend not to purchase US goods The fact that you yourself would call US goods a novelty in European stores only supports that claim,mleo51f,5.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlijx7m,Korvun,,0,2025-04-05 09:12:39,,,,My point was that they dont need our stuff is too simplistic an argument and I used a single food item as an example There are many more examples not related to food So while you again say its lower quality that is a subjective opinion not related to the price of the product Otherwise yes we are in agreement,mlidjso,9.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlmfsl1,btodoroff,,2,2025-04-06 00:12:21,,,,This is laughably disconnected from reality of how pricing really works A tech product like a laptop or cellphone is lucky to get a 3540 margin on landed cost So your 20 product would have a landed cost of 12 and an adder of 6 so a 30 increase But you are also wrong on how companies price items Established tech company valuations are largely influenced by margin not just absolute revenue So the starting point is to take the tariff and increase the price change to maintain the product margin So the 6 tariff would start with a price increase of about 10 so that the margin stays the same Now we are at a 50 increase Now the company has a harder time selling a high end phone that went from 1000 to 1500 dollars compared to a budget phone that went from 500 to 750 So they have to cut the price to compete to say to 1200 Now they have to make up that 300 per phone somewhere else to keep their operating margin in control so they have to cut expenses elsewhere in the company Manufacturing costs are already squeezed mercilessly so there is little blood from that stone So they end up laying off mostly customer service janitorial warehouse employees HR retail accounting and other functions that dont directly generate new products Unemployment goes up in these lower earning sectors so the wages stagnate In the end the cost of the device goes up and the buying power of the middle class and lower earners goes down So the device that used to require 25 hours of middle class labor now requires 3540 hours of labor Since people cant manufacture more hours their standard of living has to go down either through less buying or 2nd job to make up for the real cost of the tariff Meanwhile back in China they still sell each phone for the same price and make the same margin and the buyers pay the tariff,mldfeuo,2.0,1jr93uh

comment,mlgc2pn,99hoglagoons,,1,2025-04-04 22:44:24,,,,Apples cost of revenue is roughly in the 4050 range in comparison to total revenue A lot of stuff goes in the first bucket I pulled the ratio out of my butt for illustrative purposes If you have insider info on actual numbers that are not publicly available maybe best to shush now My much bigger point was about actual impact of tariffs on total cost of hardware This seems pretty uninteresting to anyone Reddit is for soapboxing Oh well,mlg8gog,3.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlgdlin,onan,,3,2025-04-04 22:53:35,,,,Youve now pulled out a different number and its still a wildly incorrect one Apples COGS for 2024 was 2104B and revenue was 391B So we start at 54 However those are companywide numbers 77 of Apples revenue is from hardware which will account for nearly all of their COGS So their actual cost for hardware is around 70 70 hardware cost is a whole different universe from the 10 of your claim and your madeup example My much bigger point was about actual impact of tariffs on total cost of hardware This seems pretty uninteresting to anyone Id say its quite interesting its just that your point was largely incorrect Apples costs may go up by only 70 of the 3446 tariffs but that is still a huge increase and not the trivial rounding error that you suggest,mlgc2pn,4.0,1jr93uh
comment,mlgh6kl,99hoglagoons,,1,2025-04-04 23:15:11,,,,I appreciate a more thoughtful response from you but cost of raw components is not 70 either There are sub 300 new phones out there that still make a profit on sale You pay premium for latest cutting edge but these numbers are ultimately fungible as well Apple for instance controls their own chip production Android devices that pay premium for latest and greatest Snapdragon are ultimately paying for RD that is part of the gross price These costs can further be broken down and will get broken down for accounting purposes In terms of raw materials there is nothing different between a budget and premium phone,mlgdlin,5.0,1jr93uh
