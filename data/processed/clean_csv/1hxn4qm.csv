comment,m6eqoky,huhwhatnogoaway,,2,2025-01-10 14:48:51,,,,Actually life has never given you lemons Lemons were created when humans began cultivating fields They crossed many species either on purpose or by accident They brought two plants one of which was itself a human made hybrid together and they either cross pollinated themselves or humans did it intentionally but that resulting plant gave the world lemons They were rightfully rejected at first because sour but some weird people out there likes sours stuff and started using it So no life never gave us lemons Were fucked,m6arwnu,2.0,1hxn4qm
comment,m6girj9,Kronoshifter246,,2,2025-01-10 20:02:36,,,,Despite the fact that humanity gave life lemons plants are weird enough about cross breeding that lemons could have come into existence on their own eventually To paraphrase another discussion I saw on the matter on Reddit citrus trees could have absolutely plantfucked their way into lemons,m6eqoky,3.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6juop1,Octrooigemachtigde,,1,2025-01-11 08:59:34,,,,No the US moved away from a first to invent system to a first inventor to file system But regardless if the invention is disclosed to the public before the filing date of the priority patent application the claims will not be novel and a patent will not be granted for those claims An exception in specifically the US is the oneyear grace period during which it is still possible to file a patent application if the inventor made the public disclosure This does however mean that for eg a European patent application you do have to deal with your own noveltydestroying public disclosure,m6eteqf,4.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6tou0l,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-12 22:42:16,,,,One thing I have also seen is that some deals with other countries eg Germany Egypt worked out to like 1M per missile Though I do think they are much more modern versions than those from 1980 US approves 740m sale of Stinger missiles to Egypt The US State Departments decision enhances Egypts defence power amid ongoing regional tensions The US State Department has approved the sale of 720 Stinger missiles to Egypt a move intended to strengthen ties with a Middle Eastern ally But hey Im fine with that Maybe other countries can subsidize US military equipment like US healthcare costs subsidizes everyone elses prescription drugs,m6ti7ga,8.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6cqxym,cyanescens_burn,,4,2025-01-10 04:44:06,,,,Interesting point I had wondered if they didnt want to upgrade these systems due to needing to take them offline in order to do so which is a vulnerability like getting caught in a fire fight with your pants down But this makes more sense,m6bj8ir,5.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6fiwdd,VexingRaven,,1,2025-01-10 17:09:55,,,,Im not convinced that onboard AI is to the point where something with such a limited number of bombs could successfully fly ahead of an offensive and identify concealed dugin troops and bomb them with a high enough success rate to be worth the added expense and the added value to the enemy if captured Radio is line of sight mostly Youd just keep it in the air And I wouldnt be at all surprised if they are using larger fixedwing drones for radio jamming perhaps alongside surveillance capabilities Dont need AI for that weve had drones that can fly themselves in a pattern for years Radio jamming of all sorts is very prevalent in this war,m6felsv,6.0,1hxn4qm
comment,m6gbqy5,Particular_Treat1262,,1,2025-01-10 19:28:23,,,,2 points A drone like this would likely have redundancies such as self destructing physically and digitally if downed or otherwise caught similarly to how most wonder weapons are strictly ordered to be scuttled in the event it cannot be recovered Any gunfire that destroys such a drone would either destroy enough of it that data such as ai isnt salvageable or doesnt destroy it enough so that it is still pinging a signal wether SOS or basic telemetry data Trying to capture such a small drone would be an arguably larger risk as it would basically double as a beacon for a missile strike or secondary drone assault We would have to assume the AI is also easy to reverse engineer the drones body wouldnt be anything remarkable most drones are similar in design as it is and are fundamentally useless without a proper doctrine and number of them which is the same reason we arent panicked by the Russian captured western tanks we arent going to see Russia revamping their entire military structure to facilitate them in the next decade at least at which point they are even more outdated then they currently are Plugging a piece of enemy software into your RD equipment is also a massive security risk that might STILL be even more compromising then a command based ai being captured Backload software that ransoms destroys steals data from unauthorised systems or simply pings itself for an air strike If the systems to do this are in place then the systems to protect it must also be or its useless tech A while back there was a squadron of soldiers using robot dogs are intel support if separated the dogs would lay down and enter a low power surveillance mode We dont hear about these things until they have already happened all either of us can do is speculate and wonder,m6fiwdd,7.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6bn6jo,homingconcretedonkey,,-4,2025-01-10 00:48:52,,,,Theres a lot more you need to do with weapons then what is capable with facial recognition Facial recognition implies you have enough resolution to see a face and you cant add too many cameras because of the processing required The reason why AI is useful is that it can look through one camera and make a determination to shoot or not without needing enough resolution for facial recognition We dont yet have cameras that perform well enough in low light or no light especially at longer distances and a night vision setup has a lot of downsidesproblems,m6bi9yg,2.0,1hxn4qm
comment,m6byi7t,JaggedMetalOs,,4,2025-01-10 01:52:02,,,,Facial recognition implies you have enough resolution to see a face and you cant add too many cameras because of the processing required Weve had facial recognition algorithms that work on CCTV camera feeds for a long time maybe even over a decade The reason why AI is useful is that it can look through one camera and make a determination to shoot or not without needing enough resolution for facial recognition That sounds like a terrible idea,m6bn6jo,3.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6flchh,SmashShock,,8,2025-01-10 17:21:44,,,,Not sure if this is a hot take but what he did is both completely impractical and easy to accomplish Its just a pantilt mechanism that uses ChatGPT to translate humandescribed patterns into machine patterns Human describes pattern it gives pattern output in a GCODElike format ChatGPT cant see anything Even if it was getting passed frames from the camera ChatGPT is not yet able to determine specific coordinates in an image for targeting Even if we were able to get specific coordinates from the image latency would be way too high to control the platform directly The reason its so popular is because a layperson doesnt understand that this provides literally zero utility as a defensive or offensive platform Another way to put it is if you wanted to make this a practical autonomous gun system the first step youd take is to remove ChatGPT The mode where it follows the balloons is already not controlled by ChatGPT its a computer vision model running locally Heres how what you see in the video works What ChatGPT sees as instructions You are ChatGPT Here are the GCODElike commands you are allowed to generate and what they do G1 Xvalue Yvalue Move the pantilt mechanism to the specified coordinates X Pan Range is 90 to 90 degrees 0 is the midpoint Y Tilt Range is 45 to 45 degrees 0 is the midpoint G4 Ptime Pause for the specified time in milliseconds M1 Activate the trigger mechanism G0 Return to the home position X0 Y0 When provided with a human command describing a desired motion or action generate the appropriate sequence of GCODE commands What the user gives as input Can you move to 25 degrees then sweep across the field of fire stopping every 5 degrees to fire one round you should also have some variation in the pitch What ChatGPT gives as output G1 X25 Y0 G4 P100 M1 G1 X20 Y5 G4 P100 M1 G1 X15 Y5 G4 P100 M1 G1 X10 Y10 G4 P100 M1 G1 X5 Y10 G4 P100 M1 G1 X0 Y5 G4 P100 M1 G1 X5 Y5 G4 P100 M1 G1 X10 Y10 G4 P100 M1 G1 X15 Y10 G4 P100 M1 G1 X20 Y5 G4 P100 M1 G1 X25 Y5 G4 P100 M1 The result The turret starts at X25 Y0 pan 25 with neutral tilt It sweeps across the field of fire stopping every 5 degrees in the pan direction Each stop introduces some variation in pitch tilt alternating between values within the defined range 45 to 45 degrees At each stop it pauses briefly 100 ms and fires one round Transformer models like ChatGPT could potentially be used in target identification giving a gonogo to an actual realtime model that controls the position and firing That is not happening here Here the model is being used to directly output the fire solution which accomplishes none of what the public is concerned about this for AIcontrolled guns OpenAI took action not because they believe this is a real concern but because laypeople cant tell the difference and it reflects poorly on them,,0.0,1hxn4qm

comment,m6f1bbw,Desperate-Depth-1790,,2,2025-01-10 15:44:16,,,,The technologies are very different Your character is part of the game the game knows exactly where your character is at all times and could kill whenever it wanted The game actively limits itself to give the player the illusion of choice The game doesnt need to see where the target is it will always know because the character is generated and put there by the game Unless there is a bug the characters are always predictable because they can only do what the game allows them to do The AI on the other hand needs to undertand external inputs that it cannot control eg the gun the servos and specially targets which can actually be very unpredictable TLTR videogames are not real life,m6eqrwg,1.0,1hxn4qm
