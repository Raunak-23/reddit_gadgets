comment,mba11nv,nerdthatlift,,219,2025-02-06 11:58:03,,,,They would do really good if their launch wont be a paper launch and have cards available at said launch I would switch to Team Red because Im sick of Nvidia BS marketing and scarcity of products launch,,0.0,1iizw86
comment,mbgd712,andrejlr,,20,2025-02-07 09:56:19,,,,People constantly say that but then somebody always byus this insane priced Nvidia GPUs and their price only knows one direction Most used GPUs on steam are all below rtx 30xx There is no need for this AI generated crap and also no need to give studios incentive to ship unomptimized games with shit ton of not needed shaders which increase GPU load and add nothing to graphics Supply and Demand rule the market Nerd gamers made PC platform unaffordable Ill buy some last gen GPU on release of this gen and I fear this was my last build Its not master race anymore its FOMO race,mba11nv,1.0,1iizw86
comment,mbmmihp,Accentu,,3,2025-02-08 08:13:18,,,,I got my 6950 XT on sale combined with a moboCPURAM combo No regrets Its not great at ray tracing and certain applications like those that require pytorch dont work well with it but overall thats small potatoes for my use cases I probably wont be upgrading anytime soon given general world events but Im all for seeing more competition for Nvidia,mbgd712,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mcffc45,dave55man,,2,2025-02-12 20:28:22,,,,I mean this recent NVIDIA debacle has already made me switch to Team Red The fact that nothing of the 50 series is available on top of the meager performance gains for the 5080 caused me to go and buy a 7900 XTX instead Im hopeful that AMD will continue to undercut NVIDIA and deliver great video cards to us because now is their chance to start taking back market share They managed to come back with their CPUs lets see if they can do the same with their GPUs,mbgd712,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mbmow17,onemightypersona,,2,2025-02-08 08:36:31,,,,I went all AMD this time and honestly Im considering selling the GPU I know NVIDIA is not great And I know my experience is limited and my sample size is one But my Gigabyte 2060 never had any coil whine and never crashed And my Sapphire Radeon RX 7900 XTX is crashing all the time and has insane coil whine Crashes all the fing time on Windows but not on Linux so its certainly a driver issue So here we are,mba11nv,1.0,1iizw86

comment,mbax27g,LePouletMignon,,71,2025-02-06 15:12:15,,,,I mean dont people get tired of this argument There was something wrong with RDNA 3 so RDNA 4 will be the REAL RDNA 3 Its literally the same argument every single generation Its kind of getting old at this point,mb9v186,1.0,1iizw86

comment,mbbfmn3,GrayDaysGoAway,,9,2025-02-06 16:40:01,,,,Yep fuck that noise Anybody still expecting AMD to make a competitive GPU at any point in the foreseeable future is being very willfully naive Even IF they can catch up on raw performance and thats a huge if their tech will still be years and years behind the curve,mbax27g,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mbfeygh,cat_prophecy,,-7,2025-02-07 04:48:11,,,,People have forever been arguing that AMD cards will be good eventually The fact is that the only reason youd buy one is because you cantwont buy a Nvidia card They arent the performance leader even in their price brackets Like why buy an AMD card when you can buy a Nvidia card for slightly more money with better performance,mbbfmn3,3.0,1iizw86
comment,mbfh0we,Jra805,,9,2025-02-07 05:02:27,,,,I mean lately that isnt really true though Cost of 40 and 50 series cards are sky rocketing right now I bought an AMD card because it was so much cheaper for basically the same as a 4070,mbfeygh,4.0,1iizw86
comment,mbkz9kv,ElJanitorFrank,,1,2025-02-08 01:12:38,,,,I just dont find this to be true Last card I bought was a RX 7900 GRE which MSRPs at cheaper than a 4070 Super and exceeds it in performance across the board pulling significantly ahead at higher resolutions,mbfeygh,4.0,1iizw86
comment,mbb329p,psykofreak87,,-3,2025-02-06 15:41:22,,,,Je suis bien daccord mon Poulet Ive watched a video saying RDNA3 had problems with the new GPU layout and drivers etc so perf wasnt met as planned Now RDNA4 is just a RDNA 35 and we should wait for UDNA Either way my 6800xt does the job for me I have rly good 1080p screens and I dont plan to upgrade to 1440p yet I tend to keep stuff for a long time When I need to upgrade Ill go with whichever is the best for me and for my wallet blue red or green,mbax27g,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mbcg50z,Subduction_Zone,,-3,2025-02-06 19:27:26,,,,Well the argument is true RDNA12 were made on the same process and RDNA 34 are being made on the same process Something was very clearly wrong with RDNA1 AMD ought to have been able to crush the 2080ti on TSMC 7nm easily but the large die was cancelled They ended up making good GPUs on 7nm with RDNA2 but by then it was too late to compete against Turing Something was also very clearly wrong with RDNA3 the 7800XT only matches the 6800XT despite having higher clocks and being made on a superior process and the 7900XTX fell short of their initial performance claims Remains to be seen if RDNA4 will deliver a good GPU on TSMC 5nm,mbax27g,2.0,1iizw86

comment,mbc0zzr,Bluedot55,,1,2025-02-06 18:18:21,,,,Eh you can have a new lineup that has improvements even if it doesnt push the high end any higher Like the 4090 wasnt any faster then sli 3090s at least in the 2 games or whatever that supported them but it was still overall better If they improve the price to performance and have other things like improved rt and a better upscaler then its still solid Not many people get the top tier cards of the generation A generational improvement of the mid tier stuff is a solid leap for them,mb9v186,1.0,1iizw86

comment,mbbs1oa,sorrylilsis,,4,2025-02-06 17:37:01,,,,Because that 10 of the business is way less profitable than the AIcompute part And developing it further cuts into the resources needed to develop and produce new AIcompute products The thing is that those two lines are very much in competition with each other and this is a zero sum game,mbav6s9,3.0,1iizw86
comment,mbdd16m,MetalstepTNG,,3,2025-02-06 21:58:12,,,,They made 26 billion for 2024 for their graphics card segment out of 258 billion in revenue Thats over 10 of their total revenue alone Theyre not going to leave that much money on the table if they think they can chase that level of sales again when they made over 6 billion dollars from GPUs the year prior,mbbs1oa,4.0,1iizw86
comment,mbfio78,Derp00100,,4,2025-02-07 05:14:12,,,,I think the problem isnt the revenue i think its more so the actual profit they make themselves on these cards Why make a 2000 msrp gpu when you can just make a 10k20k ai card and have way more profit,mbdd16m,5.0,1iizw86
comment,mbg7gjp,sorrylilsis,,3,2025-02-07 08:56:14,,,,Yup simple as this So long as the production capacity is the bottleneck GPU and accelerators are competing for silicon And one of the two can be sold for more than the other Not sure why so people dont seem to realise that supply of high end chips is very much limited right now,mbfio78,6.0,1iizw86
comment,mbikojy,MetalstepTNG,,1,2025-02-07 17:57:59,,,,Because demand isnt unlimited If it were that easy they wouldnt be reselling binned chips or have a gaming segment at all,mbfio78,6.0,1iizw86

comment,mbdeiqf,GrayDaysGoAway,,15,2025-02-06 22:05:10,,,,Because raw performance isnt everything Nvidias software like DLSS makes their cards punch way above their weight Buying an AMD GPU is settling for a notably inferior product and the price should reflect that,mbddc87,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mbeb32k,tastyratz,,3,2025-02-07 00:54:51,,,,You get a lot more with nvidia than raw fps If you can only compete on the fps you need to price out the value of all the other things the card can do Not having that dlss RTX performance ROCM support etc all has a value There is a different way nvidia cards are well rounded with other full developed supported and used technologies you dont get with AMD I love my AMD cards but I recognize its not the same product even if it has the same FPS,mbddc87,2.0,1iizw86
comment,mbdmxge,KalashnikittyApprove,,1,2025-02-06 22:46:03,,,,How does that argument make sense Pragmatism Unless you already have an AMD card Im not sure what would tempt a lot of people away from Nvidia if the pitch is same performance for the same price Might as well stick with Nvidia,mbddc87,2.0,1iizw86

comment,mba9mwv,scummos,,5,2025-02-06 13:00:49,,,,Eh let me counter this a lot of the pixel enthusiasts dont understand the real difference either 4k video vs FHD video isnt the relevant comparison if one is five times as large youd need to use the same bit rate with the same codec to encode both of them But this isnt what usually happens the 4k video is much larger and thus much higher quality The amount of pixels is very rarely the limiting factor for the visual quality of content on screens But advertisements and technical choices to push those eg youtube seems to use better codecs for 4k content have misled people into associating things with higher resolution which actually arent causally related to it,mba8c7b,2.0,1iizw86
