comment,mp6n59e,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,1,2025-04-26 18:12:07,,,,Every search engine sucks ass at roughly the same level though Google has absolutely no qualitative advantage any more and they pack in more and more ads as well as rank search results according to how well paid they are Bing doesnt do as much manipulation with the rankings and Duckduckgo just gives a couple of basic keyword ads without profiling you SEO has just ruined the traditional search engine so its functionally nothing but basic keyword searches while Google has turned their algorithm away from serving users and focused it completely on advertising I use DDG and Brave search and theyre fine for keyword searches Honestly just about the only thing these LLM AI chatbots are good for is search With a little practice you can quickly get them to help filter the wheat from the chaff and give clear useful search results like Google used to For now The enshittification cycle will come for them too and I expect advertisers will adapt SEO for the AI age by using their own AIs to pollute ChatGPT and Copilot results with crap too But for now they work pretty well as search engine replacements Im partial to Copilot in particular mainly because I use it extensively for work so Im familiar with its little quirks,mp6kbdw,5.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4y5df,purplegreendave,,1,2025-04-26 12:40:10,,,,Google is still the only search engine that can put a date beside results When Im looking for problem with x piece of software or best product y value for money I like to choose results from the last 12 months if possible not 10 years ago which could be irrelevant The first one to do it will make me try to switch,mp401uq,6.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp46ekm,ShatterSide,,1,2025-04-26 08:33:22,,,,Alright Ill look into it thanks I will say I would be concerned about EU censoring policies Sometimes I try duckduckgo to find a PDF of a book or an ISO standard or something that I need quickly and briefly Some search engines more aggressively block possible copyright infringing sites,mp401uq,6.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp4kx7k,Muslim_Wookie,,2,2025-04-26 10:59:21,,,,I will say I would be concerned about EU censoring policies What are you referring to can you expand on this I will be really honest with you about the root of my question I dont really believe that theres some untoward censoring policies so I want to know what you are talking about,mp46ekm,7.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp4oik0,ShatterSide,,3,2025-04-26 11:29:48,,,,Well I suppose sometimes its largely a feeling based in anecdotal experience other times its absolutely evidence based For similar search terms Google and other big names tend to not find what Im looking for for a variety of reasons primary of course that its not a web page selling things that Im looking for If I search a document or book name or ISBN or an ISO standard with pdf for example I am less likely to get what I need with some search engines Additionally the EU more aggressively blocks sharing sites like Libgen and torrent sites and mirrors in general Does this all apply automatically to search engines No I suppose not But an EU based service is going to be MUCH more likely to comply with laws or legal threats than one situated elsewhere I could be offbase here and I dont claim what I say is 100 true Just a concern consideration as I stated above,mp4kx7k,8.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp52kku,Muslim_Wookie,,-1,2025-04-26 13:09:05,,,,I vehemently disagree with your reasoning I see that as a government actually doing its job and taking care of people If something is blocked due to copyright and it shouldnt be I am with you But is that up to the government to decide on and selectively enforce I dont think so It should be up to the people to do their best to vote in government that makes better copyright laws specifically ones that dont bend over for US corporate interests Because thats the root of the problems you are describing various international agreements in which US corporate interests are enforced on the sovereign citizens of other nations So to me that screams of irony and hypocrisy If I search a document or book name or ISBN or an ISO standard with pdf for example I am less likely to get what I need with some search engines This is also completely anecdotal and I would ask you to actually prove it but you will of course and frankly I would say rightly so say that you dont want to go to the effort to do a proper study to prove something on Reddit Obviously though that gives me no reason to do anything other than dismiss that statement of yours as anecdotal nothing Honestly its incredible to me that you cite this No I suppose not But an EU based service is going to be MUCH more likely to comply with laws or legal threats than one situated elsewhere Corporations SHOULD be complying with laws This is so topsy turvy my goodness PEOPLE UPVOTED THAT STATEMENT What in the world,mp4oik0,9.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp86i3o,ShatterSide,,2,2025-04-26 23:16:39,,,,First of all I am not trying to convince anyone of anything I expressed my concerns with my usecase Second I did not complain that governments enforced copyright law or anything of the sort although copyright law needs an overhaul in general but thats a different story Third its a slippery slope to censor and block services and freedom of speech in general Think of the children and Protect the children are two arguments commonly used to push political idealist agendas and more dangerously censor ANY information the government doesnt want out there Once that avenue is open its going to be difficult as hell to prevent abuse You better trust the government a whole lot In the USA right now there is record little trust in the government All this has never been more relevant than it is right now This is the difference between treating the internet as a utility vs a service Or users as a customer vs as the product My usecase is my own Im not telling you how to live your life,mp52kku,10.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp9bso5,Muslim_Wookie,,1,2025-04-27 03:42:37,,,,Its not a slippery slope at all You can actually put reasonable and strong safeguards in place for it That you use the situation in the USA to back your view here is crazy given those checks and balances have proven to be worthless So Id rather trust in the government and have those reasonable protections for the vulnerable of society combined with the reasonable and strong safeguards against those protections being extended to the stifling of a free society until such time as when I cant and need to take to the streets about it That you ignored the point that you are complaining that EU corporations are much more likely to comply with laws than a corporation elsewhere is very concerning,mp86i3o,11.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mpac5r0,ShatterSide,,1,2025-04-27 09:23:34,,,,Didnt mean to ignore that point apologies The EU is often overly restrictive Its as simple as that really I love Europe dont get me wrong I think Europe has a lot to teach the rest of the work I love the GDRP I love how it seems generally citizens firsti think consumer protection is generally unmatched I consume information A lot Of all types What if my queries and searches would benefit most from not having a well behaved walled garden Well then Im going to go with a search engine that I would trust to provide unaltered responses I didnt complain that EU corps would obey laws but rather that I would prefer to use a service that I would expect to be less restrictive Lets try an analogy Content a government wishes to restrict is not going anywhere There is an argument for legalizing pot simply because then it reduces the illegal logistics behind Less exposure to other drugs or criminals etc A bit exteme of an analogy I admit I thought about deleting it but Ill leave it I would prefer the internet to be treated as a utility I would prefer legal action be taken against indidual sites and users I would prefer not adding useless friction and annoyance for a user,mp9bso5,12.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4fdos,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,12,2025-04-26 10:05:34,,,,No the solution is to replace them with products that dont depend on the cloud Products with open protocol specifications that you can integrate with home assistant say where home assistant talks directly to those devices locally via Ethernet WiFi zigbee whatever without the internet or other peoples servers the cloud being involved Its better for security and privacy too,mp3hq8k,3.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp56cb7,Foygroup,,2,2025-04-26 13:32:29,,,,I agree with you Id rather not be dependent on the cloud for any of it But what products do you suggest that would cover that Can you suggest a brands to start looking into with all the features,mp4fdos,4.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp5hgo8,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,2,2025-04-26 14:35:57,,,,Unfortunately I have no idea as I tend to just DIY such stuff but that probably isnt for you My smart themostat is an ESP8266 with an I2C temperature sensor connected to it maybe 3 EUR total that feeds temperature data via WiFi to my home server which in turn is connected to the CAN bus of my heat pump and which runs software that I wrote that uses that temperature data and a bunch of other information to control the heat pump That works great and involves no external servers whatsoever but its probably not for you if you dont know how to use a soldering iron and stuff Though I guess that home assistant might be a good starting point they probably have a lot of information about which devices work with home assistant and whether they rely on the cloud or work via a completely local connection Its maybe not quite plugandplay but should be accessible without much prior knowledge,mp56cb7,5.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp6egoo,Foygroup,,2,2025-04-26 17:28:13,,,,Thanks for the info but I am quite handy We took our 80s house gutted and redid the electrical plumbing HVAC all the walls and floors down to joists and studs All done by my wife and I Currently working on the last couple rooms Tiling the bathroom as we speak Unfortunately everything in the house is reliant on the cloud SmartThings Nest Google its all tied together I can solder with the best of them I am a telecom engineer by trade but grew up building houses as a family business So nothing you mentioned is not doable The question is just getting it on a platform we can support long term,mp5hgo8,6.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp25k8d,pmjm,,7,2025-04-25 23:40:33,,,,Some of the hardware in those thermostats includes modules from TI STMicro etc all of which would prevent Google from opensourcing the firmware They do publish the source for the portions of the Linux kernel and Gnu tools that they are required to,mp1uiok,1.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp9drdu,306bobby,,1,2025-04-27 03:57:06,,,,Google has been pretty good at open sourcing device trees see all Nexus and Pixels within AOSP Updating the OS these nest thermostats run should only require the compiled blobs from the modules mentioned You shouldnt need the source code to update how the software side functions ETA likely these old thermostats still have similarities to the new ones that would open them up to exploitation I could see that as a definite reason for Google to keep the door shut Dont want the latest and greatest nest to have custom firmware that prevents Google from tracking you,mp25k8d,2.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp9q8v7,pmjm,,1,2025-04-27 05:41:34,,,,Thats a fair point about exploits The counterargument is that those exploits can be patched by the opensource community but the counter argument to that is that the vast majority of people will never install or even become aware of unofficial updates and exposing the source could do more harm than good,mp9drdu,3.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mpai467,306bobby,,1,2025-04-27 10:26:17,,,,I dont mean exploits as security vulnerability but exploit as in oh this model thats just released has similar hardware as this one that has its source available I bet we can build a functional source early right now which would allow the nerds of the world to strip the Google from the Google from release,mp9q8v7,4.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4db3t,Plati23,,1,2025-04-26 09:44:25,,,,While I agree with you wholeheartedly the problem is that these companies have no motivation to do things like that when theyre internationally creating the obsolescence Their goal is to send you out to buy a new one and giving users ways to keep it with the same or better functionality flys in the face of those goals,mp1uiok,1.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4k8zh,Kresche,,1,2025-04-26 10:53:18,,,,This would be a sick EU Consumer Protection mandate Companies releasing products as closed source is fine so long as when the hardware is no longer able to sustain with a live service all code that runs on the hardware itself must be l released within that same year of discontinuing said software service connection to the hardware It just solves so much heartache pain and waste And creates jobs and market opportunities for those willing to use the code and step in Af far as security which is a real concern the way to counter that argument is simply that obfuscation isnt a valid security method Given this truth it isnt much of a stretch to deem arguments formed to defend stopping the release of this code as extensions of code obfuscation Thats because the code will never be patched anyways going forward so any claim of danger is ignoring the fact that defacto code function can be sourced manually over time by any bad actors anyways So simply specifying a time not greater than 1 year before the code is released should be enough to technically appease that crowd anyways after which time the real code would be released This does not require the online service code and it shouldnt Just the code that is existing on the hardware along with any extra code required to communicate with that hardware Like secret internal keys meant to stop the change of code on the hardware by non company action which would be a moot security point by the time such services are canceled Am I missing anything obvious here,mp1uiok,1.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp4qezc,LazaroFilm,,1,2025-04-26 11:44:39,,,,It should be law that if you stop supporting your hardware you have to release the source code This would stop planned obsolescence pretty quickly And if you dont want to release it because of IP then keep on supporting it,mp1uiok,1.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp1x7bu,Finnman1983,,42,2025-04-25 22:53:06,,,,They do this with smartphones already They may not be able to perfectly forecast but they can set a reasonable maximum to set consumer expectations Also provide a more modular interface to replace products on the wall that doesnt require an electrician or some comfort with wiring in the home Could there not be a local server solution literally just a device in a closed environment over LANWifi that continue to operate automated functions globally across devices in the home at the users own riskdiscretion Do the benefits of smart devices outweigh the mounting issues of consumerism trash pollution etc I say that as someone who upgrades his mobile device often so Im not claiming to be perfect But at least with a mobile device I can continue to use many of its basic or even web based functions long past any security support,mp1vgjm,4.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp2omzc,Marston_vc,,2,2025-04-26 01:32:52,,,,I think the industry is mature enough at this point to have a pretty good idea of when theyll be sunsetting products like this Especially with smart appliances like this where the company is no longer putting out the best product they can but rather a purposefully nerfed product that they know they can release a better version of next year with the smallest technical improvement Apple is infamous with this Google Amazon and other tech companies are no better with their own appliances,mp1vgjm,4.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4hxxa,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2025-04-26 10:31:22,,,,Cyber security needs change continually after a physical item ships That is sortof bullshit For one its not a law of nature that software in devices must have vulnerabilities A lot of that is just the result of bad software development practices that businesses have no incentive to fix because they can use the vulnerabilities to sell support and updates and replacements Its not possible I dont mean feasible under the iron thumb of ruthless capitalism I mean possible update obsolete tech indefinitely That is pretty much bullshit too I mean maybe not indefinitely but certainly much longer than they do So 30 years would be perfectly possible and would be close enough to indefinitely in practice for many products Every new model release would necessitate commitment to support and integrate with those changing cyber security needs There are no changing cyber security needs More precisely Most vulnerability fixes are just fixes of broken code or hardcoded credentials Those were vulnerabilities when the product was released not the result of some changing need The one big area where that might not be quite true is crypography where faults in protocols or primitives get discovered and thus those need to be replaced However for one that field has matured a lot and the current generation of protocols and primitives can generally be considered pretty reliable But also its just software and software that is generally not particularly specific to the respective hardware so its not really that hard to update anyway The major shift in that area was the shift away from clear text communication to encryption which required more processing power in devices to handle and thus couldnt really be done with an update But for one one could argue that manufacturers dragged their feet on that so we could have had that much earlier instead of needing to replace everything but more importantly That is behind us All new devices do have the processing power So changng details of the cryptography used is much more feasible But also part of the solution here too is local control If your device only talks to your local home assistant instance then cyber security is much less critical than if it directly talks to the public internet And its better for privacy And the product cant be obsoleted by the manufacturer switching off their server And its much easier to apply security updates for home assistant should those be necessary,mp1s156,2.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp9fo7g,306bobby,,1,2025-04-27 04:11:47,,,,I disagree The product should be able to connect to a local endpoint such as HA It can turn off all cloud access for the reasons you describe and enable some sort of ufw rule to block all traffic except the one server you select locally if any else its just a dumb device That way the option still exists to have a smart feature set without relying on the company whatsoever There are products designed like that from the beginning with no obsolescence worries whatsoever besides software support within things like Home Assistant,mp1s156,2.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp40z4x,whattareddit,,1,2025-04-26 07:38:54,,,,I posted a list of grievances a little bit up in the thread but I would honestly settle for a reliable follow me feature I always understood that to be their killer feature which makes it sting even more I have a simple setup forced central air natural gas furnace and freshly pulled wiring with a proper C wire and no splices or janky adapters all servicing a single zone All equipment is properly maintained and serviced by me and the equipment is less than 10yrs old The house is about 1500sqft and the thermostat is located in the living room The Zigbee SmartSensor is on the exact opposite side of the house my bedroom and the furthest from the equipment and thermostat No connection issues and the sensor reliably records my motion and presence each time albeit with a totally unacceptable cool down time that demonstrates quality engineering is not Ecobees primary motivator Because this is my bedroom Im not in it all day No matter the season the temperature delta between my bedroom and the living room is between 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit The Ecobee app reliably shows the differing temperatures of the sensor and thermostat However devoid of all common sense the temperature physically displayed on the thermostat can be an average of these two temperature readings and not the actual temperature of the thermostat I have an Accurite weather station right next to the thermostat so I see it every time when Ecobee decides to intentionally gaslight any person reading the thermostat display with a temperature 6 degrees off from reality I would expect that if I enter my bedroom after a long time of inactivity while there is also activity in my living room the thermostat will compensate for this and run the equipment to reach the desired temperature as measured as an average between the two I would also expect that if I am not in the living room at all but Im in the bedroom then the thermostat temperature will be ignored It rarely works this smoothly There is unnecessary complexity with the homeawaynight modes and the ability to choose which sensors to use during each mode Given that geofencing with their Android app is unreliable I cannot be sure which mode the thermostat will be in at any time and which sensors will be used to determine the set temperature I am sure I can dig into this further and develop various automations to compensate for the platform flawsbut it is kinda ridiculous to do so,mp3stcp,5.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp5c4xx,MrsMiterSaw,,1,2025-04-26 14:06:31,,,,Huh Thats crazy Mine works perfectly well I think thr displayed temp may be the average but it certainly uses the remote sensor for control especially when I use the floor sensor which routinely reads 7880 deg when the room is still below 70 Maybe its the presence sensors that muck it up I also dont use the geofense something I have found doesnt work worth shit on any platform unless I write my own apps to literally search for my phones MAC at home Sorry to hear I build automation and control systems for a living and I honestly cannot understand why smart thermostats have problems,mp40z4x,6.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4390j,Jean-LucBacardi,,-3,2025-04-26 08:01:21,,,,Yeah but its still a working thermostat Am I crazy to think that a 10 year old smart device shouldnt be expected to have support longer than that for security reasons You got what you paid for and then some Google isnt putting out security updates anymore and doesnt want it connected to their servers because of that Plain and simple Even windows 10 is getting canned this year at 10 years old,mp2e4j6,3.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp44gs1,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-04-26 08:13:30,,,,It really depends on the smart device IMO Installed home appliances are not have their useful features DISABLED I dont care about support but for fucks sake to have a perfectly working thermostat no longer be able to be controlled by my phone or home automation is bullshit Nests entire selling point was that it learns your routines and is controllable from a mobile app etc Without that its no better than a thermostat from from the 1950s And Windows 11 is a FREE update for Windows 10 users not to mention it will still work Microsoft isnt shutting down its Internet access so its a poor analogy If Google wants to send me a free replacement fine But nowhere in my original purchase did they say if it lasts 10 years youre going to have it buy a new one What I got out of it is subjective to me And no part of the calculus was planned obsolescence,mp4390j,4.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp45upt,Jean-LucBacardi,,2,2025-04-26 08:27:44,,,,Come on lets not treat Microsoft as the nice guys in this scenario The vast amount of PCs out there can not upgrade to Windows 11 due to outdated hardware which is exactly why Im assuming Google is dropping support for these At least Google is giving a discount on new hardware which is far less than Microsoft is doing for my 2017 laptop which wont even be 10 years old when support for it is dropped,mp44gs1,5.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp2ttks,hacksoncode,,4,2025-04-26 02:03:20,,,,But just have a old version of the app that lets you use it as intended but no longer gets updated ridiculously easy solution A large cloud infrastructure is involved in just using the app and patching security holes is expensive not excusing that but its not that easy,mp2b54r,5.0,1k7xgsq
comment,mp2v0b0,TwoBionicknees,,2,2025-04-26 02:10:25,,,,i mean you can provide 9999 of the functionality without the cloud thats pretty much just a gimmick to begin with Cutting it out of a final app version for old models is trivial Also again providing something saying this wont receive security updates but will work forever is easy Just commit to providing it via websitedownload if playapple stores get pissy about legacy app and no security updates,mp2ttks,6.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp4znx7,TwoBionicknees,,1,2025-04-26 12:50:18,,,,Its purely done in the cloud If you are using the app to tell the cloud to do something its not being done purely by the cloud because you are telling the app to do something The cloud is literally just passing on that same command Its basically a service to pass on the message its exceptionally trivial step to skip and the cloud is doing nothing remotely complex in the slightest here,mp4xzes,10.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp2a1qz,Spanky2k,,3,2025-04-26 00:05:47,,,,I really regret buying into the Nest ecosystem Ive got a bunch of these had a 2nd gen at my previous house and have 4 gen 3s in my current house and I have a load of Nest smoke alarms too I remember being excited about Nest when they were first released designed by exApple staff and looked really nice But then Google bought them and good iOS support was always due to be coming soon Siri support was never quite promised but always hinted as being available in the near future Just like they were strongly hinting years ago that theyd add some Nest compatible radiator TRVs but again that never materialised Besides all that I really hate the learning part of them I just want to be able to set it to a temperature set it remotely using my phone or a voice command or schedule it to be a temperature for certain times of the day I dont want it to learn and adjust settings whenever I turn it up I dont want it to learn when Im home or not and I dont want it to turn off when Im out theres almost always someone at home and when theres not there are pets here I know I need to replace them all but its not obvious what works well I want Apple HomeKit Support I want Smart TRV support I want separate zone support I have four underfloor heating zones and radiators that control two floors Right now I have a Nest per underfloor heating room and one Nest for the rest of the house which is heated by radiators The last time I looked into it there werent any solutions available in the UK that could handle all of that,,0.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp1yrrp,LydianSharp5,,1,2025-04-25 23:02:05,,,,Last year I finally configured my Nest to be a dumb thermostat which is not trivial by the way but found a great guide to do so by somebody who figured it out My Nest was turning on at silly times for reasons on it knew Now it never does anything on its own Turns out the best model for my home is that when Im cold I turn the knob a bit to the right and when Im warm I turn it to the left The only useful smart feature is that I can ask Alexa the temp and tell her to change it from my bed if need be,,0.0,1k7xgsq

comment,mp3ryoc,Strikereleven,,1,2025-04-26 06:12:54,,,,Ive had a gen 3 for 7 years and honestly feel like its been dumb this whole time The auto schedule thing always ran like crap it was hot when I got home and would randomly get hot in the middle of the night or morning I tried resetting the learning several times and if I left it on too long it would start messing up Ive been running efficiently off of a timed schedule for 5 years I was also really annoyed they collect all this cooling data from my system it knows the temp outside humidity so it knows how long it should take my house to cool but when my system has a problem and isnt cooling I never got an alert that there was a problem Id come home and its 85 in the house because its been running the pump all day with no fan or the pump didnt come on because the capacitor went out The only benefit over a cheapo thermostat is it looks nice and I can control it from my phone,,0.0,1k7xgsq
