comment,molf9sf,chrisdh79,,111,2025-04-23 12:06:38,,,,From the article Its not like Nvidias RTX 5000 series needs any more negative press but here we are again Igor Wallossek of Igors Lab has discovered a problem that appears to be present in most Blackwell AIB partner cards local hotspots at the rear of the PCBs This could potentially lead to the cards being damaged over time due to heavy use During a sustained torture loop on a PNY RTX 5070 OC and Palit RTX 5080 Gaming Pro OC Wallossek recorded temperature spikes in the power delivery areas of the cards The RTX 5070 reached 107 C while the GPU core sat at a much cooler 70C and the RTX 5080 Gaming Pro OC peaked at 805C,,0.0,1k5xghg
comment,monzsoe,bonesnaps,,42,2025-04-23 19:56:55,,,,I once had a card that had caps installed behind the fan vents It was blowing hot air at them the entire time it was in use Since the caps blew up almost exactly 23 months after the warranty ended I suspect it was enshittification in the form of planned obscelence I always look for those now when buying cards,molf9sf,1.0,1k5xghg

comment,mpa41g1,Christopher135MPS,,2,2025-04-27 07:58:05,,,,I mean if youre not paying 1000 cards pushing the absolute edge of performance youre fine owning a PC Its these must have the newest and best at any cost machines that have issues because theyre pushing the tech to its limits My last four machines purchased between 20092024 4 years per machine all ran the concurrent games at top settings without any issues and the only part that ever failed was a MOBO that cost 129 to replace They were all a few hundred dollars more expensive than a console though and one was 4500 more because I splashed out Which was my really long winded way of saying PCs are usually as reliable as consoles unless you buy stupid shit Although my n64 and GameCube also still run without any problems and my PCs from those eras are in a recycling yard sooo,morqyj4,3.0,1k5xghg

comment,mopbaqh,Arthur-Wintersight,,19,2025-04-24 00:06:37,,,,I had the same PC from 2012 to 2023 and gamed on it the entire time Hardware isnt improving as fast as it used to half of the most popular games are 5 to 10 years old at this point if not older and the back catalogue is absolutely chonkers at this point Were at the point where you could go full boomer decide to never upgrade your PC ever again and youd still be able to play a substantial percentage of the most popular titles even five years from now because those older games are lasting longer and longer,monc1od,3.0,1k5xghg
comment,mopedcu,Teddy8709,,5,2025-04-24 00:24:19,,,,My current PC is getting old and I cant be bothered to build a new one It runs perfectly fine just cant play the latest games anymore So my fix for this was to just invest in a console Xbox to be exact It suits my needs most games I want to play are on it and I pay for game pass ultimate and a handful of PC games I want to play I can do so using their cloud gaming it works just fine for me Hard to justify dropping 2k CAD on a PC to play a few games once in a while anymore,mopbaqh,4.0,1k5xghg
comment,mpa4lnd,Christopher135MPS,,1,2025-04-27 08:03:46,,,,The only reason I upgraded in 2018 is because my gfx card didnt support the newest version of directX My PC from then is still running games Sure not on full settings but it managed 4560fps on medium settings in CP2077 I have bought a new machine since then but thats because my wife wanted a PC otherwise Id still be running that 56 year old machine,mopbaqh,4.0,1k5xghg

comment,molpsog,ArseBurner,,18,2025-04-23 13:12:43,,,,It does because they are supply constrained There are only so many TSMC wafers to go around and right now the datacenter and gaming lines use the same node The obvious choice is to fulfill datacenter first and build less gaming cards,molp4zu,3.0,1k5xghg

comment,molhmod,petermadach,,33,2025-04-23 12:22:29,,,,thats what happens when you try to squeeze in more and more power to the same physical package eventually physics comes to say hello we either need to collectively say fk it and let them do these 500600W monsters with even bigger PCBs and coolers or say a card can go like 350 tops and they should make the most out of it but I guess as long as they literally fly off the selves with all these problems at these prices we can blame no one but ourselves,,0.0,1k5xghg

comment,mom3imx,DontPeek,,4,2025-04-23 14:27:05,,,,Exactly The GPU and a cooler as a huge 4 slot pcie card doesnt make sense Unfortunately it seems like there isnt much motivation to move away from this standard,molyfx3,2.0,1k5xghg
comment,momrdh9,NorysStorys,,7,2025-04-23 16:23:32,,,,Because it would require new standards and no one company wants to be the one to pour money into developing a new standard The inertia on case design motherboard layout is incredibly hard to shake on top of that,mom3imx,3.0,1k5xghg
comment,mopbrnn,Arthur-Wintersight,,2,2025-04-24 00:09:19,,,,Offloading framegen and DLSS to another card could allow for vastly more performance but that means either more PCIe lanes on consumer grade CPUs or something akin to NVLink being brought back,mom3imx,3.0,1k5xghg
comment,moq4t42,DontPeek,,1,2025-04-24 03:00:11,,,,Its just splitting up the card into even smaller parts which means even more smaller higher rpm fans and less sensible airflow paths Personally I think for the vast majority of people it makes more sense to have a single board with an integrated CPU and GPU Less upgradeability but I would be very interested to see how many people are upgrading just their GPU on an existing system vs doing a complete build every few years,mopbrnn,4.0,1k5xghg

comment,moy8uq8,llBradll,,1,2025-04-25 11:16:49,,,,My understanding was that Nvidia makes the GPU while the board partner designs the PCB If thats the case is this an Nvidia issue or a PalitPNY issue,,0.0,1k5xghg

comment,mompd1o,Readiness11,,1,2025-04-23 16:13:38,,,,A total AMD noob here but what are their cards like compared to Nvidia cards All of the recent news about Nvida has me thinking the next time I upgrade my PC I might go over to AMD instead,,0.0,1k5xghg
comment,momt2ql,thelazygamer,,2,2025-04-23 16:31:51,,,,In general AMD provides a better value for rasterization true frames with slightly worse ray tracing performance I have found that I usually get more vram at similar price points which helps them age better I swap brands every other upgrade based on whats available and priceperformance for the gamesresolution I am playing at Ive had good and bad drivers with both brands and dont see much of a difference between them My last two cards were a 3070 and a 7900XT and I liked both Just pick what seems like the better option for your budgetneeds when you build your system,mompd1o,1.0,1k5xghg
comment,moo1ew4,Squirrel_Apocalypse2,,1,2025-04-23 20:04:39,,,,The 9070xt is a slightly worse 5070ti They are similar in raster game to game they beat each other but the TI is better at Ray Tracing AMD has vastly improved their upscaling and frame generation with FSR4 and the 9070XT can do Ray Tracing quite well though Especially at 1440p,mompd1o,1.0,1k5xghg
comment,mong1zf,JediMasterChron,,0,2025-04-23 18:21:02,,,,Dlss and frame gen plus way better Ray tracing is why you go for nvidia If you dont care about these things buy an amd The newer low end nvidia are kind of lacking though A 5080 will be a way better experience than anything amd has to offer,mompd1o,1.0,1k5xghg
comment,morlfle,mister2forme,,3,2025-04-24 10:43:19,,,,Way better is a bit of a stretch As someone who had a 4090 and now an OC 9070xt its not a huge difference between the 5080 and stock 9070xt beyond numbers on some bar graphs 1320 according to TPU If the 9070xt gets 80fps in a game then the 5080 would average from 9096 in the same game Thats not really a way better experience Im not sure most people would even the see the difference Shrug DLSS and FSR4 are similar with a nod to 4 being marginally better than FSR4 and FSR4 marginally better than DLSS3 according to the comparison content recently published At this level Im not sure you need it These cards are powerful enough Frame gen shouldnt be necessary either and both are capable Im sensitive to the visual downgrade of upscaling and framegen though so theres that Ray tracing is sadly only good in a handful of games HUB did a great video on this a few months back Nvidia is better but Im not sure if spending almost double for a marginally faster 5080 is worth it for most Just to have better RT in a few games And thats discounting the awful power design driver issues retailer scalping and other issues plaguing the 50 series But if someone is dead set on RT then Nvidia is still better but AMD is at least capable now Cheers,mong1zf,2.0,1k5xghg
comment,morohq3,JediMasterChron,,1,2025-04-24 11:07:50,,,,Raster is going out the door nobody gives a shit about raster when more and more games are having Ray tracing used as their normal lighting You are right a 5080 is powerful enough in raster that it doesnt matter Dlss 3 looks decent but transformer is much more clean and better than fsr 4 Combine with path tracing hdr and a 4k oled and you will have an image that is almost lifelike And idk what you are talking about marginally better dlss 4 solves a ton of issues from dlss 3 If you get a 5080 and arent playing in 4k you are wasting your money Frame gen will allow you to do 240hz 4k on all max setting so dont know why you are discounting that Amd cant compete with these feature sets so if you have money the 5080 is the way to go,morlfle,3.0,1k5xghg
