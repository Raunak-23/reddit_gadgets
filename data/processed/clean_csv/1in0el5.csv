comment,mc6yycd,Explosivpotato,,386,2025-02-11 15:11:56,,,,Theres a reason that the 8 pin only has 3 current carrying positive wires Its all that was required to make a connector that is physically capable of safely handling close to double the rated spec This 12vhpwr cable seems to rely on numerous small wires to divide the load Thats a lot of points of failure that seemingly arent monitored,,0.0,1in0el5
comment,mc78oi9,RedMoustache,,281,2025-02-11 15:59:27,,,,Except the ASUS 5090 The fact that company is putting in per wire monitoring says they probably saw that the cable issue was not resolved after the 4090 and knew the 5090 would be worse,mc6yycd,1.0,1in0el5

comment,mc8yyqc,Magiwarriorx,,24,2025-02-11 20:49:39,,,,It may still not be enough Great video on how older Nvidia cards load balanced here but TLDR is previous generation Nvidia cards would load balance between the connectors or between wires for 30 series 12vhpwr cards Absolute worst case scenario would only put 150200W through one wire before the card electrically couldnt turn on anymore and those wires were arguably overspeced anyway 40 and 50 series dont load balance at all even the Asus cards It isnt clear to me if Asus monitoring actually shuts the card down when it sees major over current on one wire or just warns you somethings fucky It certainly doesnt seem to have a way to actually fix the problem,mc78oi9,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mc7dms6,UpsetKoalaBear,,8,2025-02-11 16:23:05,,,,12VHPWR was created by Dell and Nvidia then submitted to PCISIG who approved it and incorporated it as part of ATX 30 though it was part of PCIE50 before that Nvidia was just the first to use it Its most likely if this was implemented by _literally_ any other manufacturer it would end with the same issue Though there are concerns about connector quality I dont think Nvidia would risk another class action lawsuit PCISIG is a consortium companies who make products interfacing with ATX or PCIE have to pay for membership to be able to access the standards As a result it falls on the entirety of PCISIG that _they_ allowed this to be implemented into the specifications without proper and thorough testing It also falls on Nvidia and Dell for creating the spec and submitting it without testing thoroughly but PCISIG is also responsible for not having checks and balances in place for this Even if it is user error the number of issues people have had with it means that its clearly a problem Whats worse is PCISIG have tried to wash their hands of the problem despite being the ones that approved it in the first place,mc7773k,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mc7g4mn,joebear174,,34,2025-02-11 16:34:48,,,,Its especially stupid if their reasoning is to take up less space since the connector is so fragile you need to give it plenty of space to accomodate a wide bend radius anyway,mc78gku,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mc87yvx,Zomunieo,,8,2025-02-11 18:44:49,,,,Theres a proposed design that would have the power supply as a pluggable module that provides power to the motherboard That would also let the motherboard provide enough power to graphics cards through the slot connector,mc7qw7y,4.0,1in0el5

comment,mc83m2i,Spiz101,,12,2025-02-11 18:24:40,,,,In my view the worst part is the ATX power supply spec already has a 12Vdc rail They could have designed the card with a 12V so 24V supply and avoided this mad dash to ever higher currents Sure youd need new power supplies with way more 12V current but this is just silly,mc71h3p,1.0,1in0el5
comment,mcbrgw6,nagi603,,3,2025-02-12 06:33:05,,,,They can get away with a new adapter but everyone ditching all PSUs in use currently and forcing PSU companies to reengineer all their lineup is a nogo,mc83m2i,2.0,1in0el5
comment,mchex9d,Quasi_Evil,,2,2025-02-13 02:30:49,,,,The problem there is that all the other signals in the system are referenced to ground So instead of a simple 12V to core voltage multiphase buck converter youd need some sort of isolated topology of switching converter Its hard enough making the current system function within specs doing it with an isolated converter would be absolutely bonkers and chew up a huge amount of board area with transformers I say simple because a friend of mine actually designs these things for one of NVs suppliers Theyre absolutely hideously complicated to meet the absolutely insane specs in terms of current and tight voltage overshootundershoot when the current demand suddenly swings a few hundred amps in microseconds Theyd be much better off building a better connector from scratch or moving to a groundreferenced 24 or 48V DC rail for future high power use for both the CPU and GPU Now if you move to 48V that poses its own challenges but theyre probably better than anything unholy that involves isolated converters,mc83m2i,2.0,1in0el5
comment,mcy4d1u,User_2C47,,1,2025-02-15 19:16:03,,,,The 12V rail on an ATX power supply is rated for very little current usually less than one amp and its only routed to one pin on the mobo connector It was only ever used for RS232 and a few very old expansion cards Implementing this would require an entirely new 24 volt standard that takes the place 12V0 was meant to and separate 12v and 24v versions of graphics cards for several years,mc83m2i,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mcbn2zk,soulsoda,,17,2025-02-12 05:54:28,,,,The new 12VHPWR 12V2x6 is just a 12VHPWR with longer contact pins and shorter sensing pins This helps with user error like improper connections but does diddly squat for load balance electricity doesnt really care how many connections you give it the majority is going to follow the path of least resistance Yes theres 6 paths it can flow but theres no mechanism for the card to say hey dont run 500600watts through only one of six wires since to the card its all one wire,mc703mh,1.0,1in0el5
comment,mcaa9kc,eaeorls,,26,2025-02-12 00:45:11,,,,The main point of the connector was that it would be more efficient at delivering high amounts of power Where to remain in spec for the old PCI power theyd need 3x 8 pin and 1x 6 pin at minimum for 575w since the spec is rated for 150w 8pin or 75w 6pin 75 from the slot itself They probably should have just developed the cable for a safer 300wor even just 450wthough,mc703mh,1.0,1in0el5

comment,mc7x6b9,bal00,,31,2025-02-11 17:54:46,,,,Exactly This was such a bad design from the beginning Its a bad idea to deliver 600W at just 12V its a bad idea to run multiple pins in parallel and its a bad idea to use so few pins that even if their resistance is perfectly identical theyre still running very close to their rated maximum The only way to make this design safe is to add currenttemperature monitoring Everything else is just a gamble,mc74yyv,1.0,1in0el5
comment,mc86e73,audigex,,26,2025-02-11 18:37:33,,,,Yeah its just a fundamentally bad idea to send 600W at 12V over this type of connector We either need a new read thicker connector suitable for higher currents or to just accept that once you get to this kind of power consumption 12V just isnt suitable for this kind of application if you want to keep the thinner connectors and you need eg 2024V,mc7x6b9,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mcdbjwy,audigex,,3,2025-02-12 14:28:30,,,,Thats basically what it comes down to either a 6gauge wire or a couple of 810 gauge Assuming Ive not cocked the maths up a new 6pin with 10 gauge for example would allow for 90A 3x 12v up to 30A 3x GND That would max out at 108kW giving plenty of headroom for current cards which realistically are probably hitting the limits of what the thermals can handle anyway Even if the thermals could be improved it still allows for theoretically 80 more power draw than the 5090 Youd probably want to reduce that down somewhat for safety but using 10ga rather than 12ga is already giving us some headroom,mcb9qus,4.0,1in0el5
comment,mcdl2zw,Pepparkakan,,2,2025-02-12 15:18:31,,,,Is there an actual good reason they even stayed with 12V when designing a whole ass new connector Were they unable to get PSU manufacturers to agree to add new higher voltage power rails,mc7x6b9,2.0,1in0el5

comment,mc9oov1,ApproximatelyC,,8,2025-02-11 22:49:12,,,,If Im understanding your argument correctly Its not an argument its a fact The individual pins are directly connected to a single metal rail at the back of the connector which runs down into the board You can see it really clearly on the GN teardown vid The fact that there IS current being measured on all the other wires means that the other wires arent broken Im not saying the wires were broken just expanding on the point that as the card is effectively just one 12v point and one GND point if four of the wires were broken then theres nothing stopping the card from pulling the 45a or so that the card would need to operate at 600w through the remaining two wires Your original assumption that the pins individually supplied discrete parts of the board wouldnt allow this as youd be limited by whatever component the individual pins were connected to So what is causing the uneven current distribution Thats the million dollar question Ive seen speculation that in the case of the cable that sparked this issue its potentially the connectors in the cable becoming slightly worn which reduces contact at the pins increasing resistance This also lines up with the der8auer video that was the source of the OP article as he specifically notes that the cable being used has been plugged intotaken out of multiple cards before As the cable is effectively one big parallel resistor increasing the resistance of any one connector also increases the resistance of the cable as a whole but current will increase through the paths of least resistance to ensure compliance with Ohms law As a complete dumb example if the pins in new condition have a resistance of 01ohm each and youre drawing 42A to reach 504w on the connector each cable will have 7A running through it If four of those cables wear and have a resistance of 1ohm each instead youd have 175A running through the four wires with higher resistance and 175A running through the two intact wires Ive no idea if thats whats happening here and a big part of the problem is that you cant test the cable that caused the fault as theresa bit of damage there Testing for this type of issue I imagine would be difficult as theres no way to directly measure resistance along each wire while plugged in to both the PSU and GPU,mc9ddex,3.0,1in0el5

comment,mcdh7bw,ApproximatelyC,,1,2025-02-12 14:58:44,,,,I think the only way you could try to measure the resistance is once at each end like you suggest but it would require both the PSU and GPU to be disassembled to the point where the power ails are accessed Plug into GPU measure GPU rail to pins at PSU connector end then plug into PSU side and measure PSU rail to pins at GPU connector end The issue there is that youre having to plug inremove the cable and if thats causing wear youll be degrading the cable and altering the results with each test,mcdc90u,5.0,1in0el5

comment,mc8di2s,witheringsyncopation,,0,2025-02-11 19:10:27,,,,So the problem was on the PSU end or the GPU end Because Im pretty sure all 50series cards have a 12V2x6 connectors So if it was 12VHPWR on the GPU end I could see it being because the load was unbalanced due to poor connections relegating too much power to too few pins,,0.0,1in0el5
comment,mc75kwv,N3utro,,-5,2025-02-11 15:44:38,,,,It was stupid to use a 12VHPWR cable in the first place when nvidia stated themselves that 12V2x6 is here to avoid these problems When you pay 2500 it makes no sense not spending 50 more for a new 12V2x6 cable,,0.0,1in0el5
comment,mc78ghv,dertechie,,3,2025-02-11 15:58:23,,,,The changes for 12V2x6 are on the connector side to lengthen power pins and shorten sense pins to make sure power stops if it works loose or isnt all the way in The cables are the same A fully populated 600W 12VHPWR cable is the same as a fully populated 600W 12V2x6 Source Corsair,mc75kwv,1.0,1in0el5

comment,mc6y0tw,dertechie,,37,2025-02-11 15:07:09,,,,The initial failure is from that post but the 22A on a cable designed for 95A max and 150C hot spot was derbauers setup From what I understand the user with the fried card did use a Moddiy cable but we have no particular reason to believe that it was out of spec Knowing derbauer the cable he replicated on was in spec,mc6wtqy,1.0,1in0el5

comment,mc71mp5,dertechie,,9,2025-02-11 15:25:19,,,,Yeah Nonuniform power pull across GPU connectors has been a thing for a while 8 pins are overbuilt enough by spec to be fine a nominally 150W 8 pin can jam almost 300W safely based on the wire gauges in the spec That massive amount of safety margin covered for any issues with some pins or connections getting more juice than others 12VHPWR and its descendants dont have that massive safety margin when trying to push 600W it has about 10 of slop available in the spec You cant treat it the same when designing your power delivery circuitry,mc6yepl,3.0,1in0el5
comment,mc6ypiy,crigsdigs,,14,2025-02-11 15:10:41,,,,A cable having 22 amps flow through it has nothing to do with it being aftermarket Individually they need to be rated for 910 amps so this is pulling 22x what theyre rated for Its an issue with the cards,mc6wtqy,1.0,1in0el5
comment,mc6ztna,Golluk,,4,2025-02-11 15:16:18,,,,That and a bad connection means higher resistance so lower current flow if anything Unless they have some voltage regulator after that tries to boost the voltage drawing more current But again it should be designed not to pull over spec,mc6ypiy,2.0,1in0el5
