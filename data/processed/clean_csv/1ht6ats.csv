comment,m5c76f0,bootymix96,,25,2025-01-04 11:15:25,,,,Its for the Atari 5200 its a little smaller than the first revision 5200 and its nearly the same size as the compact second revision 5200 Ataris other TrakBall for the 2600 7800 and their computers was a much more manageable size,m5buop1,2.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5gpx88,Over-Conversation220,,4,2025-01-05 03:18:54,,,,I had one It was pretty good compared to the control sticks for 5200 that were not good at all,m5c76f0,3.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5we1ev,JamesHeckfield,,1,2025-01-07 17:08:23,,,,AVGN noted that the Atari 5200 trackball controller was slightly bigger than the NES,m5buop1,2.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5bcbws,Syzygymancer,,25,2025-01-04 06:02:10,,,,Yeah honestly it feels like they should have maybe made the trackball smaller and placed it in the middle of a four way rocker,m5b11ci,1.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5bf10z,Affectionate-Memory4,,9,2025-01-04 06:25:14,,,,I like the size actually I think the best placement would have been to mirror the joystick like the way almost every other handheld does it Basically just replace the right stick with the trackball,m5bcbws,2.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5bffp5,Syzygymancer,,8,2025-01-04 06:28:52,,,,Wouldnt work too well for the games it seems to be aiming at All those on the left side were movement controls on various Atari arcade games and also home consoles The right side is basically shooting jumping You would have issues moving and shooting at the same time,m5bf10z,3.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5e2gwl,shpongolian,,3,2025-01-04 18:29:07,,,,Yeah Ive always thought a game controller with trackballs could be really cool if executed right especially if they had variable tension When the original steam controller was announced before they revealed the touch pads I was really hoping they were going to be trackballs,m5b11ci,1.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5euwn7,Affectionate-Memory4,,4,2025-01-04 20:58:44,,,,Variable tension is actually a really cool idea for a controller With fast enough modulation you could emulate different textures,m5e2gwl,2.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5hnmxy,tylerbrainerd,,10,2025-01-05 07:39:33,,,,I feel like everything atari related is purchased as gifts for men in their 30s50s from people who dont know what to get them The era of 8bit gaming represented by atari just didnt age well Really everything 8bit didnt age well The original nes is much worse than most of us remember Its the 16 and 32 bit forward eras that we actually want to revisit in nostalgia,m5e4rd8,2.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5jg4ss,Turmoil_Engage,,5,2025-01-05 16:20:29,,,,I have to politely disagree about the NES even as someone who didnt grow up with it or have much to do with it to this day The best of the NES has arguably aged quite well Sure there are outdated elements and a bit higher difficulty in a lot of games But compared to Atari NES is far more playable at worst and really fun at best If youre willing to grant a fair amount of patience NES games are just fine Super Mario Bros SMB3 Kirbys Adventure Mega Man Castlevania Final Fantasy Tetris Dr Mario Metroid Legend of Zelda etc All bangers And leagues ahead of Atari,m5hnmxy,3.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5frsqv,None,,0,2025-01-05 00:01:56,,,,Given how English works yes Im being downvoted because I asked who upvoted the silly comment not because I opposed the comment Use your brain why would Atari put a trackball for a product they dont own Yes I understand hackers will add it but thats not a bankable service plan from Atari The question from the original comment is asking about trackball and spinner as in they are guessing at what games Atari will provide Golden Tee is not their property so your point is silly,m5fqg13,10.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5ge4wl,None,,0,2025-01-05 02:09:11,,,,You are adding so much that isnt there The first comment is theres a trackball and spinner Millicentipede and Tempest to which the reply is just Golden Tee They are just listing off games that immediately came to mind not Atari games,m5frsqv,11.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5bn5ts,Korvun,,21,2025-01-04 07:42:50,,,,What a ridiculous contention The Switch had little to nothing to do with inspiring the current wave of handhelds Retro handhelds and mobile computers like to ROG Ally Steam Deck and any number of emulator handhelds are the real inspiration for companies to begin reentering the market The Switch has been out and completely unanswered for almost 10 years at this point These new handhelds dont even remotely resemble the Switch in functionality Theyre handheld PCs not a dedicated platform for a single company,,0.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5cgn1i,None,,15,2025-01-04 12:45:42,,,,The Steamdeck can be a mobile PC but by default it is a handheld gaming console and they even market it as such The Switch and Nintendo in general absolutely deserves some mention in helping establish and continue the handheld gaming scene Theyve been doing it longer than anyone And the Switch is by far and away the biggest success of anything else in this vein and its not even close There are retroemulator handhelds that are using Switch aftermarket parts Its part of the conversation,m5bn5ts,1.0,1ht6ats

comment,m5h15m8,None,,1,2025-01-05 04:30:29,,,,Theres a distinction between calling something a handheld or mobile PC and a gaming console PCs are multi function general use devices made for doing more than playing PC games A gaming console mostly only plays games for that platform The Steamdeck is a console by default but if you install other OSes on it it can function like a handheld PC I thought that was the whole point you were getting at,m5gxcpu,3.0,1ht6ats
comment,m5hw8yv,Korvun,,1,2025-01-05 09:08:04,,,,The Steam Deck by default has a desktop function that behaves as a normal PC Switching to that function is by design By every definition of the word the Steam Deck is a handheld PC that is simply marketed as a portable Steam interface,m5h15m8,4.0,1ht6ats
