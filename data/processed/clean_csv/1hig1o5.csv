comment,m2yw1fj,scorpion_tail,,1061,2024-12-20 11:41:29,,,,I actually worked at a Walmart for about six months People saying they want to use the cameras for workplace surveillance arent aware that your location and activity are already being monitored Most employees optin to clock in and out using an app Even if you dont use the app for this you still basically need the app anyway for their ongoing learning training mandates The app has location tracking and its pretty tight I would test it to see how far from the door it would allow me to clock in15 feet past the entrance inside Even if you dont have a cell phone they will give you a device such as a company cell or radio As an employee you are being constantly observed The store I worked in was packed with cameras Id guesstimate they numbered more than 300 These arent just cameras up above the aisles They are above all the selfcheckouts behind counters and in the staffing areas That store had a twoperson security team who spent much of their shifts sitting in front of about a dozen monitors One very very big concern for corporate is a mass shooting within the store During training we went through three different segments focused on mass shootings This included two computerbased segments and one store walkthrough and drill to locate the best safer spaces during an emergency I cannot stress enough how concerned they are about this The only thing that worries them more are spills What body cams can track better than any app is an employee who walks away from a spill When you report to work they dont give you any spill time so a jug of milk busting during your shift can totally offset the rest of your day I had one jar of salsa break on me and the next 25 hours were spent dealing with that alone There is the ideal Walmart that is presented in a training program and theres the real one you work in where you actually cant find any of the bullshit you need to quickly clean a spill They say the cams are for safety but they are really there for liability reasons Thats it,,0.0,1hig1o5

comment,m31ywzz,TheKappaOverlord,,-2,2024-12-20 22:58:59,,,,In certain cases this is actually kind of true But in most major cases it obviously isnt my dad exclusively avoids joining the union for the company he works for exclusively because he has to pay them Also because unless you are 10 year seniority you really dont actually benefit The only benefits hes seen are people who get caught drinking or fucking on the bus or causing minor accidents that would cost them the job but they walk because the union Hes seniority enough now that he gets all the benefits of the Union without having to actually pay any dues to them Plus hes friends with the senior level guys in the Union so theyd protect him anyways as a favor Its cherry picking and smearing the lie part of the white lie so it looks more factual,m30f3bi,8.0,1hig1o5
comment,m33um3q,Pixiepup,,4,2024-12-21 07:37:48,,,,Needing seniority for any kind of anything is something I saw really bite an old roommate of mine getting eith the railroad The other issue Ive personally seen was a really good friends mom when I was a kid who was pretty high up in the grocery store Union There was a couple of years of turmoil before all the Union stores were bought out by nonunion in our state and during the time of negotiations before then she was constantly being blocked from working The Union paid some wages but not enough to live on during that time As a result she nearly lost her home and I do remember discussions of filing bankruptcy but I dont know if she did or not Collective bargaining can do great things but a large enough organization is always going to start acting in its own self interest regardless of the personal costs to individuals in that organization,m31ywzz,9.0,1hig1o5

comment,m37xtdc,Hatedpriest,,-1,2024-12-22 01:09:40,,,,A arguement I heard was they keep a good man down and a bad man working Its hard to fire union workers and some come across as lazy though theyre following procedure example working on machines is a maintenance issue and if a machine is down half a day hes either sitting waiting or something else is found for him to do Furthermore wage caps keep good employees from making more though those caps are to ensure other benefits are paid like a retirement fund or insurance Thats what Ive heard,m308u4i,7.0,1hig1o5

comment,m3cb829,AggressiveToaster,,1,2024-12-22 21:24:11,,,,You can also organize and become a union of workers that use their leverage as a collective to gain better pay working conditions without paying dues Nothing is stopping that They will be less effective than a union that has a fund to pay workers during a strike or pay lawyers but they can still get good things done Theres really no reason to not unionize,m305taa,7.0,1hig1o5

comment,m308p2o,Mama_Skip,,30,2024-12-20 17:03:40,,,,This is weirdly parallel to the argument against universal healthcare But youll have to pay higher taxes Youre already paying taxes for private healthcare Its just that your company takes it out of your paycheck before they give it to you And most people would pay much less in total costs,m2zu91k,6.0,1hig1o5

comment,m30eawb,showyerbewbs,,17,2024-12-20 17:34:42,,,,The only argument ever was mandatory union dues They say it like union dues are 70 of your gross pay Brief searching shows union dues are typically 12 of gross earnings NOTE This is a generalization and varies from union to union That would have to be insanely lower than the wage theft by the company for unpaid time as listed by OP People generically speaking struggle with breaking down nuances,m2zu91k,6.0,1hig1o5
comment,m33cy2u,Kimura2triangle,,7,2024-12-21 04:48:44,,,,I would add yes it is often 12 of your gross pay Which is 20 higher than it would be without a union So still a massive net gain,m30eawb,7.0,1hig1o5

comment,m300jt8,None,,9,2024-12-20 16:18:35,,,,That turns into another conversation about how effective is union leadership I have a story about a time when I was working for a retailer and I joined a union during my time on that job I reported some unsafe practices I witnessed a coworker engaging in operating a forklift without being certified and rushing while moving pallets around and the response I got Well hes under a lot of stress with his home life so cut him some slack Hes just trying to do his job So employee continued to engage in unsafe practices union leader didnt do anything and the show went on Like I said this was a retailer so different industry But I can imagine a similar conversation happening in other unions as well Of course the conversation could go entirely different within different unions as well,m2zxxsp,7.0,1hig1o5

comment,m30oux9,KeberUggles,,3,2024-12-20 18:32:48,,,,I worked for an internet company that was unionized I was falsely accused of time theft when I was actually working on the work computer I was just slow at my job Perfect This will be easy to prove losers Union didnt think it was worth their effort The last guy they went to bat for and pulled the computer tracking proved he was time thefting so they wouldnt do mine And then if they were able to prove I was working the company would just go through with a fine tooth comb to find something else lost my job even though I am a truthful employee not coffee or smoke breaks to flag No recourse because what the union says goes you cant go after the company yourself And only after too much time had passed did I learn you can file a complaint to the Goverment about the union No one tells you how to defend yourself against unions I find unions do just as much fear mongering as companies I was part of the initial push to unionize at a previous job And I found their shtick to be very fear mongering which they get all pissy about when the company does the same thing They seem to cause a toxic relationship between the company and workers since theyre stance is the company is trying to screw you at every turn Of all the unions Ive been part of Ive never seen the actual benefit And when I was finally going to benefit from one nope they didnt wanna That said Amazon workers NEED to unionize,m2zko91,5.0,1hig1o5

comment,m351jl4,DragonRaptor,,1,2024-12-21 14:30:30,,,,Unions can be good they can also be bad they protect workers who are actually bad at their job bad workers means other workers will often have to fixclean up their mistakes creates an unbalanced working environment that is stressful for those who actually want to do a good job and because it prevents their dismissal the company may not be able to afford to hire more workers to help pick up there slack which means more difficult job for others if everyone does bad then the company goes under and no more job the whole seniority thing doesnt always reward the best workers they can prevent growth by not allowing you to do work outside your mandate ever heard the term do the job you want not the job you have its hard to learn new jobs and move into them when your not allowed to do them which means they have to hire based on chance then experience from seeing candidates attempt said work being on strike can mean lower or no wages which some people cant afford not all unions are like this some are really good But some are bad theres more reasons then what I mentioned above point being is everything isnt black and white,m2zko91,5.0,1hig1o5

comment,m383tzr,ial4289,,0,2024-12-22 01:51:22,,,,I have a few reasons why unions arent the best for everyone First and simply they cost money Union fees were over 100month out of my 900 paychecks which was far too much at the time Additionally as a hard worker seniority sucks unions seem built around benefiting the employees who have stayed longer vs the ones starting out regardless of work effort By far my biggest complaint was the forced working hours You HAD to work 5 days every week which meant you could not get unpaid time off if it meant working less then that or you would get hit with a reprimand mark Sure after a year you can get a week long paid vacation or whatnot but until then if you needed more then 3 days off for any reason in a week it was the equivalent of calling out Just not a good experience all around Costco by the way and I was maybe 23 at the time,m2zko91,5.0,1hig1o5
comment,m38bkx4,lama579,,0,2024-12-22 02:46:33,,,,Some companies or industries wont let you work for them unless you also join the union Unions will argue that this is because you would get the benefits of being in a union without paying the dues What if you dont think the union provides a good enough if any benefit What if you think the dues are too much What if you dont like that dues often go to donations to politicians that you dont like Unions will usually not let you negotiate your own wages either If youre the best widget maker you cant go to management and ask for a raise to reflect this Youll be paid the same as the worst widget maker It raises the floor for the lowest performers but lowers the ceiling for the highest I dont agree with everything there but they are legitimate arguments,m2zko91,5.0,1hig1o5

comment,m30q6ug,diescheide,,5,2024-12-20 18:40:12,,,,Bro it does not take 25 hours to clean a small spill Youre heavily exaggerating Even the worst stocked spill stations will have pocket pads andor paper towels Grab an empty box scoop the mess into the box with padstowels and then go grab your broom and mop Call maintenance if you need the scrubber Report lost merch There are reclamations bins for that I cannot imagine being so incompetent that it takes more than 30 minutes between finding supplies potentially assisting customers and dealing with the damaged product Having to wait for maintenance takes longer than addressing it yourself usually,m2z0sgx,3.0,1hig1o5

comment,m38ve5l,Terribletylenol,,0,2024-12-22 05:27:07,,,,Also the floor of a Walmart might be one of the filthiest things ever made by human hands I guess you have never had to take out bloody tampons from a womens restroom or clean up shit out of a mens urinal or clean vomit off of a floor I loled hard af at your comment because you have no idea what disgusting is if you said that Even dumping grease from taco Bueno is significantly more disgusting than grabbing glass off a Walmart floor Youre so dramatic about such a simple process I worked at Walmart and regularly stocking juice was much more annoying than what you dealt with considering how small I am and how short of a time period I was given to do the entire thing I never would have been allowed to spend 25 hours cleaning a simple spill I got less than half that to unload and stock the entire juice pallet Sounds nice to stand around and be allowed to focus on a spill for 25 hrs Janitorial sucks btw And you dont get 2 hours to clean up the shit piss tampons or vomit either But yes the floor of Walmart is the filthiest thing made by humans lmaoooo Gain some understanding of the kind of work other people have to do,m2z0sgx,3.0,1hig1o5

comment,m2ynrgm,DekuHHH,,105,2024-12-20 10:10:47,,,,Honestly Walmarts explanation makes no sense Why bodycams when their stores have security cameras in every corner of the buildings They specifically state this is for loss prevention and employee safety If a customer is already getting physicalviolent in a store that puts Big Brother to shame I doubt a body cam is going to be effective in deescalating the situation I have a feeling this is so Walmart can invasively monitor their employees at all times,,0.0,1hig1o5

comment,m2zh99r,okram2k,,1,2024-12-20 14:24:33,,,,when I worked at Walmart decades ago as an assistant manager the security cameras were very much okay but the main purpose of them was not to record things to send to the authorities it was for a couple people in loss preventing watching around the clock to look for customers doing suspicious things that was likely to be theft or vandalism and then contact the floor loss prevention associates to start tailing the suspected person The eyes in the sky were really just to alert and draw attention not to produce crystal clear evidence in court for that you just have a couple employees watch someone stuff space jam DVDs down their pants in person Then you ask them politely to come with you to the security room show them the tape and ask them to sign a notice that theyve been banned from Walmart Repeat offender got the cops involved,m2yxin9,2.0,1hig1o5
