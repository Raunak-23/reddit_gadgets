comment,m79x2fx,notred369,,533,2025-01-15 14:23:52,,,,These arent fake frames but arent rendered by the PCs processors either Multiframe gen is a magic trick that requires misdirection Users will be too busy playing the game and basking in the framerate ticker to notice any potential visual discrepancies when theyinevitablyappear This takes time to parse out something that cant be done even with a few hours of demos Well need to get our hands on these new cards to discover how this impacts our gaming experience So whats the point of the article then Even the author says wait for benchmarks,,0.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7bwq86,ambermage,,6,2025-01-15 20:17:51,,,,A video review has already been posted for the 5090 using cyberpunk with prerelease drivers and the DLSS frame rate was 260ish with 56ms latency and with all software rendering disabled it was still 65ish with a latency of around 35ms Thats nice but the 2000 price tag is not for me,m79x2fx,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7dqvx0,None,,9,2025-01-16 02:01:15,,,,Even then I hate latency and frame gen is pointless to someone like me It reminds me of the soap opera effect TVs can do when they add more fake frames to make the picture smoother Both increase latency,m7bwq86,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7eo3b8,Exeeter702,,-2,2025-01-16 05:39:58,,,,This doesnt make any sense Games dont suffer from the soap opera effect because they are designed to run at higher frame rates Thats like saying you prefer your games at 30 fps because 60 is a soap opera effect Frame interpolation on tvs has that strange look to it because the source material is almost always sub 30 You are unironically agreeing with the Sony exec that comically said 30 fps in games is more cinematic,m7dqvx0,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7gqefa,None,,0,2025-01-16 15:37:02,,,,Yeah it does Frame interpolation and AI generated frames both are making fake frames that increase latency which increases input lag They arent that dissimilar from each other,m7eo3b8,4.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7gxq1x,Exeeter702,,2,2025-01-16 16:12:47,,,,I didnt say otherwise Im telling you the soap opera effect ie the hyper smooth strange image on tvs from frame interpolation does not exist with video games from a visual standpoint Unless you think the soap opera effect involves artifacting and blurring which DOES exist with frame gen for games but is not what the soap opera effect is The reason its called the soap opera effect is because the frame interpolation on tvs makes the source material look live on set like instead of movie film like since soap operas are shot that way There is no such thing as video game soap opera effect because games are commonly hyper smooth due to naturally running at frames above 60 on principle Again artifacting and latency have nothing to do with the soap opera effect but also are effects of frame interpolation,m7gqefa,5.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7a6u6t,beleidigtewurst,,2,2025-01-15 15:17:58,,,,So whats the point Fake frames are laregly pointless They increase not reduce lag and creating fake frames drops the number of real ones inevitably It kinda sorta maybe makes sense in point and click games but who cares about FPS in thos anyhow,m79x2fx,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7ag2ym,kayak83,,8,2025-01-15 16:04:45,,,,For clarity DLSS itself is an AI resolution upscaler with a few other added techniques like Ray Reconstruction Frame Generation is just that a frame generator adding AI frames between real ones Although Frame Generation became available on DLSS3 and above A bit confusing,m7abwju,3.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7ah1gt,Prodigle,,1,2025-01-15 16:09:37,,,,Frame Gen is still under the DLSS umbrella but Reflex should heavily restrict any added latency and should still perform better than no DLSS no Reflex,m7ag2ym,4.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7cl96x,I_hate_all_of_ewe,,2,2025-01-15 22:12:38,,,,Once is super sampling one is updating a frame They might both use some level of AI but thats where the similarities end I wouldnt bucket them in the same umbrella unless you plan to bucket every AI feature that generated pixels which just seems overly broad,m7ah1gt,5.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7clupx,Prodigle,,0,2025-01-15 22:15:35,,,,I think its totally fine and normal to refer to Frame Gen Super sampling as DLSS Theyre both included in that term Nvidia groups them together as DLSS and its name is DLSS Frame Generation,m7cl96x,6.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7cojnc,lxs0713,,2,2025-01-15 22:29:09,,,,I see a point to frame gen for certain people Lets say you bought a 360hz monitor because you like playing competitive games and want the extra smoothness and faster response time Well what if you also like to play single player games too You already have a high refresh rate display and youve gotten used to the smoothness but with these types of games you cant reach those fps numbers when you turn on all the bells and whistles Well using MFG you can now take that game that runs at 90fps without it and boom you have 360fps now Since its not a competitive title the response time isnt as important especially if you play it on a controller And with a baseline 90fps you already have a decent starting point So for most people MFG will be niche and irrelevant but as more people buy higher refresh rate displays itll start to become more useful The thing about frame gen is that it works better when you already have a high enough starting fps It shouldnt be seen as a tool to bump a 30fps game to 60fps because that will look and feel like crap,m7a6u6t,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7fa6sq,Responsible-Win5849,,1,2025-01-16 09:15:01,,,,Dont most competitive games have super low requirements for that sort of reason Its been a long time since I played cstf2 but Id expect them to run at 400fps on integrated graphics by this point Cant see it helping for the dota knockoff either but never played that at any competitive level,m7cojnc,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7fl4wz,lxs0713,,1,2025-01-16 11:09:21,,,,Yeah they do Thats why Im saying its for the person who bought a high refresh rate monitor 240z and higher to play esports games but then also wants to play more demanding games on that same monitor Theyll be able to run those esports games at super high fps no problem but then when they decide they want to play some Cyberpunk or Alan Wake 2 with path tracing theyll use the multi frame gen to make it look just as smooth even if it means dealing with a bit of input lag,m7fa6sq,4.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7fbm2w,Curse3242,,1,2025-01-16 09:30:34,,,,Exactly Also if I was seriously thinking of buying a 5090 Id wait as long as possible anyways because maybe their new DLSS4 tech works better on already released games but on newer games we still say crazy pixelization jaggeds input delay,m79x2fx,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m8b6h7h,SoftcoreEcchi,,1,2025-01-21 06:47:22,,,,Well part of the issue is that this new frame generation tech can generate up to 3 or 4 frames for every 1 actually rendered by the hardware Weve already started to see games become less optimized and heavily reliant on frame generation to hit reasonable frame rates and its definitely possible this could get worse in the future is one of the concerns Skews benchmarks results too between actual frames rendered and fake frames might want to get a card that can play whatever your favorite game is at 120fps so you go looking up benchmarks only to find that the benchmarks were hitting 120 fps with 4 fake frames and 1 actual frame Now thats a pretty extreme example admittedly but not out of the realm of possibility So it would take 5 frames for an input you made to show up for you as opposed to just 1 frame,m79x2fx,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7effao,Mr_SlimShady,,20,2025-01-16 04:33:43,,,,I am against them being needed in a us2000 card If it cant perform well without these gimmicks then perhaps it shouldnt a be marketed as if it did and 2 cost this fucking much In a us300 card Sure Its great that the technology is there to help On a card that costs as much as a car Hell no It shouldnt be necessary The card should achieve the advertised claims Period They are asking an insane amount of money for the card so it should at least perform enough to warrant the cost,m7a4hav,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7fm2sj,Olde94,,4,2025-01-16 11:18:19,,,,haha yeah i did too I was actually about to say im okay with upscaling but not frame gen But the reality is that im just not happy with the current level of said technology I do prerendered stuff and while we all agree a perfect ray traced render is better boy oh boy is it not worth it compared to using fewer ray samples and then adding a denoise We are talking minutes vs seconds It has allowed me to do animations that would previously not have been possible At my last job i did a factory tour 4 minutes long render so around 6000 frames With denoise it took me what 20 seconds per frame previously that would easily have been 10 minutes we are talking 1000 hours or 40 days full time rendering i would only have been able to provide still frames from a few spots Im amazed at where we are and perhaps framegen wont be bad when games are developed with this in mind from the ground up then again i mainly play single player games soooooooo,m7fg65u,4.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7mgzwa,TheRealPitabred,,1,2025-01-17 13:25:09,,,,Im also ok with upscaling I just want the compressions to be like for like instead of this Is implicitly misleading because while installing works well I can still see a difference Same with this This is me as a relative expert what does this dishonest marketing do for someone who doesnt know the tech realities,m7fm2sj,5.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7di5l0,kentonj,,5,2025-01-16 01:11:20,,,,I have a feeling most people with their nose up about fake frames wouldnt notice the downsides but would enjoy the improvements But even if they couldnt get past it and decided not to make use of the feature at all the 5090 is still more capable than any GPU on the market and will run games with more FPS than any competitor without frame generation To a degree that is more or less commensurate with the price differential from the 4090,m7co6ry,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7eudnp,None,,5,2025-01-16 06:34:53,,,,Itll be game dependent In an RPG where I am moving slow and cautiously exploring It wont be noticeable in a twitch shooter it will be As a 50 year old I no longer play twitch shooters What do I care No one who bought a 40904080 should ever have thought they should need to buy a 50xx It was always going to be a refresh and refreshes generally give a 1520 improvement in real performance Just like me about to buy the 5080 mind you I am upgrading from a 1080 I dont care what the next generation brings because only an idiot or person with more money than sense upgrades every cycle,m7di5l0,4.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7g9u66,Henry5321,,2,2025-01-16 14:08:01,,,,Im very latency sensitive I was reading an article talking about human latency perception and high end FPS gamers were able to notice a dip of a single frame at 300fps on a 300hz monitor So if the game dipped down to 299 for even a brief moment they could reliable indicate that something felt off But consistency is important for perceived responsiveness If the latency is low enough and more consistent it could be an overall win to perception Low enough can vary a lot Generally below 100ms is considered instant but highly trained people or just naturally skilled can notice all the way to around 40ms If I remember correctly,m7eudnp,5.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7k7lu8,fesenvy,,2,2025-01-17 02:10:11,,,,Twitch shooters however run much much easier than single player RPGs theyre not demanding on the GPU and you would turn off frame gen like any other setting that could increase input latency anyway So this sort of tech IS for very taxing single player explorationwhatever games where 30 ms of input latency would never be noticed,m7eudnp,5.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7diueb,BrunoEye,,0,2025-01-16 01:15:18,,,,Yeah but it means many 50 series cards will be poor value if you dont play many games that support it,m7dig4n,6.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7dk2mc,kentonj,,1,2025-01-16 01:22:17,,,,I mean yeah if youre playing NES roms then a 5090 isnt the way to go lol but if youre worried about graphically intensive games that dont have DLSS native support then its still going to do a better job of running it than anything else that exists and you would therefore have to worry a whole lot more about running this hypothetical game on something else,m7diueb,7.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7dlsoh,BrunoEye,,0,2025-01-16 01:32:07,,,,But if youre currently running your games at 144 FPS upgrading to 50 series so you can run them at 165 FPS doesnt seem very necessary,m7dk2mc,8.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7dmsde,kentonj,,2,2025-01-16 01:37:49,,,,Right if you dont have a reason to upgrade dont upgrade If youre happy with how your games run and arent interested in other or future games or running them better then obviously you wouldnt upgrade I was only responding to the idea that one would have to worry about graphically intensive games that dont support DLSS When in reality you would have to worry the least about the 5090 out of anything else that currently exists,m7dlsoh,9.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7bb1dv,DYMAXIONman,,0,2025-01-15 18:34:25,,,,Games will just need to support DLSS 35 and the new Nvidia app change it to a different version The number of generated frames is adjusted in the Nvidia app not the game,m7avx4q,2.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7cpze9,Basshead404,,2,2025-01-15 22:36:23,,,,Thats the issue Higher frame rate increases responsiveness except DLSS frame generation frames Basically if the game doesnt update and fakes it how can your controls update Smooth video but thats it really,m7a2t2l,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7mp63t,Soul-Burn,,1,2025-01-17 14:13:45,,,,Supposedly they use techniques used in VR applications where a frame with depth info can be transformed with your inputs to generate frames Yes the animations dont run but it does make rotation and also movement feel smoother In VR it works fabulously no idea if it works well in desktop games though,m7cpze9,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7c76i2,gokarrt,,1,2025-01-15 21:06:11,,,,the whole idea of fake frames relies on the existence real frames what exactly is real about rendered graphics mfers think gordon freeman is living in their PC and before someone rolls up with well the game itself doesnt know about those frames theyre generated and injected between conventionally rendered frames so it doesnt need to nor does it have any tangible effect on how the inputs are interpreted by the games its a distinction without a difference as long as it feels and looks good,m7a2t2l,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7cfcam,xxxradxxx,,6,2025-01-15 21:44:32,,,,Real one generated then AI generates the next 3 based on the real one trying to predict what you are going to do but then you do something opposite like do 180 turn to simplify things Thats where the delay and stuttering is going to come from Granted say you have 60 real frames so its hard to notice it in 160 of a second but Id definitely feels like something is off for sure best way to describe it is despite you having 240fps it feels like stuttering not like a pure 240 fps performance,m7c76i2,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7d34pb,sinner_dingus,,5,2025-01-15 23:46:55,,,,Thats not how it works the start and end frame are rendered first then the interpolated frames are inserted after the fact Frame gen cant work without knowing the end state of a frame set in advance So essentially you end up with the same latency as if you had a single frame in the frame buffer This is why nvidia advises to only use it on games where you can get at least 60 fps natively,m7cfcam,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7cgfr9,gokarrt,,2,2025-01-15 21:49:39,,,,current frame gen only generates a single frame between conventional so youre talking about the new version it also doesnt attempt to predict it holds the forward frame hence the latency hit ive used it plenty although admittedly while gaming in my livingroom with a controller so that likely masks any floatiness that occurs,m7cfcam,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7cyz6o,tartare4562,,1,2025-01-15 23:23:54,,,,fake as in not based on current data input from the player triggered events physic calculations etc but just extrapolated from the previous state As to why extrapolation doesnt always return meaningful data please see relevant xkcd,m7c76i2,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7d7e1j,gokarrt,,5,2025-01-16 00:10:54,,,,love a good xkcd but considering you know both the beginning and the end state before you generate the frame its not exactly accurate here input can be argued but how much input you think can be missed in 16ms even if youre pushing it at 40fps base framerate thats still only 25ms what do you think happens to your inputs between rendered frames when playing without frame gen,m7cyz6o,3.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7djzdz,elton_john_lennon,,0,2025-01-16 01:21:46,,,,Honestly if the end result looks good is fluid and is responsive Thats the thing it might not be As previous DLSS this one also comes with huge caveats and the more aggresive setting you use the worse it will look but that isnt the main problem and why you should care nVidia wants those DLSS fake frames to be seen as equal to raw power frames and advertises them as such and in the end wants this to be the new normal when it comes to how we see generational jumps between GPU where in reality like I said it isnt as good as raw power even previous DLSS isnt and it was faking much less frames than this new gen and what is more important it is title based So no dev DLSS implementation no fake frame gains And guess what most of the world doesnt have 5000 series so there isnt that much incentive for devs to spend money on this particular implementation where they could lets say make a paid DLC instead in that same time and potentially make money from every player that bought their game It also doesnt work with VR,m7a2t2l,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7d0azp,Infinite_Somewhere96,,-2,2025-01-15 23:31:10,,,,How do you play the games which need high FPS Do you slowly walk through places ever so slightly moving your mouse to look around Or are you running around and driving things taking sharp turns going at fast speeds Dodging things If its the first one thats fine you can be a special snowflake but if its the later then ask yourself why the fake frame demos never show this,m7a2t2l,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7bhz0k,TheTarasenkshow,,5,2025-01-15 19:07:19,,,,In my opinion the games youll want higher frame rates in are the games input latency will be an issue All these fake frames are going to cause input latency and doesnt make sense to me,,0.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7ilzkx,unskilledplay,,0,2025-01-16 21:02:37,,,,Is that true You can already exceed a high end monitors refresh rates in all of the competitive esports games with current hardware that you can buy today Every esport game is intentionally designed around low latency with current hardware The list of games that cannot be rendered at high resolution and high frame rate and highest settings with current hardware is short You have titles like Cyberpunk MS Flight Simulator Minecraft ray tracing and Alan Wake 2 In these titles around 5070ms latency is well within what is acceptable The problem I see is that a meaningful uplift can be seen in only 45 games that anyone who would consider buying one of these cards will have already played 3 or more years ago,m7bhz0k,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7a25ju,Crintor,,23,2025-01-15 14:52:48,,,,There is no downsides to DLSS as it continues to improve in quality frame generation is the one that has an actual downside DLSS is the best thing to happen to gaming performance in a very long time in my opinion the only thing that would make it better would be if they got a way to make it driver level implementation especially with the new higher quality switch to Transformer based models,m7a0w8y,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7a4ibc,drmirage809,,5,2025-01-15 15:05:39,,,,Oh yeah of all the fancy upscaling techniques that weve been seeing enter the scene ever since RT and 4k screens entered the market DLSS is by far the cleanest looking FSR has come a very long way since version 1 and XESS is no slouch either from what Ive seen But theyre both more prone to ghosting and blurring compared to DLSS Ive never messed around with Nvidias frame gen but AMDs is okay I used it to smooth out the framerate when I played The Last of Us and it did a good job there Wouldnt dare use it in something that requires more twitch input however It worked well in a slower paced game and thats probably where its best,m7a25ju,4.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7czelo,Nihlathak_,,3,2025-01-15 23:26:15,,,,It has downsides tho Developers are becoming lazy AF because they are promised almost unlimited performance from both nvidia and epic yet a DLSS game with nanite and lumen becomes a ghosted blurry mess and still running at sub100 fps Now were getting quad framegen on top of that IMO DLSS and framegen should be what enables an optimized game to run at 240 fps and that shouldnt require more than every other frame being generated Instead devs will now look at framegen and think oh boy we can just disregard optimization even more because framegen lets us hit 80 fps anyways,m7a25ju,4.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7akocg,dead_fritz,,1,2025-01-15 16:27:42,,,,While for the majority of situations yeah frame generation and upscaling should perform okay there are plenty of situations and plenty of games where it just breaks down entirely For example in Death Stranding upscaling creates weird ghosting with a lot of this sort of floating elements that exist in that game And Ive recently been playing Horizon Forbidden West which has a lot of swimming in it The upscaling just completely breaks down when its faced with largescale water movement To the point where I had to turn it off because it was actively giving me a headache,m7a25ju,4.0,1i1y9op

comment,m79znfu,nipsen,,1,2025-01-15 14:38:47,,,,Its still the case that Nvidias salespeople have been using free postprocessing filters supersampling antialiasing and now eventually framegeneration as their main selling point since before the 1000series If you actually look at the way the benchmarks have been set up as well its typically a comparison with the competition and with their own competing products for example on ARM that favours postprocessing filters heavily over realtime generated effects Even the raytracingread raycast modules that really are just more complex simdprocessors than the ones normally used has been downplayed heavily because it undercuts the salespitch of get postprocessing for free So its not wrong to say that nvidia has focused on framegeneration for a very long time Or that in spite of their graphics cards having been at many points the best product the main pitch never has been geared towards realtime contexts Which is curious when thats really what games are all about Realtimegenerated content,m79xkfu,3.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7jdowf,SparroHawc,,1,2025-01-16 23:21:09,,,,Thats one of the major complaints about it since it cant actually predict future frames it by necessity introduces interface lag And it cant predict future frames because it doesnt know anything about level geometry so it cant draw for example whats around a corner that youre moving past until theres another frame that reveals it,m7csnuh,8.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7pgx06,SparroHawc,,1,2025-01-17 22:28:05,,,,Nope The only thing the AI has to work off of is the previous frame and the current frame It gets some extra stuff from the renderer like what direction the pixels are moving and what depth theyre rendered at but it knows jackall about whats around the corner Thats why youll see people complaining about weird auras around objects As the objects move around the AI doesnt know whats being revealed around it,m7lc80r,10.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7ah5rm,afurtivesquirrel,,5,2025-01-15 16:10:13,,,,At a really basic level the difference is that simple code does exactly what its supposed to every time It has an entirely predictable output that has been decided by a human and will do it every time given the same inputs AI is a nebulous term but the key difference is that the computer is taught with examples and trained by giving feedback on how close it got to the desired output but the intermediate steps from input to output are a mystery that has been entirely designed by the computer no one has intentionally created or coded for them To use an analogy Imagine me giving you incredibly detailed instructions on how to cook a pavlova Right down to how many strawberries you should place on top This would be normal computer code like vsync It doesnt matter if the pavlova is super super fancy and complicated It also doesnt matter if theres some unpredictability in there like telling you to use between 10 and 14 strawberries The key is that every stage of the instructions was intentionally written by a human AI is like me telling you to make a pavlova with no additional context Maybe I give you some photos of a finished pavlova or even let you taste some but thats it The only feedback you get is by attempting to make one and me saying better or worse Eventually given enough tries you might reach a point where you can make a tasty pavlova 9 times out of 10 Great Mission accomplished But the difference is that I have no idea how you made the pavlova or what steps you took to get there Ill also never entirely know whether its gonna come with kiwis or strawberries Occasionally you might deliver it with tomatoes or even with no fruit at all Or on a dustbin lid No one said you couldnt Maybe you experimented with using a vat of liquid nitrogen to keep it cool rather than a fridge and it seemed to work Maybe you use a barbecue to toast the merangue Maybe all your fruit is sourced from the leftovers of the fancy restaurant next door Ill never know As long as it tastes like a pavlova when it gets to me I dont care Whatever works I guess And when I think about it I also actually have no idea even what you think a pavlova is Do you think its a generic name for any dessert including meringue and fruit Your Pavlovas are super tasty but theyre also always square Is that just because you find them easier or because somewhere along the road I gave great feedback to an attempt that just happened to be square and you got in your head that square was a requirement Do you think they have to be served on a plate Or that they have to be whole If I showed you a photo of a pavlova after it had been dropped on the floor and smashed up would you still know it was a pavlova Does that help at all Edit A perhaps apocryphal example of never knowing how an AI reaches a conclusion is the story of NATO teaching an AI to differentiate between Russian and NATO artillery The expected outcome was that the AI learn would recognise the difference in shapes from the air and very quickly tag satellite photos with any examples of probable Russian artillery movements The AI reached nearperfect identification accuracy in tests but failed miserably when deployed on the battlefield No one could work out why identification was failing so often when seemingly nothing had changed with the quality of input photographs Eventually someone realised that the difference was that the AIs training data was almost exclusively on photos of artillery in fixed defensive positions whereas its real data often included equipment on the move The AI had sifted through all the training data and skipped the part where it learned the different shapes and found a foolproof shortcut instead Russian artillery has its guns pointed west,m7a743g,7.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7ajttx,ChaseballBat,,-1,2025-01-15 16:23:32,,,,It doesnt really matter The 5070 will be able to get pretty much any frame rate you want youll just have to adjust the graphic quality If someone doesnt want to sacrifice quality they can use the DLSS simple It isnt a feature turned on natively as far as I am aware If youre running a 5080 chances are you wouldnt even get to the point where you can get more native frames than what your screen can portray And if you have a 200 htz monitor youre in the 01 of gamers what will also want the cutting edge GPU which a 5090 will definitely get you enough native frames The only people this feature is really for are budget computers or in a decade when the baseline has shifted above what a 5080 can handle anymore,m7a0ytn,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7at5dn,LiamTheHuman,,1,2025-01-15 17:08:57,,,,5090 is supposed to be up to 30 more powerful than a 4090 I cant hit top level frame rates 144 on max settings in a decent amount of games or even 30 lower For instance cyberpunk can only get close to 60 without DLSS So its absolutely relevant and as newer games come out could be even more relevant,m7ajttx,3.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7aaig2,Borghal,,2,2025-01-15 15:36:52,,,,I am not in a uproar about it but it is true that they are fake in at least one sense frames generated in such a way do not respond to player input Eg If you press a button on time after frame 64 and the next three frames are generated then the first time your input is taken into account on screen will be frame 68 So you might be playing at 240 fps but the controls will feel like playing 60 fps Its not an issue with a high enough framerate but it does illustrate how it makes sense to call them fake in a sense,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7dbl8u,Fidodo,,1,2025-01-16 00:34:26,,,,It would be technically possibly for it to be based on player input if the AI model used partial information to inform it on how the next frame will be structured The game needs to know where things will be positioned before theyre rendered Thats a prerequisite to rendering of course So it would be possible for the game to prepare a representation of the next frames movement in a cheap way for the AI to have more information on what to generate This could be movement vectors or a partially rendered frame for example The devil is all in the details though and I cant make heads or tails of the marketing techno babble bullshit that Nvidia puts out and the tech illiterate tech writers of these magazines dont provide any insight into the implementation details either,m7aaig2,2.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7ar5ju,elheber,,2,2025-01-15 16:59:07,,,,Itd be more accurate to call them synthetic frames Theyre interpolated frames not unlike the oft maligned frame smoothing feature that some TVs come with except significantly more advanced However advanced theyre still interpolated frames If you dont like frame smoothing you probably wont like frame generation,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7a41km,arguing_with_trauma,,1,2025-01-15 15:03:05,,,,It is a frame not directly resolved from the games resources it is fake in some legitimate sense Yes people are dumb as well but two things can be Because of that there are aberrations Seems a bit extra to start contemplating the notion of frames pixels and photons edges and polygons and whatnot,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7btet0,YeOldeSandwichShoppe,,1,2025-01-15 20:01:53,,,,This is explained elsewhere in this very thread Frame gen IS different from traditional rendering because it is in effect a visual smoothing effect that isnt a 1 to 1 match to the underlying simulation This can become a problem when the underlying latency is noticeably different from the visuals generated Also graphical fidelity is affected in certain situations If you dont care about these things thats fine frame gen still has drawbacks and can be considered differently than traditional rendering Upscaling too can cause visual artifacts and when used in marketing and benchmark shenanigans obfuscates relative performance of products Of course this isnt black and white Your example of AA is indeed a sort of postprocessing that is applied to some reference image if you will but as a feature it is much more transparent AA isnt used to imply that you can run a game at X fps while in fact parts of the game run much slower It has a direct performance cost and a visual effect so you more or less know what youre getting Vsync absolutely has problems and many avoid using it In certain scenarios like in situations where the hardware is generating frames just under the vsync rate it introduces stuttering Maybe the hyperbolic language fake is a bit much but it points to a real phenomenon Not sure who the dumb one is for not being sensitive to this,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7d8usw,Fidodo,,1,2025-01-16 00:19:09,,,,Theres been many poor quality attempts at frame interpolation in the past so its natural to be wary Its dumb to discount it entirely but its not dumb to request proof Seems like a pretty easy thing to verify though Just show examples of lossless screenshots of a AI generated frames side by side with what they would have looked like rendered so we can judge the accuracy ourselves,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7fbqnk,Curse3242,,1,2025-01-16 09:32:00,,,,The problem is theres no MSAA of framg gen yet Anti Aliasing is faking edges but FXAA looks really really bad Thats with with fake frames the experience gets worse even if its a 1440p image at 240fps It doesnt look or feel that good,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7a9gg4,timmytissue,,1,2025-01-15 15:31:29,,,,I think you are missing the point The frames are fake in the sense that they dont represent an update to the game state They delay the frame with the most updated game state eg mouse movement to add an intermediate frame That intermediate frame has some of that most updated info because its a half step towards it but it still adds latency instead of improving it This is not similar to anything else and I think it makes total sense to call the frames fake,m79yl7e,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7aai8m,Nebuli2,,2,2025-01-15 15:36:50,,,,A That sort of prediction is not as good as you may think B Thats also just straight up not what theyre doing The new frames are always meant to interpolate _between_ frames that have already been rendered They can calculate accurate motion vectors this way precisely because they already know where everything starts and ends over the period for which theyre interpolating frames They _already know_ that those motion vectors are accurate so the effect works reasonably well in this case It would work less well if they tried extending those motion vectors into future frames for which they dont know end positions,m7a1441,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7agrni,timmytissue,,2,2025-01-15 16:08:14,,,,Would be cool IF that was what it did But it doesnt It adds a frame in between two existing frames thereby delaying the real frame by a frame and adding latency If it actually predicted a new frame that might be interesting and useful But that would require some impressive innovations,m7a1441,3.0,1i1y9op
comment,m7a400s,TheGoldenKraken,,2,2025-01-15 15:02:51,,,,DlSS is fine imo The issue is frame gen Frame gen on the 40 series already has some issues Ive seen plenty of artifacting and weird bugs playing through Indiana Jones personally on a 4070 super If there are issues with one fake frame being generated Im a bit worried about 3 frames being generated Also this is less of an issue but not a fan of nvidias marketing showing of crazy numbers that wont be representative of all games,m79wh9j,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7brjr8,SparroHawc,,1,2025-01-15 19:53:00,,,,It becomes much more apparent if you are using a lowpersistence monitor I get perfectly smooth scrolling but any sort of AI scaling or frame generation would cause smearing of text with a scrolling background unless the text is rendered completely separately from the AIgenerated images If youre using a monitor that doesnt strobe the image like CRTs did back in the day the blur you get from that hides a lot of sins,m7a2rx7,3.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7acmoc,timmytissue,,1,2025-01-15 15:47:27,,,,The real issue with frame gen is that it doesnt improve performance so its not recommended below 60fps Most people dont need to play above 60 fps unless they are playing a competitive game in which case you wouldnt want to use frame gen because of the 1 frame lag it introduces Sure I would like to be at 90fps even in a story driven game but thats still for the feel of it and frame gen wont help that Dlss and fsr can take a 30fps experience into a 50fps experience Frame gen is not even usable in these cases This is when you actually need the performance help So I struggle to see the use case for anyone who knows how it actually works,m79wh9j,1.0,1i1y9op

comment,m7csgtn,VRGIMP27,,1,2025-01-15 22:49:08,,,,I think a better way to think of frame interpolation or frame generation is as a new form of motion blur reduction that is ideal for LCD and OLED displays LCD and OLED displays draw the frame in a way that is called sample and hold That means the liquid crystals get an electrical signal and either open or close to let light pass through or block light and they hold that position until the next refresh cycle For OLED it means the pixels switch once every refresh cycle and thats how you get the image on the screen Unless you strobe the back light or you insert a black frame on an OLED you get really crappy resolution in motion Your 4K monitor or 1080p momitor without motion blur reduction only gives you 400 lines or 400 pixels per second in fast motion Thats about the resolution of a VHS tape This is really bad for motion resolution and smooth scrolling images unless you have a very high brute force frame rate Think of motion blur like the shutter on a camera A frame rate of 240 Hz means that a single frame is visible to your eye for 416 ms That translates to 416 pixels of motion blur per 1000 pixels per second of motion I have a 1080P monitor that I have over clocked to 180 frames per second 180 frames per second is 55 ms of frame visibility time This means that in a fast moving image my 1080P panel is actually only resolving 1200 pixels per second in fast motion if and only if I can maintain a refresh rate of 180 frames per second In Laymans terms that means my 1080 P display is only showing me 720 P resolution in fast motion And thats only true if the frame rate stays locked at 180 frames per second and never drops even one frame These fake frames from Nvidia mean your display is actually going to get closer to actually being able to show you a high definition image when the picture is moving which if you ask me the monitor should be able to do on its own Monitors have not been able to show us high resolution images in motion since the days of analog tube displays Dont think of this as fake frames think of it as a way to actually make your monitor show you the resolution that it is claiming it is capable of,,0.0,1i1y9op
