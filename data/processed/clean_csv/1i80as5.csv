comment,m8phwmk,FlatusSurprise,,-5,2025-01-23 11:37:27,,,,Not always a larger pixel size allows each pixel to capture more light at lower ISO levels and reduces grainynoisy images This is why it has become more common for smartphone cameras to group a complex of four pixels into a single pixel on an image,m8phhis,2.0,1i80as5

comment,m8pki3i,danielv123,,10,2025-01-23 11:59:01,,,,Yet more smaller pixels combined often turn out better than one large pixel This is why smartphone cameras combine smaller pixels instead of using a lower resolution sensor,m8phwmk,3.0,1i80as5
comment,m8pnzos,RomanPenguin,,3,2025-01-23 12:26:11,,,,And smart phones have way better software and processors built in so they can deal with the unbelievable amount of data you get from more pixels Larger pixels and less pixels help with continuous shooting less overheating potentially better battery life as a result There are always tradeoffs whether its worth it depends on you and the manufacturer,m8pki3i,4.0,1i80as5

comment,m8rohsy,AARonDoneFuckedUp,,3,2025-01-23 18:38:03,,,,I dont think the best processor is going to keep up with typical SLR burst mode My phone takes a couple seconds to post process a 50MP capture into an image SLR users expect 35 frames per second Itd need to run 10100x faster than my phone with 2x more data It could be done but it sounds more likely theyd shoot faster in RAW and offload the processing on a computer where they dont have to worry about battery life,m8ppp2z,6.0,1i80as5
comment,m8porpo,Zed_or_AFK,,3,2025-01-23 12:31:54,,,,Some of the latest iPhones pretty much use 4 pixels of the CMOS to create 1 pixel of data unless you change the settings of the camera to use full resolution So 4x more light per pixel but at the expense of the resolution Unless you are outside in a well lit daylight or in a well lit studio quality of the 4x images are better than what you get with the full res In well lit environments smaller pixels do work well I have tested some 100 MP phone cameras and they are pretty impressive in the right scenarios iPhones have up to 48 MP More pixels can actually be more beneficial even when they become smaller Daylit scenery with a camera stand for instance Or some megalit facotry settings in a production line for quality control,m8phwmk,3.0,1i80as5
comment,m8sng7t,Business__Socks,,4,2025-01-23 21:16:52,,,,I hate that they market this as 48mp It does technically have that many photosites but when you factor in the bayer filter its basically 12mp Youre not getting 48mp unless you shoot in black and white and even then its not the same as a regular 48mp mono sensor Computational photography is nice for the gram but for the most part its bs,m8porpo,4.0,1i80as5
comment,m8qqtt2,ronimal,,1,2025-01-23 16:03:55,,,,Thats neat but this particular image sensor is still for industrial scientific applications not for photography,m8phwmk,3.0,1i80as5
comment,m8qk0vi,shawnington,,1,2025-01-23 15:31:16,,,,It also increases the color resolution since the pixels can just be straight binned and treated as one pixel that can sense 3 colors without debayering as opposed to having every pixel detect luminance and one of 3 colors,m8phwmk,3.0,1i80as5
comment,m8snwo4,Business__Socks,,1,2025-01-23 21:18:55,,,,That is not accurate each panel of the bayer filter covers all 4 photosites Youre getting 4 red blue or green Not 4 of red blue and green,m8qk0vi,4.0,1i80as5
comment,m8svd0k,shawnington,,2,2025-01-23 21:52:37,,,,Thats not what I said at all In a binned lower res photo you are combining 1 blue 1 red and 2 green sensor sites in most cases into one pixel at the most basic The raw data has full resolution for luminosity 05 resolution for green and 025 resolution for red and blue Constructing an image from raw sensor data involves debayering to interpolate approximate values for an ideal sensor that can sense the three components at teach pixel site With a binned image the color resolution for each component is 100 of the output resolution as you are combining all the component pixels of a bayer grid into a single virtual pixel,m8snwo4,5.0,1i80as5
comment,m8va1ct,TheWarCow,,1,2025-01-24 06:12:24,,,,Correct except regarding luminosity resolution You cannot have that with any kind of color array in front of the sensor,m8svd0k,6.0,1i80as5
comment,m8xavd1,Business__Socks,,1,2025-01-24 15:34:35,,,,Sorry but no In the context of smartphone sensors you are binning 4 pixels that are all covered by a single panel of the bayer filter So you are binning 4 green OR 4 blue OR 4 red Not a combination of the three,m8svd0k,6.0,1i80as5
comment,m8xlgiy,shawnington,,1,2025-01-24 16:23:59,,,,I suspect you saying the same thing as me but perhaps just misremembering the layout of a bayer array a typical bayer array is a 4 pixel box that is laid out rggb or bggr as follows r g g b When I say bin a bayer site it is taking this grid of 4 pixels and treating them as one virtual pixel What you are suggesting is not a viable way of binning since you have twice as many greens as reds and blues and due to the physical layout of a bayer array the only viable binning strategy is to bin an entire filter site together as a virtual pixel To better understand why that is you have to consider that a row of pixels either has red and green or blue and green pixels never all three r g r g r g r g g b g b g b g b As you can see it would be very strange to bin just the reds and just the blues together as you would need 3 rows to get a square of reds or blues instead of 2 Instead you bin the square bayer array r g r g r g r g g b g b g b g b,m8xavd1,7.0,1i80as5
comment,m8xmird,Business__Socks,,1,2025-01-24 16:28:49,,,,I understand what I am saying and I understand what bayer filters and binning are I am describing the quad pixel hocus pocus in some newer cell phones Photosites in groups of 4 are all covered by a single panel of the bayer filter So you have a group of 4 photosites that are all gathering either red blue OR green data Regular bayer filters are as you describe but that is not what I am talking about,m8xlgiy,8.0,1i80as5
comment,m8y2c22,shawnington,,1,2025-01-24 17:41:39,,,,Then we are talking about fundamentally different things Those physically binned pixels are still however arranged into a bayer array as you correctly state,m8xmird,9.0,1i80as5
comment,m8pstf9,lucellent,,8,2025-01-23 13:00:00,,,,Both are still important Otherwise by your logic a 35mm sensor with 1 pixel should outperform a 24mm sensor with 12MP,m8pdwzq,1.0,1i80as5

comment,m8pptav,alexanderpas,,2,2025-01-23 12:39:24,,,,You can still use the same trick smartphones use and use 4 physical pixel for 1 logical pixel for low light photography or use the full 11 resolution in well lit studio photography,m8pgitj,1.0,1i80as5
comment,m8rbw4u,notusuallyhostile,,2,2025-01-23 17:40:53,,,,Youre getting downvoted but youre not wrong A sensors dynamic range is fundamentally limited by its physical characteristics size pixel pitch and pixel density Smaller pixels can capture fewer photons during a given exposure which results in less dynamic range since theres less data per pixel to work with Granted things like BSI are significant improvements over standard CMOS but they still dont defy physics you can only get so much information in a single pixel so the larger the pixel the more data you have to work with For example I own several Canon cameras with different sensor sizes an original EOS1D Mark I with a 4 MP APSH sensor a Rebel XSi with a 12 MP APSC sensor and an EOS 5D Mark III with a 22 MP fullframe sensor Of these the 1D produces the best raw dynamic range because its pixels are significantly larger However this comes at the cost of resolutionwhile I can get a good 20x24 print from the 1D anything larger starts to look grainy On the other hand the shadows and highlights in the 1Ds raw files are noticeably more detailed and recoverable compared to the 5D Mark III even without any postprocessing in Lightroom That being said one of the biggest advancements in camera technology over the past decade has been in computational and incamera processing Modern cameras can extract far more dynamic range and detail than older models with similar or even larger sensors While there are physical limitations to what can be achieved with small pixels or compact sensors the software and processing that occur between capturing an image and saving it have become so advanced that sensor size and pixel density are less critical than they used to be Ive taken images with my iPhone 16 Pro Max which has a sensor much smaller than any of my APSC cameras Thanks to computational photographymultiframe stacking and advanced HDR basically ondevice Lightroom the dynamic range and resolution is almost always comparable to what I get from a consumer DSLR But thats the result of processing inside the iPhone not the sensor itself But there are times when even really powerful software cant compensate for things like very low light I would argue that larger sensors still have a clear advantage due to their ability to capture more light and produce cleaner images,m8pgitj,1.0,1i80as5

comment,m8sdjza,notusuallyhostile,,-1,2025-01-23 20:31:59,,,,I agree with you but your point was not his point even if his comment was more appropriate for a DSLR thread Bigger pixels make better images Smaller pixels introduce more noise and the images are flatter with less dynamic range Is that important in an industrial setting Possibly not But it doesnt negate the validity of his point I was just affirming that Not trying to pick sides or be disagreeable,m8sbttf,5.0,1i80as5
comment,m8sefx3,dwiedenau2,,3,2025-01-23 20:36:06,,,,He said they would get shit results from this sensor No they wont they would get exactly the results they want from choosing a sensor with such a high resolution,m8sdjza,6.0,1i80as5

comment,m8tvp19,QuickQuirk,,1,2025-01-24 00:56:02,,,,Downsampling a modern hi resolution sensor to a lower resolution of an older sensor and you usually get as good if not better dynamic range and noise characteristics The photons arent lost after all Theyre just being measured as data with a more precise location,m8rbw4u,2.0,1i80as5
comment,m8vbaj2,TheWarCow,,1,2025-01-24 06:22:59,,,,The point you dont address in your comment is that this matters on a perpixel level but doesnt matter all that much for that global image Combining multiple pixel into bigger groups will produce very similar results unless the pixel pitch is already on the extremely small size where absolute limits of current technology become more and more important Overall sensor size plays the much bigger role because that determines how much information can be collected In an ideal world its just 100 transparency from there aka trying to lose as little of it as you can Some examples regarding noise not DR because its easier to tell you can easily validate using online samples Full frame sensors outperform APSC sensors with the same pixel or smaller pitch a7R45 a6700 various M43 low MP cams Full frame sensors with vastly different pixel pitches perform similarly a7R45 a7 4 a7S3 Basically sensor size scales almost perfectly while pixel pitch just shifts the equation a bit regarding noise Its a similar story with DR but there we cannot just quadruple a full frame sensor and immediately get a whole stop more DR,m8rbw4u,2.0,1i80as5

comment,m8siz6p,Business__Socks,,1,2025-01-23 20:56:44,,,,It depends entirely on what your use case is and what focal length you are imaging at Remember this is not a consumer grade sensor To be more specific and give a real example consider astrophotography A sensor with a wide angle lens may be undersampled because any single star doesnt cover enough photosites pixels are in screens not sensors to get good resolution That same sensor with a long focal length could be oversampled because the star covers more photosites than it needs to for good resolution Its a balance that you need not just the smallest or biggest pohotosites In this example youd want smaller photosites with the short focal length and bigger photosites for the long focal length There is no best size It is very subjective,m8pgitj,1.0,1i80as5
