comment,mkiciun,TremendouslyRegarded,,1178,2025-03-30 12:39:24,,,,This model of business needs to die Only way to kill it is to stop buying it which is why they resort to these scumbag tactics of selling it without these paywalls and introduce them later The other alternative is to jailbreak these devices if such an exploit even exists,,0.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mklhrk0,Notgreygoddess,,156,2025-03-30 22:56:34,,,,Coming from the generation that went from vinyl to 8track to cassette to CDs to streaming music its nice having physical discs that corporations cant delete or alter We embraced many new technologies but also had the bitter experience of giving up tv antennas for cable promising it would be commercial free It was a good lesson in there is no such thing as a free lunch,mkiciun,1.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkmb3im,Chimbo84,,5,2025-03-31 01:56:33,,,,This is why open source is so important Theres a big blowup in 3D printing with Bambu Labs pulling the same shit and locking down functionality albeit not behind a paywall,mkiciun,1.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkoqt5g,zAbso,,-1,2025-03-31 14:05:31,,,,That big blow up is because people spread misinformation and speculation There is nothing theyre locking down in regards to functionality They want to introduce safety features by limiting direct access to the printer from nonsigned applications In doing that though they provided a middle man application so that users can continue using other slicers to prep their files they just wont be able to talk directly to the printer anymore At least that was the case before they backpedaled a little and added Developer mode options but made it clear that its on the user if something goes wrong In other words they dont want potential malicious actors to have unrestricted access to someones printer anymore If you think people can govern themselves accordingly watch this video of a guy downloading Orca slicer from a nonaffiliated site and connect it directly to his printer thinking he was doing things correctly The whole point of his video was to act in defiance to the coming optional firmware update Even trying to show others how to do it All the while he acted as the perfect example as to why theyd want to do these changes to begin with The average person does not know how to protect themselves or their tech Theres more to it with a change in their TOS verbiage but its literally them saying theyll be doing what most other hardware companies do when installing firmware updates We see it all the time but people suddenly forgot how their other tech works People that dont understand or simply want to hate on the company tried to spin it into something that it never was If you want an example of what could go wrong heres a post of someone that recently lost their home due to faulty components,mkmb3im,2.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mklb1ec,OpenSourcePenguin,,2,2025-03-30 22:16:47,,,,See you are considering updating as just bug fixes Sometimes updates add features too unannounced unpromised It has become rare but that is a possibility,mkla8kt,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mklp412,thisischemistry,,2,2025-03-30 23:39:10,,,,Yes thats always a possibility You have to judge it on a casebycase basis but lately companies seem to add complexity and annoyances rather than improve their products Generally Ill turn off updates and keep an eye on new ones that are announced If they look good then Ill consider updating,mklb1ec,5.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mknchy9,ElfjeTinkerBell,,1,2025-03-31 07:01:12,,,,What about security updates New risks pop up every day,mkla8kt,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkohtc3,thisischemistry,,0,2025-03-31 13:14:02,,,,Theres hardly any risk if you dont connect the device directly to the internet at that point youre looking at local risks and they are very unlikely on a device like this The article shows a watch and I believe these dont have a cellular modem in them so they work through your phone Your phone OS should certainly be updated to the latest security updates and it should serve as the watchs gateway to the internet Any app that connects from your phone to the watch should be properly sandboxed to protect it from exploits Security updates on a watch connected like this are not likely to be necessary in any major way Im sure they can serve as vectors for attacks but they are likely to be minor concerns compared to the bigger targets such as phones and computers As usual you have to evaluate each device and judge the risks accordingly Its like traveling each mode of transportation has its risks and benefits Do you use a roll cage three point harness helmet protective gear and such when youre driving your car to work Sure its safer but its overkill On the other hand if you work as a Formula 1 driver then it makes total sense,mknchy9,5.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkiyiil,LetsJerkCircular,,-60,2025-03-30 14:56:13,,,,Im conflicted The article explains that the plus plan offers stuff in addition to whats already free As in it would not exist without the added cost If the services included with the cost of the device remain decent and the services included with the premium subscription satisfy demands of users then theres nothing to fault Iflike people are expressing worries aboutGarmin starts moving formerlyincluded features to the other side of the paywall then they should absolutely suffer out of principle Excessive greed should die and Im right there with anyone else whos trying to suffocate it,mkiciun,1.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjn0f8,Oops_I_Cracked,,58,2025-03-30 17:04:28,,,,I think the part of the response youre ignoring is that there were already plenty of fitness tracking devices available with subscriptions and Garmin devices tend to be a bit more expensive relative to devices with identical hardware but they did not have a subscription So people sort of thought that was what they weee buying into Paying a bit more upfront with the knowledge there is no subscription to access features their device supports even if that was never explicitly stated People are upset because Garmin was basically the last buy once option left in the fitness tracking space Pretty much everyone else already required a sub to unlock all the features Garmin grew themselves an antisubscription fan base and then introduced a subscription,mkiyiil,2.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjrmc3,LetsJerkCircular,,5,2025-03-30 17:27:46,,,,That makes sense I was pretty unfamiliar with Garmins included features The article made the subscription seem reasonable and added caution for the future but no alarm yet If a company makes a product that is good quality and lasts a long time it makes sense that theyd look for some recurring revenue to pay for the services they offer Otherwise they would rely on device sales to pay for everything Ive had an Apple Watch for seven years and dont pay for Fitness Plus The free features work for me But most Garmin Watch users Ive spoken with did tout it as a superior product for people who are into fitness outdoors etc Please accept my adjacent dispassionate take everyone in the thread,mkjn0f8,3.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkk38x1,OriginalUseristaken,,4,2025-03-30 18:26:01,,,,The thing is you dont need any server or other stuff Garmin has to pay for The app is on my mobile device it connects to the watch thats it,mkjrmc3,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkkj5e3,Oops_I_Cracked,,2,2025-03-30 19:47:32,,,,Apple is a bit different because part of the Apple Watch is supporting their whole ecosystem If the best wearable exclusively works with their own phones youre more likely to get an iPhone if you want a smart watch If you get an iPhone they get any ad andor purchase revenue you generate in apps on your phone So Apple does not care if you get Fitness as much as say Samsung or now Garmin care if you get their subs And I can tell you firsthand this works After trying many different wearables on android I ended up switching to the iPhone so I could have an Apple Watch because I was very interested in trying what was generally regarded as the best wearable And I am now relatively locked into their ecosystem,mkjrmc3,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjzkio,ZiKyooc,,4,2025-03-30 18:07:12,,,,From the article description the paid service is on top of what they were already offering and it doesnt seem that the basic functions will be phased out I have a Fenix 6 and I have no interest in the paid functionalities,mkjn0f8,3.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkkmhhk,juniorone,,4,2025-03-30 20:04:40,,,,This is the flaw with people They get smacked all the time but believe that the other one is unique and wont follow the same trajectory The reality is that the pandora box is open From all the history of capitalism you can already expect that they will eventually follow what others are doing Why Because its profitable Its like when the ex president wanted to raise the minimum federal wage Tons of states came out with the propaganda that it will lead to higher prices of goods So it got dropped What happened Price of goods doubled while the minimum wage stayed the same This problem repeats so much that I dont understand why people fall for that shit,mkki0x6,5.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkl4lg9,alxrenaud,,1,2025-03-30 21:40:12,,,,In a way you are saying they were right Companies got away with increasing prices without increasing wages They got some flack and blamed the cost of material international supply chain issues the pandemic etc which is not all wrong by the way lets be realistic Now they would increase it again and blame the wages Everyone against capitalism always say it the revenues need to grow each year Pretty easy either you cut costs or you increase the price Early on subscriptions were even fine Nobody could afford Photoshop before so wither you stole it or you made without Subs helped a lot of people to amortize the cost Streaming services make sense even if they increase the price all the time they are still 2030 of the price of cable where I live for the full 4k no ads For Garmin eh I really cannot think of what more I could need that they could hide behind a paywall unless they want to compete against Strava or something which I would also never pay for Illgive the the benefit of the doubt for now already have a watch not much I can do As long as they keep the paywall for useless AI features and badges good for them and whoever thinks its worth it If they release a new flagship watch and you have to pay for anything that is currently free I will not buy it simple as that,mkkmhhk,6.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkmy01o,ZiKyooc,,1,2025-03-31 04:42:53,,,,I had a Fitbit some time ago which has subscription options for years and it was entirely possible to use it without the subscription,mkki0x6,5.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkjpsah,StarGazer_SpaceLove,,6,2025-03-30 17:18:25,,,,Ancestry is a great example of this exactly You signed up for free to access a plethora of data and tree building and you purchased extras like DNA testing or world records Then they locked all records making the hints useless unless you subscribe Then they started locking bits and pieces of the DNA tools Now its basically entirely useless unless you have a subscription Half the links then also require you to have at minimum an account or another subscription to access the actual data linked You can see your DNA matches your trees and a few comp tools still but for record searching you gotta sub an arm and a leg across 2000 accounts to do anything worthwhile anymore,mkiyiil,2.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkiyu6m,Lyelinn,,28,2025-03-30 14:58:01,,,,Yeah yeah Next theyll start locking basic features because haha need more money then what They are already a pricy product,mkiyiil,2.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkizcwp,LetsJerkCircular,,-3,2025-03-30 15:00:49,,,,Its right there in the third section of my comment Please read stuff instead of lashing back so quickly I do not support Garmin one way or the other and I dont subscribe to very many services But I do pay for some stuff that has value to me,mkiyu6m,3.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjnb65,Newspeak_Linguist,,10,2025-03-30 17:06:00,,,,Please read stuff instead of lashing back so quickly Its because youre bloviating about simple concepts everyone understands We all know what Garmin says theyre going to do and we all know what we expect them to do So people are complaining about it The article says there will be special badges on the paid plan Fucking badges Clip art There arent added costs for making new badges its a money grab If this subscription plan doesnt fail spectacularly there will be currently free features moved to the paid plan within 1 2 years,mkizcwp,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjysk7,vadapaav,,2,2025-03-30 18:03:17,,,,This is a very standard model of industry where the existing free version continuously keeps getting badly managed lacks feature updates and regular maintenance with users eventually passively motivated to buy a maintained software,mkizcwp,4.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkjhz3e,TremendouslyRegarded,,9,2025-03-30 16:38:35,,,,Thats a rational take I guess Reddit disagrees I mostly take issue with the pay per month model in general though sell me a gadget for one up front cost features should never be a subscription imo with rare exceptions for things like cell data or something outside of simple software features,mkiyiil,2.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mki5wbz,None,,734,2025-03-30 11:45:56,,,,I have a feeling that a lot of great previously included features are going to get slowly tucked behind this paywall Garmins whole upside was the fact that you bought the device and you owned it fully Truly unfortunate,mkhznt2,1.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkkbu80,TheLuminary,,11,2025-03-30 19:09:34,,,,Going to hard disagree with you Records Tapes was a huge usability upgrade I dont know anyone who had a record player in their car Tapes CDs was a huge music quality density and durability upgrade Especially once we got antiskip features figured out CDs MP3s was the best upgrade and IMO when the music playing capped out Having a 20 GB hard drive in your trunk and having access to thousands of songs was amazing Everything after that has been pretty bad but mostly optional You dont have to use subscription music if you dont want to,mkieepg,5.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkpfr7e,TheLuminary,,1,2025-03-31 16:12:16,,,,I agree with this but this is not inherit in improving the music playing generation It is just artists taking advantage to gut their legacy,mkoctci,7.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkiv5b3,goodnames679,,33,2025-03-30 14:37:27,,,,Tbf there were legitimate improvements with each step though Records were very nonportable and couldnt be played in cars so tapes made sense Tapes werent very dense so CDs as an upgrade made sense and you didnt really have to replace your tape player immediately since tape players remained in cars till like the mid 00s MP3 players were absurdly more dense and could hold your whole library in one device plus you could add your music from your tapesCDs to them pretty easily Streaming services reduced the hassle of transferringdownloading songs and organizing your library plus the upfront cost was gone If you add at least 12 a CDs worth of music to your library per month you come out ahead by using a music streaming service What were seeing currently with much of the tech world is a complete worsening of their product with practically no upside Its a hell of a lot worse,mkieepg,5.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkivzui,ReaditTrashPanda,,0,2025-03-30 14:42:15,,,,Depends Garmin gives you a Lot of data that watches historically never did Its becoming the norm but not a requirement Some would argue this is improvement over basic watches that dont show heart rate or other exercise metrics so devils advocate says its justified they charge regularly for features above and beyond the standard basic watches,mkiv5b3,6.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkiykku,goodnames679,,11,2025-03-30 14:56:33,,,,Sure there are still cases where youre getting more for the subscription fees Im more specifically talking about the widespread pandemic of companies taking existing featuresproducts and locking them behind subscriptions though And honestly in this specific instance nothing they listed sounds like its actually worth the subscription fee For now you dont have to have the subscription but often in situations like this theyre testing the waters before they introduce future products that do require the sub just to function,mkivzui,7.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkj0nr6,ReaditTrashPanda,,4,2025-03-30 15:07:51,,,,Its required now it sounds like Its locked away behind the Connect option Wild honestly I was thinking of switching away from Apple and garmin battery life is stellar But this totally ruins that Infinite payments for a watch that goes bad in 23 years from battery degradation is not worth it,mkiykku,8.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkio6bj,idiot-prodigy,,10,2025-03-30 13:57:21,,,,The subscription model for music seems better Have use of all the music for 72year Except when companies lose the license to the music and your library gets nuked This has already happened to people who collected digital libraries of films by purchasing licenses The company inevitably folds and the access to your library is gone Hard copies or locally stored digital copies are the only insurance against this,mkikl9z,6.0,1jn9pqk
comment,mkiqs7d,thegreatgazoo,,7,2025-03-30 14:12:41,,,,Generally thats when people buy digital copies on top their subscription For instance buying a movie or book on Amazon Prime Those are at risk of disappearing But physical media fails as well A record or CD can get scratched A tape can stretch The devices that can play them can be discontinued,mkio6bj,7.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkjkbyg,thegreatgazoo,,1,2025-03-30 16:50:49,,,,Sure But compared to say the Blockbuster model of charging about 13rd of retail to rent a movie and screwing you over if you kept it too long digital is a bargain To me Id rather rent movies and music because for movies I generally dont watch them more than once and I get bored of albums pretty quickly Plus the media takes a lot of space and generally has a lousy resale value That said if I was a collector Id absolutely want physical copies In particular your can hand them down to descendants when you pass Though personally my parents CD collection went in the trash she passed,mkiwb1e,9.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkkbuns,None,,1,2025-03-30 19:09:38,,,,I have a Tundra with built in Nav I think it is Garmin but Im not sure because Ive never used it Only use Google Maps or an alternative But I do use a Garmin dog tracker I live on a farm and let my dog roam free but I want to know where he is in case he gets too close to the road about 250M from the house in the closest direction This means I use a collar an Alpha 10 an app and my watch The Alpha 10 does not allow me to set a geofence as near as I can tell but constantly warns me he has exited the geofence Even though it is set to keep only the last few minutes of tracking the app will frequently every few minutes explode with all tracking information since I last installed it a few weeks ago Because of spurious warnings I cannot disable dog has treed quarry etc the watch will alert constantly and drain the battery in about a day unless I disable all the alerts Garmin support is useless as well,mkka6hb,2.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mki51j9,skinte1,,7,2025-03-30 11:38:34,,,,Why They do the exact same thing by forcing you to pay for apps As an example the Oceanic subscription for being able to use the Ultra as a dive computer something Apple advertised when releasing the Ultra is 10month Maybe you dont need that but same likely goes for some of the functions Garmin is locking,mkhzdmb,1.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkint5w,IngeniousGent,,-1,2025-03-30 13:55:09,,,,As a software developer I dont see anything wrong with this If the free experience becomes sidelined then Id be upset But this subscription service is adding a new feature that will compete against the likes of Stravas paid feature AI is not cheap This is not a feature everyone would want but providing this feature will cost Garmin more money The people that want this feature should have to pay the cost,,0.0,1jn9pqk

comment,mkikbf7,afurtivesquirrel,,3,2025-03-30 13:33:20,,,,The problem is the direction of the brand My watch still gets updates with new features every now and then Its one of the great things I love about it and one of the reasons I bought it Chances are any new updates will be paid only Also the app UX will 100 change It will pivot to pushing these features down your throat and trying to entice you to subscribe instead of just showing you your stats Thatll be shit And Im on Garmin 3 Every one is rock solid buy once enjoy til it dies buy a new Garmin Yes youre right the feature set of my current Garmin will probably remain But there wont be a new Garmin for me And that sucks because for more than a decade theyve been rock solid with a user friendly business model Sure there is no reason to be entitled to a new feature thats released Your base set of features is all youre entitled to But a company that previously went above and beyond deciding to scale that back and do the bare minimum is still reason to be sad especially when youre deep in their ecosystem Companies that do this also have a real history of saying that everything you currently have is staying but somehow you find yourself three years later and thats not quite true and youre not quite sure how you got there,mki4m81,1.0,1jn9pqk
