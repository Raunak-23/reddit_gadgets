comment,m5yrhyz,BShotDruS,,1,2025-01-08 00:11:13,,,,Yep thats what has been shown in some Ryzen and Intel configs with rebar that are older but not as old as say a 2600x so its weird Maybe just an architecture thing or a driver issue dunno Im sure well find out since many people will be testing this Some tests show the 4060 whooping the B580s butt in some games when paired with an older CPU B580 was in the 30s and 4060 was in the 5060s fps wise in some games Thats pretty bad lol damn,m5q572j,6.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5q1dqa,cafk,,8,2025-01-06 17:05:48,,,,It allows faster data loading over PCIe between components By default data size accessible via PCIe is limited to 256mb meaning larger data sets require multiple calls to load it all and determining the file size and number of calls with rebar its configurable to directly access and load 2gb depending on PCIe version in one go Ie instead of CPU loading texture to memory and then transfer it to the GPU its possible for the GPU to directly stream data from SSD to GPU memory,m5puaiy,5.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5q6yrp,VerifiedPersonae,,3,2025-01-06 17:33:09,,,,So this is like the equivalent of modding a car for more air intake 99 of people dont need it but if you feel like tweaking out on small percentages of performance improvements it could be of interest,m5q1dqa,6.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5qjrzh,cafk,,6,2025-01-06 18:35:13,,,,With the data sets modern games use its relevant high detail textures shaders and models require permanent access to data and Intel has optimized their GPUs drivers to work with rebar and sam which enable loading data in bursts over in segments Basically making loading any kind of data to GPU dependent on this technology Its not turning but building the GPU and drivers to expect those features to be available from the ground up over creating fallback methods to handle it otherwise Or think of it other way an ice built for forced injection will work better with forced injection over being naturally aspirated,m5q6yrp,7.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5tj9c9,Emu1981,,1,2025-01-07 04:06:26,,,,Ie instead of CPU loading texture to memory and then transfer it to the GPU its possible for the GPU to directly stream data from SSD to GPU memory Resizeable Bar basically makes the entire GPU VRAM addressible by the CPU at the same time instead of only having up to 256mb chunks being addressable at any one time It makes no other changes Directly streaming data from storage to VRAM is not possible on PCs with consumer GPUs Data still needs to be copied from storage to system RAM and then from system RAM to VRAM even with DirectStorage All DirectStorage does is enables better transfer rates between fast storage and system RAM by optimising the access and transfer of small files from storage into RAM Copying data directly to VRAM is possible on the consoles because the GPU and CPU share memory so the only real difference is that the data is copied to RAM blocks that are allocated to the GPU rather than RAM that is allocated to the CPU Nvidia does have GPUDirect Storage which allows GPUs to access storage directly and transfer data via DMA but it is only supported on their enterprise compute cards like the Tesla and Quadro models eg A100 V100 T4 I am sure that AMD has something similar for their compute cards,m5q1dqa,6.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5q0k46,trs-eric,,5,2025-01-06 17:01:44,,,,Rebar improves memory speed by making it possible to access graphics memory all at the same time instead of smaller chunks It can improve both cpu and gpu performance substantially on intel cards It also improves performance on other cards too,m5puaiy,5.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5p1bln,PotusThePlant,,7,2025-01-06 13:43:21,,,,Its not a support issue because it still underpferforms with supported cpus Read the article,m5ot0u9,1.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5pguop,LupusDeusMagnus,,26,2025-01-06 15:20:55,,,,No youre the one who should read it The article is clear that intel ARC support is 10th gen plus or AMD Series 5000 plus Intel ARC supports 10th gen plus or 5000 series plus They are testing with series 2000 3000 and 9th gen not officially supported In the Intel site they say those gens mobos with ReBARSAM That has been so since the Alchemist family If Intel is going to manage to add support to older ReBARSAM enabled CPUsMOBO its another story,m5p1bln,2.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5plpot,PotusThePlant,,7,2025-01-06 15:46:51,,,,ReBARSAM works even with Ryzen 1000 Even disregarding that they also tested with 5000 and 7000 AMD cpus Theres a very significant difference even with those cpus Since reading the article seems troublesome for you heres an image To summarize it even more With a 7600 the RTX 4060 gets 90126 and the B580 gets 80114 If you change the cpu for a 9800X3D ridiculous cpus to use with that gpu the 4060 gets 90127 basically same performance and the B580 skyrockets to 105152,m5pguop,3.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5ptyy4,LupusDeusMagnus,,-10,2025-01-06 16:29:12,,,,Youre either really confused or changing the subject My original comment was about the performance drop in some games when coupled with a nonsupported CPUs and the possibility of future patching to expand compatibility I did not make a comparison to Nvidias cards or its performance with newer CPUs,m5plpot,4.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5q2bm1,FreshPrinceOfNowhere,,19,2025-01-06 17:10:27,,,,Oh my god WATCH THE ORIGINAL VIDEO ALREADY It specifically addresses that 1 ReBAR works perfectly fine on unsupported CPUs exactly as it does on supported ones and results in large performance uplifts on BOTH 2 the above is has been known for ages 3 the issue currently being discussed has NOTHING to do with ReBAR and NOTHING to do with whether ReBAR support is official or not 4 rather it is about the B580s performance being heavily dependent on raw CPU power a LOT more so than Nvidia or AMD cards In the video at 837 you can clearly see that there is a MASSIVE difference between a 9800X3D 7600X and an 5700X3D obviously all three have official ReBAR support when using a B580 where you would normally expect to have zero CPU bottlenecking with a mdrange GPU Meanwhile a 4060 performs identically across all three as expected THIS is what we are talking about the B580 for some reason requires far more beefier CPU than it has any business requiring,m5ptyy4,5.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5qx3m8,VailonVon,,0,2025-01-06 19:43:07,,,,I have no business talking about technical stuff like this but consoles are specific hardware are they not They dont change besides maybe the SSD you use So it doesnt really matter if they are on x86 when you are optimizing for specific hardware When you port something to pc you are now going back and trying to optimize a game for multiple configurations of hardware that may or may not like it,m5qkp96,10.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5t9qs4,FreshPrinceOfNowhere,,1,2025-01-07 03:08:44,,,,Really the only differentiating factor between console and PC development these days is that on console you only need to optimize for AMD hardware while on PC theres also Intel and Nvidia Still the leeway you have is minuscule when you consider how it was in the PS3 and X360 days And I still fail to see the point of this offtopic tangent,m5qx3m8,11.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5otbxi,Stargate_1,,42,2025-01-06 12:43:23,,,,The point is that while the 4060 would get the same fps with older CPUs that still resulted in a GPU bottleneck hence the same fps each time the B580 continuously declined It literally just loses performance the older the CPU is,m5orz5v,2.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5t7722,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,1,2025-01-07 02:54:00,,,,From what Ive been reading around it looks like Intel generally changes the socket every two generations with exception to the last one before the current one 8th and 9th were on LGA 1151 10th and 11th were on LGA 1200 12th 13th and 14th are on LGA 1700 Newest one is LGA 1851 for the Core Ultra CPUs Essentially youre generally locked into to only two gens of Intel CPUs So most PC users wanting to use the Arc GPUs will also need to fork out additional cash for a new motherboard AND CPU The hard cutoff is 10th gen Its not great for those of us that are nearpoverty or cannot spend much of any money on electronics for whatever reason thats probably what the news article is implying,m5pozdw,5.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5tl4nb,BEEFTANK_Jr,,1,2025-01-07 04:18:56,,,,I know but my point is that an LGA 1151 system almost definitely has a PCIe 30 motherboard and is going to throttle the Intel card anyway Realistically what GPU is a system that old running For me that was a GTX 970 until last year I could have potentially upgraded to a Nvidia 1000 series card from there but thats it What if you already have a 1070 though The only other upgrade you can realistically get now is an RTX 2070 but those cost more than an Arc B580 My point is that a system that old doesnt have realistic upgrade options anyway It doesnt really matter that much if an Arc B580 doesnt work great with someones i79700,m5t7722,6.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5pkj2t,GnarApple,,11,2025-01-06 15:40:37,,,,I think youre missing the point just a little bit All the fuss about this issue is that this basically forces out the people with older cpu looking for gpu upgrade only Also this means the upgrade package is now arc gpu price plus 5080 which is not insignificant given that its a lowmid end card The price comparison with 4060 suddenly looks worse than before now that you also need a cpumotherboard upgrade else the fps cripples,m5p907y,5.0,1huxl0o
comment,m5qrxjw,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-01-06 19:18:01,,,,I understand that and thats definitely valid Still you will get a newer 12th gen CPU which are still reasonably good efficient and modern vs the 9th gens which are oooooold 2017ish So I still think its a viable option if you were doing an economical upgrade on both fronts If you wanted to do a GPUonly upgrade for a 8th gen Intel CPU then IMO a 4060 is tbh also a bad choice I would go for a 6700XT or something cuz probably raster performance and VRAM is more important than RT at this level,m5pkj2t,6.0,1huxl0o

comment,m5pvqz2,ymmvmia,,24,2025-01-06 16:38:06,,,,I feel like the testing is extremely flawed here They arent testing equivalent predecessor cpus In fact I think the inclusion of x3d cpus is EXTREMELY dishonest we know how they change and enhance performance different than most cpus of the past with their x3d cache Id have tested the 9600 the 7600 the 5600 the 3600 then the 2600 Then do similarly for Intel cpus AND they should have tested AMD gpus versus the B580 and if cpus present the same issues for AMD and Intel or just Intel Another problem probably a much more major problem here in methodology They are cherry picking the worst games of Arc and the best games for Nvidia As well as testing on 1080p From the reviews and initial benchmarks we know the Arc B580 outperforms most everything in that price range for 1440p and 4k except for a FEW bad game examples like Starfield but drops a little behind depending on the game for 1080p And DEPENDING ON THE GAME is important here They tested two games I havent seen any other outlet test when reviewing the b580 Now if you CHECK and investigate a little the gpu benchmarks for Space Marine 2 you will notice that Nvidia has a clear outsized advantage over AMD The game is clearly optimized for Nvidia with any non nvidia card being gimped Especially noticeable as AMD is far superior in rasterization performance for the price Nvidia should NOT be performing better than AMD in general as long as ray tracing or DLSS are not on I wouldnt be surprised if AMD performance scaled in a similar way in Space Marine 2 being limited by the cpu This is likely just a case of extreme optimization for nvidia in some games and unintentionalintentional gimping of nonnvidia gpus However these problems seem limited to a handful of titles In many other games the B580s performance is in line with expectations For instance in games such as Alan Wake 2 Doom Eternal Horizon Forbidden West and even Call of Duty Black Ops 6 the B580 delivers playable frame rates when paired with the i59600K They even mention their cherrypicking in the dang article I really dont understand this its sketchy AMD has always had problems in specific games And then vice versa some AMD sponsored games have bad Nvidia performance Listen to the reviews folks Not this clickbait garbage manufacturing drama about Intel Now sure they have a lot of work to do on their drivers But as evidenced by last generation theyre working hard on it Alchemist cards of last generation got SO much better after 36 months of driver updates I wouldnt expect that much of an improvement as that was Intels first consumer discrete graphics card generation so they had MAJOR issues at launch But I would expect them especially as the new underdog in the gpu space to do as much as humanly possible to work on their drivers Anything to gain market share and good will with the gaming community,,0.0,1huxl0o
