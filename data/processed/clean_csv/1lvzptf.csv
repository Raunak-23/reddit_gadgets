comment,n2fx7jf,CutsAPromo,,5,2025-07-10 21:52:02,,,,Theyre really neat in theory but most people just dont use them They either need to make a separate stylus phone or upgrade the plus so people can have a better camera without one Ill also add a stylus can be carried separate in a case or whatever its just such a waste of space having it in the phone when most people dont use it Most buy the ultra for the camera screen and battery I nearly got an ultra but went with the base model replacing my s22 plus,n2fq4vj,5.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2gbqr9,HeftyArgument,,3,2025-07-10 23:09:33,,,,Good to know you can speak for most people I for one buy bought the ultra for the screen battery and pen I could care less how great the camera is the tech hasnt really gotten appreciably better to anyone but enthusiasts for the last 5 years,n2fx7jf,6.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2gbe86,HeftyArgument,,6,2025-07-10 23:07:40,,,,I use mine a lot I use the ultra as a notepad during meetings and just during the day when I notice things at work The being able to hover the pen over the screen to highlight and translate text on the fly is also a game changer considering the amount of foreign design drawings I look at during work Latest ultra phone was a no go because they removed that feature in normal life do I use the pen a lot no but during work all the time Which was the entire point of the S Pen originally IIRC that huge phone was supposed to be for multi tasking and productivity the pen was a huge part of that,n2fq4vj,5.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2i7urr,KEVLAR60442,,1,2025-07-11 06:35:42,,,,Its much faster to do all of these things by just popping out a pen which you can quickly adapt to even with my huge hands than by pinching to zoom in constantly and using long presses And Ive yet to find a good way to select text from images or get mouseover events without using the Spen,n2i7hed,7.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2an65d,pcdenjin,,52,2025-07-10 02:38:45,,,,Yeah the exclusion of the feature is honestly baffling to me One of the biggest use cases Id say for unfolding phones like this is the ability to use them with a pen The larger screen estate is kind of a nobrainer for that alone,n2ajf82,1.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2c28xs,peakedtooearly,,8,2025-07-10 09:37:23,,,,Yep if the retail price was 300400 lower than the Fold 6 then the reduced functionality might be acceptable To charge more though for a phone that wasnt a great seller in the first place is madness,n2b5jye,3.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2binsz,CutsAPromo,,7,2025-07-10 06:32:13,,,,Yeah I tried one in store and it wasnt useful at all Maybe in winter when I am wearing gloves it would be useful Ended up getting the s25 base in navy blue,n2b9zcd,2.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2ch8da,wizkidweb,,7,2025-07-10 11:39:14,,,,It depends on how you use it Most people arent using the s pen for regular phone navigation but rather for notes and drawing I use it for quick notes all the time and now there arent any folding phones with a Wacom stylus support like this,n2binsz,3.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2cqaio,CutsAPromo,,1,2025-07-10 12:37:21,,,,Yes I feel like it should be a separate phone for you people as it currently stands if you want the ultras cameras and screen you need to buy an ultra but most people dont care about the s pen I understand those that do are very passionate about it though They need to bring back the note or upgrade the plus camera,n2ch8da,4.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2cspx2,6StringAddict,,1,2025-07-10 12:51:40,,,,Could you give a couple useful examples for using the pen I just got myself the s25 ultra and its the first time in my life I have a pen so I dont really know what to use it for to be honest It was fun using it on photos for removing objects but that got old fast lol,n2ch8da,4.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2dbt7t,wizkidweb,,1,2025-07-10 14:30:55,,,,I do some CAD and design work and making quick sketches on the phone makes things a lot easier I also personally find it faster to do complex math problems by writing it out Ive also used it to help with puzzle games to map out builds in simulation games and other random things that require notes that are more than text Basically anything you would use a notepad for The fold is big enough to basically just be a notepad in your pocket,n2cspx2,5.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2cx5lp,adamcunn,,1,2025-07-10 13:16:26,,,,Same as that If there was an option to completely reject hand input when the SPen was removed I may have taken the odd note with it but even then the SPen itself just feels horrible to write with for me Like trying to write with a toothpick,n2b9zcd,2.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2bt3pn,profheg_II,,2,2025-07-10 08:08:41,,,,I had a flip 4 and in the space of 2 years had numerous issues The hinge itself never actually failed but the screen once broke near the hinge dead pixels the screen protector never stayed on for more than 9ish months before it started bubbling and at the time I had to arrange for Samsung to replace it themselves else id break the warranty and then finally it developed some kind of weird powering off issue that when I looked into it seemed likely tied to expected behaviour around if the phone thought it was folded open or closed I really like the idea of a folding phone but Ive never had more issues with a phone and I couldnt ignore how every single one was somehow tied to the feature Still hoping theyll become more reliable in time but I wouldnt consider one again in the near future,n2aszes,4.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2dd2fu,VictoriaRose0,,1,2025-07-10 14:36:58,,,,Foldables are honestly a consumer device for those that can spend money on it without thinking too much about it Hardly any of us here should be looking at devices with so many points of failures when we need this shit for emergencies communication and now a ton of responsibilities that are tied to it Foldable tablets are one thing but smartphones arent tech toys anymore its like needing a fridge and going for the smart fridge with limited updates if any at all over a nice basic fridge that can last you way longer Its no ones fault but yours when it breaks when we KNOW what worked for decades with no issues Nobody I ask about it irl want a foldable because its expensive and fragile when I see someone with it in the wild 910 theyre someone with a lot of money and barely any hobbies to pull that money away,n2aml5q,1.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2bn205,crymachine,,16,2025-07-10 07:11:49,,,,We are getting less features less options and paying more for it Samsung ditched the s pen which other companies still include in their foldables and Samsung didnt even use the latest battery technology carbon I believe and stuck with lithium Your missing the history of having great usable accessible features that were standard and came with a phone that have been removed and gutted without price cut or reasonable exchange Apple at least has always sucked and offered next to nothing Samsung generally had the compliment it gave users options and features USBc headphone jacks are just wear and tear on the port that will cause an expensive repair quicker down the road later My six year old s10e hasnt needed a single repair and theres never been any storage limit problems nothin My s23 Ive had under a year now has me carrying around wireless headphones that are annoying dont pausestart as quickly as wired headphones need to be charged and I have to manage my storage about three times as often Samsung and phones in general arent getting better for consumers theyre getting better at copying the subscription style capitalism payment trap and trying to lock people into ecosystems which sucks,n2blgo7,2.0,1lvzptf

comment,n2c8ztm,countingthedays,,1,2025-07-10 10:37:04,,,,Ive had it in hand already The battery is a compromise for thickness for sure Personally I think it felt great but the large screen battery life is probably pretty rough,n2bard4,1.0,1lvzptf
comment,n2cp05b,Spazzdude,,1,2025-07-10 12:29:31,,,,I am disappointed by the battery as well but if there is one company I expect to be cautious around adopting new battery tech its Samsung They dont want another note 7 It has however been just about 2 years since they started showing up in phones they need to figure it out,n2bard4,1.0,1lvzptf
