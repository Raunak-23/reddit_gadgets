comment,mqrhlru,SmPolitic,,6,2025-05-05 19:51:34,,,,And the other commentor is saying that the companies _will only_ consider to lower prices after demand drops The black Friday and superbowl tv sale prices were always still profitable for the manufacturers They could have lowered the prices much earlier instead only lowered them as the cord cutting trends and more subscription streaming services Curious If they can figure out how to increase supply they will only use that to scale up keeping the same profit margin until and only if demand drops Is how I read their theory Few companies optimize their processes and pass the savings down they reinvest that increase cost saving into growth or into their bonus,mqr9kqd,7.0,1kfbrta

comment,mqs3rz3,chinomaster182,,39,2025-05-05 21:41:21,,,,Companies are always greedy all the time in all contexts its how we respond to the prices that set them or not For example prices for GPUs were scalped to hell and back during the pandemic after the next generation came out with those same prices and we all responded by buying every last one of them The latest generation just came out with even higher prices and the market is eating it up Same with Switch 2 So yeah the consumer hates price hikes but loves buying as such companies love raising prices,mqr02ej,3.0,1kfbrta

comment,mqqgxgs,Zapador,,-9,2025-05-05 16:53:22,,,,Exactly this Avoid products that see a hefty price increase A few percent can be whatever theres always inflation and prices go up but if something is suddenly 595 instead of 495 thats a clear sign Most of these products can be avoided theyre in the nice to have category cameras laptops TVs gaming consoles and so on If you absolutely need one of these products because the old one broke then consider buying second hand if at all possible Youre right in saying that it is we the consumers that in the end get to decide if companies can get away with significantly raising prices or not Its the same reason why theres so little that is manufactured in the US or Europe for that matter today consumers have focused very heavily on price for decades Had consumers instead focused on Made in insert country here and so on the situation would be completely different today,mqq6bpo,2.0,1kfbrta

comment,mqq5oqh,codyzon2,,24,2025-05-05 15:57:59,,,,Wait how would you think this works What mechanism are you talking about that would push the cost onto the corporations without impacting consumers Because just asking nicely for a corporation to eat the cost of a tariff is pretty much the dumbest take you could potentially have when talking about this whole situation Companies charge based on what they pay for goods they dont eat the cost and look at it as just paying their fair share that would destroy a company how would you expect that to work Do you believe that companies have endless resources Thats why you absolutely have to tax them with actual taxes because thats not something that just gets pushed off as easily on consumers It also allows for you to completely avoid companies that do pass off their higher tax burden onto customers because usually we have an alternate to choose from but with tariffs youre forcing people to pay the company at whatever rate they ask because there is no alternative If you increase the price for American companies to produce a product and make it punitive to choose any non American company but somehow expect the prices not to go up Like youre just expecting companies to operate at a loss because of reasons until the company would most certainly have to close So in the long run you want to damage all American companies and destroy more jobs while simultaneously costing American consumers more money everyday seems like a super smart winning strategy,mqpz32e,8.0,1kfbrta

comment,mqq96qc,Graardors-Dad,,-1,2025-05-05 16:15:28,,,,Wait how would you think this works What mechanism are you talking about that would push the cost onto the corporations without impacting consumers Because just asking nicely for a corporation to eat the cost of a tariff is pretty much the dumbest take you could potentially have when talking about this whole situation The mechanism is not having corporation under cut everyone by having unethical labor practices that normal companies cant compete with They cant just endless raise prices because people will just stop buying stuff We saw this as inflation was used as an excuse to raise prices above the actual inflation rate Companies charge based on what they pay for goods they dont eat the cost and look at it as just paying their fair share that would destroy a company how would you expect that to work Do you believe that companies have endless resources Do you think companies dont have a profit margin I dont understand this paragraph at all it makes zero sense You have to balance you profit margins with what people are willing to pay you cant just increase you prices as much as you want and expect people to keep buying stuff thats not how it works You demand will absolutely be destroyed if you try to pass off all of the cost onto consumers or they will find an alternative This is the basis of capitalism Thats why you absolutely have to tax them with actual taxes because thats not something that just gets pushed off as easily on consumers It also allows for you to completely avoid companies that do pass off their higher tax burden onto customers because usually we have an alternate to choose from but with tariffs youre forcing people to pay the company at whatever rate they ask because there is no alternative This paragraph makes zero sense and its almost like your logic is opposite First of all you arent explaining why a universal tax wouldnt cause them to pass the cost onto consumers Also why would there be companies that dont pass the cost onto consumers This contradicts what you just said above Are we just hoping companies will eat a tax increase out of the goodness of their heart Why would there not be an alternative in the tariff case then Not only could companies just eat the cost increase like they would with a tax increase but they can also use American based companies that wouldnt be affected by tariffs Your argument assumes everything is made outside of America which is not correct If you increase the price for American companies to produce a product and make it punitive to choose any non American company but somehow expect the prices not to go up Like youre just expecting companies to operate at a loss because of reasons until the company would most certainly have to close So in the long run you want to damage all American companies and destroy more jobs while simultaneously costing American consumers more money everyday seems like a super smart winning strategy The first sentence is literally the opposite of what tariffs are supposed to do and that literally describes what a flat tax increase would do to companies Im so confused Companies would not operate at a loss their profits would not just be increased Meanwhile American based companies that dont use unethical labor would actually be able to compete generating tons of jobs that are not only protected by workers right laws but also environmental jobs and the money would actually stay in our local economy rather then stimulating Chinas Not only will you have jobs that dont require a college degree but you will have tons of engineering environmental health and safety jobs as well,mqq5oqh,9.0,1kfbrta
comment,mqqdtax,codyzon2,,5,2025-05-05 16:38:17,,,,You are correct that a company would try to pass higher taxes off onto the consumer but just like how it works now you would have competitors to go to instead so it would be a bad idea for them to do so they would lose business that they potentially would never regain their prices would go up but then you would just choose to go with a cheaper company thats how the free market works but youre taking choice away because now we dont have any other alternative If were only given the option for higher prices with an American company or outlandishly high prices from a foreign company thats no choice you seem think that America produces everything that they sell You think because an American corporation is in America that theyre making every part of their product Its like you dont actually know what a supply chain is or how that affects manufacturing and how it affects the cost for the actual company Most American companies dont actually produce anything in the country And when they do they mostly source their materials from out of the country we dont have infrastructure to replace that Thats the biggest part of this whole conversation we dont have the factories or the infrastructure in place for any of the stuff were putting tariffs on not to mention some of the actual resources we need cant be produced here there are rare earth minerals required for a lot of electronics that we just cant produce I would really like to see you find a company that makes a product that solely only sources its materials within America,mqq96qc,10.0,1kfbrta

comment,mqqbsah,DoubleJumps,,5,2025-05-05 16:28:20,,,,With tariffs a company gets taxed on goods before they sell them to a customer so because its front loaded they can make it back by increasing the price of those goods They cant pass on taxes on the money they make AFTER sales because those taxes are a percentage of what they made and charging more doesnt reduce the percentage If they were being taxed 20 they are still being taxed 20 whether they made 10 million or 20 million Its basic math If Im making 10 by selling a tshirt for 10 and Im taxed 20 on that income Im paying 2 in tax And if I raise the price of that tshirt to 12 to make up for that 2 Im still getting taxed 20 on that income and now Im paying 250 for that shirt I will never make the percentage I pay less by charging more You can however end up making yourself make less money by raising those prices to chase something youll never catch by causing consumers to buy less of your product,mqpx0tw,4.0,1kfbrta
comment,mqqcjyx,Graardors-Dad,,-4,2025-05-05 16:32:06,,,,So if they have an overall increase of 20 why wouldnt they just increase their cost 20 to make up for that increase in taxes,mqqbsah,5.0,1kfbrta
