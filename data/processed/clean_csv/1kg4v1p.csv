comment,mqzrtda,WeepingAgnello,,26,2025-05-07 01:44:20,,,,Surface makes great hardware but I dont need an OS that nags me to update with ultimatums which then after you update forces you to interact with their 365 ad I already have 365 and they need my credentials to sign in to the OS so I dont understand why theyre inconveniencing me with an ad for a product I already pay for Ironically thats one of the reasons I dont use Windows anymore and am looking to replace 365,,0.0,1kg4v1p
comment,mr5tjho,IBJON,,10,2025-05-08 00:12:53,,,,I about threw my surface off my balcony when I opened a spreadsheet which I used to be able to do without a 365 license just to read it and got bombarded by a 365 ad that took over the entire window Then we have One Drive that just insists on being in your quick access bar in Explorer and constantly wants to indiscriminately push your Docs Photos etc to the cloud Ive always had issues with windows but Ive been able to work around them Windows 11 just feels hostile towards any user who isnt shelling out for every service MS offers,mqzrtda,1.0,1kg4v1p
