comment,m4p9xx2,chrisdh79,,482,2024-12-31 15:17:51,,,,From the article This remarkable feat has been running successfully for an astonishing eight years without a single battery replacement as detailed by the creator Glubux on the online forum Second Life Storage The setup is housed in a somewhat unassuming shed 50 meters 164 feet away from the individuals residence but its purpose is anything but ordinary It combines old laptop batteries with solar panels to create an offgrid power supply essentially turning a pile of ewaste into a sustainable energy solution Despite the unconventional nature of this system there have been no reports of fire hazards or swollen battery issues throughout its nearly decadelong operation In fact Glubux claims he can power his entire house from it including the washing machine The projects origins can be traced back to November 2016 when the creator shared his initial plans on the forum At the time he had already begun producing part of his electricity needs with a modest 14kW solar panel array an old 24V 460Ah forklift battery charge controllers and a 3kVA inverter However Glubux aimed to expand his setup by constructing a dedicated shed to house additional batteries and charge controllersinverters He had already amassed around 650 laptop batteries and had started sorting and assembling them into packs each designed to hold approximately 100Ah by carefully matching the number of cells and using copper wiring for efficient connections,,0.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4pfplq,cocaine-cupcakes,,617,2024-12-31 15:50:10,,,,Im an HVDC battery engineer and this is impressive Most laptop batteries and electric vehicle batteries are still pretty useful for stationary power despite being too degraded for EV use He will probably get several more years out of this system but I would be curious to see how much hes actually able to store relative to the initial capacity That being said unless you really know what youre doing you should not try to do this at home The potential for thermal runaway is extremely high Thats the whole reason why this person put it in a shed 50 meters from their house,m4p9xx2,1.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4po778,badguy84,,224,2024-12-31 16:35:57,,,,I was going to say its impressive but also its clickbaited a little bit in to a DIY package Getting all these batteries set up in any sort of functional array requires quite a bit of knowledge and a ton of experience to do right and its super easy to get wrong I have an electrical engineering degree though I dont work in that field and I have 0 confidence in being able to pull this off reliably,m4pfplq,2.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4qjtji,brucebrowde,,3,2024-12-31 19:21:00,,,,Can thermal runaway be easily contained Im thinking something along the lines of put the batteries outside shield them from sun rain wind put a fire barrier between the batteries and the house So basically even if it happens it burns like a nicelycontained fireplace of sorts Is that too ignorant of the fire risks,m4pfplq,2.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4qwfik,ernest314,,7,2024-12-31 20:29:31,,,,if water gets in there its less burning and more violently exploding just to be clear theres also some pretty nasty toxic fumes that you probably dont want to be inhaling,m4qjtji,3.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4r2u1m,brucebrowde,,2,2024-12-31 21:05:08,,,,Right so lets say you build a small somewhat fireproof enclosure to protect it from sun water wind say you use bricks to build it put the batteries near the ceiling to be high off the ground and in addition you put some fire barrier between the house and the enclosure Perhaps add additional protection such as running the cables trough sand or some fire retardant My understanding is this burns rather quickly in a matter of minutes so if it happens you get away from your house for the next 15 minutes till the fire subsides and the fumes dissipate and it should be a nonissue Would that not be enough to have a high confidence you wouldnt run into issues or are there other considerations,m4qwfik,4.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4t9kra,ernest314,,3,2025-01-01 06:04:47,,,,I mean yeah the way this guy did it seems safe enough but I think the article is a bit dangerous since it frames this as a laymanaccessible DIY project,m4r2u1m,5.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4rdv24,Aggravating-Pear4222,,2,2024-12-31 22:08:39,,,,So is it the rate of charge and power drain that makes those batteries not work for EVslaptops anymore but easier for powering lights if they are connected parallel vs linear Idk probably just ignore the last part of the question,m4pfplq,2.0,1hqgqla

comment,m52zrbo,Aggravating-Pear4222,,1,2025-01-02 22:23:48,,,,For EVs accelerating a vehicle requires a high output of energy The same can be said about powering a computer relatively I was asking if these high power processes are the reason why these batteries dont work for their original purpose but can work in this scenario for other things like powering lights The question about linear vs parallel connections was asking if the batteries are all connected linearly where the power would be running through each battery as so defeat the proposed benefit in the first part of the question where the power requirements are significantly higher if applicable or Whether they are in parallel so that the batteries provide the same amount of power but dont need to conduct the power provided by the upstream batteries Its the difference between plugging your phone into your laptop to charge it linear and so potentially more strain on the laptops battery vs plugging your phone into a different outlet avoid extra strain on your laptop battery As you can see the last part of the question is more complex and I doubt I would be able to appreciate the answer since Ive only had introductory courses in electrical circuits so I said they can ignore it that last part of the question,m4z9u0g,7.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4s79z5,C_Madison,,2,2025-01-01 01:12:22,,,,IIRC correctly the warranty on EV batteries is usually for the time they expect them to only have 80 of their original capacity left It would really be a waste to throw those batteries away But same as you Im really curious how much theyve lost in the last few years I dont know if its linear or maybe the first 20 are really fast and after that it gets slower,m4pfplq,2.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4uqt3l,cocaine-cupcakes,,3,2025-01-01 14:50:47,,,,Yep 80 state of health is a pretty standard warranty condition for EV batteries The reason they become unsuitable is because the high charge and discharge rates required for vehicle use begin to rapidly increase cell impedance You dont really need that though for home power storage,m4s79z5,3.0,1hqgqla

comment,m50p6sf,inerlite,,1,2025-01-02 15:22:38,,,,I gotta give this guy credit for the outstanding color gradients on the battery placements So pretty I have been considering this same type of use but using all individual battery charger and monitoring electronics The individual 18650 chargers are so cheap on Ali Im wondering if anyone has set up a system that doesnt rely on matching batteries at all,m4pfplq,2.0,1hqgqla
comment,m50rb8o,cocaine-cupcakes,,1,2025-01-02 15:34:26,,,,What do you mean by matching batteries Are you referring to battery chemistries or matching up SoH levels The reason I ask is because you can easily get yourself into trouble with both of those You really want to make sure that you align your monitoring tools with the cell characteristics Generally speaking but not always that means grouping cell chemistries together and approximate SOH together Light mismatch just means degraded performance Significant mismatch will likely lead to overcharging or over discharging eventually leading to thermal damage,m50p6sf,3.0,1hqgqla
comment,m511o5a,inerlite,,1,2025-01-02 16:29:34,,,,I mean it would be the same probably 18650 battery but each battery has its own charger and management system to regulate output Then combine all the individual managed batteries for greater charge,m50rb8o,4.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4s6bwp,asimovs_engineer,,10,2025-01-01 01:06:20,,,,Anything smaller and the effectiveness of connecting them all together becomes more expensive and less efficient My quick googling says a high capacity vape may have 5Ah Youd need 20 just to match 1 of the batteries in this guys shed setup and most vape will be much smaller,m4rz4g0,3.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4sfft2,Hendlton,,6,2025-01-01 02:05:58,,,,Not to match one of the batteries but one of the battery packs Each one of those packs has 80 cells But most vapes are 500 mAh with larger ones being 1500 mAh So yeah youd need a lot to match the packs in the article but if you can get them for free I think itd be worth it,m4s6bwp,4.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4xrszk,nikolai_470000,,1,2025-01-02 01:02:15,,,,Maybe The only reason why I think it may work better than people would anticipate for a time is that the process of wiring them together might be simplified by the fact those devices already have a charging regulator on board At a certain point though with the cost of other parts to get it working and the labor involved in manually wiring that many components together unless you are an electrical engineer with a bunch of spare parts just laying around it either costs too much or takes too long for it to truly be worthwhile Also differently from laptop batteries and the like the batteries in vapes are cheap Rechargeable yes but the majority of them arent going to last much longer than the vape itself does Making lithium ion cells which are that small that last a comparable number of cycles to a laptop battery is not something done cheaply If these disposable vape manufacturers were putting high quality lithium like that in their devices they wouldnt be turning a profit,m4sfft2,5.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4pcsfu,minotaur05,,-19,2024-12-31 15:33:54,,,,Solar only works for half the day and you need power the rest of the time Not to mention even if they have solar tbey might use more power than is being produced so the battery storage kicks in This is quite the feat if true Edit Are downvotes because I said solar only works half the time This was pointing out that yes they have solar in combination with the batteries but saying solar is the only reason they powered their house for 8 years would be incorrect Solar plus the batteries did this and the focus is on the fact they could do this with a ton of ewaste which is awesome,m4pbmce,1.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4pq0nj,ToMorrowsEnd,,4,2024-12-31 16:45:27,,,,Solar only works for about 4 hours not half the day 90 of the power my system generates is from 2 hours before solar noon to 2 hours after only way to extract more is by adding servo motors to track the sun The power made before and after that is a rapid dropoff losing about 25 every 30 minutes and then tapering Its a bell curve it also gets worse the more north you go Good friend of mine up in canada can barely make 4Kwh right now on his 40Kwh solar array and yes the panels are clear of snow extreme low angle of the sun and extremely short days in the winter make solar in any north lattitude a challenge,m4pcsfu,2.0,1hqgqla
comment,m4qcp06,BassGaming,,2,2024-12-31 18:43:00,,,,You are not bashing solar panels or saying theyre useless Youre stating easily verifiable numbers even though Id say its more like 46 hours and yet get downvoted,m4pq0nj,3.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4r1bpv,minotaur05,,1,2024-12-31 20:56:37,,,,I dont think Im acting like Im contributing was just trying to point out the solar itself wont power a house so the battery is the other half The article is focusing on the feat of doing so with essentially ewaste which is why thats being focused on not the solar Its so weird people get upset by someone just trying to have a conversation on the internet,m4r009w,3.0,1hqgqla

comment,m4pgyw9,rossmosh85,,-4,2024-12-31 15:57:01,,,,Im the furthest thing from an expert on the subject but I have watched several videos of guys building massive batteries out of these cells The process to do it correctly which Im guessing this guy has is long You basically need to test capacity of each little battery a bunch of different times and sort them and then sort them again Then finally assemble the battery and charge it in a some what specific way so the battery charges evenly and no one cell is stressed After that the BMS does most of the heavy lifting keeping the batteries charged and balanced Whats also important to note here is this setup is extremely basic It would not meet the needs for the vast majority of people 14kW solar setup is TINY Not to mention these DIY batteries are also quite small This setup would work for someone who gets a lot of sun and has a VERY low demand I have serious doubts that this could even run a small heat pumpAC unit,,0.0,1hqgqla
