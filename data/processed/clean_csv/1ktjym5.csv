comment,mtu8afq,MysteryRadish,,2,2025-05-23 14:18:33,,,,Every other attempt at this has flopped Hard Very hard I dont think its a case of needing better design or better tech there are some things that people just simply dont want,,0.0,1ktjym5
comment,mu72kc6,elton_john_lennon,,2,2025-05-25 16:38:19,,,,Every other attempt at this has flopped How many attempts have there been actually I dont think even google smart glasses went to stores for everyone to buy Where are you getting that flopped hard from there are some things that people just simply dont want Id love me some AR glasses not by meta or google but the concept itself seems useful and full of potential,mtu8afq,1.0,1ktjym5
comment,mu83a7y,MysteryRadish,,2,2025-05-25 19:44:45,,,,How many attempts have there been actually I dont think even google smart glasses went to stores for everyone to buy Where are you getting that flopped hard from The ones Im familiar with were 1 Google Glass Never made it to market despite the backing of one of the worlds biggest tech companies People who beta tested them earned the pejoritive glassholes Not a strong start 2 DAQRI Smart Glasses Suffered from a very silly design somewhere between ski goggles and a VR headset Barely lasted 2 years company shut down shortly after 3 Snapchat Spectacles Introduced in 2016 and in 2017 Snapchat wrote off 40m worth of unsold Spectacles inventory and unused parts That isnt good Design described as truly horrid by Slate To be fair they do seem to be still trying and releasing a new version every couple years 4 Meta RayBans Introduced in 2021 These are the bestlooking attempt so far Dont seem to have exactly taken off in the market though and have some pretty significant privacy concerns A lot of people these days want nothing to do with MetaFacebook and for good reasons,mu72kc6,2.0,1ktjym5
comment,mu8d5kv,elton_john_lennon,,1,2025-05-25 20:37:05,,,,I wouldnt consider it a flop if device was never introduced to open market to begin with you have be able to jump to be able to flop google pulled out in warmup phase Snapchat spectacles and Meta raybans arent actually AR glasses those are shades with smart camera in them they dont augment the reality DAQRI afair were aimed at industry and I dont even remember if they actually started to sell them openly There is a huge difference between what you mentioned and something like Meta Orion High tech makes a huge difference That is like a difference between in terms of VR oculus Rift DK1 that was available to only a handful of people was expensive and limited in functionality served as a tech demo and something like Quest2 that had massive success as a headset was cheap and had tons of usages apps and games They are both VR headsets and just because you might consider the first one a flop by your standards doesnt mean people dont want the tech if it was cheaper and more functional I feel like the same applies to AR glasses We are glued to our phones one of the advantages of AR glasses for better or worse arguably is having that screen constantly available to you right in your field of vision so there is already huge appeal for a lot of people A lot of people these days want nothing to do with MetaFacebook and for good reasons And I hope none of their AR product ever succeeds really I hope they invest bilions develop tech and forma factor that others will copy and will make betteropennonspy products,mu83a7y,3.0,1ktjym5
comment,mtuaaph,GreyScope,,0,2025-05-23 14:28:19,,,,To me they look like a product only sex offenders would use Watching someone elses viewpoint or even rewatching mine in a boring version of an fps doesnt appeal to me and a way to get into fights with ppl who dont want to be filmed by perceived perverts My own views,,0.0,1ktjym5
