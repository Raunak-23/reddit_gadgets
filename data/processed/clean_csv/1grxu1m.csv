post,1grxu1m,chrisdh79,Reports emerge of AMD 9800X3D CPUs burning out in MSI motherboards and a batch of bad CPU sockets could be to blame | A batch of dodgy sockets or just maybe user error?,447,2024-11-15 14:41:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1grxu1m/reports_emerge_of_amd_9800x3d_cpus_burning_out_in/,79.0,gadgets,,,,

comment,lxb2jb1,fmaz008,,52,2024-11-15 18:42:38,,,,Hey Steve MSI here Please dont do a piece on this situation I swear we are looking into it already What situation,lx9v8xx,3.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxb5zxn,Noteagro,,35,2024-11-15 18:59:41,,,,For real But just saying I have to give MASSIVE props to MSI to looking into it from the first case and the second case is just making them double down on making sure it isnt a manufacturing error We have had wayyyyy too many PC part companies try to say it isnt their issue until you smear their face in their own shit This goes all the way up to the biggest part company of Intel even So this is honestly huge showing that they are willing to take accountability if they are at fault and once the issue is fully solidified I think my next board will be an MSI knowing they are going to try to stay on top of these issues,lxb2jb1,4.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxb9sep,chris14020,,12,2024-11-15 19:18:37,,,,Well this is a huge moment If its user damage and easy to cause meaning at least a few more people regularly do this in the same manner thats fine to them still worth the investigating What would not be fine would be ignoring it entirely because then it could be questioned If they address it and find its user damage even if its common user damage failure mode they can explicitly address that and keep public trust and probably prevent others from doing the same thing If its not they can gain public goodwill by showing they didnt handle it like Intel just did their failures across the board They can also immediately address it if it is indeed a CPU or socket failure No matter what their problem or not investigating immediately and thoroughly is a PR win and a financial win,lxb5zxn,5.0,1grxu1m

comment,lxbkvvg,ThePointForward,,18,2024-11-15 20:15:33,,,,Got an MSI board with 9800X3D No issues been running the PC for a week now including a small torture test Id bet its an user error BUT if the user error is too common its also a design flaw Alternatively its a defect followed up by user error of essentially forcing the CPU in through the defect,lx9uary,2.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxdwas7,PG908,,3,2024-11-16 04:36:24,,,,Yeah lots of things are user error but really should have not been possible,lxbkvvg,3.0,1grxu1m

comment,lx9v712,ilyich_commies,,7,2024-11-15 15:07:10,,,,Yeah but to be fair your socket designbuild quality kinda sucks if its that easy for users to miss the fact that their CPU isnt seated properly,lx9uary,2.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxaeqa6,whodaloo,,25,2024-11-15 16:44:56,,,,Its keyed to only go in a certain way and its very obvious when its not Even a cursory glance would tell you its wrong Its a design thats been in use for years The user then had to force the lever down hard enough to break the CPU socket If you sell enough of something some human is going to figure out how to break it,lx9v712,3.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxb0nr9,Kittensss1,,4,2024-11-15 18:33:21,,,,JayzTwoCents showed how its possible to put the CPU in upside down even though its keyed a certain way The user should have noticed it but the fact that it was even slightly possible is concerning,lxaeqa6,4.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxda3yg,whodaloo,,-5,2024-11-16 02:05:57,,,,You cant be serious I saw that video If you think installing a cpu upsidedown is correct then you deserve the life you have Think of how much money you have to spend before you make that mistake Youd have to do zero research not see a single review and out of the blue decide to order those specific components and then somehow not just install the CPU in the most obvious way but also force it down hard enough to shear plastic,lxb0nr9,5.0,1grxu1m
comment,lxllaaz,xGHOSTRAGEx,,1,2024-11-17 14:56:35,,,,How does one seat a cpu incorrect lt cannot be seated incorrectly it can only be sealed with the pin if its arrow to arrow in the corner It autoseats on seal so whats the deal,lx9uary,2.0,1grxu1m

comment,lxb0zyj,Kittensss1,,24,2024-11-15 18:35:02,,,,JayzTwoCents showed it was possible to put it in 180 though It shouldnt have been possible with how its keyed but the socket wasnt preventing it like it should have I still blame the user but there is some concern around the socket allowing it to,lxab2py,1.0,1grxu1m
