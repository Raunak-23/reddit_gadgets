comment,n0emhc9,imfm,,54,2025-06-29 13:39:18,,,,This makes me sad My vintage 2011 I think 2270DW at work recently died for good Its sitting in the corner of my office because I still cant make myself throw it away just in case I ever find a way to fix it I loved that printer and as a work printer it put out a lot of pages in 14 years Brother toner fine Generic toner fine Fancy paper fine Cheap copy paper fine It didnt care what I threw at it it just printed Let the toner get so low I could barely see the prints it didnt care just kept spitting them out I bought a new one in 2013 because we had budget surplus but ended up giving it to a colleague and using my old one,n0egyac,2.0,1lncm92

comment,n0q9pbd,GreggAlan,,1,2025-07-01 09:21:21,,,,Same with my LaserJet 4100DTN Its a tank with a huge toner cartridge I recently replaced all the paper handling rollers and other parts that make the paper get out of the trays and into the mechanism Inexpensive to buy and replaceable without any tools Ive maxed out its RAM installed a 100 megabit EIO JetDirect print server card installed a PostScript module which reduces the max RAM installable and replaced the control panel because the left direction on one of the rocker buttons didnt work I havent bought a hard drive for the 2nd EIO slot because I dont have a use for it I would like to get another huge paper tray to stack under the one already under it The 500 sheet 4th trays are readily available at a decent price but the whole mechanism the tray slides into which only seem to be available with a tray sellers want some gold for those The really neat part is it still works with Windows 11 just as it did with Windows 2000 through 10 Yes Ive had it that long and it was used when I got it,n0fwsda,3.0,1lncm92
comment,n0q8ruq,GreggAlan,,1,2025-07-01 09:12:03,,,,Reminds me of when Xerox tried selling inkjet printers They had Sharp rebrand some of theirs Sharp was paid to erase their name from the software and firmware replacing it with Xerox The problem was the printers were crap The printheads ALL failed Itd start with a few nozzles quitting on one color followed soon by the whole color quitting The ones with a scanner developed a problem where theyd make a yellow stripe in everything Quite oddly the cure was to take the thing apart loosen the lens in its housing and rotate it about 14 turn I took the lens out couldnt see how a lens with no specific orientation could change how the sensor sensed the light reflected off what was being scanned or how it could work fine out of the box then suddenly cause a yellow streak But I put it back in rotated from its factory position and no more streak Then the printhead failed By then Xerox had washed their hands of the whole mess and printheads were not available even from Sharp Xerox had them alter the design a bit so they wouldnt interchange IIRC the ink tanks were cross compatible But the trouble started even before the printers went on sale Xerox advertised them as 1200 DPI AND compatible with Windows XP Never mentioning the caveat that they only made drivers for Windows 9x and provided a feature reduced driver to Microsoft to be included with Windows 2000 and XP which only supported up to 600 DPI Might even have cut the scanning resolution too I suspect Xerox lost money on them If so they deserved every penny lost Id hoped there would be a class action lawsuit over their false advertising Nothing anywhere mentioned they only did 1200 DPI with Windows 95 OSR2 with the USB update Windows 98 Windows 98SE and Windows Me The lack of full drivers for XP smacked of an overly long development cycle and Xerox had to push them out anyway after the release of XP to try and make their money back,n0eev2q,2.0,1lncm92

comment,n0em1ov,funnyfarm299,,50,2025-06-29 13:36:39,,,,The serial number is accessible via the devices web interface why would anyone have their printer on the public internet or have any ports forwarded from the net to it They shouldnt But the average user barely understands what port forwarding is let alone why its dangerous Users may enable functions they are not familiar with in an attempt to troubleshoot an issue,n0e9ew4,1.0,1lncm92
comment,n0fn4ed,young_mummy,,10,2025-06-29 16:57:53,,,,Highly highly doubt They would need to go into their router and change random settings accidentally doing something extremely specific for no reason There is approximately zero percent chance anyone would do this unless they knew what they were doing And at that point they are knowingly consenting to this risk You dont just randomly go into your router and setup a port forwarding rule on the firewall to allow traffic from WAN to your specific printer IP at the specific printer service port by accident Its not a setting you can clutz around with and enable on the printer or on the router even You have to deliberately make a choice to do this The only exception is if you have UPnP enabled for some other reason on your router but these printers arent using UPnP so its irrelevant,n0em1ov,2.0,1lncm92
comment,n0ezelm,dandroid126,,30,2025-06-29 14:52:22,,,,Users may enable functions they are not familiar with in an attempt to troubleshoot an issue I highly doubt that I used to work for a company developing a WiFi router I was actually the lead software engineer on the project We did a ton of market research before we started and it turns out 70 of users didnt even know their WiFi password 90 didnt even know that there was a different set of credentials to log into manage their routers settings If a troubleshooting step told them to forward a port I guarantee you that 9999 of users would just give up there Even if they did manage to log into their router every routers settings are laid out differently and it would be damn near impossible for them to figure out how to forward a port unless they already know about port forwarding And those people likely already know the implications of port forwarding and why you shouldnt do it to a printer,n0em1ov,2.0,1lncm92
comment,n0f14nw,funnyfarm299,,7,2025-06-29 15:01:32,,,,Even if the user doesnt do it themselves UPnP has the potential to automatically punch holes in the firewall,n0ezelm,3.0,1lncm92

comment,n0f8iri,MiningDave,,9,2025-06-29 15:40:40,,,,This might be a US or even a New York based thing but here unless you are on a business internet plan you cant even forward most service ports 80 443 25 110 143 587 etc since they dont want you doing that on home services So getting to the web interface should not be possible for most home users if you are not inside the house And I just checked the 2 brother MFC I have access to neither one gives you the serial number without logging in 1st Im not saying its not dangerous just that there are MUCH MUCH MUCH worse issues out there IMO,n0em1ov,2.0,1lncm92

comment,n0g28nc,MiningDave,,5,2025-06-29 18:15:19,,,,I only have access to one an MFCL2740DW but the web interface doesnt require logging in to access any pages Interesting I just pulled a MFCL2730DW out of storage and its the same I really need to get out more The MFCL3780CDW and MFCL5915DW that I tested on earlier gave nothing I dont know if its the way they are or whoever set them up locked them down properly This isnt the right approach to security Just because other products and services have worse vulnerabilities doesnt mean Brother doesnt have room to improve theirs I didnt say that it does not have to be improved or that it should be ignored and yes this should be fixed by Brother But there are a limited amount of hours in a day and if you have to prioritize security things on your network I personally would have this lower on my list then other things This is certainly ISP specific I live in the USA and havent experienced any inbound port blocking with my ISP Cox and Optimum block 80 on residential plans Verizon does in some locations but will remove it if you call That is where my knowledge ends Since those are the only players in the areas I deal with I never checked past there,n0fa5mw,4.0,1lncm92
comment,n0jin1a,LBPPlayer7,,1,2025-06-30 07:47:39,,,,most internet customers dont know how to port forward and a large number of them dont even have the _ability_ to either because they have an ISPprovided modemrouter that can only have its settings changed remotely by the ISP andor the ISP is saving on IP addresses and putting its customers under NATs by default,n0em1ov,2.0,1lncm92

comment,n0fpmko,mrdungbeetle,,2,2025-06-29 17:10:42,,,,The threats arent always on the other side of the firewall These days most people have questionable IoT devices on the same network cameras smart scales smart TVs smart lights old Android devices that no longer receives security updates you name it MANY of these are vulnerable often the company that makes them no longer exists and they no longer get firmwareOS updates If one of those gets compromised the malware gets installed there and it can easily scan the local network for other devices find your Brother printer access its web interface to grab the serial number and youre now hacked The solution is to not only have a firewall but to segment the network internally so that IoT devices cannot see one another and if they must see each other for some reason then restrict the ingress and egress ports to only those which they need,n0e9ew4,1.0,1lncm92
comment,n0jzx9t,MiningDave,,1,2025-06-30 10:39:37,,,,Side thought with that things like segmenting will probably work to a certain extent BUT you depending on your provider and what other services you have it can become messy real quick Using Fios as an example if you want all the smart functions of their TV boxes you need to use their router Same with their phones So now you have to make sure that if nothing else that TV you have in the conference room can see the router same with the phone BUT the other network jacks have to be on another VLAN Yes there are other ways but how many network admins are going to go down that rabbit hole Otherwise you will have equipment that you have ZERO control of sitting on the same network as everything else Yes its an edge case but its something else to think about,n0fpmko,2.0,1lncm92

comment,n0eivvc,ToMorrowsEnd,,2,2025-06-29 13:17:04,,,,Which is stupid because you already own the PC WTF is worth poking at the printer and have to jump through massive hoops to do pretty much nothing compared to what you can do with the already P0wned windows PC that is unpatched and barely maintained You move on to the NAS Network gear and other PCs on the network not fuck with a printer that is extremely limited,n0eb3l5,5.0,1lncm92
comment,n0et0ln,NeverLookBothWays,,5,2025-06-29 14:17:37,,,,Well a couple things The PC does not need to really be compromised to run code in the user space It can run and just vanish after it runs without leaving much of a trace executes solely in memory From there a backdoor is installed where a network can then be explored traffic can be sniffed other things can be done to build up enough info on a target to further compromise them stealthily When HP had a similar vulnerability years ago the attack was towards HR departments A resume would be sent that had exit codes built into it that would compromise the printer When HR departments received resumes they would typically print them And from there the printer was a backdoor with a reverse ssh tunnel It would capture PII data off every future document printed by a department that works heavily with PII No antivirus for printers so the exploit could go on for months or years unnoticed if the company does not have good network inspection policies Eventually the PDFs could be detected as occasionally they would brick the printers But its still an effective way to trench in as an attacker We still dont have great defenses against firmware exploits like this,n0eivvc,6.0,1lncm92

comment,n0ejpi1,mattindustries,,2,2025-06-29 13:22:09,,,,What do you print out Typically important docs if you have an at home laser printer They can see your flights and organize the best time to rob your house They can get additional information on who you are to get a cursory idea if you are worth hacking more The worst though they can call you and say Hi John Doe I am from airline and it looks like your flight confirmation shows you are potentially on the nofly list I am sure this is a misunderstanding though and it is another traveler who shares your name Can you verify your SSN so we can correct this mistake in our system,n0e7xm7,1.0,1lncm92
