comment,mtjb06k,SaraAB87,,11,2025-05-21 20:21:17,,,,Its gotta be a fire hazard or some kind of chemicals in the materials the phone is made out of Either that or the lithium in them is leaking some kind of chemical Word is that stores that have them are told not to touch them with their bare hands and only handle them with gloves if they have them that is But if its something like this then shouldnt all the carriers be getting this recall,mtj6ozn,1.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjht5k,pbiscuits,,7,2025-05-21 20:52:55,,,,Ya its a weird situation Who knows how the rumors started but for some reason only Verizon and Motorola put a halt on shipping devices Either there is a real safety issue and a full blown recall is coming or it was a false alarm Or maybe somehow only the devices sent to Verizon were affected Or some other bizarre scenario that no one would ever think of,mtjb06k,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjmabu,SaraAB87,,5,2025-05-21 21:13:20,,,,Maybe a bad batch of batteries that they can track only to Verizon stores Either way I wouldnt buy or use this phone until its considered safe for sure One of the rumors is that women shouldnt be handling them at all since there is risk to the reproductive system,mtjht5k,3.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtjk1ol,dfsvegas,,-10,2025-05-21 21:03:00,,,,I never understood the flip design I get the fold design but what does one gain from the flip design It just makes it slightly smaller but now I have a more vulnerable screen And Im paying more for it Nothing about the flip design makes sense to me,mtjii0q,1.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjztvf,YungDaVinci,,27,2025-05-21 22:22:59,,,,its not slightly smaller its significantly smaller when i first got mine sometimes i thought i forgot it while it was in my pocket most of the other advantages are a bit gimmicky but still fun but being more pocketable is a genuine benefit and its not much more expensive than a normal slab phone,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtm59sf,CAElite,,5,2025-05-22 06:54:14,,,,Yeah I got the new 60 recently had been waiting for something to replace my iPhone 13 mini as the small form factor was the hill I chose to die on Wanted to go back to android and flip seemed like the only alternative to a phablet since manufacturers have forgotten how to make reasonably sized smartphones Im liking mine so far if it could also explode and burn my shitty apartment down then that is a massive added bonus,mtjztvf,3.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjugb2,Trekintosh,,45,2025-05-21 21:54:09,,,,The small outside screen lets you do many of the things youd do with a phone on it quick messages navigation watching videos or pulling up quick reference material Then if you need more space you have the big screen inside The outside screen saves a ton of battery and helps you not get as distracted by multitasking and other apps,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjyf1q,Jaerba,,19,2025-05-21 22:15:16,,,,It makes it a lot smaller and I dont understand what you mean by a more vulnerable screen That the inside screen is softer That hasnt really been a concern for several generations and when it falls its usually more protected than a slab phone is Plus its smaller and less likely to be knocked off of things The screen protector needs to be replaced at about 152 years but thats pretty minor Its also usually the same price or cheaper than regular Galaxy phones Most people in the US will get them for free with trade ins Youre giving up some battery life and camera quality for size and accessibility Im sticking with flip phones from here on out,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtl981w,danarchist,,4,2025-05-22 02:44:49,,,,Same My biggest praise is that I dont need to take it out of my pocket to sit down or get in the car or tie my shoes when Im wearing tight pants or shorts The desk mode is cool too,mtjyf1q,3.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtkgb8w,ResoluteGreen,,3,2025-05-21 23:55:51,,,,but what does one gain from the flip design Its fun I like it Its very satisfying flipping the phone closed to hang up again The smaller form factor while folded is nice for a lot of people the cover screen adds some functionality like being able to take selfies with the forward facing cameras and the partial fold form is handy for some things like when using the calculator or propping up the phone to take some photos with a group,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjlnl2,pbiscuits,,4,2025-05-21 21:10:21,,,,Ya idk a lot of people like the form factor of the flips Ive always wanted a smaller phone so was intrigued because it was only 165 for the base model with a promo deal one of the MVNOs was running Figured it was worth a try,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjmlyc,SaraAB87,,7,2025-05-21 21:14:52,,,,I am guessing the advantage is it fits into insanely small pockets on jeans when no other phone fits But clearly they are not durable and the hinge is a huge issue Also they have horrible battery life compared to regular phones I definitely dont need one,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtkreh2,brickmaster32000,,6,2025-05-22 01:00:19,,,,But clearly they are not durable and the hinge is a huge issue Is it clear or did you just invent that fact out of thin air because it sounded good to you,mtjmlyc,3.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtl9mas,danarchist,,4,2025-05-22 02:47:12,,,,My razr fell off the roof of my car while folded at 25 mph bounced off the street on the hinge side and landed on the sidewalk Barely a scuff on it,mtkreh2,4.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtlctzk,brickmaster32000,,4,2025-05-22 03:06:45,,,,What about your battery Personally mine lasts just as long as my previous phone did and looking at the actual capacity of the battery it certainly appears to be comparable to most other phones but what would I know I merely have and use the phone and compared to a guy sitting back guessing about their shortcoming I practically know nothing,mtl9mas,5.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjnazx,dfsvegas,,-10,2025-05-21 21:18:13,,,,Yeah unless you have more money than sense and pocket space is an issue I get it but otherwise Ehhhh The bang for the buck seems terrible to me,mtjmlyc,3.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtjp5ex,SaraAB87,,-5,2025-05-21 21:27:16,,,,I havent seen anyone in real life use one of these foldable flip phones yet Honestly most people I see out in real life with their phones have older iPhones its pretty clear people arent buying the latest and greatest if they dont have to at least in my area I can see the use case for the foldables depending on what your line of work is someone may want that type of phone depending on their needs Yeah if you want bang for your buck this is not the way to go at all You can pretty much plan on the phone being useless in 2 years due to battery deterioration andor hinge damage meanwhile you can probably get a lot longer out of a standard phone that does the same thing You are going to be charging it twice per day if you use your phone at all for phone stuff which will lead to premature battery degredation Also these basically cannot be repaired if the battery or hinge fails you are getting a new phone there will be no options for repair I am sure they just replace rather than repair even if you send it in for repair Most other phones can be repaired,mtjnazx,4.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtk646w,Charles_Mendel,,2,2025-05-21 22:58:16,,,,In 2005 flipping that Razr open and then slamming it closed at the end of a call was the pinnacle of dumb phones,mtjk1ol,2.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtldahd,dfsvegas,,0,2025-05-22 03:09:38,,,,Its not a phone for me I said that My question is why its a phone for anyone It makes no sense Its two positives with multiple negatives for the same price at best I mean do you but I still dont get it The features are cool but the tradeoffs are just too high,mtlczrk,5.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtmzift,JBWalker1,,5,2025-05-22 11:38:04,,,,In reality theres a reason why companies stopped making physical keyboards and its because barely anyone wanted them A couple of big companies tried offering them back Like the Blackberry Android ones a few years ago and they had the super cool looking one with the slide out keyboard a couple years before that Both were fails Theres still a smaller companies of course A big company is never gonna make them again I feel like if they did make one again not only would it fail badly but most of the we want a keyboard crowd wont actually buy it either,mtkj75b,1.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtlgjsm,kiddokush,,10,2025-05-22 03:30:08,,,,The problem is that they dont actually look like the fucking Razr they just look like a dumb looking foldable phone The whole reason the razr was iconic was its look it cant just be a bulky slab,,0.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtopo6l,Benjamoose,,2,2025-05-22 17:07:11,,,,Which is a shame because the first version of the new RAZR they released actually did look just like it Then the second one was also based on their second generation original RAZR The last two iterations theyve just dropped the classic look entirely though removed the chin and now it looks indistinguishable from the Samsung equivalent though admittedly the RAZR colours are nicer Its a real shame,mtlgjsm,1.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtk4uxg,YAOMTC,,4,2025-05-21 22:51:13,,,,The original Razr had a small screen on the outside Thats part of why it was unique I dont think such a small screen would make a massive difference to battery usage when its intention is to reduce the screenon time of the massive inside display,mtju766,1.0,1ks7fu9
comment,mtkpddc,HalobenderFWT,,1,2025-05-22 00:48:48,,,,Weird my Sony Ericsson z500 had a small screen on the outside too Also came out in 2004 It definitely wasnt a unique feature Just like back then people are still pretending that the Razr was something special when the only thing it really had going for it was that it was probably the thinnest phone on the market Everything else about it was hot garbage,mtk4uxg,2.0,1ks7fu9

comment,mtmzru8,JBWalker1,,2,2025-05-22 11:39:53,,,,I think if they got rid of the touch screen on the front itd make a massive difference to battery usagecost Based on what The outter screen is much smaller and will use less energy than if someones using the inner screen So itll save energy if people use the outter one for something quick Signifigantly more durable than the inner one too of course for obvious reasons People arent gonna buy a foldable with no outside screen now anyway Would be an instant flop People always suggest mainstream devices should be designed for a niche crowd,mtju766,1.0,1ks7fu9
