comment,m4vlmke,IMovedYourCheese,,705,2025-01-01 17:53:21,,,,Quest 3S at 300 is an insane value Apple really thought 3500 was a good price point to enter the market Glad to see that the reality distortion field has some limits,m4umj1g,1.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vyayk,LordRobin------RM,,207,2025-01-01 19:00:27,,,,I cant believe that Apple expected the product to sell well at that price point I figured it was just a first step toward a more affordable future product Its a shame if thats not going to happen For what its worth I never saw Apple Vision as a competitor to MetaQuest or Oculus Rift Apple seemed to be positioning it as a nextgen content consumption device something that might replace the iPad for some folks,m4vlmke,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4zrbwr,sorrylilsis,,13,2025-01-02 11:12:34,,,,Its funny when I reviewed the first Oculus dev kit for a magazine way back in the day once of the the things I was super hyped with was watching movies with it My editor then told me great but thats a single guy point of view He wasnt wrong and people keep having that bias 10 years later,m4w1s1e,5.0,1hr312h

comment,m6744n3,sorrylilsis,,1,2025-01-09 08:49:51,,,,Oh there are single guys out there sure Some nerdy enough to be interested in VR an even smaller subset who are wealthy enough to throw a few thousands in an high end headset and out of those an even smaller subset will actually pull the trigger and buy the thing The economic reality is that building a product like the Apple Vision Pro and mobilize the whole software ecosystem that it needs to be actually useful long term is very hard Its a super cool product technically but one that is way too niche to actually have mass appeal The tech industry is full of those,m63wagy,7.0,1hr312h

comment,m4z1ojq,Radulno,,2,2025-01-02 06:36:03,,,,Meh I got it in trial for that and its way inferior to a good TVprojector and sound system system considering the price this is what it gets compared to Sound is nothing exceptional from it and its uncomfortable wearing that thing for the duration of a movie its heavy on your face and it heats not to the point of hurting but uncomfortable Without even mentioning how its so isolating where as a TV allow you to watch something with other people Also the other headsets way cheaper can watch movies too,m4vzbd0,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4y3t13,lecollectionneur,,-1,2025-01-02 02:16:20,,,,I have a VR headset but I will never get whyd you put one to watch a movie Its not confortable and it adds nothing compared to a tv,m4vzbd0,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wetcf,Eccohawk,,18,2025-01-01 20:29:35,,,,Also seemed like they were positioning it to replace your monitors Heres multiple desktops at whatever display scale and size you want,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4yq3bb,Leungal,,21,2025-01-02 04:53:36,,,,Thats the idea but it sucks right now Imagine you had to go about a regular workday at an office job but had to put on a pair of ski goggles every time you wanted to look at your monitor Maybe one day if theyre as lightweight and ergonomic as a pair of glasses but that will require multiple generational leaps in tech,m4wetcf,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4zgy45,nagi603,,3,2025-01-02 09:20:35,,,,Yet it was absolutely incapable of replacing them for anyone who actually works with monitors all days It was too heavy and it had a 2 hour battery life untethered And if you actually want to interact not just stare at those monitors you either have to sit at the same place and use the keyboards or get a hit on productivity and come up with a completely new gesture based interaction Which is much more tiring than having your hands rest on the desk So its great for a 10 minute demo session And would be great for ARVR work stuff if it had the apps and comfort and usability of the rest of the market,m4wetcf,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4w6nvs,stevenmu,,60,2025-01-01 19:45:13,,,,Werent Apple very clear when they launched it that they never expected it to be a mass market consumer product Im pretty sure they always said it was somewhere between an experimental tech demo and a dev kit Maybe Im misremembering,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h

comment,m4zu5z8,ArriePotter,,1,2025-01-02 11:40:54,,,,IMHO it was basically an open beta for developers They wanted to build a bunch of hype for their new product category to be introduced to the mainstream over the next decade The first gen was for the folks to make apps with for the next gens,m4xzhh2,6.0,1hr312h

comment,m4xwy8y,NtheLegend,,9,2025-01-02 01:33:09,,,,Yes It was never oh were going to sell it at a premium and its going to break the entire category It was always EXTREMELY clear from the initial presentation that this was a pickaxe in the ice a highend product that allowed them to push the technology in ways that consumerpriced tech simply cant They wanted this to be different People have such weird perspectives about this device that it was never intended to be I absolutely agree it lacks content or a killer app because it is a very convincing demo at an Apple Store but theyre building the technology first and hoping they can figure out what more they can do it with it from there 224000 estimated Vision Pros sold at 3500 is threequarters of a billion dollars in revenue Thats HUGE for a toe dipped in the water,m4w6nvs,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4zkmne,Bloody_Sunday,,5,2025-01-02 10:01:45,,,,Thats revenue not net income On one hand its 2024 sales are guesstimated by market reports at around 400420k On the other Apple was initially expecting it to sell around 800k and now according to the news reports theyre stopping production perhaps for a new model Thats way too high even for the early adopter throwmoneyaway group with very low market response outside the US estimated to be one of the main weaknesses Augmented reality is nowhere near as extraordinary or experimental as Apple thought it is And they are going to have to offer something way more tangible and cheaper if they have any expectations of success Plus their acquired knowhow is admittedly very useful for them but they will have to use it sooner or later into something far more appealing,m4xwy8y,5.0,1hr312h
comment,m52g70x,OperativePiGuy,,1,2025-01-02 20:47:02,,,,what exactly DID it do to revolutionize the technology out of curiosity,m4xwy8y,5.0,1hr312h
comment,m4zoa9x,tweda4,,1,2025-01-02 10:41:19,,,,I mean that was what Apple suggested but if that were true then surely wed be expecting a new apple vision device as opposed to just a shuttering of production I cant tell then if theyve decided the concept doesnt work or if theyve decided that other cheaper options wouldnt have enough market appeal Or I suppose if theyre just being really quiet about a successor for some reason Either way lacking any announcements indicating of a successor it doesnt seem like the AVP has succeeded in Apples view,m4w6nvs,4.0,1hr312h
comment,m6t4vsv,zzazzzz,,1,2025-01-12 21:03:36,,,,thats cope all their marketing very clearly targeted the casual user so either their marketing department completely failed or they just lied,m4w6nvs,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m50m0tj,wiyixu,,1,2025-01-02 15:04:46,,,,There are reports well before the launch that Sony was only able to produce 450000 micro LED screens Two screens per unit plus typical failure rates and reserves for replacements Supply chain evidence alone made it clear the AVP was going to sell in the low sixfigure range,m4wolzs,5.0,1hr312h

comment,m50w0ov,wiyixu,,1,2025-01-02 15:59:49,,,,There are two screens per AVP so 225000 units per year There are no published sales figures by Apple Everything sales estimate so far is a guess by analysts All estimates thus far suggest sales well above 225000 units,m50u0sd,7.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wf7o3,HaMMeReD,,17,2025-01-01 20:31:45,,,,The thing is thats lonely AF Its the perfect media consumption device for the person with no family or friends and a 140sf apartment that they can only sit with their hands on their lap and look at things That said apple knew it wouldnt sell they wanted to see if it would get traction though It was a flawed plan though if they said Apple vision pro 3500 Apple Vision 1500 6 mo later it would have actually sold really well and got way more traction as developers would be like oh shit we have 6 months to get products to market Instead they are like Vision Pro 3500 next product next product price Its really a high risk situation Not only do you have to spent a ton up front to get your foot in the door on the dev env but you have no pathway to profitability Edit Same goes for content production why spend the extra to produce content for such a small demographic And personally I think its content consumption for lonely rich people with ubernecks,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m5c28l2,mcknuckle,,1,2025-01-04 10:23:12,,,,Honestly I think even at the 1500 price selling really well would still be selling to a niche audience I think a world in which any kind of headset or glasses based computing is ubiquitous will be one that looks different than the one we live in today that uses a different computing paradigm that doesnt exist yet in addition to or instead of what we use today In the same way that GUI based computing was a different paradigm to CLI based computing or the way that smartphone based computing was massively more accessible than desktop based computing If were putting on a pair of glasses en masse when we want to interact with computing power it will be to do something we cant do already in a way we cant do any other way not just to do more of what we can already do Even if its novel,m4wf7o3,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wdwbt,daft_knight,,20,2025-01-01 20:24:35,,,,The crazy thing is the Apple Vision Pro IS a competitor to the quest 3 Yes its much more premium but the quest 3 offers 90 of the vision pros functionality plus all of the PC VR gaming stuff thats completely absent on the Vision Pro Im hard pressed to think of a feature present on the Vision Pro thats not possible on the quest 3,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h

comment,m505ggl,Grimzkunk,,2,2025-01-02 13:17:03,,,,I meant that their own MacOS compatibility with the Vision is just another way to lock the user into their ecosystem From my perspective its very negative for a piece of hardware to not be able to run on operating systems So I would not call that a feature Its more like a drawback,m4yto4u,7.0,1hr312h

comment,m4yfqmx,birdington1,,7,2025-01-02 03:36:10,,,,I dont think people understand the fact they werent releasing it expecting it to sell well at this price point Its priced that way simply to cover the cost of RND and use the current sales as customer feedback for the next iterations They will bring back a lower cost version in a few years with the exact same features as the now pro version and price a more advanced pro version slightly higher When adjusted for inflation the iPhone is now only 60 more than the very first one This is their exact release model for every single product they have,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4z74kt,nysecret,,1,2025-01-02 07:31:55,,,,and when the iPhone first came out it was considered an extravagant purchase and a luxury device i know iPhones are still expensive but tons of consumers are fine with the expense because iPhones have such improved utility to the point of near necessity But at launch the iPhone didnt even have an app store The iPhone was in fact successful out the gate but I wouldnt say it broke through till the 3rd generation,m4yfqmx,4.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wlgwz,intellifone,,1,2025-01-01 21:05:33,,,,The only thing keeping it from being any semblance of mass market at that price is that there is zero way to share an experience With my phone or laptop I can tilt the screen to show someone else but I cannot watch a movie with someone else I couldnt get one for my wife and I to both watch a movie on a giant 1000 screen at the Grand Canyon together I cant play games with her in the living room That would be the killer app,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h

comment,m4xab08,kibblerz,,0,2025-01-01 23:19:22,,,,They repeatedly stated that they knew it wouldnt become a mainstream thing they were quite clear it was specifically for early adoptersenthusiasts They basically marketed it as a dev kit from the beginning The reason its so pricey is because the 4k micro oleds are quite difficult to manufacture with the cost for the screens themselves being about 1800 due to a 50 failure rate when manufacturing,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4weazg,--Bazinga--,,-2,2025-01-01 20:26:48,,,,Apple sold the best VR product they were able to make and consequently this was the price point They could have settled for a Quest competitor but it wouldnt be near as good as the Vision Pro is That wont mean they wont release a cheaper version They learned tons of shit from the Vision Pro and there is now an ecosystem with apps to benefit from,m4vyayk,3.0,1hr312h

comment,m4w7a5a,Fedoraus,,9,2025-01-01 19:48:37,,,,I dont really think they are wanting to compete with the quest though They are trying to create an actual virtual replacement to your PC altogether but it was no where near ready It had the same processor as the highest end macbook pro at the time iirc So at the very least Id expect it to be between the price of a maxed out Ipad and a macbook pro Whereas the quest 3 is like a mid end phone in terms of specs I just dont think theres enough of a demand for what apples selling yet even if priced well,m4vlmke,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4w6ps0,FlyingBishop,,12,2025-01-01 19:45:30,,,,It might have been an okay price point if they had made any effort to provide compatability with existing games The fact that BeatSaber didnt work at launch The way theyre insistent on hand tracking reminds me of Elon Musk insisting lidarradar are unnecessary and FSD can just use cameras Except the cameras cost nothing and they couldve just provided compatability with IndexQuest controllers and not provided any firstparty ones Would have cost them basically nothing and they couldve had access to existing gaming titles which would have at least doubled the use cases for the headset,m4vlmke,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wglk5,HaMMeReD,,8,2025-01-01 20:39:11,,,,As a developer Apple should have outlined that plan so that developers could manage their risk tolerance If you were a dev would you spend 3500 up front all your mac station expenses so that you could have an opportunity to build for something not even knowing if there is a roadmap Like yeah apple might be doing this but we dont know so 3500 is a lot If they had announced the next version in 6mo or 1yr or whatever and the price point a lot more developers would buy the 3500 version knowing they have a 1 yr window to get their stuff to market for the masses Instead without a roadmap we are stuck with a chicken and egg scenario Developers want users users need developers So developers sit and wait to see if a user base is being established and potential users sit and wait for experiences that are worth it,m4w4x1g,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4whqwn,HaMMeReD,,8,2025-01-01 20:45:23,,,,Without Apple announcing a clear roadmap developers are just going to wait for that next version The for developers think doesnt work unless developers are also looped into the goals and details of the ecosystem and believe that their investment will have a clear path to ROI Developing for a product that hasnt even been announced is incredibly high risk and likely for very limited reward Itd take a very special person to do that instead of just you know making a quest or pcvr experience maybe with a consideration of using unityunreal so you can maybe target AVP some time in the future,m4w4x1g,3.0,1hr312h

comment,m4wjzpo,elton_john_lennon,,3,2025-01-01 20:57:29,,,,Apple really thought 3500 was a good price point to enter the market Its not about the price people can justify the price when there are good ways to use the device Problem is there werent To the extent AVP is an entertainment device personal mobile theatre etc Meta gives you better bang for buck and to the extent AVP is a productivity device it doesnt actually provide anything new or groundbreaking Just floating displays nothing more whatever you can do in the goggles you can do on a flat screen I was really hoping for them to have some killer app ao killer usecase but sadly the fcked it badly and didnt even have some regular apps youd expect them to have on launch day like popular streaming,m4vlmke,2.0,1hr312h
comment,m4zhjve,nagi603,,1,2025-01-02 09:27:22,,,,Its not about the price people can justify the price when there are good ways to use the device It would have to be at least twice as useful as the average users smartphone for that For most especially nonUS rich gadget minded the difference is even bigger Hell 510x as useful as an actual display unless you are again rich AF and have a 3k display,m4wjzpo,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4xbfew,kibblerz,,0,2025-01-01 23:25:36,,,,Well the mac virtual display can simulate a dual 4k ultrawide display which a display like that costs atleast 2000 And its portable You can also play PCVR through ALVR though if you want to experience the benefits of the 4k microoleds you need a beefy PC My 4080 gets pushed to the max with VR on the vision but it looks far superior to what the quest is capable of,m4wjzpo,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4y2yzc,thedanyes,,3,2025-01-02 02:10:55,,,,Can emulate as many pixels as you want as long as youre willing to turn your head but effective DPI still sucks compared to a typical PC monitor According to this guy equivalent to a 28 1080p screen at typical viewing distance which is similar DPI as if you put a 55 UHD TV on your desk,m4xbfew,4.0,1hr312h
comment,m4y3xef,kibblerz,,1,2025-01-02 02:17:07,,,,I have a vision pro and I use the virtual mac screen often It certainly looks 4k The virtual monitor that was originally released looked closer to 1440p but after the recent ultrawide updat in November it looks great and truly looks 4k The 4k ultrawide can fit into the FOV without turning your head If you want the dual 4k youll need to turn your head though If you have dual ultrawide monitors youll gonna be moving your head some regardless lol,m4y2yzc,5.0,1hr312h
comment,m4wno4e,Deltahotel_,,1,2025-01-01 21:17:10,,,,Their advertising also wasnt great in my opinion I feel like if youre going to create a product that nobody really asked for you should try pretty hard to give people a reason to want it and help them to understand what its capable of I never went out of my way to find out what it does or what the point of it was and probably most people felt the same way especially at 3500,m4vlmke,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4uyotu,SoSKatan,,-38,2025-01-01 15:42:09,,,,Not sure what you mean by no content Its like saying the Apple TV has no content As an owner of one its completely changed how i watch movies shows While the immersive video stuff is high quality thats not its primary function I just see the unit as a high quality universal screen that you can place anywhere Its far better than any TV or monitor Ive ever seen and it works great for also playing ps5 and pc games So I find your comment confusing its complaining that hd TVs dont have any content Wtf Sure the AVP can do more than show virtual screens in the air but that is its primary function Apples own marketing has shown as something to watch movies on 99 of what I use it for are just the following apps Apple TV Max Disney web browser which also covers Netflix etc The device has literally more content than I can consume in a lifetime with just four apps,m4umj1g,1.0,1hr312h

comment,m4v1o9r,SoSKatan,,-15,2025-01-01 16:00:18,,,,The quest 3s video quality isnt better than most screens the AVP is Dont get me wrong I love my quest 3 I use it for lots of things but I use more AVP more Its like comparing an iPhone to a Nintendo Switch At the basic level they are very similar high def screen arm cpu network connectivity etc etc But they are very different products with very different use cases I wouldnt even say the two devices are compete against each other I use my AVP more than my Quest 3 because well I watch more shows movies than I play fully immersive games I also love my Nintendo switch but u use my iPhone far more Imagine someone trying to make the argument that the iPhone doesnt have any content and people should just get a switch instead Also Im not sure why Im getting downvoted Am I not supposed to provide first hand experience with the AVP On a daily basis I use my AVP more than my quest 3 But I guess it has no content,m4uzm13,3.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vbxp6,joomla00,,13,2025-01-01 16:59:49,,,,Its cool that you can afford 4k for a personal media viewer but I imagine that market is very very very small Most people buy a vr device to you know do vr stuff Whete it lacks content And have a 200 tablet or tv for media consumption,m4v1o9r,4.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vfovb,SoSKatan,,-2,2025-01-01 17:20:39,,,,I personally like the fact that there are different options Would you prefer it if the AVP just didnt exist Id argue that most people spend far more than 4K for movie show watching when you factor in the cost of having a dedicated room right A hundred years ago people use to have a dedicated room for listening to the radio because radios were large and expensive As soon as they became portable people no longer needed radio rooms Look the AVP will come down is price over time other companies will make similar quality products which will also lower the cost But at its current price and feature set the AVP is worth it if you are the type of person who has a home theater It seems like you and others and hung up on the idea that such consumer electronic device exists at that price point Which seems silly compared to the automotive market Its like trying to make the argument that Lamborghinis shouldnt exist and everyone should just buy a pruis I personally dont think Lamborghinis are worth the money but Im glad they exist and are an option Which is also interesting people here dont bat an eye at high end vehicles markets existing but a 4k high end headset existing is a bad thing right,m4vbxp6,5.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vooby,joomla00,,7,2025-01-01 18:09:43,,,,You keep missing the point but ok No one is slamming you for your purchase and your personal justifications for it Everyone is happy it works for you and you find the price acceptable But Its designed as a vr device the general population was expecting a revolutionary vr device and its lacking as a vr device The best use case youre presenting is for it to be a very high end media consumption device Which is great for the handful of you guys out there that were looking for but disappointing to everyone else especially at its price point Its a dead product asis And as a home theater guy myself a big part of the experience being able to share it with others The best part is talking about a movie or show and someone goes we gotta watch it in the theater room And everyone smiling and having a good time sharing a visceral experience that only a proper home theater system can bring Its a completely different experience than a ht on your head solution,m4vfovb,6.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vsowt,SoSKatan,,2,2025-01-01 18:31:04,,,,Just stop and look at how many down votes I got for simply making the case that its very good at one thing movie show watching and that because of that I use it more than my Q3 Then look at how much the comments are upvoted claiming it has no content and its a paper weight Most likely made by people who havent used the AVP more than 5 minutes Interesting right Its like people are legit mad the device even exists in the market at all Do I wish the AVP was cheaper or had exclusive games Of course I do but that doesnt detract from the value Im already getting from it I do think expectations were given both the cost and it being Apple and VRs existing market being gaming So its like wtf is this thing Look all I can offer is first hand experience The movie watching is so good I prefer watching stuff on it even if Im sitting on my couch in front of my TV I like how I can have that same experience reclined in bed at night or take it on a plane The device didnt meet my prior VR expectations but it far exceeded the movie show part So much so that it quickly changed my movie show watching routine Im a gamer and a VR enthusiast but the AVP made me realize that I consume more movies shows than I do VR games After owning the AVP my headset usage went up by a factor of 5 Simply because it was better at doing something that I already did Look if you are a home theatre guy you might find this thread or others insightful Given the costs of his other home theater the AVP is on the cheaper side of his devices But the weird thing is the same people who are hate the idea of a high end headset existing have no problem that there is a high end theater market Interesting right,m4vooby,7.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vwiqp,joomla00,,3,2025-01-01 18:51:03,,,,Bruh youre talking in circles and keep missing the point If the best case for it is a personal home theater system the device is a failure aside from the handful of people like you because its suppose to be a revolutionary vr device As a vr device its lacking content 99 of people arnt looking at this to buy this just to watch stuff theyre expecting a revolutionary experience As presented by apple and expected by its executives and investors Im not going to keep going but Ill just put it this way Its like apple releasing a flying car But its not that useful as a flying car because its uses are very limited because you can only fly and park it in a hand full of places during certain weather conditions But its the best one seater car ever built Great for people looking for the best one seater ever and willing to pay 5x the cost to its nearest competitor Justifiably disappointing for everyone else,m4vsowt,8.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vzpgf,SoSKatan,,0,2025-01-01 19:07:55,,,,Hmm Ive only been mentioning the exact cost benefit Ive found with it Its been worth it But I dont think any one other than Apple fan boys thought it was going to be universal as iPhones Yes initial product at a high entry cost is going to mean a limited market But people seem pissed about that It was never a mass market device There is still a potential world like that years from now but it would require a high quality affordable product People seem offended by the idea of a high end VR headset market I imagine the product designers at Apple had been working on headsets for years and once they nailed the movie watching experience was like we can make a product but its going to be expensive or we can wait 5 years until we can make it cheap what do we do At some point Im guessing internally they figured there might work given its movie watching experience Im happy with my AVP purchase and Im glad it exists Without the AVP the closest thing for a home theatre replacement we would have is big screen beyond which given that it requires a PC and Steam VR trackers the total cost is about the same as the AVP Given the BSB is tied to a single room makes the AVP a far better option Maybe people are just mad that Apple released a new product thats out of their budget But look Lamborghinis arent in my budget but Im not mad at Lamborghinis for existing Im glad they exist,m4vwiqp,9.0,1hr312h

comment,m4vp9ub,pre-existing-notion,,3,2025-01-01 18:12:56,,,,Its because the Vision Pro was marketed as being able to do a lot more than just be a monitor and while it has some content a lot of it is underdeveloped 4k is high but justifiable for a VR set of Aple quality however the device isnt there yet 4k for a nice screen when you were expecting a lot more is a big ask and people understandably arent a fan of it existing in this manner,m4vfovb,6.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vuspi,SoSKatan,,1,2025-01-01 18:42:04,,,,I honestly dont think it was marketed as anything more than for content watching Every Apple commercial Ive seen has just shown people watching movies shows People expected something different based on other prior VR headsets which is reasonable There is a distinct difference between what people expected versus how its marketed They did hype up the new UI scheme and there is something to that which might highlight the future of computing UI for some use cases But thats on par with what Apple did with the first Mac Lisa and with the first iPhone They gave us a new more natural UI but thats isnt what sold the product It was the overall here is a better way at doing something youve already been doing For the AVP thats movie watching For the iPhone it was email texting web browser,m4vp9ub,7.0,1hr312h
comment,m4v6oi6,dunno0019,,14,2025-01-01 16:30:00,,,,Its probably because you keep insisting that basically every bit of video ever is now content for the AVP Because you know thats not what we are talking about Great apple released yet another device that can play any video ever Oh and it also happens to do that on crisp new display technology So exactly par for the course with new apple tech Awesome Now what does it have for exclusive software that I cant get anywhere else Dont be obtuse,m4v1o9r,4.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vac1n,SoSKatan,,-4,2025-01-01 16:50:50,,,,Im not being obtuse at all Im happy with my AVP purchase even if thats ALL it did watch movies computer monitor Watching Dune 2 on the AvP was a better experience than watching it in the movie theater The fact that I can have that quality of a display on my couch in my bedroom on an airplane and take with me makes the device for me at least worth it If there was a physical TV that looked that good that I could just move easily room to room and take with me Id buy it But no such physical device exists Like I get what you are saying it would be nice to have exclusive content But Im saying at the end of the day it doesnt need it to be useful I didnt buy an iPhone because it had exclusive content I bought an iPhone because it does most things I need well in a portable device Compared to 15 years ago smart phones are a partial computer replacement As soon as phone web browsing became was as good as doing it on a PC it became a game changer The single most app I use on my iPhone is web browsing I didnt buy my iPhone for exclusive content I bought it because it did things I could do elsewhere extremely well Sure the App Store is great but the first gen iPhone didnt have an App Store Its killer feature was the portable browser The AVP is similar its a better TV than my TV Yes its fun to talk about what else could be done with it but Im happy with just that A home theater that I can use anywhere So for me its bizarre to see posts saying the AVP has no content,m4v6oi6,5.0,1hr312h

comment,m4virnf,SoSKatan,,-2,2025-01-01 17:37:47,,,,Im not trying to sell any one on anything Im just relating my first hand experience Im happy with my AVP But to answer your question There is no other comparable device to the AVP on the market right now I wish there was but the Q3 isnt at the quality of being a real TV replacement The AVP is Im sure we will have other options in the next few years Image a world where the Nintendo switch came out before the iPhone You would see tons of posts from people who are like I dont get it why is there an iPhone Its 4 times as expensive doesnt have controllers or exclusive games It doesnt have any content What would you think of such statements Im trying to highlight whats really important Im assuming you are like me you have both a switch and a smart phone The two are very comparable hardware wise are they not 99 of what I use my phone for is web browsing messaging and email It does those things very very well So much so that Im happy to pay the 4x cost over a switch to use it for just that The AvP does movie watching very very well and my entire point is because of that its a game changer Because of that I use my AVP more than my quest 3 despite all of its exclusive content I use my iPhone way more than my switch because its better at the things I do more often People look at the AVP and look at it as a VR headset whose existing market has mostly been gaming The AVP is something new and its use case is completely different than other headsets I understand the confusion people only can relate to it in context of something else Thats why I use the TV comparison as its more apt But its difficult to convey the concept of a high quality TV that you can just place anywhere you want and take with you If a physical TV existed that was as good and as flexible and portable as the AVP Id pay 4K for it,m4vfj48,7.0,1hr312h

comment,m4vyzoo,sethsez,,1,2025-01-01 19:04:06,,,,It wasnt initially pitched as just being a personal portable screen and taken in that context it still has the pretty massive downside of being gorgeous and sounding great for exactly one person Which I suppose isnt a problem if you exclusively watch TV movies and sports by yourself but for a lot of people they consider those social activities at least some of the time and makes Apple Vision Pro a total nonstarter as a home theater replacement no matter how great it is in every other respect It should also be mentioned that a simple TV is infinitely more comfortable than even the most comfortable VRAR set by virtue of not being strapped to any part of your body I think its a viable monitor replacement but its not a strict undeniable upgrade,m4uyotu,2.0,1hr312h
comment,m4vwhtj,Sneyek,,-4,2025-01-01 18:50:55,,,,Theres some content already But content is not really the important thing with this headset its not the features Mac passthrough is the killer feature here Add this with a gaming PC at home and Moonlight OR an NVidia GeForce Now sub and you can pretty much do whatever you want wherever you want Its young and lacks for sure but it was never intended for everyone its still a niche tech mostly to built hype and get feedback for a V2 which will probably be the actual consumer V1,m4umj1g,1.0,1hr312h

comment,m4v8p21,JBWalker1,,11,2025-01-01 16:41:30,,,,I remember so many comments from people saying how excited they were to use this for work as if this was somehow exponentially better than two physical monitors that you didnt have to strap to your head Sounds cool at first but having a full VR headset literally strapped to your face all day while working would be terrible especially in hot weather so your face would get sweaty They look very dorky to use which alone will put lots off It also restricts your vision like you cant see stuff to the side of you I think its field of view is around 95 degrees instead of probably 160 degrees with your normal vision so thats another reason why it would feel bad to wear long Would close yourself off from people around you too much and thats even ignoring the fact that they cant see your face just weird digital eyes The pass through quality is decent but not close to as good as real life On the other hand AR glasses exist for just 399 Just glasses which are almost the same size as normal glasses but have a screen built into them You dont need something strapped to your face so theyre comfortable to wear for longer and you can look reletively normal using them They fit in your pocket Can be taken off and on easy like normal glasses helpful if youre talking to people You can see through them like normal glasses so you have your full real world field of view visible They now also have all the 3dof features built in like other VR headsets so you can place a virtual screen in front of you and itll stay in place like a normal monitor when you turn your head awayoptional of course The main downside is that the screens have a 50 degrees field of view but thats not a huge deal since you have your full natural field of view This years versions are already 60 degrees anyway The main drawback is that theyre 1080p As soon as theyre 1600p then theyre perfect But yeah glasses are the future for work Not even the far future either so its weird Apple chose to make the vision pro as a work device normally theyre forward thinking Someone in a cafe wearing a full vision pro for work will look dumb compared to someone next to them using glasses even if the vision pro does more,m4uwqq9,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4w74q3,FlyingBishop,,1,2025-01-01 19:47:47,,,,The price point seemed to be an acknowledgement that this was a dev kit and not intended to be a mass market product And its a dev kit for creating software that will run on a headset that doesnt exist yet that has similar specs is lighter weight and has a reasonable price point But the way they were hyping it sounds like I feel like Apples leadership is pretty out of touch in terms of what 3500 is and how many people are willing to spend that on a whim But at least initially I think they knew it was a dev kit price and not a massmarket price,m4uwqq9,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4x21eb,shinyquagsire23,,2,2025-01-01 22:32:47,,,,IMO its a product designed to get people excited Enterprise likes it because the competition is a 10k headset with a subscription model Varjo and Vision Pro is half the price I suspect it can take off in Pro markets because its a portable calibrated 10bit HDR display with perfect lighting conditions exactly what youd want for video color grading and mastering kinda niche but hey Im sure theres people whod like to work next to a window for a change if the price was about half Theres alternatives but no 11 competing products but its also a bit too heavy for 8hrs of work But ime even for casual VR uOLED is great and brings out a ton of lowlight details that get nuked on LCDs and it avoids all the OLED smear that full size OLED monitors have For consumers it and Android XR are the only headsets with Widevine DRM ready to go so they dont have to beg every streaming service to make an exception to get 1080p and 4K video Ive tried using my Quest for media and its just such a hassle comparatively,m4usmx0,2.0,1hr312h

comment,m4yzxx1,filmguy123,,4,2025-01-02 06:19:10,,,,My understanding following previous rumors is that this is out of production but not discontinued simply because they have excess stock and are updating it with a new CPU next year The current model has plenty of inventory due to low sales and does not need further production A lot of people are mistakenly reading this as discontinued The refresh is rumored to have no big changes just a newer CPU,,0.0,1hr312h

comment,m4xifw6,LARGames,,2,2025-01-02 00:06:55,,,,Beat Saber is hardly the killer app I dont think there is one Though there are a plethora of fantastic experiences that as a whole make VR as a platform worth it Though 99 percent of them are on Meta and PC Of course those fall under VR Spatial computing has always been used rarely as a niche application Things like 3d design and showcasing To be a replacement for a monitor it needs to surpass a monitor for the specific requirements of a monitor without having additional downsides While you can have a display any resolution and as many as you want Not on the apple headset of course battery life and comfort are a downside ESPECIALLY on the apple headset Just because they wanted to go with form over function Making the headset out of incredibly heavy materials like metal and glass was just plain stupid Having a headstrap without any top support was just plain stupid Having no internal battery at all was incredibly stupid If it had even a tiny one youd be able to hot swap the external battery instead of having to turn off the device,m4xfn8o,3.0,1hr312h
