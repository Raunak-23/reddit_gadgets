comment,luwgjgm,chucklas,,101,2024-11-01 18:54:59,,,,That price point doesnt compete with the quest 3 Until companies get in the market at a closer price point the quest line will continue to own the casual gamer market,,0.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luxuubs,clamroll,,18,2024-11-01 23:36:04,,,,The only things competing with the quest 3 currently are the 3s and the 2 Youre entirely correct tho if this new device was priced around 500 and came with controllers it would be a different story Still likely wouldnt have the software library that the quest does tho,luwgjgm,1.0,1ghcfvs

comment,lv1u9zb,Suedie,,2,2024-11-02 17:54:48,,,,It depends on if its focused on productivity instead of gaming The Quest 3 is marketed for productivity but its pretty awkward to use it for work Apparently the vision pro is really good for productivity but the price point is too high The Quest Pro kinda sits awkwardly inbetween as being more expensive than the 3 but not really being much more capable for productivity So if it ends up being a good productivity headset it could outcompete the Quest 3 Quest Pro and Vision Pro in the productivity segment at that price point But for casual gaming the Quest 3 and Quest 3s have that market locked down pretty much especially since they got exclusives I dont think there is that much demand for a productivity headset to really carry sales but who knows maybe Samsung could convince a bunch of execs that they really have to buy a bunch of these for their workers,luwgjgm,1.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luwdbkp,x_scion_x,,148,2024-11-01 18:38:23,,,,1000 and 1500 Dollars I just cant get into VR enough for that Too much of a yay this is fun for about an hour a day for a week and then never touch it again for months other than parties,,0.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luwglek,RSomnambulist,,39,2024-11-01 18:55:15,,,,I could see paying that much with a ton of caveats If they get the battery and compute off my face and onto a hip worn device if that device is enough to handle HalfLife Alyx on its own hardware if it has 90hz if it has oled screens with 2k to each eye if it has foveated rendering probably necessary if it can install steamthen yeah Ill pay that much Id also take included haptics for hand maybe chest Be nice if it can accurately and usefully track your hands and feet I dont see Samsung doing most of the most pertinent parts of this though like moving the compute off your face That seems to be something almost no one is realizing they should do and should have been done 5 years ago,luwdbkp,1.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luz8klp,cowadoody3,,6,2024-11-02 05:39:25,,,,like moving the compute off your face That seems to be something almost no one is realizing they should do and should have been done 5 years ago Marquez Brown Lee just uploaded a video showing a new set of AR headsets from Facebook and Snapchat and the FB one has moved the computer part off the headset into a side unit you carry with you Honestly Im more excited about AR headsets than I am for VR headsets I honestly think AR is the future and if they get small and cheap enough they will be as ubiquotous as smart phones THIS will be the future watch,luwglek,2.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv20iqk,NecroCannon,,2,2024-11-02 18:28:12,,,,I honestly feel like the future is two kinds of AR Glasses that can directly connect to your phone that basically acts like a smart watch but on your face and goggles for home use that can handle more intensive tasks and has better AR capabilities eye tracking better screens more power The goggles will get phased out as we bring that experience to glasses as it becomes cheaper Once Apple scales down the Vision I bet there will be people using them or walking around with them Like how AirPods looked stupid and next thing you know now theres people that walk around with AirPods in just to have them in,luz8klp,3.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv2zs5z,cowadoody3,,3,2024-11-02 21:40:29,,,,goggles for home use that can handle more intensive tasks and has better AR capabilities eye tracking better screens more power I feel the same way The home VR units dont even need a built in computer or battery for example They should just act as a monitor that connects straight to your desktop computer via a cable Think of how much lighter and cheaper they would be And the portable AR units like the FB and Snapchat ones can continue to get cheaper and lighter so they can be carried around outside and worn as easily as a smart watch This makes the most sense for me Apple could have really been the pioneer in this space but instead they did a superexpensive me too product that doesnt do ANYTHING very well its trash at portable and trash at home use not to mention its way way too expensive What were they thinking,lv20iqk,4.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luy3q9v,HeftyArgument,,12,2024-11-02 00:30:18,,,,Youre asking for the world and offering peanuts in exchange lol to achieve that with current technology youd end up paying much more than 1500,luwglek,2.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luzgi8p,DarthBuzzard,,3,2024-11-02 07:09:09,,,,No its not Price aside Apple Vision Pro is just about everything they described minus the compute since thats built into the headset but could technically be offloaded and AVPs power is enough to handle Half Life Alyx if Valve decided to port it over and support third party controllers,luz923d,4.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv0hxj6,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-02 13:24:42,,,,Also Apple had a version of a HMD with a separate break out for compute and it was nixed because they felt it had to be completely cable free as that was the future Given Quest 3s success I dont think they were wrong they are just still too early in the market to get the quality they demanded at a reasonable price Im not sure how far off it is but to me the end game seems like it should be super small lightweight glasses driven wirelessly from a phone Displayonly XR glasses like Viture may be the right direction though they are still tethered to a device for power and video signal Which Id imagine will be a requirement for quite a while we may be getting closer with high bandwidth wireless video but power is always a problem,luzgi8p,5.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv1red6,RSomnambulist,,2,2024-11-02 17:39:51,,,,The wirefree approach is a really backwards outlook What would you prefera lightweight super comfortable headset with a single wire running down to hip mounted compute or 500g strapped to your face The wirefree mentality needs to go until we can successfully stream 8k 90hz Id rather be comfortable in VR and a little inconvenienced by a wire and separate compute than start getting uncomfortable 3060m into use,lv0hxj6,6.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv1titx,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-02 17:50:50,,,,That why I said Im not sure how far off it is Not sure you actually read my whole comment but yes the goal has to be that compute is separate Hell it could be 30 years off with contact lens displays driven by induction But it will be the end goal And go look at the Viture glasses They are awesome for what they do virtual large display with basic tracking not VR thats why I mentioned them as a stepping stone That setup with true VR and a wired smart phone or equivalent as the compute would be an amazing step along the way,lv1red6,7.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv8ftdb,RSomnambulist,,1,2024-11-03 20:13:15,,,,I read your comment maybe it sounded like I was countering youmy comment was more an annoyance at the companies who are obsessed with the idea of wirefree when we simply arent there yetnot meant to be a counterpoint to what youre saying Virtue glasses look pretty cool Considered getting something like this for my wife when she was traveling a lot,lv1titx,8.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv73bx4,Shapes_in_Clouds,,1,2024-11-03 16:10:44,,,,The wirefree approach is a really backwards outlook What would you prefera lightweight super comfortable headset with a single wire running down to hip mounted compute or 500g strapped to your face I agree but in this case its likely referring to cabling to a Mac versus the more self contained approach the VP ultimately took Afterall the VP is still uniquely cabled to an external battery I imagine there are technical reasons why they didnt put all of the compute in the external box as well but I hope they can eventually get to that point Its the only way these headsets are going to miniaturize to a comfortable size on any reasonable time horizon If they can shave the weight down by even half it starts to change the game considerably as far as how wearable it is,lv1red6,7.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv8gamz,RSomnambulist,,1,2024-11-03 20:15:43,,,,That makes more sense They have a historical product that already exists though and could be altered for this purpose the Macminis Just seems weird they thought the maccrowd would buy into the Vision given its size ergonomics and computational power compared to the price,lv73bx4,8.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luz98la,Ikanan_xiii,,3,2024-11-02 05:46:25,,,,Maybe mainstream VR is that far off as well,luz923d,4.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv1sssc,RSomnambulist,,1,2024-11-02 17:47:04,,,,Most of this is already in the Q3Sony VR2 I meant 2k per eye whoops other than the higherend off the headset compute Installing Steam directly would be very straightforward though Samsung wouldnt want to do that only Valve would do something like that The Q3 and Sony headsets are both under 500 and basically doubling the compute of the Q3 shouldnt push the cost over 1000 So I dont think this is asking for the world Bigscreen Beyond is a tiny company and they made an OLED 2k per eye headset for 1000,luy3q9v,3.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luzq159,None,,1,2024-11-02 09:05:00,,,,Theres a broader picture where these companies are gunning to replace any screen you interact with at work or at home The infrastructure has to be built I think thats more Apples bet than Samsungs I feel like Samsung is merely to sell headsets but this shit is going this direction The internet is just short sighted and reactive as always,luwdbkp,1.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luzxt8s,BloodWork-Aditum,,1,2024-11-02 10:34:06,,,,Yeah thats a price that I could consider for a phone but that is something I use for hours every day and even then 1000 is a lot For a fun gimmick thing that gets used from time to time Hell nah,luwdbkp,1.0,1ghcfvs

comment,lux7luk,x_scion_x,,9,2024-11-01 21:19:33,,,,There are some cool games but the novelty of VR wears off quickly for me The only reason I have my quest 2 is because my employer bought everyone one for Christmas during Covid since they couldnt do the party We used it a lot initially but now its mainly used for parties as if I actually get time to game Id rather play on my big screen,lux5tja,2.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv4c8ln,Fecal-Facts,,1,2024-11-03 02:35:25,,,,Yep they all basically use the same gimmick pick up this or open that Most of the games are just really basic and as much as I love being active I can play as much as I can with a traditional controller or kbm If Im gaming I want to be lazy and zone out,lux7luk,3.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luzb4ai,SiscoSquared,,0,2024-11-02 06:06:57,,,,Very few vr games go beyond quick novelty arcade or whatever Sure W few are fun like Alyx bone works etc etc but I used my vr headset maybe a few hours a week for a half a year its been years now since I used it Very few intersting games for it cant justify buying such an expensive headset Its also just far less convenient than sitting down on the your couch or desk Plus a decent of ppl get motion sick from it too,lux5tja,2.0,1ghcfvs

comment,lv0nl4v,SiscoSquared,,0,2024-11-02 14:00:45,,,,What new games compare to Alyx or such The last time I got a game was squadrons which was just low quality port of a 2d game I ended up refunding within an hour Why is years in quote marks Its been around 23 years since it used it back in pandemic days rift s Dont get me wrong stuff like super hot or beat saber the pistol whip game or gorn and bone works etc wree fun enough but get boring fast once the novelty wore off The vr version of CS was kinda cool and being multiplayer had potential for replayability but it always found myself just playing normal 2d multiplayer shooters as it just lacked something,luzorq3,4.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luywr13,BigCommieMachine,,1,2024-11-02 03:51:49,,,,Something bizarre about the Apple Vision Pro isnt we havent seen a display even close pop up elsewhere It is MicroOLED so my money is being on Sony manufacturing the display But typically we see Apple push the envelope on tech and it pop up on some Chinese product within a couple of months It is especially odd because the Vision Pro hasnt exactly been a sales success youd imagine the supplier is sitting on some displays,,0.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luzh0fm,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-11-02 07:15:15,,,,Clearly you missed the time in history when no one asked for PCs in their homes or cellphones in their pockets Heres a truth of how the world works Nobody asks for new technology ever The average person is completely incapable of imagining a technology beyond what we already have Were average people asking for PCs No It took a visionary to invent the PC and they had to be forced onto people As Steve Jobs said Some people say give the customers what they want But thats not my approach Our job is to figure out what theyre going to want before they do,luz7n3e,1.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv0dwlf,cmlucas1865,,1,2024-11-02 12:57:06,,,,Youre right generally speaking But in this specific instance were approaching 30 years of these wearable VR sets nothing has been successful or profitable Gonna go out on a limb here assume Meta Apple the gang arent bad at designing their product These are just being rejected,luzh0fm,2.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv0geck,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-11-02 13:14:26,,,,These are just being rejected Because the tech is early We wont know things for certain until it has hit maturity 30 years is just the length of time since consumer VR was first tried but most of that time is empty space with no investment going on No investment means no advancement of the tech It needs more time to advance,lv0dwlf,3.0,1ghcfvs

comment,luzg87f,dedfishbaby,,1,2024-11-02 07:05:48,,,,What I dont understand is how these decisions are made I dont see any real demand from the consumers since VR for gaming years ago its just something that is there but nobody really cares that much How do they defend the huge spending in RD for this,,0.0,1ghcfvs
comment,luzhdo6,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-11-02 07:19:42,,,,How do they defend the huge spending in RD for this Foresight Companies are a lot better at forseeing the future than redditors Well in some cases like Samsung it might be because they see the wave coming from the likes of Meta and Apple and dont like the idea of being left out if it takes off but with leaders like Meta and Apple they understand that the tech could have mass appeal if it develops enough,luzg87f,1.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv0acnh,dedfishbaby,,1,2024-11-02 12:30:27,,,,Okay but VR is there for over 10 years at this point and I dont see any adoption still Im a big half life fan and still didnt play alyx because I just wont pay hundreds of dollars for the set as I have no use for it,luzhdo6,2.0,1ghcfvs
comment,lv0bftu,aCuria,,1,2024-11-02 12:38:56,,,,Its a matter of sufficient progression of the technology We already wear glasses every day If you make a device the same form factor as a regular pair of glasses and its powerful enough Such a device can replace your phone,luzg87f,1.0,1ghcfvs
