comment,n5mxzrb,ZachTheCommie,,140,2025-07-28 16:49:12,,,,Yup Its been happening for months for me Random devices remove themselves from rooms or remove themselves from Home altogether It really sucks because we live with my disabled father in law and Google Home has been an invaluable accessability tool And I cant even call customer support because Google sucks as a company now and there is no customer support and theres a half dozen different brands of devices connected so theres no central entity to consult anyway,n5muz5v,2.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5mx1ex,ElectronRotoscope,,87,2025-07-28 16:44:46,,,,It really just doesnt seem like a good thing to use an LLM for since they famously do shit like this all the time and it boggles my mind that Google pushes Gemini for stuff like that EDIT for clarity I mean LLMs are famous for occasionally exhibiting unexpected behaviour or in other words for sometimes giving a different result even when given the same input Not exactly what I want in a light switch,n5mqded,1.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5ogit5,wsippel,,-15,2025-07-28 21:04:34,,,,LLMs work great for this purpose if theyre set up correctly Doesnt even need a huge model like Gemini I run Home Assistant with much smaller local models Mistral Small and Qwen 3 works very nicely,n5mx1ex,2.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5p7jbm,camwow13,,2,2025-07-28 23:26:21,,,,Its definitely geared for tech savvy people but its not awful to setup Good GUI documentation and tons of community resources to bounce off of for support They have an alpha version of a locally run voice assistant too,n5ohmz4,4.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5rh2u9,bremidon,,1,2025-07-29 09:17:03,,,,I have no idea why you are being downvoted And since none of the downvoters have bothered to explain themselves I remain unsure what their problems are,n5ogit5,3.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5to67n,ElectronRotoscope,,1,2025-07-29 17:00:43,,,,I mean I didnt downvote but I would say maybe because the comment didnt refute the central point that many people dont want something for home automation that has unpredictable results Im no expert but setting it up correctly as far as I know doesnt solve the core hallucination problem with LLMs,n5rh2u9,4.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5xhwjj,bremidon,,1,2025-07-30 05:34:55,,,,Thank you for giving a whirl at explaining what they might be trying to say with the downvotes But I mean I have this set up at my home and it does not have very much trouble You just have to know how to set up your prompt And I would agree that there is a minor amount of trialanderror to work out some kinks but those were absolutely trivial to deal with Yes if you just use a general LLM and expect The kitchen is too bright to just work out of the can you are going to be disappointed Load up the prompt with enough information that limits what the LLM will consider and it is very accurate to the point of not really mattering anymore About the only weird thing I can really report is that the LLM insists on sometimes leaving out the final in the json it produces But that is easy enough to deal with once you figure it out Now getting IR to work with home automation that is a real pain to develop yourself at least time wise Getting the LLM to work was trivial by comparison,n5to67n,5.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5nk945,KyberKrystalParty,,12,2025-07-28 18:30:56,,,,I use an enterprise version of Gemini at my workplace and it does the same thing They launched functionalities where it can communicate and make actions between Gmail calendar sheets google drive etc and it worked a few times but in the last week or so just started telling me it cant do that Ill clarify that it can and itll be like I understand you THINK I can do that but youre wrong Pmo so much,n5mqded,1.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5nlxbl,thedoc90,,21,2025-07-28 18:38:54,,,,The idea of using llms which are nondeterministic to accomplish specific repeatable tasks is terrible A switch cant just decide to not turn on It either does what you want it to or its broken,n5mzeb2,2.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5r20yw,DanNeely,,1,2025-07-29 06:52:09,,,,Where LLMs would make sense is as a secondarysupplemental voice interface Keep the baseline set of deterministic commands using whatever the preLLM system is Then whenever theres a request thats outside the baseline command set let the LLM take a best guess at what the user asked for If its wrong the user is no worse off than if they just didnt know or misspoke the deterministic command and it would make interacting with someone elses setup easier if they used a different platform than yours Suitably anonymized the most common freeform text commands handled by the LLM would be good input data to expand the deterministic systems vocabulary and make it better overall The problem is that for the mega tech companies that own all the systems now chasing whatever the latest hype train is takes priority over actually making good products so instead we have delusional and randomly failing slop shoved down our throats at every opportunity,n5nlxbl,3.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5nrzci,gabrielmuriens,,-6,2025-07-28 19:08:00,,,,A switch cant just decide to not turn on A switch cant understand a spoken request phrased a thousand different ways either,n5nlxbl,3.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5pr0uo,mxzf,,10,2025-07-29 01:16:29,,,,But how many ways do you realistically need to phrase turn the light on The marginal benefits of more phrasing flexibility are dwarfed by the huge losses in basic functionality when it doesnt work in situations where a lessoverengineered setup would,n5nrzci,4.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5qazb2,gabrielmuriens,,-3,2025-07-29 03:16:41,,,,the huge losses in basic functionality when it doesnt work in situations where a lessoverengineered setup would It sucks when it doesnt work sure But this absolutely is the future not only of home assistants but life assistants And in 10 years or sooner these assistants will be smarter than most real life assistants That is one element of the future that I am looking forward to,n5pr0uo,5.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5qkesm,mxzf,,4,2025-07-29 04:22:39,,,,And in 10 years or sooner these assistants will be smarter than most real life assistants Nah not unless theres a fundamental paradigm shift in AIs LLMs fundamentally arent capable of filling that sort of role Until they have some way to actually weight for correctness rather than just humansounding text outputs you cant really hand off tasks to an LLM like you could a human,n5qazb2,6.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5sbjto,gabrielmuriens,,1,2025-07-29 13:04:28,,,,Until they have some way to actually weight for correctness Do humans have that No they dont Seriously its funny how out of the loop most people here are and how severe their internalized human exceptionalism is,n5qkesm,7.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5shuqr,mxzf,,0,2025-07-29 13:39:10,,,,Sure humans do We are absolutely capable of recognizing when facts are correct and acting accordingly Humans dont always tell the truth and they dont always have all the information to know what is or isnt correct but we are absolutely capable of recognizing what is and isnt factual or correct and responding accordingly If I say to you the sky is red you have the capacity to take that information compare it against your knowledge atmospheric conditions and determine that the most likely situation is that Im either lying or that its near sunrise or sunset From that information you can also potentially estimate where on the world I live An LLM on the other hand can only look at its training model and see what a probabilistic output to that input would be based on the body of training text it has been fed It has no way of recognizing what is or isnt truth and it doesnt care it just knows what likely textual responses to the sky is red might be and it spits out what it calculates is a standard response Humans absolutely have a capacity to recognize and act on correct and factual information in a way that a language model can never replicate because correct factual information is orthogonal to the language its not fundamentally connected to the linguistic representation of that information at all and LLMs are language models their chances of being correct are just a reflection of the correctness of their training body,n5sbjto,8.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5sk6um,gabrielmuriens,,1,2025-07-29 13:51:17,,,,Sure humans do We are absolutely capable of recognizing when facts are correct and acting accordingly Humans dont always tell the truth and they dont always have all the information to know what is or isnt correct but we are absolutely capable of recognizing what is and isnt factual or correct and responding accordingly You say that as if every day there werent countless and uncountable examples of people failing to recognize facts and act accordingly Many people are so god damned fucking stupid that you could lobotomize them and it might improve their functioning They believe the dumbest fucking shit and behave in all kinds of insane and irrational ways For fucks sake the current sitting president of the United States of America is so pitifully stupid that any random LLM would outperform him in every measurable way in his job From that information you can also potentially estimate where on the world I live An LLM on the other hand can only look at its training model and see what a probabilistic output to that input would be based on the body of training text it has been fed And just how in the fuck do you think those two things are different because correct factual information is orthogonal to the language its not fundamentally connected to the linguistic representation of that information at all and LLMs are language models their chances of being correct are just a reflection of the correctness of their training body Woo hoo somebodys using big boy words that they dont know the meaning of None of what you said is the slightest bit right in relation to LLMs or to language and our internal representation of the world This dumb ass mythologising of our own cognitive abilities which lacks any basis in either neuroscience or epistemology is nothing more than what the poorer versions of ChatGPT do you are spinning a rationale to justify your own preconcieved and biased notions Thank you for the demonstration tho Dont talk shit when you dont know shit,n5shuqr,9.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5smcpy,mxzf,,0,2025-07-29 14:02:17,,,,I mean the fact that humans dont always recognize and act on facts like one might hope doesnt mean that humans are physiologically incapable of it LLMs are fundamentally incapable of recognizing what is or isnt correct information because thats not what theyre designed to do theyre designed to be language models that take in naturallanguage prompts and generate naturallanguage responses factually correct information doesnt factor into it at all Theres a difference between not acting on truth logically vs being incapable of recognizing it at all The rest of your post is just namecalling with zero logic or weight to back up your opinion simply claiming that humans arent special and therefore LLMs are actually intelligent or some shit like that which can be safely ignored as nonsense,n5sk6um,10.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5t0di2,gabrielmuriens,,1,2025-07-29 15:10:04,,,,LLMs are fundamentally incapable of recognizing what is or isnt correct information because thats not what theyre designed to do theyre designed to be language models that take in naturallanguage prompts and generate naturallanguage responses factually correct information doesnt factor into it at all That is right only if you ignore or rather are unaware of the fact that LLMs do develop a distributed emergent representation of patterns relationships and knowledge in their weights and parameters as they increase in size These encode not only semantic but relational and logical associations They do in fact encode increasingly complex and often very accurate representations of the world based on the data they are trained on Thus the basis of your argument is invalid,n5smcpy,11.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5uvrl3,mxzf,,0,2025-07-29 20:22:45,,,,The problem is that they dont actually develop any knowledge at all theyre storing the way that words relate to each other not semantic meanings behind the words or the context of information The nature of a language model is to model language not to model truth or factual information or anything like that,n5t0di2,12.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5pix8z,MinusBear,,1,2025-07-29 00:30:01,,,,Ive had situations like this too where Ive asked it to remember something and then for a while it works For example when I tell you to turn on all the lights dont turn on the fans as well That worked for a month or so Then one day it was back to not working I asked it why it forgot and it said it doesnt have the ability to remember things like I requested Then I asked it why it worked last time after a lot of back and forth the answer seemed to be coincidence But I cant say for certain because it has difficulty explaining operational facts without lying,n5owqto,2.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5qtqrb,nagi603,,4,2025-07-29 05:37:24,,,,pumping out abandonware Its literally how you get a promotion there launch something move on to something else You wont be rewarded for keeping the lights on and have insane hurdles for improving an already launched service so the easiest is to just abandon it at the gate,n5mwbq7,1.0,1mbk6yi
comment,n5obtkf,jellybon,,1,2025-07-28 20:42:08,,,,This start to make sense if you think about how each new product they release either adds new users into Googles ecosystem or helps refine the data about current users Smart home devices for example give Google more detailed information about your living situation and daily routines,n5mwbq7,1.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5my8eg,ElectronRotoscope,,13,2025-07-28 16:50:18,,,,I mean I see where youre coming from but lots of profitdriven companies see the long term reputation benefits as being more worthwhile than the costs of maintaining old platforms All other things being equal AWS has a reputation of continuing to function without being touched for years where Google Cloud Services famously will sunset stuff way more often Almost any program that ran on Windows 7 in 2009 will run that version just fine on the latest Win11 Id be hard pressed to find anything that ran on Snow Leopard that you can even open on macOS Sequoia Theyre all corporations and ultimately if you want real long term sustainability you need open source but some are far more stable than others,n5mr6zo,1.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5muep7,angrydeuce,,-4,2025-07-28 16:32:15,,,,Problem is all the solutions that allow for configuration outside of a locked ecosystem cost a goddamn fortune Theyve finally managed to carrier lock home automation software so just like cell phones youll end up with a bunch of ewaste for no other reason then it wasnt profitable enough for the vendor to support long term and they provided zero avenues to transition to another platform without replacing all the hardware Edit my point wasnt that there arent free solutions my point is that the hardware that uses the free solutions are often priced up according to the fact that there isnt an ecosystem lock in with which data scraping can be leveraged to offset the hardware price But keep downvoting lmao,n5mr6zo,1.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5rnxk7,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2025-07-29 10:20:53,,,,Thats a nonsensical reply The comment was about attaching your house to a corporation ie about making the functioning of your home dependent on the continued cooperation and reliable operation of a specific corporation When I put in a physical light switch I buy that light switch from a corporation But that doesnt make me in any way dependent on that corporation That corporation can not make any decision that makes my light switch change its behavior or that makes it stop functioning The corporation can go under and I can still use the light switch for decades without any change in functionality For that matter I have no idea what the corporation that made the light switches in my house is up to or if they even still exist Thats how nonattached my house is to that corporation And if a light switch ever were to fail it still doesnt matter There are plenty of corporations that produce light switches and I could just buy one from any one of them to replace the broken one I wouldnt have to replace all light switches I wouldnt have to replace cables I wouldnt have to replace lamps just a new switch from whatever corporation Thats how nonattached my house is to that corporation And basically the same thing is true for localonly smart home stuff with open protocols and projects like home assistant If the organisation behind HA were to go under you could still at the very least keep using your existing setup And if the hardware of your HA installation failed for some reason you could buy just about any small computer as replacement from just about any manufacturer and restore a backup on there and still keep using it And also with HA being Free Software you can even still extend and improve the software if the organization were to go under or decided to abandon the project And if there were sufficiently many interested parties they also could just found a new organization to take over development Which is to say The organization behind HA does not have the power to unilaterally decide to end the project at most they can stop contributing Which is to say You are not dependent on that corporation in a way even remotely comparable to how if Google decides to change their product in a way that makes it dysfunctional for you but improves their profits you can only live with it or throw it all out which in turn makes them do these things in the first place because they know you have no other options,n5qu1ey,2.0,1mbk6yi

comment,n5qne5g,rapaciousdrinker,,1,2025-07-29 04:45:22,,,,Its the reason apps like PixelIMS exist Google hard disables those features in most countries and you need hacks just to enable them The reason given for this on the Google support forums is that it costs a few pennies to certify their phones with carriers Budget Android phones from China will work just fine but google doesnt see that as a reasonable expense So they just disable the features whether they would otherwise work or not,n5ql4kv,2.0,1mbk6yi
