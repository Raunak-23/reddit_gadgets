comment,m9lw3qe,danielv123,,4,2025-01-28 08:49:23,,,,Id argue no They are getting crushed by Nvidia on GPUs and their cpu business is very important Intel launched xe2 on lunar lake months before they announced the desktop cards It wouldnt be that surprising to see something similar from amd,m9kxn1j,1.0,1ibsvuo
comment,m9mrs1q,UnsorryCanadian,,1,2025-01-28 13:28:16,,,,I think AMD is focusing on the low end market rather than the high end market sure I hear a lot of peoplr talk about their 4090 but Ive never seen anybody mention owning a 4060 but I hear people mention owning a 7600xt,m9lw3qe,2.0,1ibsvuo
comment,m9nq6ft,GrayDaysGoAway,,8,2025-01-28 16:28:06,,,,Just because you havent seen people talking about it doesnt mean they arent popular The 4060 is the 3 most used GPU in the most recent steam hardware survey 1 2 are the 3060 and 4060 laptop version respectively Meanwhile the first discrete AMD GPU doesnt show up on the list until 30 with the RX 6600 To put that into perspective the 4090 has a higher userbase at 27 Dont let reddits hard on for AMD fool you When it comes to GPUs theyre nowhere near competing even at the low end and havent been for years now,m9mrs1q,3.0,1ibsvuo
comment,m9ns63s,UnsorryCanadian,,0,2025-01-28 16:37:25,,,,Maybe in popularity but when it comes to budget cards its easier to get your hands on AMD A quick look at ebay shows a used 3050 costs more than a new 7600xt and thats a bit silly Cheap cards will never become more popular than the powerful cards thats true but if you need a card AMD is slightly better value from what Ive seen This is anecdotal evidence yes,m9nq6ft,4.0,1ibsvuo
comment,m9nxb78,GrayDaysGoAway,,4,2025-01-28 17:01:07,,,,Were not talking about value or easy availability here though This is about whose cards get bought and used more And thats Nvidia by a mile no matter which tier of cards youre looking at,m9ns63s,5.0,1ibsvuo
comment,m9o8z08,AllAboutTheKitteh,,3,2025-01-28 17:55:44,,,,Cheap cards absolutely become more popular than powerful cards When the 1060 launched it soon had like 16 user base Further its easier to get an AMD card because the demand is lower,m9ns63s,5.0,1ibsvuo
comment,ma7l3s4,Thelongdong11,,1,2025-01-31 15:42:37,,,,Nobody is paying for a 7600xt tho Id rather have a weaker Nvidia card than a better AMD card just for drivers and dlss alone,m9ns63s,5.0,1ibsvuo
