comment,lxfpo34,thisischemistry,,5,2024-11-16 14:30:08,,,,US iPhone sales data for the March quarter that was shared by Consumer Research Intelligence Partners CIRP As I said Apple doesnt break it down by model This is a guess by an outside agency edit And if Im reading that correctly the mini outsold the SE So why are they keeping the SE instead of the mini Just combine the two into a single lowcost and small formfactor device The combined sales will keep it a viable product,lxfey0s,6.0,1gs2d3e
comment,lxgop8n,rsplatpc,,0,2024-11-16 17:47:25,,,,So why are they keeping the SE instead of the mini They are changing it into a full size cheaper phone because those sell better to the AVERAGE CONSUMER vs smaller phones and they sell better by a WAY larger margin than the Reddit tech bubble probably believes I have a Mini 12 and 13 and would pay whatever for a updated one also but sales are sales,lxfpo34,7.0,1gs2d3e
comment,lxeybo7,Shawnj2,,2,2024-11-16 10:49:35,,,,You have to pay the engineering cost for 2 phones to do that I think at some point in the future well see the standard and pro iPhone alternate years though when consumer demand drops enough,lxbirf5,3.0,1gs2d3e
comment,lxgjmsv,thisischemistry,,1,2024-11-16 17:20:33,,,,Just combine them into a single phone Theyre already getting rid of TouchID on the next SE make it a mini formfactor which is lowcost and be done with it They could have a mini normal and max option and simplify their lineup,lxeybo7,4.0,1gs2d3e

comment,lxgszhy,52Hurtz,,3,2024-11-16 18:10:08,,,,Having switched to a Unihertz Jelly Star for about a year now this is probably the smallest a phone can be and still be useful with touch controls Swipe text is a must But every time a new colleague sees me pull this thing out let me tell you it turns into an excitable conversation I think theres definitely an allure to a smartphone with diminished power to draw your attention which is why I tried it out in the first place after seeing daily app usage times on my Pixel I think the early Xperia Z Compact phones were my fave form factor with little screens as well,lxdeaga,2.0,1gs2d3e
comment,lxcvriy,saposapot,,11,2024-11-16 00:34:38,,,,Please this I dont even care about a decent 500 iPhone I just want an updated mini I can upgrade to I know sales of the mini were low but Apple has a lot of things with lower sales I dont think adding a mini would be a major cost for them If they dont want to keep a mini at least keep the SE as mini size,lxayntk,1.0,1gs2d3e
comment,lxdjtil,thisischemistry,,3,2024-11-16 03:10:44,,,,The mini and the SE had significant overlap in demographics Both were small both were lower cost They most likely cannibalized each others sales The SE had the advantage of being the last TouchID phone so it probably sold more and thats why they kept it They really should just combine the devices into the mini form factor and make it the smallest and least expensive iPhone,lxcvriy,2.0,1gs2d3e

comment,lxbonwn,GenghisConnieChung,,1,2024-11-15 20:34:48,,,,Apple may drop it from support in that shorter timeframe but most apps will continue to work for at least a couple of years after it stops getting iOS updates My wife was using my old iPhone 7 until this fall when iOS 18 was released and developers of apps she uses started dropping support for the old OS It tops out at iOS 15 so she got another 3 years of use out of it after it stopped getting updates,lxbf0mi,2.0,1gs2d3e
