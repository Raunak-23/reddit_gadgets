comment,mgyywbx,gatoAlfa,,1174,2025-03-10 04:09:37,,,,It is more like undocumented API calls Nothing can be triggered over the air The directly connected MCU has undocumented API to readwrite memory change the MAC address and others but only from the wired side Looks more like and advertising from the research company it is clearly not a back door,,0.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgz5o85,Small_Editor_3693,,218,2025-03-10 05:03:52,,,,Its also important to note that these methods have been used to find hard coded passwords in things like routers to hack huge swaths of devices all at once But thats not what this is doing It might be a precursor to future research,mgyywbx,1.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mh0a0f7,ElkSad9855,,21,2025-03-10 11:47:54,,,,So what youre saying is flashing the ESP32 for BLE just got BETTER Since we have more API functionality Was it just for the BLE API or does it include their ESPNOW API,mgyywbx,1.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mgzs3d8,FLu_Shots,,8,2025-03-10 08:55:03,,,,I saw this and when I heard it was between the host and controller even with my VERY limited knowledge knew this sounded like no impact But I am just very curious if the research company presented it as a vulnerability in ESP32s or was just showing they can do these sorts of research which would have explained the advertising,mgyywbx,1.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mh03qci,Fantasy_masterMC,,10,2025-03-10 10:53:23,,,,It might be due to some thief that tried to unscrew your window or it might be that the guy that assembled the window didnt screw it in in the first place or it might just be as loose screw your cleaning crew found on the floor and put on the windowsill then forgot about,mgzzfrx,3.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mgyxt28,UnusualSoup,,1,2025-03-10 04:01:43,,,,The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains undocumented commands that could be leveraged for attacks The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices unauthorized data access pivoting to other devices on the network and potentially establishing longterm persistence This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security who presented their findings yesterday at RootedCON in Madrid This is the takeaway,mgyxl69,1.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mh2t70d,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2025-03-10 19:46:06,,,,The documented commands can be leveraged for attacks too The ESP32 doesnt do anything on its own it needs to be programmed to do things you can write all sorts of bullshit code using documented commands to wreck havoc with,mgyxt28,2.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgz1uhi,SpikeX,,65,2025-03-10 04:32:12,,,,ESP32 chips are not Bluetooth chips You can have an ESP32 board without using Bluetooth Title is inaccurate Edit Corrected for accuracy ESP32 has BT but is not a requirement to use or its only function,,0.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzm0jd,designateddesignator,,17,2025-03-10 07:47:29,,,,they ALL do actually have a bluetoothwifi radio on the SoC the chip with the cpu cores the only thing that is optional is the antenna for it there is a reduced version without wifi but that still has bluetooth capable radios You can use the microcontroller with radios shut down for power consumption,mgz1uhi,1.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzqh97,DaveVdE,,-2,2025-03-10 08:36:56,,,,Are you sure about that A quick search reveals that the ESP32S2 does not support BT,mgzm0jd,2.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzr9wi,designateddesignator,,19,2025-03-10 08:45:54,,,,thats true that SoC Not dev board variant only supports wifi thats an ESP32S2 though not an ESP32 The user i replied to stated ESP32 BOARDS could drop the bluetooth implication of which was that bluetooth chip was somehow separated and only on some dev boards and optional Your suggesting something called an ESP32S2 has no bluetooth but while they share part of the same name the the ESP32 and ESP32S3 are different SoCs made from a different design,mgzqh97,3.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mh2us7l,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2025-03-10 19:53:47,,,,ESP32 is a series of lowcost lowpower systemonchip microcontrollers with integrated WiFi and dualmode Bluetooth Yours is a cool story too though The team used an ESPWROOM32 lol its quite hard to find a raw ESP32 on its own to buy nowadays,mgzr9wi,4.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mgzmcl5,designateddesignator,,3,2025-03-10 07:51:12,,,,some products do actually use it as a bluetooth chip given its good bluetooth performance and freetos controller at least during rd other low end microcontrollers can interface with it to provide data or streams to expose prevent a product needing a whole linux busybox implementation and the power consumption issues with that while having solid responsive connectivity,mgz1uhi,1.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzoeix,AwGe3zeRick,,1,2025-03-10 08:13:51,,,,Almost all products that utilize it for IoT use its Bluetooth Even if its just for the initial wireless password handoff The alternative is the old approach people used with the likes of the 8266 which required you to join the devices broadcasted AP giving the info and disconnecting which is a horribly outdated user experience,mgzmcl5,2.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzphax,designateddesignator,,3,2025-03-10 08:25:48,,,,Almost all products that utilise it for radio based technology use its radio technology Well yes they would wouldnt they There are plenty of uses for the esp32 that dont need networking stack those are more likely where the esp is the only microcontroller involved esps are great wherever you need a decent and low power capable chip without a whole linux implementation supported There are other chips beside the esp32 and esp8266 just they arent as hobbyist catering,mgzoeix,3.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzpmzq,AwGe3zeRick,,0,2025-03-10 08:27:33,,,,Uh you would never use a ESP32 unless you needed the Bluetooth or WiFi You wouldnt pay extra for features you wont be using There are other chips that are just as capable but cheaper without those things,mgzphax,4.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzpz2t,designateddesignator,,5,2025-03-10 08:31:18,,,,yeah you would been at a factory rd firm for many years created drivers for virtually every off the shelf sensor to interface with esp32 plenty of times data is being logged inside faraday cages or just driving button activated lighting centralising on a single platform means one set of tooling one set of requirements on set of cheap mass produced microcontrollers to stock to solve thousands of diffferent issues whats the better alternative something that needs me to train my people on an whole new stack,mgzpmzq,5.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzo31z,AwGe3zeRick,,1,2025-03-10 08:10:18,,,,Um what ESP32 can you buy that doesnt have Bluetooth Whatre you talking about Bluetooth capability is literally one of the crucial things that separates the 32 from its predecessor the 8266 Granted I havent done IoT in a few years but all the ESP32 variants have Bluetooth and WiFi built in,mgz1uhi,1.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mgzql8m,DaveVdE,,1,2025-03-10 08:38:09,,,,The ESP32S2 does not support BT as far as I can tell,mgzo31z,2.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mgzuhfu,077u-5jP6ZO1,,10,2025-03-10 09:20:52,,,,Excellent explanation why this is not a backdoor in the common sense TLDR vendor specific commands are available in most Bluetooth hardware some features can have security problems,,0.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mh26qcr,WestonP,,8,2025-03-10 18:00:10,,,,Garbage post This has been shot full of holes by many people already It is very ordinary to have undocumented commands for things not useful to the enduser and they require having the ability to flash your own firmware to access at which point you already have full control to do whatever you want anyway These are not a backdoor and its ignorant to push that narrative Your phone also has a bunch of private APIs in it too are you going to freak the fuck out over that Really annoying to see all the ignorant hysteria about this,,0.0,1j7q2z8

comment,mh0in0z,Blommefeldt,,10,2025-03-10 12:50:38,,,,Why do you share info you dont understand You might as well spread lies I believe what you did is called fearmongering Having autism myself I understand how it feels to really want to help and share knowledge Enough for my manager to tell me to restrict myself You should be more careful of what you share Before you say or share something think about this if someone can question you and you dont have answers for it reevaluate how much you should share I have to do it myself sometimes Its a good thing to do as its a part of critical thinking,mgzkl5s,2.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mh0m6i6,UnusualSoup,,3,2025-03-10 13:13:40,,,,I shared an article because it had facts in it The article had these facts The ubiquitous ESP32 microchip made by Chinese manufacturer Espressif and used by over 1 billion units as of 2023 contains undocumented commands that could be leveraged for attacks The undocumented commands allow spoofing of trusted devices unauthorized data access pivoting to other devices on the network and potentially establishing longterm persistence This was discovered by Spanish researchers Miguel Tarascó Acuña and Antonio Vázquez Blanco of Tarlogic Security who presented their findings yesterday at RootedCON in Madrid That is not misinformation those are facts In my hopes of sharing it I wished to see the discussion about it My post was successful in that But to say I fully grasp the threat level that would be different I did not share this to spread fear I also dont think the article spreads fear I found it quite informative The title was pretty direct the comment section in the article was also interesting I do truly believe its okay to share something and engage inread the resulting discussion I am sorry if you think differently I at no point put my own opinion on it But it would be a factually incorrect to say I truly understood everything being conveyed in the information Honestly I am glad I shared it as the comments have been enlightening,mh0in0z,3.0,1j7q2z8
comment,mhgjhk4,Blommefeldt,,1,2025-03-12 21:43:53,,,,I think I comment may have sounded a bit on the mad side Sorry about that I dont believe you did anything out of malicious intent It was meant as a casual Think about how you share information as others often can interpreter things differently than yourself I have been in that annoying situation more times than I will admit I just did some watching and reading on it From my understanding of it would be equal to bypass the key on an old car If you have physical access to the device then its not secure no matter what Espressif the maker of esp32 also states that you need to flash a compromised firmware on your esp32 but that would would be hard since most peoplecompanies use community made software or they make it them self,mh0m6i6,4.0,1j7q2z8
