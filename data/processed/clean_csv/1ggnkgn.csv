comment,lvf28d4,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-04 21:39:51,,,,Anything where smooth rotational input makes sense Eg theres one game where a ball is rolling on top of a rod The rod has solid discs along its length each disk has gaps where the ball can pass through You have to rotate the crank to rotate the rod So the disks rotate to align with the ball so the ball can pass through to the end,lve1t15,5.0,1ggnkgn

comment,luvdmk4,ill_thrift,,6,2024-11-01 15:32:44,,,,this is the biggest thing that has prevented me from getting one My eyes are already bad enough probably honestly no thanks to spending so much time squinting at an unlit gameboy screen as a kid and ultimately Im not looking for a device that gives me eyestrain or where Im constrained by external light I know that businesswise its probably important for the playdate games to remain exclusive to the playdate ecosystem to drive sales of the device but I still sort of wish that it made financial sense for there to be a licensing scheme or something that meant devs could release on other platforms as well these games would be so so nice on little emulation handhelds with backlit screens Ive been playing UFO50 on one and its been so fun Im also following news about the inprogress frontlight mod with a lot of interest,lut7gjp,1.0,1ggnkgn

comment,lzit06t,Beastw1ck,,1,2024-11-29 05:57:08,,,,It is absolutely for the love of niche indie games Theres a great podcast where they talk to the developers of all their season one games so you get to learn about their design choices and process Theres a free SDK Theres a webbrowser based game making toolkit for people who cant code As a result theres something like 1000 games on itch for this thing now Its not everyones cup of tea but as a sort of gigantic group project its awesome,luscu93,1.0,1ggnkgn

comment,lutdtyb,guyblade,,5,2024-11-01 05:29:03,,,,I dislike it when people use the word objectively to judge something that is inherently subjective When I bought a PS Vita over a decade ago I bought it to play _Persona 4 Golden_ After Id completed it I told someone that I thought that one game was sufficient rationale for owning a Vitabecause it was to me I played other games on the console and it is still my travelling console most of the time but if the only game that had ever come out for the console was _P4G_ Id still argue the console was worth owning But I freely admit that thats a subjective opinion not a statement of cold fact Nearly all measures of value are subjectiveespecially when it comes to entertainment,lusy0o8,3.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutepzm,None,,2,2024-11-01 05:38:27,,,,I dislike it when people use the word objectively to judge something that is inherently subjective I grant you that I use the word objectively carelessly to emphasize my point Having said that I think that you if we were to turn value into an objective matter by all objective metrics in which we judge game consoles the Playdate would be last If we were to include nostalgia how they make us feel how we value money and other more subjective matters then Im sure then it doesnt matter that one game was sufficient rationale for owning a Vita I literally said the same thing about the 3ds and Fire Emblem awakening So I get you Back then there werent many handhelds consoles So it was easier to justify the value in objective metrics If I were to judge the 3DS now against phones retro handheld consoles Im confident in saying its objectively a horrible value Even if I would still want one 3DS with Fire Emblem on it Especially not now that the market is flooded with Retro consoles,lutdtyb,4.0,1ggnkgn

comment,luul4bk,sethsez,,1,2024-11-01 12:51:12,,,,I dont even think you believe that the Playdate is better than ANY of the 40 dollar ones let alone the 200 dollars People buy the Playdate for the platform not the specs Im a big fan of the Chinese emulation handheld market but theres dozens of different devices than play PS1 and below with a 640x480 screen and only one device that plays the games offered on the Playdate Are those games worth it Thats entirely subjective though I think its fair to say theres obviously a premium involved compared to other platforms due to the small size of the company and the level of game dev talent its trying to attract But its not playing in the same space as everyone trying to sell another way to play Chrono Trigger,lusy0o8,3.0,1ggnkgn
comment,luuoxqx,None,,0,2024-11-01 13:15:32,,,,theres dozens of different devices than play PS1 and below with a 640x480 screen And useful screens at that not screens that you cant use in low light And for 150 bucks you get a 720p screen and PS2 game support and Android games Are those games worth it Thats entirely subjective though Not completely The sales numbers arent subjective The budget of those games arent subjective The complexity of those games arent subjective The media coverage of those games arent subjective To pretend the exclusivity is some sort of subjective playing field is being a liar Besides even among the lovers of the console The reviews show clearly its NOT about the games and the level of game dev talent its trying to attract Well thats 0 But its not playing in the same space as everyone trying to sell another way to play Chrono Trigger If you mean its not playing in the handheld console game then I agree Its so bad it doesnt compete It does a lot of great things is a beautiful device that brings nostalgia to people and they love Like its handeld design turned into art Again I dont have a playdate but I have bought things equally stupid The market the end goal is the equivalent of selling you the boutique experience of a new retro handheld The device its trash but its pretty nostalgic a work of art etc,luul4bk,4.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lut98gn,Accide,,1,2024-11-01 04:44:07,,,,which is objectively horrible Seems like it isnt objectively horrible if they have another season of games planned to come out for it Enough people seem to want to buy what is clearly more of a bespoke product rather than something meant to be a household name,lusy0o8,3.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutbry3,None,,3,2024-11-01 05:08:11,,,,Thats a fair point My mistake I didnt clarify what I meant by value Theres value to it And I didnt show the facts of my point across By value I meant as a gaming console The value isnt because of its features as a gaming console nor the mediocrity of its games Not even one bit For example I could say that the 30000 dollar Birkin bag is objectively horrible as a bag That doesnt mean it doesnt have value It just isnt the bag part As a bag its heavy fragile and not very pratical Its the luxury item part that brings value The Playdate its the same Its factually horrible as a console and in the games However is a luxury gadget thats freaking cool it brings up joy in its user through its quirky aesthetics and the nostalgia behind it THAT may be worth 200 dollars to people,lut98gn,4.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutc76f,Accide,,2,2024-11-01 05:12:22,,,,I suppose but that initial commentor mentioned they got their moneys worth so I feel like the point is a little moot talking about the handheld market being oversaturated and being objectively worse than other consoles at that price point Since theyre in that camp of people who like it as the luxury gadget Its also entirely possible that I might have missed some context between what you initially had and the edit to your comment so I could be a little off lol I get what youre saying though Quick edit I dont think that their comparison is apples and oranges they can very easily have an EntertainmentFun budget for seeing movies going out to eat gaming purchases etc,lutbry3,5.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutdxvs,None,,2,2024-11-01 05:30:13,,,,I suppose but that initial commentor mentioned they got their moneys worth so I feel like the point is a little moot talking about the handheld market being oversaturated and being objectively worse than other consoles at that price point You are correct that Im arguing for arguing sake I made a mistake and took it too seriously The guy made a value assesment regarding movie and tickets and I blew it out of proportion Quick edit I dont think that their comparison is apples and oranges they can very easily have an EntertainmentFun budget for seeing movies going out to eat gaming purchases etc Its rhetoric to justify purchases I dislike that type of rhetoric because its useless in analyzing a product AND because its dishonest for taking things OUT of context Think of it the oppsite way I could say for that money you could get a Disneyland ticket for you and someone you love and live an experience that would last you a lifetime How freaking relevant is that If I told you the things you could do Or even exactly what he said 200 dollars is a lot For that money I would take my partner for a romantic dinner followed by a movie buy them flowers and have finally a proper date after a while and build memories with my partner that would last a lifetime Or I could say the Miyoo mini plus which has better games better hardware a better screen better buttons all for 50 dollars Now thats relevant,lutc76f,6.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutefwv,Accide,,2,2024-11-01 05:35:31,,,,Yeah I got you Rereading it I didnt add anything of value honestly the person already said they knew their opinion was a personal thing and wouldnt fight you on it haha So again totally get what youre saying but I feel more in line with what the initial commentor thought They gave their two cents and maybe its only relevantusefuletc for anyone else who might compare apples to oranges because theyre both fruit rather than the exact same fruit,lutdxvs,7.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutf7x8,None,,2,2024-11-01 05:43:49,,,,Rereading it I didnt add anything of value honestly Nah You did to me People think of this platform in a matter of upvotes and posting things that are valuable to anyone For me this platform is about personal 1 on 1 conversations that anyone can listen to And on that I appreciate you taking your time speaking to me So again totally get what youre saying but I feel more in line with what the initial commentor thought Yeah I was out of line its fair This was not the place for this conversation,lutefwv,8.0,1ggnkgn
comment,lutg05k,Accide,,1,2024-11-01 05:52:27,,,,All good Im glad Honestly feel the same way I hardly ever have this consistently pleasant of an interactioncomment chain at all Glad we had the conversation because its one of those things where I probably wouldnt have thought much about it since I feel so much closer to that first comment Admittedly I was arguing for arguings sake as well I dont have a horse in this race at all other than seeing when Playdate launched and going Oh cool haha,lutf7x8,9.0,1ggnkgn

comment,lut5qyn,JukePlz,,2,2024-11-01 04:13:06,,,,But this is not the sports car of gaming devices its completely underpowered for a product in the premium price range of modern handhelds it competes with basically all Chinese SBCs,lusjxgb,2.0,1ggnkgn
comment,luticnu,Shawnj2,,3,2024-11-01 06:19:31,,,,Its a kitschy toy with a unique control scheme and a unique screen for people who appreciate the screen and the gimmick For price to performance you could grab a Switch Lite for like 180 and it would utterly destroy it on value completely but thats irrelevant for the target audience Its much closer to like a concept of a game console or a preproduction device than a real one and the price reflects this It was never going to sell very well but the specific people who wanted something like this will write rave reviews and treasure these because this type of thing doesnt come out very often on account of how they go against any rational sense for a normal person to buy on value A better comparison is like saying a Miata is worse than a Model 3 because a Miata is slower has worse interior materials has worse technology costs more in gas and has less space than a Model 3 going by used prices I think theyre pretty comparable in price right now The people who buy Miatas dont care about any of those things because the Miata is a very targeted product for a specific audience and the lack of practicality of one is irrelevant to their decision to get one,lut5qyn,3.0,1ggnkgn
