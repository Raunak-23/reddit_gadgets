comment,n6miiv8,lurkinglurkerwholurk,,0,2025-08-03 01:49:21,,,,Its simple and its the same reason you touched on with the commercial drone bit of your comment Due to the same security logistics geopolitics etc nobody wants to buy China drones Of course they will be out produced Nobodys buying esp the people in an active war zone so why would you word it in such a way that China loses because they dont make stockpiles on stockpiles of that stuff,n6igki1,8.0,1mf6zqi

comment,n6flqob,SpaceCadet404,,19,2025-08-01 22:41:53,,,,Honestly theres a market for this service Get an ebike that folds up into a stable shape so it can deliver itself to a location like those food delivery robots do then the recipient unfolds it into a bike gets themselves where theyre going and fold it back into self transport mode and off it goes to the next person who orders a bike,n6f3eg7,1.0,1mf6zqi
comment,n6fx6dc,im_a_secret0,,6,2025-08-01 23:47:11,,,,Why not just have the drone carry you at that point just 3 feet off the ground or something it follows streets at 15mph and drops you literally at the door,n6f3eg7,1.0,1mf6zqi
comment,n6gbo68,colrouge,,8,2025-08-02 01:15:15,,,,Unfortunately physics is against you on this one It take far far less power to push a mass with wheels on the ground than elevate it and fly it at even a low altitude Cool idea though Maybe theres a version where the drone transforms into an ebike Like the same batteries and possibly putting all rotor motors in series to power the bike That probably would only work with a road bike and carbon fiber frame I feel like even an aluminum frame would be too heavy to make the drone not work,n6fx6dc,2.0,1mf6zqi

comment,n6gxe2i,simplysufficient88,,7,2025-08-02 03:35:55,,,,Most antipersonnel mines arent actually designed to kill theyre designed to maim You take a foot off and force the rest of the soldiers to carry a wounded man back to camp You take two men out by hitting only one Plus them being small means you can scatter thousands through mortars drones rockets etc The mine probably fucked the bike up thus needing a second bike dropped but hed probably be mostly unharmed Unless it was a proper antivehicle mine the majority of the damage should have gone into the bike,n6fqdbl,2.0,1mf6zqi
comment,n6ii5a5,kerbaal,,2,2025-08-02 12:01:11,,,,The mine probably fucked the bike up thus needing a second bike dropped but hed probably be mostly unharmed probably be mostly unharmed by the mine itself Getting tossed from a bike at speed can cause some pretty serious injuries Had a friend run into an object on the ground in the dark on a bike path dude was fucked up and ended up in the hospital,n6gxe2i,3.0,1mf6zqi
comment,n6johqc,uss_salmon,,1,2025-08-02 16:08:56,,,,Some mines also blow out significantly more to the side than straight up so depending on the direction being on the bike could have simply put him out of the main path of shrapnel,n6gxe2i,3.0,1mf6zqi

comment,n6h8sro,FTC_Publik,,10,2025-08-02 05:02:50,,,,In some cases Im sure well see drone medivac Here though The drones they had could carry about 40kg and would get shot down during the day They say they tried to send a bike several times but the drone broke apart or the motors burnt out The successful bikes had to be disassembled for most of the trip and have other trenches assemble it for the last hop which they had to do twice to get him out,n6gp1hf,2.0,1mf6zqi

comment,n6gu18w,the_ruffled_feather,,11,2025-08-02 03:12:28,,,,The innovation and creativity Ukraine plans and executes is nothing if not historic That we US didnt fully enable Ukraine knowing the track record of Russia and knowing their active hybrid warfare is foolish beyond description Makes any US explanation for dedicating resources to the military seem hypocritical We could be being trained by todays most experienced military and once Russia is staved off Ukraine could relieve much US presence in Europe An achievable scenario that would save the US billions every year and hamstrings a global opponent bent on our downfall That a US president would hamstring Ukraine and enable Russia is unfuckingreal Unbelievable However Ukraine has proven themselves second to none in having pure grit and resolution I recently heard that Ukrainian engineers are able to 3D print drone chassis Six 1k printers can churn out a unit every 8 hours Once finetuned the manufacturing will likely be added to nearfrontline operations,,0.0,1mf6zqi
comment,n6n6pkc,randynumbergenerator,,1,2025-08-03 04:37:39,,,,The US did prepare Ukraine but dramatically overestimated Russian competence and thought it would be more of a guerilla campaign So they had a decent stock of NLAWs Javelins and Stingers appropriate for infantry to hit armor or aircraft but not the stock of artillery etc needed for a more conventional sustained ground campaign Never mind warfare based on cheap drone platforms that basically didnt exist at this scale or level of sophistication before this conflict Could the US have done more Yes Europe as well There was also way too much concern about red lines that were never real But hindsight is 2020 and governments and militaries are always reasoning from incomplete info and trying to balance a range of sometimes mutually conflicting priorities,n6gu18w,1.0,1mf6zqi
