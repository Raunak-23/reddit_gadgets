comment,lvh7xmb,CosmicCreeperz,,14,2024-11-05 05:17:56,,,,They arent that much more RAM efficient these days They are just x86 PCs with shared memory which does help a bit Really they require games to be coded a bit differently so they load more textures from the high speed SSDs But it means they wont approach the performance of a decent discrete GPU Speaking of that I just looked it up and its not an extra 2GB of system RAM Its separate DDR5 RAM which is weird My guess is they just increased the SSD cache from 512MB to 2GB,lvf5iwh,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvha36s,Fredasa,,6,2024-11-05 05:35:27,,,,They are just x86 PCs with shared memory which does help a bit Sony learned that hard lesson with the PS3 when a bunch of games especially Bethesda titles flat out barely worked,lvh7xmb,4.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvhfdpz,CosmicCreeperz,,5,2024-11-05 06:22:23,,,,Yeah though Id put that to Bethesdas legendarily badly optimized engine as much as Sony Though the cell SPEs were a PITA to work with sure I assume Bethesda mostly just skipped them and relied on the regular PPC cores and less than performant Nvidia RSX GPU I ported a video streaming app to PS3 and for the most part thats what we did Spent way too long getting crypto running on the SPEs only for it to be SLOWER than the CPU for our use case,lvha36s,5.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvi4qky,CarlosFer2201,,2,2024-11-05 10:56:53,,,,Its probably to put the OS and other stuff like that in there and free up 2Gb of the regular ram for the games,lvh7xmb,4.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvjhbq4,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-05 16:05:27,,,,Hmm doubtful to me If its completely separate RAM bank and type its unlikely that it would be part of the unified system memory and having totally separate RAM used for normal OS use would be some pretty serious changes to the FreeBSD kernel used The original PS5 has 512 MB DDR4 RAM as an SSD controller cache so my guess is they are further leaning into their high performance SSD interface by bumping it to 2GB DDR5 Makes sense since the default SSD is also 4x the size 2TB and the GPU is much faster so it needs to pull textures from the SSD faster,lvi4qky,5.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvdlmzf,Mindestiny,,10,2024-11-04 17:21:53,,,,PSU recommendations from GPU manufacturers are bloated CYA nonsense A 4090s max wattage is 450w You dont need 250w of overhead to cover the other components unless you load your build up with all sorts or crazy superfluous bullshit,lvdhmgs,2.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvdqepb,bearfan15,,14,2024-11-04 17:44:57,,,,If youre running a 4090 you are almost certainly running a top of the line CPU that eats up a huge chunk of that overhead at full load And if youre going all in on your GPU and CPU you might as spend 50 more and go all in on your power supply too,lvdlmzf,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvea5rc,Mindestiny,,6,2024-11-04 19:21:02,,,,Not necessarily Most games and programs are either CPU or GPU heavy theres very little out there that is going to peg both at max turbo perpetually and someone can get a lot of mileage out of a 4090 without running an absolute bleeding edge top of the line CPU at the same time But to stay on topic 390W for the PS5 Pro is not a bit low Its a custom GPU and the rest of the system is a bespoke SOC and not a consumer PC Comparing it to general recommendations from GPU manufacturers is apples and oranges,lvdqepb,4.0,1gji5ur
comment,lveu071,SummeR-,,3,2024-11-04 20:58:37,,,,I agree that usually a game wont do both but its pretty common to play a game maybe watch a YouTube video maybe even watch that video in 4k In a web browser where you might have a lot of tabs maybe stream to your buddies in discord with source quality Thatll quickly rack up the power needs I used to have issues With a 650 watt and using a 30809900k when I would playstreamdo something else with the computer blue screening,lvea5rc,5.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvhcu7o,hvdzasaur,,1,2024-11-05 05:59:01,,,,Base manufacturer profiles for both GPUs and CPUs are overvolted tho You can quite comfortably drop the voltage or up the clock speed by quite a bit and as a result see lower power consumption and heat while getting the same performance,lvdqepb,4.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvdpwhu,SoftlySpokenPromises,,4,2024-11-04 17:42:29,,,,You mean superfluous shit like a CPU and a water cooler A ramped up i712 draws like 200W on its own and water coolers typically need around 50W I believe,lvdlmzf,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvi7cqe,None,,0,2024-11-05 11:22:00,,,,But why wouldnt you want it People who spend thousands on a top tier gpu and cpu and then skimp on the PSU one of the cheapest components baffle me I wouldnt want a 4090 with less than an 850W and would probably just go with 1000 for future proofing,lvdlmzf,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvihhdw,Mindestiny,,0,2024-11-05 12:43:43,,,,Thats like saying but why wouldnt you want 128GB of ram It costs more money and if youre not utilizing it its literally sitting there doing nothing at all Thats not skimping its right sizing the build Sony could throw a 1000w PSU in this thing too but all that would actually accomplish is raising the price and creating more ewaste There would be no impact on performance whatsoever,lvi7cqe,4.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvkk9j8,None,,0,2024-11-05 19:13:50,,,,Right sizing yesbut having a couple hundred watts headroom over the max useage for the psu is just smart Its not very good to always be at 90 Were talking 2030 in upgrades a lot cheaper than doubling ram for example,lvihhdw,5.0,1gji5ur
comment,lviz5z7,CCityinstaller,,0,2024-11-05 14:32:07,,,,Yeah can tell you arent an EE Transient Current Peaks are a thing Do you need 1500W No But is possible a 750W shuts down where a 8501kW will continue to woke properly 100,lvdlmzf,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvj31gr,Mindestiny,,1,2024-11-05 14:53:18,,,,I know what a transient current peak is but thanks for the condescension If you want to overspec a PSU by hundreds of watts for an edge case what if thats not ever likely to occur based on the rest of the hardware and the load from the components for what its actually being used for by all means its your money But the manufacturer recommendations are padded by design to dodge customer service requests Youre free to measure the draw on any one of these systems to confirm yourself Im pretty confident the EEs designing for Sony also know what theyre doing when speccing out the PSU for their console far more than random I built a PC reddit commenters,lviz5z7,4.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvj73vs,CCityinstaller,,0,2024-11-05 15:14:27,,,,Clear not or your wouldnt be telling people they dont need even 250W of headroom on a 4090 equipped system I didnt say anything about Sonys design although they have to deal with them as well Its much easier to tune a custom designed SoCplatform that one fixed set of specifications I have a business building high end workstationscustom WC gaming rigs in my small amount of spare time My first job in the my main field after moving from the construction industry paid intern during college was doing SA for several large manufacturers in regards to PSU failures So I have a bit of experience,lvj31gr,5.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvfmw9q,SoftlySpokenPromises,,1,2024-11-04 23:30:10,,,,Thats my point what they have in the console is roughly equivalent to a 7700 XT supposedly which has a maximum draw of about 250W Im curious to see how its designed to work around a 390W power source and using a Zen 2 CPU for modern titles at 60 FPS 4K On paper it sounds like a list of bottlenecks,lvfkt8s,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lve6pj3,xdamm777,,-12,2024-11-04 19:04:03,,,,Ive literally never seen my 11700K408032GB RAM9 fan system draw over 450w and that was playing star citizen with a mighty CPU overclock Its usually closer to 300w for 4k120 390w for a PS5 Pro seems overkill theyre playing it safe or theyre using a cheap PSU with an efficiency curve sweet spot near 7080 load,lvdby33,1.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvlbvcc,MiyazakisBurner,,1,2024-11-05 21:28:31,,,,A high end PSU rated for 450500w could be sufficient to power a system with a 4060 and a reasonable CPU I believe that recommended specs are higher to avoid cases where the PSU can output enough total power but not all to the 12v rail It is safe to assume PS5 has a custom power supply that only supplies as much power as absolutely needed to 3512v rails so there is not that overhead,lvgllgd,4.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvdx7fx,Memester999,,2,2024-11-04 18:17:53,,,,It having the ability to use their DLSS equivalent is such a bigger jump than what the PS4 pro did youre just wrong there That alone is a closer leap in fidelity to a console generation than a normal pro model,lvdhg5u,1.0,1gji5ur
comment,lveo5ru,I_R0M_I,,2,2024-11-04 20:30:03,,,,Not a fan of DLSS or Frame Gen tbh Its a crutch I dont use it when I play PC generally certain games it introduces noticeable issues Devs should just optimise properly The Monster Hunter Beta lists a 4060 just to run 1080p 60fps and thats with frame gen on,lvdx7fx,2.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvdmhcj,IsamuAlvaDyson,,0,2024-11-04 17:25:53,,,,These pro machines arent meant to sell a ton which is why they are priced higher to offset the lower install base they will have as opposed to pricing the main console lower because they will be offset by the volume of sales People are misremembering the PS4 Pro It didnt turn every 30fps game into 60fps it mainly was resolution bumps the same as we will get with the PS5 Pro,lvdhg5u,1.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvdo538,I_R0M_I,,3,2024-11-04 17:33:53,,,,It gave 4K Something the OG4 couldnt do Half the PCs that cost double a PS5 Pro cant run games at 4K 60fps The only way the Pro does is by up scaling and by tweaking devs not us settings to fine tune it I know its not a direct comparison but the 2 highest current tier cards are 52 and 83 tflops the Pro is 167 For console gaming I take resolution over fps every time But I play PC so anything important shooters etc Im not playing on console,lvdmhcj,2.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvdtjf6,IsamuAlvaDyson,,2,2024-11-04 17:59:58,,,,The PS4 Pro did not give 4k it upscaled everything just like now and most upscaling was not to 4k Im sure there were a very small selection of basic games that did have true 4k back then but there are some that do now as well,lvdo538,3.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvdvs5r,I_R0M_I,,1,2024-11-04 18:10:56,,,,Thats semantics The PS5 up scales games too and so will the Pro The PS4 Pro could output upscaled or not at 4K The PS4 at best output at 1080p There are 77 games that are listed as 4K for the PS4 Pro Most will be 30 fps no doubt The rest are listed as upscaled 2k etc,lvdtjf6,4.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvfqvgl,YoungHeartOldSoul,,1,2024-11-04 23:52:17,,,,I think the plan would be to play single player games on console excluding other games that Id buy to play with friends and local Coop games since gatherings at my house have become a thing in recent years Every Nintendo console Ive ever had who was the least used of all my consoles at the time regardless of how much I actually liked it I loved the 3DS so much I bought the special edition fire emblem one yet Im pretty sure that thing got less playtime then any of the numerous PlayStation Vitas that I owned 7 dont ask not to mention that I definitely did not sell it yet I also have absolutely no clue where it might be I guess the better question would be after the PlayStation 5 pro comes out which of the two would be a better choice I expect the used market will drop at least a little bit in price so Im just weighing my options,lvfojhp,2.0,1gji5ur
comment,lvftmsa,Odin4456,,1,2024-11-05 00:07:57,,,,Well whats awesome about the switch is the joy cons can make Mario party and Mario kart good for the local coop games Especially smash brothers If you get the normal version its handheld and also available on the TV Im older so getting the chance to play SNES and 64 games again is a big driving point If you really dont want to go Xbox then your option I guess is PS5 lol I bought a slim last year and it runs 120 hz and looks vastly superior to my series X The only thing I could see as a benefit for you with an Xbox is getting game pass through them and being able to play most titles on the pc but it has to be on windows But back to what the intent is going to be I highly recommend a switch for its ability to accommodate multiple players the ability to be portable or tv connected and the fact that you can play actual M rated games that are the same as the PS and Xbox versions unlike how it was with the Wii,lvfqvgl,3.0,1gji5ur

comment,lvdxvby,Geth_,,1,2024-11-04 18:21:05,,,,Its always in their business plan The original had a hardware refresh It was PSX but that it was PS1PS one I think that did well and theyve followed that release life cycle since The PS2 had the slim version The PS3 had a slim and pro version The hardware refresh isnt always just a power bump It depends on the technology advancements Like the bump in specs may be because advancements allow for it at little to no additional cost For example if you cut a tree to make a chair then you see how you could cut the tree more efficiently to increase the stability of the chair why not Especially if the major cost is the tree itself then just give people the better chair because you cant cut less of a tree This refresh was clearly and openly expected because they provided their business plan to their shareholders publicly They gave time tables for when they were expecting the mid life refresh and when they were expecting the next gen,lvduism,3.0,1gji5ur
