comment,mu1lwid,hera-fawcett,,1,2025-05-24 17:58:46,,,,the article mentioned this exclusively even if they completely pulled out of the gaming market their networkingcloudwhatever is worth more than the loss would be i think the thing is is that nvidias entire network shit is built on a house of cards similar to tesla the marketing and concepts are there but theres no real proof that those can be delivered on esp since nvidia is pushing big into ai smth consumers do not want fr,mtyjc6d,2.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtt7421,guareber,,19,2025-05-23 10:24:31,,,,Imagine thinking not wanting to overpay for a graphics card equals being poor Also who the fuck cares about path tracing right now,mtry6jk,2.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtvlvyn,Wooden_Maintenance93,,1,2025-05-23 18:12:58,,,,Path tracing at the moment going forward is going to be the standard for game devs in the aaa space and high fidelity games ie Doom DA Now Nvidia isnt the only one who can make hardware for it amd and intel are right behind them This ai push will crash at some point in the future just not now Dlss sound great and all but its only for the newer Nvidia cards as right now for example I have a 3070 ti but I cant use dlss frame Gen as its only for 40 series Amd is more for lack of s better word altruistic with there own software based frame Gen,mtt7421,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mttb9ny,tyrannictoe,,-23,2025-05-23 10:59:32,,,,People who care about their game looking good Imagine not being able to play with path tracing in 2025 and thinking youre not poor lmao,mtt7421,3.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mts9biv,propylene22,,16,2025-05-23 05:04:05,,,,I think the take away generally here is that ray tracing is still in the gimmick phase Even a 5090 cant do it at 4k high frame rate The improvement is generally visually so little Id sooner turn it off and have smoother play,mtry6jk,2.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtsqymj,Memphisrexjr,,4,2025-05-23 07:45:07,,,,Is it a gimmick when games like Indiana Jones and Doom Dark Ages are forcing you to have a RTX to play,mts9biv,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtvm3sd,Wooden_Maintenance93,,1,2025-05-23 18:14:02,,,,Its making its way out of gimmick phase once more devs work with only with Ray trace in mind it will change,mts9biv,3.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mu0ggv4,EnormousPileOfCats,,1,2025-05-24 14:20:11,,,,The 5090 not being able to do ray tracing well is news to my eyeballs and 5090 Calling it a gimmick is also just straight up ridiculous If its a gimmick then all of computer graphics are a gimmick and we should all just go back to untextured low poly models of everything,mts9biv,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtsbj7h,tyrannictoe,,-20,2025-05-23 05:22:33,,,,Its no longer a gimmick Path tracing has a transformative effect on indiana jones The 5090 can maintain a stable 60 fps at 4k dlss quality which is good enough to then add frame gen on top For a single player game the experience does not feel compromised at all,mts9biv,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtsg965,Preisschild,,15,2025-05-23 06:03:52,,,,I completely agree that Ray tracing is cool but saying that you need to fake half of your video output which has a lower quality than running natively without DLSSCo just to be able to use it is a biiig compromise,mtsbj7h,4.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtsi7ij,tyrannictoe,,-15,2025-05-23 06:21:34,,,,Thats just pure coping because your hardware cant handle it Dlss quality is now on par with or even exceeds native res in many instances It is only second to DLAA at native res,mtsg965,5.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtsj7av,Preisschild,,7,2025-05-23 06:30:44,,,,Id argue DLSSFSR and other tech is just for coping that your hardware cant handle rendering natively And even DLSS which is the best tech in that area still has a lot of artifacts hallucinations and more,mtsi7ij,6.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtsjm38,tyrannictoe,,3,2025-05-23 06:34:32,,,,Dlss 4 quality is definitely better than native TAA Is using TAA just coping that your computer cant supersample from 8k so your image is still aliased at 4k,mtsj7av,7.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mu0h98w,EnormousPileOfCats,,1,2025-05-24 14:24:24,,,,In the world outside of sweaty internet cope nobody gives a shit about this and just enjoys their 200fps 4k ultra everything games because the slight artifacting that is barely noticeable anymore is 10000 worth the massive increase in frame rate,mtsj7av,7.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mu0m74j,Preisschild,,1,2025-05-24 14:50:39,,,,I guess it depends on your preference but your original comment saying anyone who doesnt want this is poor is still false,mu0h98w,8.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mu0pf0k,EnormousPileOfCats,,1,2025-05-24 15:07:29,,,,That def wasnt me the pricing being out of control now is another issue that I agree with I only have a 5090 because I have a good job and am stupid lol Im purely talking about the tech DLSS 4 has gotten extremely good I didnt used to use it either now I dont even bother comparing native anymore,mu0m74j,9.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtq4i7n,NormanYeetes,,90,2025-05-22 21:11:55,,,,I laughed when I read the fine print and saw what Nvidia meant by maxed out It meant a paltry 720p render resolution DLSSupscaled to 1080p with up to three of every four frames imagined by AI and even then only when you paired Nvidias budget 299 GPU with a decidedly not budget 599 AMD CPU one of the best money can buy Just putting this here so people who want to jump to Nvidias defense might wanna read what Nvidia thinks its users average IQ is,,0.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtozo6f,phoenixmatrix,,200,2025-05-22 17:53:46,,,,The best time to buy a videocard is at the end of the generation before they stop manufacturing them for the new gen where all the kinks are known you can make an informed decision and have a lot of supply to pick from while everyone is holding off to buy the next one Early gen cards are such a pain I had to go through 3 RTX 4080 cards and still have issues with mine overheating now My wife got a late gen Super 4080 and doesnt have any issue Its a small sample size and plenty of people with early cards are doing fine but its just putting statistics on your side,mtoyr9r,1.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtp1zjz,drmirage809,,38,2025-05-22 18:04:43,,,,Thats what I did I had the choice between buying a 4080 Super or taking my chances with the 5080 Ended up getting a 4080 Super and Ive been most pleased with it Its an absolute beast and coming from an AMD card DLSS has been a game changer for me That stuff is some black magic to me with how well it works,mtozo6f,2.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtp3zuj,phoenixmatrix,,13,2025-05-22 18:14:20,,,,yeah the 4080 Supers are really good You made the right call No multi frame generation but hey youll live,mtp1zjz,3.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtpohl9,sh1boleth,,12,2025-05-22 19:54:03,,,,Its game dependent and when it works its beautiful IMO Nvidia is wrongly advertising it it will feel like shit if you get 60 fps but if you have a high refresh rate monitor and get 80 fps FrameGen to 200 feels really smooth artifacting is game dependent I havent noticed much in Oblivion and Hogwarts Legacy but AC Shadows did artifact a bit around the UI Components,mtphss6,5.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtp4kxt,drmirage809,,2,2025-05-22 18:17:09,,,,Indeed Havent had to use framegen yet outside of Portal RTX but thats kinda the point of that game Its a crazy tech demo that pushes the hardware to the limit by ray tracing everything The frame gen looks really good I must say I just wonder if it impacts things like input latency Probably not very useful for games that require fast reactions,mtp3zuj,4.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtw3sga,phoenixmatrix,,1,2025-05-23 19:43:17,,,,yeah afaik they just used DLSS 4 Frame Gen to describe the 1 fake frame per real frame mode and Multi Frame Gen was used to describe the 3 fake frame per real frame one that is in the 50XX series,mtw3hgy,5.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtppihu,Ironlion45,,6,2025-05-22 19:59:00,,,,I skimped a little during the shortage when I needed a new GPU so I ended up more recently going from a 1060 to a 4090 lol It was quite a jump in many ways I milked my 780 for a long time I imagine Ill be running this bad boy for some time too unless it melts which it sometimes feels like lol,mtp1zjz,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtqn5f6,ChesswiththeDevil,,4,2025-05-22 22:53:35,,,,Bought a 6900XT for 400 2 years ago and it just chugs along GPU manufacturers have squeezed the fun out of PC hardware enthusiasts and now its not worth trying to get a nextgen GPU Just get the best priced flagship from the previous gen you can and save 60 More money for games or other stuff and youre really not gonna notice a difference,mtp1zjz,3.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtp9qlk,dark_gear,,3,2025-05-22 18:42:01,,,,This is the way The added benefit of this approach is the discounts on the older gen cards As an aside this is the best way to buy a new iphone Dont buy the new one when it comes out in October buy the outgoing phone in August or the fist week of September when they go on sale for heavily discounted prices,mtozo6f,2.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtq1q1d,pinkynarftroz,,-3,2025-05-22 20:57:54,,,,The only downside to this is software support Apple drops support for devices for iOS upgrades every so often If you buy an older phone youll have updates for less time If thats not important then go for it I imagine its the same for games At some point certain card will just do longer be supported But maybe by then youll be wanting a new one anyway I dunno,mtp9qlk,3.0,1ksx0nb
comment,mtqcku6,dark_gear,,5,2025-05-22 21:54:52,,,,I can see the point however its not really an issue when buying a brand new 11month old phone Apple software support is assured for 7 years 5 years regular 2 years vintage 6 years is a long time in phone years keeping in mind that the lack of support doesnt mean the phone stops working right away it just means that your unsupported apps will eventually stop working The phone and texting features will work much longer than most of your apps As for GPUs its also not really a concern I have 2 gaming computers My main is less than a year old while the older one is running an i76700 with a GTX1070 When my nephew comes we play sidebyside coop in Space Marine 2 and the game still runs super Granted its an EVGA card but cards from major vendors rarely fail out of the warranty period when theyre not overclocked Based on my experience of building computers since the mid 90s the savings and more stable software are worth the wait,mtq1q1d,4.0,1ksx0nb

comment,mtoyx80,TheRexRider,,144,2025-05-22 17:50:16,,,,This week the company reportedly attempted to delay derail and manipulate reviews of its 299 GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card which would normally be its bestselling GPU of the generation Nvidia has repeatedly and publicly said the budget 60series cards are its most popular and this year it reportedly tried to ensure it by withholding access and pressuring reviewers to paint them in the best light possible Nvidia might have wanted to prevent a repeat of 2022 when it launched this cards predecessor Those reviews were harsh The 4060 was called a slap in the face to gamers and a wet fart of a GPU I had guessed the 5060 was headed for the same fate after seeing how reviewers handled the 5080 which similarly showcased how little Nvidias hardware has improved year over year and relied on software to make up the gaps But Nvidia had other plans Here are the tactics that Nvidia reportedly just used to throw us off the 5060s true scent as individually described by GamersNexus VideoCardz Hardware Unboxed GameStarde Digital Foundry and more Nvidia decided to launch its RTX 5060 on May 19th when most reviewers would be at Computex in Taipei Taiwan rather than at their test beds at home Even if reviewers already had a GPU in hand before then Nvidia cut off most reviewers ability to test the RTX 5060 before May 19th by refusing to provide drivers until the card went on sale Gaming GPUs dont really work without them And yet Nvidia allowed specific cherrypicked reviewers to have early drivers anyhow if they agreed to a borderline unethical deal they could only test five specific games at 1080p resolution with fixed graphics settings against two weaker GPUs the 3060 and 2060 Super where the new card would be sure to win In some cases Nvidia threatened to withhold future access unless reviewers published applestooranges benchmark charts showing how the RTX 5060s fake frames MFG tech can produce more frames than earlier GPUs without it Some reviewers apparently took Nvidia up on that proposition leading to early reviews where charts looked positively stacked in the 5060s favor,,0.0,1ksx0nb
