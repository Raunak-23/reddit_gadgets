comment,n3f7gd2,Stussygiest,,31,2025-07-16 10:26:47,,,,I guess watching videos are better You dont get the black bars on top or bottom I have a normal folding phone and the ratio for videos is not the best Large black bars People who use excel or other apps that benefits horizontal view When i use excel i have to scroll which is annoying Having multiple apps open at once Im guessing someone who does use a phone for business would benefit from this best For normal folks having better video ratio is not worth it Edit Forgot to mention reading bookscomics is amazinggg on a foldable phone Not sure if a trifold would make it better Probably not,n3eycu2,1.0,1m16w9j
comment,n3fsoog,external72,,7,2025-07-16 12:53:50,,,,I use fold 6 as my work phone I can remote into my PC and its great on bigger screen Our ERP is also web based which too works great and sheets are a no brainer I also need to show people catalogs price lists etc and I can open it and show it to them Plus I can annotate stuff with the pen but thats going away which is unfortunate Also not great for watching vids for sure but thats not my use case so it works for me When I need to I just half fold it and have videos on top screen and controls on bottomflat one Not great for someone who consumes all their media on their phone or dont have an option to use a iPadlaptopTV,n3f7gd2,2.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3i1i13,alidan,,3,2025-07-16 19:40:02,,,,normal phone ratios are good to get quick info from 1 fold is great to have actual screen space to watch or read something most people want a tablet sized device they can fit in their pocket but most people arent willing to spend 1k on a fold design that has built in mechanical obsolesce,n3eycu2,1.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3f4vfu,theemptyqueue,,1,2025-07-16 10:03:56,,,,The problem these phones are trying to solve isnt really a problem for most The problem these folding phones are solving is how to get a tablet sized screen into a pocket instead of a backpack or purse One of the big issues with folding phones are that theyre a lot more fragile than bar phones in regard to their screens and their chassis,n3eycu2,1.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3jqmen,crymachine,,0,2025-07-17 00:47:47,,,,Honestly all anyone needs to do is make a fold out 7 tablet display and keep a 169 aspect ratio and itd probably be a hit The Pura X is 1710 I think and thats a huge hit Just make a device thats good to watch content on and make another device thats 10 or more with a good stylus for pdf nerds and profit,n3eycu2,1.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3gve88,Kingstad,,0,2025-07-16 16:26:30,,,,Well I was going to get the Fairphone for some of the following reasons its European and we should support and build up our own tech companies to avoid dependence on increasingly hostile powers It attempts to make a phone as ethically as possible no exploitation etc This includes environmental concerns Its a modular phone meant to last and opening it to swap batteryparts is trivial However I reasoned with myself that getting a used phone is quite good too though I think its the tech loving side of me that did most to push that argument as I got a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra which is basically still a new phone I dont have much beef with South Korea yet I must say however that Ive had very little use for its various fancy features so far,n3gcrar,2.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3fuy76,gchaudh2,,7,2025-07-16 13:06:37,,,,They were also banned from India for a while They are still not allowed to some extent Their whole shtick was to enter the market at an insanely low price in part subsidized by the chinese govt to undercut rivals and establish dominance in the respective foreign market Some countries eventually saw through it and banned them,n3fufma,2.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3fzfjj,LupusDeusMagnus,,6,2025-07-16 13:31:11,,,,I dont think so I think America accused them of that but America isnt exactly a sane country much less devoid of its own interests Dont remember if anything came out of that They are banned in America Japan and Australia but the reasons depend They do have restrictions in other countries derived not from tampering with their equipment but due to their business practices like bribery forging documents money laundering which are all par for the course for tech industries but they are bad at it and got caught,n3fke3s,1.0,1m16w9j

comment,n3ko5fl,_RADIANTSUN_,,15,2025-07-17 04:23:04,,,,This is the harsh truth that a lot of American analysis of China completely misses The smartest thing the CCP has ever done is making itself in recent decades close to completely invisible in the daily lives of the insanely massive population of China As a result Average Chinese people dont give a fuck about politics in general They are literally busy doing other stuff Americans by and large are hugely absorbed in politics as a major part of their lives and cant even imagine this,n3kkv5l,2.0,1m16w9j
