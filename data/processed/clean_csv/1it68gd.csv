comment,mdpke8v,reality_bytes_,,3,2025-02-19 23:36:48,,,,Cheaper for 900 msrp Now theyre just trying to see how much consumers are willing to pay for a gpu I wish people would stave off the temptation for a few months to show that charging exorbitant prices for games is something we would fight back on Mid range needs to go back to 500700 This 900 for something that isnt even at the top of performance is asinine Please people let the scalpers sit on their stock and sweat while their credit card payments come due Please let this roll until the whole industry gets the hint that playing games might be fun but it isnt worth these prices,mdm8wtg,1.0,1it68gd

comment,mdntbfn,dzone25,,1,2025-02-19 18:46:56,,,,No they should either be prepared with the stock supply or just raise the MSRP on launch if its not actually going to hit it for another 69 months,mdnq074,2.0,1it68gd

comment,mdqsjfq,Elfalpha,,6,2025-02-20 03:43:21,,,,Things are better than they used to be but theres always something with AMD cards Often it will be a specific game that hasnt done as good a job testing on AMD than Nvidia Thats not really AMDs fault and the more cards they sell the better that issue will get but its still a thing that doesnt happen with Nvidia,mdplyvx,3.0,1it68gd

comment,mds4krb,Nagemasu,,1,2025-02-20 10:35:17,,,,I hope all Redditors knows that buying over MRSP FE cards are limited stock and few AIB GPUs are ever MSRP and when they are they often come with various corners being cut The profit margin on AIB GPU if sold at NVIDIAs pricing is tiny which is often why we see them making these wild designs like the SUPRM that cost so much more than the cheaper versions of the same GPU,mdn8g6e,2.0,1it68gd
comment,mdorr42,BalooBot,,1,2025-02-19 21:20:05,,,,I really wish nvidia would strongarm retailers into following msrp Many companies do this already sony for example couldnt keep ps5s on the shelves for literal years but you never saw their prices jacked up by retailers All they would have to do is add a clause in their sales contract and retailers either agree or dont receive stock It wouldnt cost them anything theyre not the ones making bank by jacking up the prices and it would be a huge gain in terms of their reputation as a company and help develop brand loyalty,mdmkoyt,1.0,1it68gd
