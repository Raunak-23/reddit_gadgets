comment,mzpp95f,JoeSmithDiesAtTheEnd,,34,2025-06-25 15:33:17,,,,Id love to know this also Ive been trying out other bulb brands in less frequently used rooms in my house and I still cant find ones I like as much as Hue Hue bulbs are super responsive Ive tried Govee Kasa Wyze and IKEA And Govee has been my secondary preference but theyre not nearly as snappy I feel stuck with Hue for future bulb replacements as any smart bulbs need to be instant to pass the wife test,mzpj48u,3.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzqug8g,Yummier,,23,2025-06-25 18:43:05,,,,For me it was resolving two needs for the main ceiling lamp in the apartment 1 It needs to be dimmable and there isnt an existing dimmer installed 2 It needs to have different temperatures based on activity Hue bulbs solved both issues The lamp is now great for any occasion be it reading crafts cooking movie nightyou name it Thats super convenient in a small apartment where space is a limited resource I bought mine on a sale the round glass orb ones and it ended up costing about the same as the normal bulbs I replaced,mzpu6t6,5.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzxc2cz,nicetriangle,,3,2025-06-26 18:11:57,,,,MFGs of smart bulbs make high CRI lights FYI but besides that point Im gonna make a rough guess that 99 of the population doesnt give a damn and would find the light quality of any decent smart bulb on the market to be completely adequate People dont care about CRI at all nor do they know what it even means Theyll care that the lights dim to a nice warm color that makes their home feel cozy in the evenings and works with their phone app Theyre not using them for filmmaking,mzri7s4,7.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzxckao,lowcrawler,,-2,2025-06-26 18:14:17,,,,but it just looks so artificial and assy people might not know why but they can def tell think of how many people raged about CFL light quality,mzxc2cz,8.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzxgl98,nicetriangle,,3,2025-06-26 18:33:12,,,,Theyre miles better than CFL bulbs Peoples problem with CFLs was that they were cold and sterile feeling Current gen high quality LEDs including smart bulbs dont have that problem at all,mzxckao,9.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzxhvyc,lowcrawler,,0,2025-06-26 18:39:21,,,,that sterile feeling is more than just color temp its also CRI I still get the crappy sterile feeling from low CRI which includes most smart bulbs like the Hue at roughly 80 RA LEDs they are cool dont misunderstand me but the light quality is objectively terrible,mzxgl98,10.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzpqap4,Training-Flan8092,,3,2025-06-25 15:38:08,,,,This is definitely fair To be clear Govee is my middle ground between expense and quality The app is great and it has good color transitions that feel close to hue They also have good variety and the materials they use feel strong That being said I have Black Friday items Ive gotten for pennies that are still doing great Bulbs switches things that arent strips where I care about points of light and transitions all really just make more sense to go cheap to me,mzphjl9,5.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzomalc,rustyphish,,59,2025-06-25 12:08:21,,,,Stupid hub Thats like the one reason to get Phillips hue The reason standalone bulbs are cheaper is because they have to run off of Bluetooth or WiFi If you do dozens of bulbs across your house then it can clog up those networks Creating a Zigbee network through the Phillips hue hub is a great way to solve that problem,mzoda64,1.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzomf7j,Jamie00003,,-29,2025-06-25 12:09:12,,,,Thread does that already tho And you can have an unlimited number of hubs in my case my hubs are my Apple TVs and HomePods Thread runs off the zigbee protocol by the way Maybe research it,mzomalc,2.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzon3yb,rustyphish,,13,2025-06-25 12:13:41,,,,I didnt say there are no other solutions Just that the hub itself is not stupid Especially for the time it came out it was a really intuitive way to set up a network like that for consumers who by and large had never heard of a Zigbee network I bet the majority of users still dont even know thats what the hub does,mzomf7j,3.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzonank,Jamie00003,,-19,2025-06-25 12:14:53,,,,What Im saying its stupid we have to use a hub with them I would buy these bulbs if they have thread variants especially considering how much they charge for them Thread has been around for 5 years at this point its not new,mzon3yb,4.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzooket,Jamie00003,,-1,2025-06-25 12:23:03,,,,Same goes for thread devices Your hub is an Apple TV or HomePod in my case and you get redundancy if you have multiple Plus thread bulbs are cheaper,mzonvci,2.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzomcg9,wildgirl202,,6,2025-06-25 12:08:42,,,,I have Philips hue which I installed in like 2018 Great lights and were not cheap but at the time the price made sense Today with competitors offering the same quality light as hue but at a much lower price point Im not sure Id choose hue,mzoda64,1.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzp4j9p,jeffsterlive,,7,2025-06-25 13:54:05,,,,What do you mean by the same quality I have hue bulbs from 2017 still working Cant say the same for any other led bulb including dumb ones around the house Ecosmart are trash They all have transformer issues and blink or fail outright due to poor heat dissipation LEDs are incredibly tricky to get correct Hue also has great color modes and high lumen options Guess I need to look around but hard to move on from such reliability and integration with Alexa routines,mzomcg9,2.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzpgqb2,rumski,,11,2025-06-25 14:53:14,,,,Yeah I saw some meme on instagram just this morning saying something like remember how they tried to get us to believe LED bulbs would last 15 years and they expect us to just ignore that and it struck me that I have Hue bulbs still rocking since 2012 Thats a decent ROI I guess,mzp0i71,1.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzqdftg,skriefal,,3,2025-06-25 17:24:33,,,,This isnt specifically about Hue bulbs but the early LED bulbs did seem to last and last They were heavy and had lots of heatsinking to draw heat away from the tiny emitter diodes And they cost about 20 each for nonHue bulbs I used a bunch of these and some did last more than 10 years of heavy use probably 24000 hours of use The new bulbs seem to fail sooner but last much longer than an incandescent bulb Theyre also much cheaper than they used to be at around 2 each again nonHue Those who are opposed to change will rarely listen to reason,mzpgqb2,2.0,1lk2mnp
comment,mzqxg9p,skylinenick,,1,2025-06-25 18:57:15,,,,Early LEDs did suck back when it was bluewhite Now that we can just make them yellow like the old incandescents there is literally no reason to not switch,mzqdftg,3.0,1lk2mnp

comment,mzqeuap,vanhalenbr,,4,2025-06-25 17:30:50,,,,With Homdebrige I am switching to Govee specially because Hue now requires to have an account and its so complicated and annoying as other solutions I miss when Hue just works the app would allow you to easily pair the base not forcing user account and other annoyances it was so easy it woud worth the extra price but now they are forcing accounts password and so much stress to setup It just like any other cheaper option,,0.0,1lk2mnp
