comment,m1q6voe,habitual_viking,,276,2024-12-12 18:06:20,,,,249 MSRP They are listed locally for around 280 here in Denmark which is expected because of taxes etc So yeah game changer,m1q6l5f,1.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1uqnjh,TheyCallMeMrMaybe,,65,2024-12-13 13:12:03,,,,Intel is performing a very wise strategy here Nvidia and AMD have completely abandoned the midtier budget segments for PC gaming by pricing their cards wayout of those segments The B580 should be a market disruptor,m1q6voe,2.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1whv40,Vmanaa,,12,2024-12-13 19:06:51,,,,We still have yet to see amd said they are going to stop focusing on the highend for the 8000 series Depending on what they release they still might bring a gpu that is similarly priced yet more powerful since intel is being compared to last gen,m1uqnjh,3.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1wted0,Struykert,,0,2024-12-13 20:08:16,,,,I thought of that and then figured nvidia will be the winner because they will own the high end market without competition So only 90 and 80 series from them leaving the rest for Intel and AMD to kill each other over and when they have done that and are both bleeding in their respective corners nvidia release a midrange card that blows them both to bits I hope Im wrong but this is what I think will happen,m1whv40,4.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1udzye,oshinbruce,,19,2024-12-13 11:26:43,,,,Its great to see they just need to be on top of the driver game Alot of my friends buy Nvidia because it works and every big ticket game is followed shortly by a driver update from Nvidia Driver issues arent common but it does happen and for me AMD comes with a vague anxiety that when one of 12 new games I actually want to play come along that I wont be able to play them,m1q6l5f,1.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1viktc,Baxtab13,,5,2024-12-13 16:00:06,,,,Yeah the driver thing is a driving force on me wanting to go back to team green Its not like the drivers are a problem all the time but that like 510 of the time its super frustrating I remember when there was like a good 56 month period when Destiny 2 of all games just had shit performance on AMD cards until a driver update from AMD finally fixed it I had just upgraded from GTX 1080 to an RX 6900XT and to find that I was achieving like 20FPS less in that game with the upgrade was beyond frustrating,m1udzye,2.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1tn92l,Trosque97,,12,2024-12-13 06:35:40,,,,Uhuh and how many people are buying anything above mid to low end How viable would it be to try and invest so much money in a market that already has such tight competition I for one am actually happy that theyre taking their sweet time easing their way into it and catering to the largest market to guarantee sales for future projects Mid to low end is the best way to go if youre easing your way in Do you need a 4090 And if you need one how common is your need amongst the market Because Im right there with you dude Id love for more challenges to Nvidia being the highend top dog But you cant jump into a race like that without solid footing first give em time,m1tmonn,6.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1skxc0,IceMaverick13,,12,2024-12-13 02:01:58,,,,Yeah but competition would mean theyd be coming down to like 2 months of groceries and that pool is a little bit bigger which breeds wider competition which lowers prices and soon its only 1 months of groceries I can starve for a month for magic thinking rock,m1qovc6,2.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1smffk,Usernametaken1121,,9,2024-12-13 02:11:16,,,,Yeah but competition would mean theyd be coming down Do you have an example of that Because theres 8 different competitors to Lamborghini and their cars are still one of the most expensive you can buy Top of the market dictates the market People will pay 15k to have the best GPU so thats where the market is,m1skxc0,3.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1u6qy4,notjfd,,2,2024-12-13 10:08:39,,,,Lambos are conspicuous consumption which GPUs are not Anytime AMD builds a highend GPU that provides better bangforbuck than highend nvidias they steal loads of market share The problem is AMD always seems to blow their advantage the next generation And thats honestly because nvidia controls the datacenter GPU market Nvidia makes most of its dosh here which pays for the massive RD budgets that allow them to maintain their comfortable lead there Whenever a startup like AMD or Intel gets close to competing in the highend gaming market which is dangerous for their datacenter business because its close to the lowend datacenter segment they price and spec their next generation specifically to kneecap the competitions offering tank their market share blow up their revenue stream and choke their RD Unless Intel is willing to intensively develop their GPUs for multiple years at big losses Nvidia will always be capable of putting out a counteroffer even at _higher_ prices that make Intels offering unattractive,m1smffk,4.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1ufv13,Usernametaken1121,,3,2024-12-13 11:44:48,,,,Lambos are conspicuous consumption which GPUs are not I agree GPUs arent conspicuous but Nvidia high end GPUs are conspicuous consumption Just as vehicles arent conspicuous but a Lambo vehicle is,m1u6qy4,5.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1ui3tm,notjfd,,2,2024-12-13 12:05:04,,,,I bought an expensive GPU for what it could do not for what other people would think of me Admittedly there are people who buy the most expensive thing to flex their wealth but that does not automatically class that entire product in that way Most of the time people are simply willing to accept significantly worse bangforbuck if that means more bang,m1ufv13,6.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1uca2o,Jiopaba,,1,2024-12-13 11:09:20,,,,I think for perspective you have to say how many youre feeding with that My household of 3 probably spends about 300 a month on groceries between Publix and Sams Club 800 a month sounds crazy to me like eating caviar with dinner or something,m1t4mf1,3.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1wy2hl,Jiopaba,,1,2024-12-13 20:33:56,,,,Lol I feel the same the other way around Between Sams Club and Publix I usually spend about 200 per trip and I only go every three weeks or so The biggest expenses are meat because its expensive and milk because I buy lactosefree ultrapasteurized milk that keeps forever There are occasions when I can spend 400 in a single trip like when power loss from the hurricane destroyed everything in my fridge and freezer recently but those are at most once a year I also spend money at the farmers market buying fresh fruits and vegetables but no matter how much the outoftouch old people who shop there complain 30 here and there really isnt much My imagination runs wild Im torn between thinking maybe grocery stores are twice as expensive somewhere else or some people would be confused I dont have a 400 budget for saffron and goldleaf chocolates,m1wornp,5.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1rkzgy,Wander715,,-1,2024-12-12 22:26:42,,,,Yeah I think it will probably be 1200 which is still a bad price At that point I might just wait for a 5080Ti probably in 2026 and see what pricing and specs on that are If Nvidia wanted to surprise people with a good price theyd match the 4080S at 1000 but I really doubt that happens,m1rhfr7,3.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1smt04,MegaDuckDodgers,,7,2024-12-13 02:13:38,,,,Unlikely at least in the US Nvidia has for the past decade been trying to raise prices with every new release Before covid hit the 20 series was already more expensive than the 10 series for basically minimal performance games When the 30 and 40 series were released it wasnt much better I paid 600 dollars for a 1080 7 years ago The equivalent card tier 4080 has almost doubled in price in that short amount of time Taking trump at his word the incoming tariffs will also cause those prices to go up even more There is also another crypto bubble on the horizon Pretty much every tech insider and hobbyist is saying that this is probably your last chance to get any kind of deal before prices start going up and that its better to splurge on a 40 series now rather have to wait through another 20172022 bad market while hoping the prices eventually come down,m1q9vpa,1.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1tad08,None,,1,2024-12-13 04:45:58,,,,Im curious how it bodes for GPU longevity in the future There was a SonyInsomniac leak a while back that had mention of a 2029 or so release date for another ratchet and clank game If they did well with it on the PC heres hoping being released wonder if a RTX A5000 card would run it then or the tech changed alot again,m1smt04,2.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1tk1t5,MegaDuckDodgers,,1,2024-12-13 06:05:31,,,,Probably it will be able to run the game It has the vram and ray tracing support Ampere might be on Its way out as far as the architecture is concerned by then but I wouldnt really worry that hard about it The only major concern would be if Nvidia comes out with some new tech similar to ray tracing which I havent heard anything about but even then ray tracing has been rather slow to adopt,m1tad08,3.0,1hcq9cj

comment,m1upmxc,GGATHELMIL,,1,2024-12-13 13:04:43,,,,Bought a 1080ti a few months after launch for about 550 Its a bit of stretch on that price though There was a sale plus I got them to price match and there was a cash back reward through rakutan and newegg Plus I didnt have to pay tax I may have who knows Plus it came with a code for a game I was already going to buy But still a top of the line gpu msrp was 700 and Im proof back in the day you could essentially get 20 off that 700 doesnt even get you a 4070ti super I guess if you account for inflation it lines up 700 bucks back then is equivalent to 900 now But it still feels shitty that spending the same equivalent money doesnt yield a same equivalent tier item Im aware a 4070ti super is going to be about twice as good as a 1080ti in most applications so it kinda evens out I guess Im just stuck on the fact that 700 bucks used to get you top of the line Now the equivalent gets you 3rd4th from the top depending on how you look at the super variants and the Chinese only models,m1smt04,2.0,1hcq9cj
comment,m1vj38c,MegaDuckDodgers,,1,2024-12-13 16:02:51,,,,Inflation itself isnt necessarily the issue It is not normal for things to almost double in price within seven years though 20172022 was a weird time They were already doing this before the pandemic when the 2080 was an extra 100 compared to the 1080 when it was only like 15 better and sometimes even less than that They got a lot of shit for that but it apparently meant nothing because the graphics card market is a duopoly and Nvidia controls more and more of it every year Honestly though Its just a weird time to be alive in general even excluding PC prices I definitely do think Its a crime though that you cant build an excellent gaming PC for 500 dollars anymore,m1upmxc,3.0,1hcq9cj
