comment,mev29as,MultiMarcus,,204,2025-02-26 10:11:34,,,,Im curious about the cost compared to a comparable PC I also wonder if the AMD APU will support FSR 4 If it does and the price is comparable to a standard desktop PC with similar performance I genuinely think this could be a great product For instance I might consider it for my dad Hed love to play Windows games but we can play most of them with him on his Mac Studio He wouldnt want a large desktop but would be happy with a mini PC,,0.0,1iyjucm
comment,mev5xis,_sharpmars,,108,2025-02-26 10:47:30,,,,Its based on RDNA 35 so no FSR 4 unfortunately,mev29as,1.0,1iyjucm
comment,mev62e3,MultiMarcus,,40,2025-02-26 10:48:49,,,,Arent they trying to back port it to older RDNA hardware If theyre able to get FSR4 on them then that would be incredible Without it I dont feel like I could recommend it as wholeheartedly,mev5xis,2.0,1iyjucm

comment,mev6l7q,MultiMarcus,,14,2025-02-26 10:53:47,,,,Oof then I cant really recommend this mini PC to anyone for gaming then Other than I guess the people who are really aggressive about playing at native resolutions and dont mind low end performance Im sure that this will be great especially for more work related use cases the hard gaming but there really is space for a good mini gaming PC on the market right now Hopefully AMD will be able to do something with FSR4 on their next generation of APUs,mev6afk,4.0,1iyjucm
comment,mew0i5f,Relevant-Doctor187,,36,2025-02-26 14:21:54,,,,Its performance is comparable to a 4060 Its more powerful than a PS5 Pro Its fine for the majority of games at 1440P The vast majority of PC gamers are playing with something less powerful according to steam HW surveys,mev6l7q,5.0,1iyjucm
comment,mew16zf,MultiMarcus,,2,2025-02-26 14:25:41,,,,Of course thats my point Youre spending double the amount on this mini PC compared to a PS5 I understand that PC gaming is often less value for money than comparable consoles but unless youre particularly drawn to the mini PC concept I dont see much reason to buy it You could either get a PS5 and get comparable performance for half the price in a larger package or you could buy a regular desktop PC for roughly the same amount and get better performance If youre on the Nvidia side youll get upscaling thats more competent and if youre on the AMD or Intel side youll get a much better deal Well at least I think so or how much would it cost to build a comparable desktop PC to how much one of these costs,mew0i5f,6.0,1iyjucm
comment,mew3rgn,Relevant-Doctor187,,8,2025-02-26 14:39:45,,,,Cheapest is 799 if you toss in your own case and PSU A comparable mini pc cant be built for cheaper and the gaming NUC is more expensive Its priced pretty good compared to options on the market Just built a mITX pc for one of my kids and it was comparable to this base configuration Pretty sure it cost me more Today it def costs more because 4060s are stupidly priced,mew16zf,7.0,1iyjucm
comment,mew4kfo,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-02-26 14:43:59,,,,Its quite ridiculous how expensive PC hardware has become Ive found that recommending consoles to people who want to get into gaming is more practical Unless theyre willing to spend around xx70 card money its not worth it unless they want to play specific PC games Even then I think a PS5 Pro might be more reasonable And once you get into the xx80 and xx90 cards prices are so insane that theres not really any reason other than being really into PC gaming that can justify it,mew3rgn,8.0,1iyjucm

comment,mewbzmd,MultiMarcus,,2,2025-02-26 15:22:10,,,,No so they will be buying a PS5 or PS5 Pro AMD has been rolling out these numbers saying that 60 of gamers spend have 300 graphics cards and 85 of gamers have less than 700 graphics cards and still havent managed to move the needle on AMD GPUs Targeting a group of people that consoles also target just doesnt make a whole lot of sense and since they have such bad mindshare that the nonenthusiast noncasual group they are targeting barely know AMD GPUs exist They make a good product but need to be more aggressive on pricing and catching up on the technology front and not being a step behind NVIDIA I love these small APU devices but they arent viable desktop or console alternatives at their current price points,mewajw3,12.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf8x7tm,Fackcelery,,1,2025-02-28 13:27:29,,,,I agree up until you said you need xx70 money Its a massive lie I paid 300 dollars for my rx7600 and I can play modern games at 1440p 60fps without issue in most cases Some games like Tarkov will go under 60 fps but for the vast majority of modern titles it does the job and still gives higher framerates than console,mew4kfo,9.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf8y7ev,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-02-28 13:33:27,,,,That sounds fairly comparable to a console in performance from what I can tell I dont think youre matching a PS5 pro with that GPU I dont necessarily know what you define as a modern game but when youre using Tarkov as an example that feels kind of odd since its like nine years old When Im talking about modern games Im talking about games that are from this console generation and arent cross generation,mf8x7tm,10.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf8z0p8,Fackcelery,,1,2025-02-28 13:38:14,,,,Yeah fair point talking about tarkov but its a well known optimization nightmare that requires higher specs than most modern games today so I figured it was a decent example I dont really play AAA titles at this point but I HIGHLY doubt a PS5 pro could run tarkov at 60fps assuming an identical port,mf8y7ev,11.0,1iyjucm

comment,mf1go5b,BytchYouThought,,1,2025-02-27 08:39:07,,,,I assumed it was because not everyone buys a PC for gaming or they already need a PC anyway and like FF ans prebuilt nature of it,mew16zf,7.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf1h007,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-02-27 08:42:34,,,,Sure Im only discussing the gaming part of the title where they label it a gaming PC I think its probably a great thing for other workloads and people have already mentioned that it might be a good option for AI so Im sure that there are a lot of use cases there but I was specifically referring to the gaming aspect,mf1go5b,8.0,1iyjucm
comment,mgd90jk,spaceminions,,1,2025-03-06 18:03:06,,,,The better question is not gaming pc vs console its gaming pc vs regular pc plus console A brand new decent quality laptop or desktop is already expensive enough that adding a console to the price gets the total into a more viable range than you might think,mew16zf,7.0,1iyjucm
comment,mgdawv0,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-03-06 18:12:00,,,,Sure and you are paying for that flexibility but most people probably need a laptop anyway I cannot talk about anyone else but I couldnt do my daily tasks without a laptop which means that youre probably going to need a laptop plus a desktop or youre buying a gaming laptop which generally isnt cheaper than buying a normal laptop and a gaming console Dont get me wrong there are a lot of cases where a device like this is perfect but I do think most people probably need to have a laptop and then theyll be looking at a separate device that they can do gaming on and that would be something like this or a console For the people that want a laptop and are fine with paying the extra for a desktop like me we probably dont need a portable desktop anyway That being said this is going to be an incredible device for some people and its going to be great for people doing AI work loads who also might want to play some games on the side thats an incredible usecase it just probably doesnt have a lot of general appeal,mgd90jk,8.0,1iyjucm
comment,mgdsu9o,spaceminions,,1,2025-03-06 19:36:00,,,,Yeah i can agree with that to a greater extent a random person would have to spend more to get the laptop to be comparable performance However its not as huge of a price difference when you figure that a laptop and console add up to over 1k together if youre buying new And yeah if you need a laptop this aint it Very cool though Compared to small form factor office workstations for example great Or maybe as a shared device its not a server in other important ways but one of the things servers get vs desktops is more memory bandwidth and it does have that Also some people prefer a basic light laptop or tablet plus a real pc so maybe thatll be a few sales too,mgdawv0,9.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevl2dy,yearningforlearning7,,0,2025-02-26 12:49:24,,,,Im thinking light CAD applications and RPG Games would be pretty well suited but also Im taking this information from MyButtholeorg so let me know if Im wrong,mev6l7q,5.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevm8s1,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-02-26 12:57:10,,,,Well it seems like the performance is around that of a 4060 GPU which is certainly not bad but its definitely in the low end of the current generation of GPUs and that generation is only current for probably a few months more when the 5060 gpu is released by NVIDIA Its going to depend a lot on how expensive that GPU is and how interested people actually are in this sort of mini PC concept As for the games that can run probably most games as the 4060 is capable of running a vast majority of titles that have come out recently I just think that we rely a lot on upscaling for these lower end GPUs and if youre forced to use the basic FSR 3 upscaler from AMD over something like DLSS 4 from Nvidia youre going to have less visual fidelity than comparable NVIDIA powered PCs,mevl2dy,6.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevqiqm,yearningforlearning7,,1,2025-02-26 13:24:14,,,,Ok that makes a lot more sense I think So its on the middle or mildly competitive in current generation GPUs But considering were due for a new one the main question is its compatibility with software and how you run it Not going to be top of the line per se but if the functionality is there you can make it work I genuinely have a hard time understanding computers but this looks pretty neat,mevm8s1,7.0,1iyjucm
comment,meyo2w3,Hendlton,,-1,2025-02-26 21:51:50,,,,If it truly is as capable as a 4060 itll play basically anything released so far at descent settings and framerates Yeah it wont do 4k 60 FPS but its good enough for the vast majority of people One huge advantage is that you can apparently give it an insane amount of VRAM The iGPU allows for up to 110 GB of VRAM so itll be great for certain people EDIT It seems that the 4060 comparison is to a Mobile 4060 so nowhere near as powerful as I thought It can still play a lot of games though,mevqiqm,8.0,1iyjucm
comment,mezswm6,Jon_TWR,,1,2025-02-27 01:25:13,,,,Sure but based on the cards released so far the 5060 is unlikely to be more than 515 faster than the 4060 The upscaling is a very valid point though DLSS is miles better than FSR FSR and XESS are better than nothing thoughand will allow for what would be otherwise unplayable games to be playable,mevm8s1,7.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf0ujr0,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-02-27 05:16:37,,,,Especially if its stuck with the old FSR versus Nvidia new DLSS transformer model The new FSR though we havent really seen it in many games seems comparable to the old CNN model from Nvidia the perhaps slightly worse than the later iterations of that CNN model but the old FSR is just not good,mezswm6,8.0,1iyjucm
comment,mez2vfm,alman12345,,1,2025-02-26 23:04:00,,,,Frank Azor of AMD himself was contradictory on whether it could be ported back during an interview in early January and people skimmed a driver recently discovering that while some form of hardware upscaling may be possible on RX 7000RDNA 3 the upscaling used will be significantly less precise,mev62e3,3.0,1iyjucm

comment,mf2mlso,Bluedot55,,1,2025-02-27 14:17:24,,,,That said it has a pretty large dedicated npu on die right I wonder if that could be used in place or the typical AI accelerators that are built into the GPU,mev5xis,2.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevk7k8,Funksultan,,32,2025-02-26 12:43:41,,,,These tiny form factor PCs come out every few years They always tend to be victims of economies of scale Because they arent going to sell a lot of these they will have to have a comparably higher price tag so they dont lose money Id bet when these hit the market youll be able to buy a midrange gaming laptop with the same or better specs for LESS That includes a screen portability and some upgradability Its a shame I like these small form factors but unless they can bring them to market for 250 to undercut 2 gen old laptops they are gonna have to just be a very niche item,mev29as,1.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevlyou,MultiMarcus,,9,2025-02-26 12:55:22,,,,To be fair gaming laptops have their own issues particularly with thermals However if this mini PC can offer more upgradability and doesnt suffer from performance problems I can totally see it being a viable option This is especially true if you already have a decent screen My dad probably wouldnt be playing games above 60 FPS anyway so 60Hz is more than enough for him He also has a fairly nice 5K Mac Studio Display,mevk7k8,2.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevzup6,Funksultan,,6,2025-02-26 14:18:17,,,,Thats true but remember this mini factor is less upgradable than any common laptop The other point being if your dad isnt playing hardcore games the laptop thermals wont be an issue Its a shame I like these they just dont make sense at the historic price point,mevlyou,3.0,1iyjucm
comment,mexea97,ICC-u,,2,2025-02-26 18:22:54,,,,this mini factor is less upgradable than any common laptop Is it The Ram isnt upgradeable but it does have a PCIE slot Kinda surprised that Framework would make a machine with such low upgradability options though,mevzup6,4.0,1iyjucm

comment,mfyodr3,grumble11,,1,2025-03-04 14:15:46,,,,They want to sell it to the AI crowd since Strix Halo can allocate a ton of RAM to the GPU Its the cheapest option to do it right now It suffers from toolow memory bandwidth for the absolute best infererence but its great for a home AI toolkit,mey1r0w,7.0,1iyjucm

comment,mez8rj9,KidsSeeRainbows,,1,2025-02-26 23:35:40,,,,Honestly speaking I dont know I think so I think the special aspect of it is how nvidia worked to increase its speed I think combining that speed with the speed of the gpu cores gives it the speed necessary But thats exactly my question which is is this amd AI cpu going to be a valid choice I think it makes more sense for me to pay by the month to accomplish my projects now which will realistically be probably 6 months to a year and thatll tally up to about 175 dollars not including tax I think it makes sense for me to wait use the subscription models and wait until things mature Theres gotta be some crazy breakthrough in the next 5 years that makes running ai models a piece of cake Once we hit that point and its not a 2000 dollar pc maybe Ill consider it,mez85p5,5.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf0ebpv,leastlol,,2,2025-02-27 03:27:21,,,,Sure but you dont have 96GB on any consumer graphics cards and certainly not for that price The only thing comparable to it is mseries maxultra chips from Apple which is quite a bit more expensive though Im interested to see how these fare against an m4 max with 128gb of RAM You can parallelize the models so you can use the VRAM on multiple GPUs but you will still not get anywhere close to 96GB available VRAM for anything close to the price of one of these There is a performance penalty of using nvlink but Id expect 4x 4090s or 34X 5090s to easily outperform these when running large models locally but youre spending at least 10k on the GPUs alone,mez2nvj,4.0,1iyjucm
comment,mew0khq,gymbeaux5,,-5,2025-02-26 14:22:15,,,,I guess I dont understand the market People who cant or dont want to spend 4000 on GPUs dont want to train anything just want to run certain highVRAM LLMs and dont mind that inference speed is ass As long as the model fits in memory I dont think we have official memory bandwidth figures for this device but Im not optimistic To me this product from FrameworkAMD is a response to NVIDIAs Digits computer and both I suspect are an attempt to continue to capitalize on the AI hype as both are probably experiencing a slump in demand since you know demand for 5000 GPUs is finite This is the Apple equivalent of trying to peddle a Mac Mini with 8GB of RAM in 2023 Is it better than nothing I guess so Is it going to be a lousy experience Yes,mevmx6g,3.0,1iyjucm
comment,mex8mjq,ChrisSlicks,,7,2025-02-26 17:56:37,,,,The token rate on this is 2x faster than a 4090 if the model is such that it doesnt completely fit in the 4090 VRAM So if you are playing with 40GB models this is a very cost effective approach if you dont need breakneck speed Next best option is going to be a 48GB A6000 which is a 5K card until the Blackwell workstation GPUs release,mew0khq,4.0,1iyjucm
comment,mez92wm,gymbeaux5,,1,2025-02-26 23:37:23,,,,Yeah again it comes down to how fast the thing can actually inference Id rather not run an LLM at all than only get say 1 tokens I dont understand your first sentence Token rate is 2x faster than a 1500 4090 if the 4090 cant fit the model in its VRAM I mean yeah,mex8mjq,5.0,1iyjucm

comment,mewr3bj,Kiseido,,7,2025-02-26 16:34:52,,,,As far as I know the AI HX cpus come in up to quadchannel configurations which should put the bandwidth ballpark at around 166GBs at ddr55200 speeds up to around 200GBs at ddr56000 speeds Dual channel configurations would half that Typical high end GPUs these days have VRAM bandwidth between 500GBs and 17TBs So the bandwidth would be somewhere between 12x and 2x lower than on a high end card But also ddr ram is much lower latency than gddr vram and some workloads will benefit greatly from that reduced latency,mew0khq,4.0,1iyjucm
comment,mez8l5v,gymbeaux5,,1,2025-02-26 23:34:42,,,,Right its much slower than an RTX 3090 around 1TBs memory bandwidth Look I get it 1000 for a machine that can effectively run an LLM would be huge Its an 8GB Mac Mini You get what you pay for You cant get around paying the GPU tax if you want a realistic tokenss figure,mewr3bj,5.0,1iyjucm
comment,mewd1vh,gymbeaux5,,-4,2025-02-26 15:27:27,,,,Ill say too there are much cheaper ways to get 96GB of VRAM Older Quadro and Instinct cards from NVIDIA and AMD respectively will get you lots and lots of VRAM for if memory serves you can get 96GB for around half a grand They ride the line between old and still supported by libraries and drivers and obviously inference speed wouldnt be great either but youd also have the flexibility to train not sure what if any ROCm support is coming to this Framework AMD AI contraption,mevmx6g,3.0,1iyjucm

comment,mf109k7,im_thatoneguy,,1,2025-02-27 06:02:01,,,,What do expectations have to do with anything Once upon a time you didnt expect to need a fan and a heat sink was enough As of like yesterday you didnt expect to be able to buy a GPU with 128GB of ram for less than 50000 You wouldnt expect a CPU to have WiFi built in but cellphone SOCs packaged it all onto one chip Technology changes and in this instance there is a one less thing that is possible to separate from something else,mf0zg5l,9.0,1iyjucm
comment,mf10q17,mrheosuper,,1,2025-02-27 06:05:54,,,,If framework was like every other company like Asus msi gigabyte yeah they can pull this and i dont care because they were never claiming their mission is making device more userfriendly repairable and upgradeable My expectation is nothing unreasonable Make a device that has better repairability than competitor Not allowing changing ramgpu is the opposite of that,mf109k7,10.0,1iyjucm

comment,mevupxq,karlzhao314,,57,2025-02-26 13:49:10,,,,Frameworks CEO talked about this when he appeared on LTT apparently the very first thing he asked AMD about was whether they could make the RAM upgradeable AMD actually assigned an engineer to try to work with them and they still ended up coming to the conclusion that it was impossible Its entirely understandable too its a 256bit bus running at 8000 MTs The signaling requirements are astronomical Soldering is likely the only feasible way to make it work right now If this was an impossible thing to do for whatever reason they should have just scrapped the whole idea then That I dont agree with at all Right now there dont appear to be any other consumeroriented mini PCs with Strix Halo which there is definitely a market for Just because Framework is known for making repairable and upgradeable laptops doesnt mean they shouldnt capitalize on a new market that is slightly less repairable and upgradeable out of necessity And theyve still tried to make it as modular as they could with upgradeable storage ahem Mac Mini and also by even selling it as a bare ITX board for anyone to use in their own PC,mevl7ky,1.0,1iyjucm
comment,mevxxbh,Hazel-Rah,,17,2025-02-26 14:07:30,,,,Its entirely understandable too its a 256bit bus running at 8000 MTs The signaling requirements are astronomical Soldering is likely the only feasible way to make it work right now It sucks but I feel like socketed ram will start going away with DDR6 and 7 Theres just only so much you can do to manage signal quality at those speeds the shorter the distance the better and needing a socket pins pads and the geometry of the sticks theres only so far you can go Im guessing there will be some DDR6 motherboards with soldered ram marketed as premium gaming boards for maximum transfer speeds but I doubt DDR7 will even work with the current stick based form factor of ram Maybe a flat panel that plugs in on the back of the motherboard directly behind the CPU Soldered CPUs might also start showing up for the same reason,mevupxq,2.0,1iyjucm
comment,meyyvwg,Hendlton,,1,2025-02-26 22:43:39,,,,How heat sensitive is RAM I honestly wouldnt mind if they just left empty spots on the board and sold RAM chips by themselves so you can solder them on yourself As long as it can be done with a heat gun and doesnt require a board preheater thats totally doable,mevxxbh,3.0,1iyjucm

comment,mf1rnmo,Hendlton,,1,2025-02-27 10:32:39,,,,Think of it like modern cars Repairing your own car is niche these days but manufacturers still sell components Why wouldnt PC manufacturers do the same Yeah most people wont learn how to do it but itd be nice if you could take it to a service instead of being stuck with ewaste when you need an upgrade I have an old laptop that I use as an internet browsing machine and the only reason its still around is because I put more RAM in it Otherwise it would just be scrap Are computers like the one in the article still going to be usable in 10 years Well the answer is Probably But I still think about that when I buy electronics Im not someone who can afford to spend thousands of dollars ever 45 years,mez9kjp,5.0,1iyjucm
comment,mexn8su,OSRSgamerkid,,1,2025-02-26 19:04:08,,,,My statement on them scraping the idea of course is highly opinionated and just that my opinion So I wont repeat and spark a debate on that or anything slightly less repairable and upgradeable This however I think your usage of the words slightly less is a wild stretch respectfully of course Having not only the CPU soldered but the GPU AND RAM I mean you cant get much more unupgradable than that Comparing it to Apple is a bit unfair as far as this goes In my opinion obviously Would have been nice to see them go a more mainstream market approach with standard sockets and GPUs in this form factor Would have really sparked my interest at least especially if they let you pick and choose which components you wanted with the case itself Hopefully itll come in the future but clearly nonrepairable proprietary components is where the money is at based on the rest of the market and they are a business after all So I wont get my hopes up Lastly you got a link to that Linus video,mevupxq,2.0,1iyjucm
comment,mexr059,karlzhao314,,7,2025-02-26 19:21:35,,,,This however I think your usage of the words slightly less is a wild stretch respectfully of course I dont agree Most of Frameworks other products namely their laptop mainboards already have soldered CPUs and GPUs because well thats the package that laptop CPUs and GPUs already come in All things considered I dont consider soldering the RAM as well to be a major departure from the level of upgradeability of their other products If the point of comparison was other fullsized desktops with standard socketed CPUs then sure the Framework desktop is much less upgradeable But if that level of modularity is your requirement then you wouldnt be looking at a Framework in the first place regardless of whether its a laptop or a desktop Would have been nice to see them go a more mainstream market approach with standard sockets and GPUs in this form factor Would have really sparked my interest at least especially if they let you pick and choose which components you wanted with the case itself I dont see how theyd set themselves apart from any of the dozen ITX motherboard makers already on the market and they dont have the scale to be pricecompetitive Im going to sound like a broken record here but the thing that it seems like a lot of people fail to understand not saying you specifically of course just in general is that this Framework desktop is not notable simply because Framework is making a desktop Its notable because its based on Strix Halo If you go back to all the various threads regarding product launches of Strix Halo handhelds and laptops theyre filled with people asking for it to be in a mini PC Thats the market Framework is choosing to capitalize on not simply general use office or gaming PCs That SOC does not and most likely cannot exist in anything except soldered BGA form with soldered RAM As a result if Framework wants to cater to the Strix Halo mini PC niche market then modularity is by necessity going to be more limited than ordinary desktops which Im pretty sure most of the prospective customers in that market understand If Strix Halo didnt exist Framework almost certainly would not have entered the desktop market either Lastly you got a link to that Linus video Sure here you go My Framework Investment Should NOT Have Worked Out The part where they discuss upgradeable RAM starts at 725,mexn8su,3.0,1iyjucm
