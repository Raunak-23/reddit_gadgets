comment,lvx370h,TwofacedDisc,,61,2024-11-07 16:25:21,,,,For example the average score for the Ryzen 9 7950X3D on Factoriobox is lower than that of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D while the 5800X3D handily outperforms the 7800X3D suggesting that this particular benchmark may not be the most accurate indicator of CPU performance Nothingburger,,0.0,1glscy4
comment,lw16bj5,danielv123,,4,2024-11-08 05:13:56,,,,Eh factoriobox is pretty good The issue is that the article writer choose the stevetrov 10k benchmark which has only been ran 1k times 2 of which on the 5800x3d In factorio there are massive differences with memory and cache performance One of the tricks to get the most out of your CPU is running under Linux with hugepages enabled notice that a lot of the fastest individual runs are on linux The benchmark is now also mixes results from 11 and 20 if you dont filter out old results which has big differences in terms of performance optimizations And it sadly doesnt list memory timings or speeds the listed memory kit on the runs is just based on the model number not what the kit is actually running at In general one has to be careful trusting benchmarks from strangers You never know what else they were doing on their system at the same time One of the advantages of factoriobox is that it is very reproducible when running locally As well as the fact that it obviously doesnt measure performance for anything but factorio Its not relevant at all for anything else,lvx370h,1.0,1glscy4

comment,lvzr283,half3clipse,,10,2024-11-08 00:10:10,,,,The 7950X3D was very slightly better than the 7800X3D and could out perform when doing things like streaming as well The core parking is a result of your OS and driver working together and in windows the OS is perfectly capable of waking the parked cores to handle non game threads if theres enough load on the vcache CCD That will always be better than running everything on the one CCD Especially since the vcache CCD on the 9950 should have a slighly higher clock speed out of the box than on the 9800 Which means the 9950 should also be slightly better for gaming but without a good non gaming reason to buy it the 9800 should perform basically the same for cheaper And without the potential headache of cores not parking correctly,lvxsqdu,1.0,1glscy4

comment,lw8mkc6,Pyr0blad3,,1,2024-11-09 12:27:15,,,,if you can use the technology from amd to diable the CCD without 3d cache i dont see why the 9950x3d should not at least be on par with the 9800x3d in gaming,lvxsqdu,1.0,1glscy4
comment,lw9c07y,Xendrus,,3,2024-11-09 15:19:23,,,,You could do this with the 7950x3d and it would be on par with the 7800x3d Im just now getting into AMD cuz of how badly Intel has shit the bed the last 3 gens and Im still using 9th gen intel dont know much,lw8mkc6,2.0,1glscy4
comment,lw9c7uf,Pyr0blad3,,1,2024-11-09 15:20:37,,,,I am not quite aware if this technologie is useable for the 7950x3d or not It would need a bios update at least i think,lw9c07y,3.0,1glscy4
comment,lvzjuom,soulsoda,,-3,2024-11-07 23:30:11,,,,On default probably If youre willing to finagle it you can probably get identical or slightly better performance than a 9800X3d by disabling half of the L3 cache on the 9950X3d Itd behave like a 9800x3d but itd have an additional 8 cores the 950X3D was always slower because windows scheduler doesnt do a perfect job of using the right corescache and it wastes time to communicate across For those wanting an ELI5 Its like having two identical towers and your operating system accidentally sent info to the wrong towereven when it was told not to but that tower processes info anyways just as well Then that tower needs to communicate with the other tower to be sure and then its good to go rather if it was processed in the correct tower it wouldnt need to check it just goes Hence 800X3d tends to do better in most games If you turn off a tower completely though windows wont accidentally send the data to the wrong tower but you still have extra infrastructure of roadscores meaning you could see improvement in the X950x3d since its basically a x800x3d now For the discerning buyer while the 9800x3d is better than the 7800x3d its overkill in many ways Were basically approaching the limits of gains from CPUs for gaming Yes you can get an extra 50100 frames in 1080p low gaming Except you need a monitor that can handle that jump from 500600fps If you actually play on 2k4k ultra settings like a normal person though youre going to get like 13fps gains Like sure the 9800x3d or 9950x3d is the next king but if you can get a 7800x3d or 7950x3d with mobo for cheap youre not missing out The real gains of upgrading from a lets say a 7800x3d to the 9800x3d is more about what zen 4 architecture supports vs zen 5 architecture Ie PCIE 50 lanes and higher supported ram speeds Faster Ram will get you more gains in the FPS department than a CPU swap most likely,lvxsqdu,1.0,1glscy4

comment,lw1t3oc,The8Darkness,,0,2024-11-08 08:44:33,,,,Why would you replace the motherboard and ram especially when the new motherboards are almost carbon copies of the old they literally have the exactly same featureset at the same or even higher price points x600 vs x800 and ram doesnt benefit from going above 62006600 depending on what the cpu imc can handle If you manage to get the 9800x3d for a decent price chances are you can upgrade a 7800x3d almost for free with current used pricing,lvzzniu,4.0,1glscy4

comment,lvzjjqv,Shoelebubba,,1,2024-11-07 23:28:30,,,,I got lucky and got a deal when they launched It was 400 with a kit of 32gb DDR5 RAM Sounds like a lot but around the launch of AM5 DDR5 still a premium price even for the DDR55600 kits Nowadays you can get 32gb for like 99 but iirc during that launch date that kit was like 160 If I remember right there was also a discount if you bought a X670670E board just dont remember the amount,lvy1rts,3.0,1glscy4

comment,lvwo264,definite_mayb,,28,2024-11-07 15:10:07,,,,As someone who upgraded from 1700 to 3600 to 5800x3d I highly recommend looking into a 5700x3d even if you are happy now It seriously makes gaming so much smoother in 1 lows I have no desire to upgrade from 5800x3d to 9800x3d at 4k,lvwmz47,1.0,1glscy4

comment,lvy5k7y,Terkey,,11,2024-11-07 19:24:40,,,,5800x3d is 510 better performance but not manufactured anymore so 5700x3d is 100 cheaper,lvxrgop,3.0,1glscy4

comment,lvx7j6n,NoTearsOnlyLeakyEyes,,5,2024-11-07 16:46:04,,,,As others have said a 5000 series cpu is a huge upgrade Theyre incredibly cheap right now and you can keep all your other hardware I also had a 3600x It was a night and day difference when I upgraded to the 5600x The 1 lows are sooooo much higher in games like cyberpunk It ran objectively smoother on my RTX 3070 1440p,lvwmz47,1.0,1glscy4

comment,lvwssq4,douillee,,9,2024-11-07 15:33:51,,,,Just upgrade for a 3D cache am4 processor and wait for am6 The money you saved in not buying a motherboard and ram will be better spent on a GPU,lvwnzra,2.0,1glscy4
comment,lvx37jk,NightFuryToni,,6,2024-11-07 16:25:25,,,,Dont know why you got downvoted but youre right Thats exactly what I did went 3700X to 5700X3D with a new GPU The machines flying even when the GPU is bottlenecked to PCIE 30,lvwssq4,3.0,1glscy4

comment,lvx6mvy,douillee,,4,2024-11-07 16:41:50,,,,if AMD keeps the same pattern probably after 3 gens of am5 procs so 2 more gens But I dont see an AM4 X3D being a bottleneck for games in the next 4 years while the GPU gains should be a lot more over the same period depending on how the GPU industry evolves sadly seeing the current trends,lvx4u9n,4.0,1glscy4
comment,lvwrcxr,im_brooh,,0,2024-11-07 15:26:44,,,,I had one and had no issues in gaming scenarios only upgraded to 5950x for the additional cores for workrelated stuff but its still overkill for everything else i do not sure if changing mobo is worth it yet,lvwnzra,2.0,1glscy4
comment,lvwzbdj,SteveThePurpleCat,,-5,2024-11-07 16:06:30,,,,Honestly unless you are doing specific productivity tasks or have a bit of big numbers addiction not judging I was there spent months on 3dmark 06 with my E6600 most CPU upgrades are a waste of time My 7600K from 2017 is only now becoming a bit of a bottleneck in some games might have to overclock it a bit soon I have been watching reviews of the new fx chip oh wow it can do 600fps when the previous model could only manage 580fps Really Thats supposed to inspire me on a new build Nah That 3600 could have 5 years in it yet,lvwmz47,1.0,1glscy4
comment,lvx0mhg,innociv,,4,2024-11-07 16:12:55,,,,A 5600 is over 2x the performance of the 7600k and half the power consumption Pretty good upgrade,lvwzbdj,2.0,1glscy4
comment,lvx02mg,MessiahPrinny,,5,2024-11-07 16:10:13,,,,Games nowadays are getting more CPU heavy A game like Space Marine 2 will beat the hell out of 3600 Which is why consoles have trouble hitting 60 even at a higher resolution,lvwzbdj,2.0,1glscy4

comment,lw05dl9,Fredasa,,2,2024-11-08 01:30:22,,,,The issues it can engender are specifically the sort of thing that drive me up the wall and the real problem is that 99 of folks even in a gamingspecific audience simply dont pick up on the drawbacks so its the kind of thing that falls through the cracks You wont find here is where scheduling issues screwed with our 1 lows in a 30 minute benchmark video especially today when no mainstream PC review entity is going to want to be the guy who finds something to nitpick about AMD,lvzrhrs,2.0,1glscy4
comment,lw06vga,AimlessWanderer,,2,2024-11-08 01:38:35,,,,ive had a 7950x and currently have a 7950x3d so i know of the issues and there were a lot of talk about them in forums and on youtube i for one am really looking forward to both ccds being the same and have equal vcache im really curious if the ccds will be equal in quality too because my first few 7950xs were wildly different from ccd0ccd1,lw05dl9,3.0,1glscy4
comment,lw0eg4k,Fredasa,,3,2024-11-08 02:21:07,,,,Im with you on that yeah I hope somebody takes the time to concretely benchmark the past issues the alleged fixes and how the new chip fares in that regard Resources for those of us who are shall we say sensitive to theoretically subtle drawbacks are extremely rare Ill point to TVs as an example Samsung are somewhat infamous for instituting nondefeatable characteristics into their TVs designed to trick the vast majority of people even if it simultaneously ruins the entire package for the 1 who notices whats going on QLEDs all use dithering and global dimming which essentially cannot be defeated even in the service menu To me those are basically dealbreakers but I guarantee you almost nobody is even aware Thats why I just cant buy simple or theoretical assurances that known issues in prosumer hardware are going to be solved when those issues clearly never were big enough to ruffle too many feathers and actually ding sales,lw06vga,4.0,1glscy4

comment,lw1i7ku,wayniceguy,,-1,2024-11-08 06:53:50,,,,Im amazed at the lack of understanding of tariffs here and the rest of the world We suffer from crippling tariffs on many US made products that are exported yet we let that same product come into US for free This has cost the US in terms of jobs moving to some of those countries Harley couldnt sell their bikes in India by Indian law They agreed to change the law in exchange for opening the Mango market here Once they changed the law India charged Harley a 150 tariff This caused Harley to assemble bikes in India thus depriving Harley workers in the US of those jobs All of this time we allow Indian made motorcycles into the US for zero duty The PM of India cut their tariff by 50 just because Trump told them that turnabout is fair play How is any of the tariffs we pay to sell in other countries while their countries product can come to the US for free What blows me away is wondering how we got here in the first place We may pay a bit more for certain things but were not exporting as many jobs Strategic tariffs are a good thing Free trade is a buzz word that has no real world applications,,0.0,1glscy4
