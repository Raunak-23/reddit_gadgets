comment,lwtz45i,SirWhatsalot,,2,2024-11-12 23:39:42,,,,Something something history repeats itself Something something beta format Sony bungled the beta format hard aside from the PlayStation which they almost bugled but it came around Sony seems a bit Obtuously rigid consistently to their detriment Edit Im in a mood right now so there will be tons of counter example like the Walkman but they eventually bungled that huge lead due to rigidness,,0.0,1go9zlb

comment,lwjdsxc,None,,22,2024-11-11 05:22:48,,,,So the drone is discontinued 5 days ago a review site that had previously reviewed the drone reruns that review more or less with new commentary and a title implying this is why it failed and you think that is click bait,lwj1w11,3.0,1go9zlb
