comment,mmpije7,MargielaFella,,1291,2025-04-12 09:43:39,,,,The industry jumped the gun with 8K Even to this day theres so few use cases for it on the consumer level And the cost is too high,,0.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpjuub,drmirage809,,780,2025-04-12 09:57:29,,,,Indeed 4K is already pretty much perfect doubly so at the distance most people sit from their TV Theres no real added value in adding in even more pixels Id rather have TV manufacturers focus on perfecting colour accuracy HDR viewing experience minimising OLED burn in All those things sound a lot more useful in a TV if somewhat harder to market than bigger number is more better,mmpije7,1.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpkc36,MargielaFella,,434,2025-04-12 10:02:29,,,,And lets get to a point where consoles and PCs can even output at 4K natively without upscaling before we introduce yet another resolution,mmpjuub,2.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmplfhq,drmirage809,,170,2025-04-12 10:13:57,,,,I personally doubt thats going to happen anytime soon GPU manufactures are all pushing machine learning based upscaling systems pretty hard And theyve gotten quite good at it And when theres next to no visual difference between 4K and IDK 1440p upscaled to 4K then why bother with putting in all that brute force to render native 4K Because that seems to be the line of thinking over at Nvidia and AMD mostly,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmplw0x,MargielaFella,,82,2025-04-12 10:18:36,,,,I use DLSS personally and agree with this philosophy But there will come a time when we can push 4K natively with lower end hardware Maybe thats when 8K will make sense lol upscaled from 4K,mmplfhq,4.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpsd9h,drmirage809,,39,2025-04-12 11:19:56,,,,DLSS is utter black magic Its incredibly how clear and clean that image is Ive knocked it all the way down to the ultra performance setting in God of War Ragnarok just to see how well it would do in the absolute worst case scenario And while the image got noticeably softer it still looked quite good,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqjzqp,OramaBuffin,,18,2025-04-12 14:25:09,,,,Biggest thing to look for for me is distant objects to see the difference Maybe its improved since 20 but when I have DLSS on which I do I love it one thing that jumps out is trees in the far distance stop shimmering in the wind The movement is so small and murky between leaves that even quality upscaling just deletes it entirely,mmpsd9h,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqkh77,PuppetPal_Clem,,29,2025-04-12 14:27:53,,,,30 and 40 have each been massive generational leaps ahead of the previous versions of DLSS so yes things have improved significantly since 20,mmqjzqp,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqm72t,drmirage809,,8,2025-04-12 14:37:31,,,,I dont think Ive ever played a game that still uses the 20 version of the upscaling model as my GPU in those times wasnt able to use it I have used AMDs FSR tech through the years though and Ive seen that have a noticeable amount of shimmering and afterimages Although how bad it was depended on the game Ive only recently gotten my hands on a GPU that can do DLSS and have been using the overwrite tool in the Nvidia app to force games to use the more recent versions of the model wherever possible The newest model 40 or preset K is absolutely incredible at maintaining detail and image stability though You can use the app to force whatever model you like so maybe Ill knock it down to preset A just to see how far things have come,mmqjzqp,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmr6tq8,andizzzzi,,2,2025-04-12 16:26:54,,,,I was updating games DLSS files today for a friend and yeh I havnt seen 20 in quite a while I can understand why people were not easily impressed but the latest plugins are great and have been for a while,mmqm72t,8.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mn211ql,Thog78,,1,2025-04-14 13:11:46,,,,Can we run the latest DLSS on a 3060ti with the trick youre talking about I never saw this option in the nvidia control panel is it hard to find,mmqm72t,8.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mn26n9f,drmirage809,,2,2025-04-14 13:45:07,,,,Should be possible Its just not in the old Nvidia control panel Its a feature thats in the newer Nvidia app The one that replaced GeForce Experience That app has a list of games and allows you to configure stuff in there including DLSS when supported,mn211ql,9.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmprlgc,adzy2k6,,14,2025-04-12 11:13:11,,,,The human eye cant really pick up the difference between 8k and 4k unless it sit stupidly close to a very large screen,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqydw2,stellvia2016,,9,2025-04-12 15:42:58,,,,Seeing the 8K demo content at the store I could definitely see a difference but is it worth a several thousand dollar price difference Absolutely not Especially since that content will be so few and far between,mmprlgc,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmrsyf9,angusalba,,6,2025-04-12 18:20:12,,,,Its about angular resolution and a direct relationship between pixel size and distance 1 arcmin per pixel is 2020 vision and the reality is most people dont have that good vision anyway For a typical desktop screen size and distance 8K is wasted and the same for many 4k larger TVs Better to concentrate on higher frame rates global shuttering etc to remove motion artifacts,mmqydw2,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmsnyz2,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-12 21:12:32,,,,Even with 1 arcmin it is above 4k at thx recommended viweing angle and we can se down to about 01 with the right material not even counting moving pictures That being said I agree that it at the moment perhaps is the least important thing to focus on,mmrsyf9,8.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmt4p10,angusalba,,2,2025-04-12 22:53:01,,,,THXs recommendations are the visual version of audiophile claims purist nonsense that does not apply to most situations The percentage of screens worldwide mounted at the THX distance is ludicrously small and is closer to what a typical PC screen is at than any realistic TV situation with an attach rate to justify not just the 8K screen tech but all the support environment as well even 4k is more often than not compression and upscaling to not overburden the backend There is a reason VR systems throw foviated rendering and all sorts of things when it comes to high resolution while power is a huge part of that driving an 8K screen at the distance they suggest is throwing 90 of the resolution away because you only see the resolution in the center,mmsnyz2,9.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmt898x,flac_rules,,0,2025-04-12 23:15:17,,,,40 degrees of viewing angle isnt purist nonsenseit is pretty reasonable,mmt4p10,10.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmuegou,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 04:00:32,,,,You are missing what I am saying that might be the purist viewing angle but its nothing like whats really in any standard house and typically only works for a SINGLE PERSON per screen There is a reason screens start being curved because if you start really getting into 8K and getting anything like full use of the resolution the change in focal length to the edges of the screen at the THX optimal position causes eye strain just by itself and thats before as I said you are not actually using that resolution very VERY few people are sitting anything like close enough to a standard TV screen in the vast majority of houses to be at eye limit for resolution Full disclosure I have been involved in display tech and ARVRMR for the last 2 decades and am very familiar with human factors and vision,mmt898x,11.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmv057z,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 07:14:10,,,,This isnt some crazy number that nobody has you can easily get that with a 75 or 85 inch tv at normal distance And especially with a projector If you are very familiar with human vision you should now that with the right material human vision can see well below 1 arcmin I am not saying 8k tvs is a good choice at the moment just that it is not above the limit of human vision And frankly people should be a bit careful claiming it it has been wrongly claimed for decades now People said it with 1080p with 4k and with above 60hz it was even claimed with above 24 fps,mmuegou,12.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwhee6,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 14:40:34,,,,Again you show you dont know how human vision actually works 8K on any screen does little good if you can not realize the resolution and in the vast majority of devices and how they are used it is absolutely pointless In addition with current resolutions higher frame rates and higher brightness with global shutter and other techniques you would see a far greater impact to image quality delivery along with better rendering technology all of which vastly increases the power and data processing requirements Irrespective 8K out of any context requires 4x the data rate and would over deliver resolution And yes people some very much not all can see better that 2020 which is the 1 arcmin value but for most situations and with some regard for all the content its data footprint the ability to send it without compression artifacts not waste lots of power and lastly be on a screen that someone is actually at the right point to see without the eye strain from shifting focal points from a large screen at an angle not surged and lastly not throw everything currently in place out AGAIN There is a lot of the mechanics I really dont think you get especially after that 60pixel nonsense,mmv057z,13.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwm2te,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 15:05:10,,,,40 degrees is a recommended viewing angle it is not crazy unreasonable in any way and at that viewing angle depending on material we can see more than 6k these are the facts Nobody claimed other improvements wouldnt matter more in fact i have stated so myself several times You adding in all sorts of other reasons is telling i at no point said it was worth it or anything like that I just stated which is a fact that we can see better resolution than 1 minute of arc with the right material which is a fact and even at 1 arcminute 4k isnt enough at 40 degrees viewing angle which is also a fact,mmwhee6,14.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwousk,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 15:19:44,,,,Again the angle is NOT the driving factor what is your fascination for the number 40 where is that coming from 40 deg for a 6k screen without describing the pixel size which informs the screen size AND the distance from the screen is meaningless Its about ANGULAR resolution that informs your ability to see and thats the angle to the PIXEL not the screen,mmwm2te,15.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwpugz,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 15:25:01,,,,There are recommendations of viewing angle because despite what you are trying to claim the size of the display in our field of vision matters to people People dont buy bigger displays just to throw away money No it isnt meaningless if you actually now anything about this you should now it isnt Viewing angle number of pixels gives us what we need and gives a more general solution,mmwousk,16.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwtpzn,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 15:45:25,,,,Again no that is not how it works and I am done trying to help you understand,mmwpugz,17.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx6std,flac_rules,,0,2025-04-13 16:53:35,,,,So tell me then why do you belive people buy larger TVs,mmwtpzn,18.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx740w,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 16:55:09,,,,Ego with no understanding of how resolution works Just stop,mmx6std,19.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx7gb0,flac_rules,,0,2025-04-13 16:56:52,,,,You think people buy bigger TVs because they dont understand how resolution works They belive a 65 inch 4k TV has a higher resolution than a 55 inch 4K TV and that is why they buy it,mmx740w,20.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmxupwd,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 18:56:48,,,,You would be surprised how many people do exactly that and its all about bigger is better for bragging rights and then sitting too close or too far from that big screen You are doing similar with repeating 40 deg which is 2010 I am out you do you,mmx7gb0,21.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmyif6j,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 21:04:05,,,,Sure you stick with that people dont buy bigger TVs because they like more of the field of vision to be covered the buy it because the resolution increases,mmxupwd,22.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmuj6b8,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 04:37:15,,,,Oh and by the way its not 40deg The optimal viewing angle is not a fixed number Its primarily driven by the size of the pixels so that the 1 arc min per pixel condition is met More pixels at the same pixel size will mean a larger angle but not a change in optimal distance Thats why the optimal distance in the link I provided related to resolution to give the approx distance based on screen size since the primary driver is the pixel,mmt898x,11.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmv0k3k,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 07:18:25,,,,That is a backwards way of looking at it especially in the context of resolution needed for a TV With that logic we wouldnt need any more than 60 pixels we can just sit at a 1 degree angle It is obviously better to make the tv fit our needs than to fit ourselves to the TV,mmuj6b8,12.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwfm9i,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 14:30:49,,,,And with that flippant comment you clearly do no understand the mechanics behind how vision works I am not saying 60 pixels what on earth are you talking about but that it has NOTHING to do with the angle described by the screen without direct reference to both the pixel size AND the distance to the screen,mmv0k3k,13.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwmf8i,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 15:06:59,,,,You argue in your comment as if we should choose the viewing angle based in the pixels it is the other way around we choose the resolution on what viewing angle fits us the best,mmwfm9i,14.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwo4nm,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 15:15:58,,,,No just no resolution has increased due to technology improvements not because of some arbitrary angle wish did you bother to look at rhe THX link Again ANGLE is the RESULT of the pixel size and pixel count to inform the distance from the screen to meet 2020 resolution,mmwmf8i,15.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwozpr,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 15:20:28,,,,Do you think we make bigger more high resolution TVs for fun It is because it moves us towards the viewing angle we prefer when we reach it increases will taper off as they have in computer monitor sizes for instance Your logic is backwards we try to make displays to fit us not the other way around With your logic we are back to the 1 degree viewing angle again,mmwo4nm,16.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmwtk39,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 15:44:33,,,,ONE 1 ARC MINUTE PER PIXEL move too close and you start to see the gaps between the pixels to far and you start to merge pixels We are done you just dont get this is how your vision ACTUALLY works,mmwozpr,17.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx6p2j,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 16:53:05,,,,That is not the limit of human vision and even if it was it is not enough for a 40 degree viewing angle the THX recommendation despite what you are trying to claim people actually but bigger TVs for a reason,mmwtk39,18.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx6z50,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 16:54:28,,,,Just stop,mmx6p2j,19.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmx74yx,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 16:55:17,,,,No I wont you are posting misinformation and people might read it and belive it,mmx6z50,20.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmxtt5f,angusalba,,1,2025-04-13 18:51:57,,,,Again I ask for your source that 40 degrees is the right angle and you keep not doing so Many people buy big screens and dont sit at the optimal DISTANCE and there is MUCH more to it that some arbitrary number you keep stating with not context I dont know how many more times I can tell you that the optimal viewing position is derived from the size of the pixels which is what drives the screen size and which informs an angle at the pixel level the angle the screen makes is entirely a function of the pixel angle multiplied by the horizontal resolution 1 arc min per pixel is 60pixels per degree so 2020 vision is 64 degrees for 3860 pixels at 40 deg you are pushing 2010 which is well beyond 2020 which is the norm for human vision and only 35 of people have without correction and at 40 most people are not seeing the full resolution they physically cant But yeah I dont know what I am talking about I am starting think you see screen size as some sort of bragging right or to justify how much you spent on the screen Your argument is the same as boasting about high frequency audio sound systems that almost anyone older than 30 no longer hears I am well and truly over you not understanding this and replying with near ad hominem rather than providing any math or citation to back up your point,mmx74yx,21.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmyjst3,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-13 21:11:43,,,,I have given the source several times you even commented it yourself it is the THX recommended viewing angle You can tell me as many times you want that is not how people choose a TV size and it is a stupid way to choose it TV size actually matter to people despite your claims Check things like vernier acuity and if you want to test yourself look at this test You can easily see aliasing at distance were a pixel is well below 1 minute of arc,mmxtt5f,22.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmr9qjh,adzy2k6,,5,2025-04-12 16:42:10,,,,It depends on how close you are to the screen and how large it is And probably never at the typical distance accross a room,mmqydw2,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqaexm,speculatrix,,10,2025-04-12 13:30:11,,,,In most situations people wont be able to even see 4k perhaps not even 1080p If you look at the data rate for Netflix UHD video its obviously inadequate to give a proper UHD experience When I watch a UHD Bluray its vastly better than any UHD streaming service a Bluray can have a bit rate 6 or more times that provided by Netflix,mmprlgc,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqkbw2,OramaBuffin,,19,2025-04-12 14:27:03,,,,On a TV sitting at a large distance maybe but on a PC monitor the pixels in 1080p are pretty noticeable Unless the screen is only like 20inches or smaller,mmqaexm,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqkn4r,speculatrix,,8,2025-04-12 14:28:50,,,,Yes I have a 4k 28 monitor and I cant see the pixels I also have a 24 1080p one and the pixels are readily visible,mmqkbw2,8.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmsnbcv,flac_rules,,1,2025-04-12 21:08:45,,,,In general thats is not true but there are less situations where we se the difference when you start at 4k and it surely is not worth it now,mmprlgc,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmrb5vr,gramathy,,1,2025-04-12 16:49:32,,,,I like using AI as a replacement for antialiasing since traditional AA tech is relatively expensive but I dont like actual upscaling as there are some things it isnt great at though its gotten better at the worst of it and I outright refuse to use frame generation,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmrl4ai,Alchion,,1,2025-04-12 17:39:27,,,,dumb question but can a new graphics card render at 1080 and upscale to 1440 or is it to 4k only,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mms3svk,Emu1981,,1,2025-04-12 19:20:12,,,,Maybe thats when 8K will make sense lol The problem with 8K is that 4K provides enough pixel density to make it so that someone with 2020 vision cannot make out any pixels at a comfortable viewing distance for a given size of screen Hell I have a 48 4K OLED that I sit 2ft from and I have to lean in to distinguish individual pixels in this white text but my eye sight isnt exactly perfect,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmr4rbv,TaylorMonkey,,0,2025-04-12 16:16:03,,,,But if you can push 4K natively why not spend it on even more realistic or compelling lighting and effects as opposed to a tiny bit more sharpness or knowing its native if you cant really tell but you can more easily tell the actual improvements to shading and scene complexity But I know there are people who prefer native sharpness over everything because they think thats how video games should look but then claim they cant see the difference between better effects and lighting when thats the most obvious thing in terms of actually different color and light values when you compare images back to back,mmplw0x,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmsb3mh,MargielaFella,,1,2025-04-12 20:00:42,,,,Youre taking my point too literally Its not a matter of if we should its if we can I agree with your point but I was never suggesting otherwise,mmr4rbv,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmrfcxv,ChrisFromIT,,6,2025-04-12 17:10:43,,,,1440p upscaled to 4K then why bother with putting in all that brute force to render native 4K Because with that extra brute force with upscaling you can do more computationally hard rendering techniques And that was why upscaling was design to do anyways Upscaling was done on consoles before DLSS or FSR was around for upscaling Just those techniques didnt have as good of quality so the ratio between render resolution to render output wouldnt be as huge as DLSS or FSRs ratios For example checkerboarding upscaling was used in BF1 on consoles for 4k I believe the input render resolution was 1900p upscaled to 2160p,mmplfhq,4.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmv32ln,Knut79,,1,2025-04-13 07:44:27,,,,Its the inverse square law that also applies here The higher the resolution the power requirement for rendering is exponentially higher,mmplfhq,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmud5a3,MargielaFella,,1,2025-04-13 03:50:23,,,,I should clarify I mean standardized 4090 represents a very small portion of the GPU market Native 4K is not ubiquitous in PC gaming atm When low and mid level cards can push it at reasonable frame rates then it will be,mmuc6vc,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mn4b4a7,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 20:11:01,,,,Im going to answer your second question first To answer your first question its in the top 94 of 3D Mark results All I did was splurge after a windfall and buy everything top shelf Was about 4k when everything was all said and done Wont be spending like that again for at least another 56 years I treat it like buying a used car My current build These parts were all offtheshelf and imminently available to anyone willing to buy them The tech is there has been there if thats your spending priority Just because your spending priorities were elsewhere doesnt mean its not available at mass market,mn3wgm8,7.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mn4gts3,MargielaFella,,0,2025-04-14 20:39:48,,,,I didnt say mass market I said mass adoption The most common GPU on Steam is the 4060 It doesnt matter that enthusiasts have been able to do this for 5 years or even 10 years My point is that it isnt ubiquitous,mn4b4a7,8.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mn4i7kc,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 20:46:48,,,,the 4060 does 4k just fine does every setting get maxed No However thats a card thats more than sufficient for 4k 60 and per the Steam System Survey its the most ubiquitous gifgiphy1267Co3vPNBqQU,mn4gts3,9.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmqcuha,soulsoda,,4,2025-04-12 13:44:49,,,,Technically were there for a price You can get 30 fps natively on cyberpunk with full ray tracing 4k with a 5090 I disagree on the need to forgo upscaling Its usually a significantly better gaming experience overall especially on the more modern cards as its been fine tuned In some cases dlss quality looks better than native rendering Itll also continue to get better every generation Id rather upscale and game at 4k 240hz with dlss quality and sharpness cranked up and 0 dsc than native 4k at 30hz,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmzngq1,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 01:09:49,,,,Ray tracing doesnt have anything to do with internal render resolution Many PC games usually have a setting for that and the one youre erroneously referring to is actually frame generation and frame scaling such as DLSS,mmtmspn,5.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mn1qr7t,dwiedenau2,,0,2025-04-14 12:03:37,,,,It is mandatory if you are forced to use ray tracing and want to run at 4k And this will not change again in the future You are not running 4k raytracing at high fps without dlss This time is over no matter how much you spend,mn1mask,8.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mn1sete,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 12:15:24,,,,Explain to me how this works because I have plenty of games from the last 3 years Not a single one of them requires that DLSS frame generation or resolution scaling enabled to enable Raytracing What is forcing those things to be in use Also what about AMD users whos systems dont support DLSS since thats an Nvidia specific framework,mn1qr7t,9.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmrlgt4,leastlol,,2,2025-04-12 17:41:13,,,,Theres more to PCs than just video games An 8k display at 40 inches would be ideal for me I think Thatd be 220 PPI and around 120 PPD at 28 inches away from the display For Windows probably a bit overkill since it does scaling more sensibly but for MacOS youd want to hit that 220ppi to avoid fractional scaling For context I use a 4k 42 inch OLED TV as a display currently Thats 105PPI and 58PPD at 28 inches away and I view it from as close as 24 inches At Native resolution the UI looks alright but pixels are very plainly visible I actually scale it to around 3200x1800 which allows for HiDPI mode to be active on MacOS with BetterDisplay which renders it at double the resolution and scales down to fit 4k Its sharper but not as sharp as it could be if it were a 2x scaling Other advantages it has over 6k or 5k displays made for MacOS is that it 4k and 1080p content have integer scaling when viewed at full screen I also kind of wonder if an 8k 77 inch display viewed from normal tv viewing distances would make for a good display In any case 4k is certainly large enough for most content people are consuming like video games and tv shows and the 160ish PPI of some of these 27 inch displays is more than sharp enough with Windows scaling modes but that doesnt suit my wants andor needs,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmsi6yh,mjtwelve,,1,2025-04-12 20:40:06,,,,They developed 8k displays before they even developed an interface spec that would allow us to send that much data to the display in question at speeds higher than a slide show much less graphics cards that could create those frames,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmzo8ii,Malefectra,,2,2025-04-14 01:14:49,,,,You realize that upscaling has been the norm on console since the sixth generation of consoles in 1999 before basic 720p or 1080p HD was the OverTheAir TV resolution standard right Hell the Nintendo 64 made extensive use of it because 3D used to be so processing intensive,mmsu30r,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mn01ots,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 02:44:15,,,,Nah its still largely the same thing Rendering frames at a much smaller internal resolution than the displayed resolution with an algorithm filling in the details The only major difference is marketing and tailoring a small portion of the GPU die for that compute load Systems have never been more common and thus easier to optimize for but the optimization problem really comes down to management decisions AKA executive meddling not developers themselves,mmzug6j,6.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mn4cph3,Malefectra,,1,2025-04-14 20:18:55,,,,That sounds like you have a shitty display that uses one of the old Motion 120 or equivalent feature and you never bothered to turn it off because that would require picking up a manual reading a screen or otherwise learning how to operate your systems and attached devices correctly,mn31of8,10.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpo3tz,alvenestthol,,-9,2025-04-12 10:41:01,,,,4K is mainly for video which anything with a 4K videoout can natively output games targeting that resolution withwithout upscaling is just a side effect And there will always be games that choose to target more intense graphical effects over maintaining native 4K,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpnhg5,newhereok,,-17,2025-04-12 10:34:51,,,,4k natively is pretty easy for most pcs though The tech around it is getting better and heavier which makes it more difficult But if you want almost anything can be played at 4k,mmpkc36,3.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpr367,Alloy202,,11,2025-04-12 11:08:41,,,,Errrrr very very no 4K native at playable frames and acceptable image quality pushes even the highest spec PCs with modern titles Will most pcs show 4k as an option Sure as long as your monitor also supports it which honestly very few pc enthusiasts would have over 1440p at least the ones that know what they are doing But the experience at 4k over 1440p is simply not worth it on 99 of modern gaming PC set ups,mmpnhg5,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmq6vwr,newhereok,,2,2025-04-12 13:07:59,,,,Acceptable image quality is the difference here Im with you 4k is the max needed and 1440P is good for most but there is a choice not to play shit on 4k and that choice just changes with the technology that is available Which is totally understandable but the notion that 4k isnt possible isnt true,mmpr367,5.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmq9mx8,Alloy202,,2,2025-04-12 13:25:22,,,,Im not saying its not possible You just give up too much in performance or image quality to get there when compared to 1440p Its typically not worth the trade off with modern titles,mmq6vwr,6.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpphvo,MargielaFella,,4,2025-04-12 10:54:10,,,,You really gotta dial your settings down on low or mid end hardware to push native 4K on modern games I should clarify I mean uncompromised 4K,mmpnhg5,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmpxded,Small_Editor_3693,,-8,2025-04-12 12:00:43,,,,All these articles are just trying to match the pixels per degree for each resolution which is pretty useless People are using 5 or 6k monitors that are over 100 PPD If you want that kind of sharpness you have to go 8k,mmpusag,6.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmprdan,Fredasa,,-3,2025-04-12 11:11:11,,,,I find it a shame personally I use a 4K TV as my monitor and people like me are steadily increasing in number Id like to have seen a 6K standard to fill the gap I can live without it but theres certainly no getting around the fact that 4K as 55 inches from 25 feet is not retina Another thing is that with 8K off the plate theres even less incentive for anyone making GPUs or console hardware to get their act together and push rasterization to a point where it can meaningfully support 4K resolutions This means that good VR is also on hold,mmpjuub,2.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpn64w,BigCommieMachine,,30,2025-04-12 10:31:40,,,,The issue is a pretty sure the size of TVs have pretty much maxed that will fit in most homes Most people seem to be pretty content in the 5565 sweet spot with 42 being good for a smaller place2nd TV and more serious entertainment setup settling in the 7783 range Which is weve seen the push for OLEDMiniLED 120Hz VRRetc People are FINALLY happy with the size of TVs so weve turn to looking at image quality 4K was pretty much a response to not so much a need for more visual fidelity as it was when prices on bigger panels fell 1080p doesnt look so hot on an 80 TV I mean NFL games are often in 720p and they just look AWFUL on a big 4K display So the use cases for 8K displays really only fall into 2 buckets IMO Either you are going for a HUGE display in which case you are going to use a projector or multipanel setup Or you do professional film work and youll still be able to buy a bespoke professional monitor for some ungodly amount to pixel peep,mmpije7,1.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmppyho,elton_john_lennon,,14,2025-04-12 10:58:27,,,,Either you are going for a HUGE display That right there sums it up For 8K to make sense in a regular home it would have to be twice as big as 4K was given the same viewing distance So if you had 60 that means 120 now with 80 well get your wallet ready for that 160 that nobody is selling right now D Trying to sell 8K in previous 4K sizes of about 5060 means I would have to use that TV like a desk monitor which completely defeats the purpose,mmpn64w,2.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmq03jb,xXNorthXx,,3,2025-04-12 12:21:07,,,,Id like to see them get the price down on the multipanel units or start looking at rolling units to handle the 100 sizes 100 120hz oled 4k still looks great But what they really are running up against is diminishing returns there was a glut of people buying tvs for the last 20 years between going to flat panels atsc rollout and significant improvements as resolution went from 720p to 1080p to larger tvs being cheap to buy whats left for new markets The 100150 when sets are available is slim pickings in residential but there will be some sales in commercial as they replace projectors for them Sales volumes will be orders of magnitude lower so prices will be higher for them along with logistical issuestwo guys trying to wall mount a 150 tv not really practical The Wall works here but its cost prohibitive currently,mmppyho,3.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmrw1qm,CardboardJ,,3,2025-04-12 18:37:02,,,,I think its the content thing you mentioned NFL is still mostly 72060 because frame rates make it better than 108030 Get sports to start pushing 4k60 and you might have a case for 8k some day but today theres almost nothing to watch that even really makes 4k necessary,mmpn64w,2.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmxxap5,moch1,,1,2025-04-13 19:10:33,,,,The size of the TV has nothing to do with discernible resolution What matters is the Anglican reduction which is a function of seating distance and size Youre not going to sit the same distance from a 32 and 90 TV so just using size is silly This chart is what you want,mmr8bui,3.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmplure,CucumberError,,143,2025-04-12 10:18:15,,,,Most streaming 4k is compressed to some degree 4k streaming is compressed to the point it is hardly even 4k anymore A 4k bluray movie is 50gb where was on a steaming platform youre about 10 of that Bluray is still compressed steaming 4k uses so little bandwidth even Australian internet can handle it Watch a film at some stage on a 4k bluray and compare it to a 4k stream Its not the resolution that will blow you away its the smoothness and HDR suddenly makes sense,mmpjfiv,1.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmpok1r,LongBeakedSnipe,,61,2025-04-12 10:45:19,,,,What I dont understand is the audio I dont know how to explain it but if I put on any film on 4k bluray or bluray my sound system sounds incredible When I stream even with 51 activated it sounds completely flat Its basically the difference between almost cinema quality sound and TV speakers sound Obviously I do have decent speakers for the comparison but my point is why the hell is audio quality so low in streaming Surely its a fraction of the data,mmplure,2.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmqpdc8,Just_Another_Scott,,34,2025-04-12 14:54:46,,,,When I stream even with 51 activated it sounds completely flat Because theyre compressing audio too They do this to save network bandwidth and avoid having to pay more for their packets going over other networks Streaming apps on my PS5 especially Netflix somehow lose the center channel Makes it hard to hear people talking So I have to switch to stereo 2channel instead,mmpok1r,3.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmrefuc,Shehzman,,6,2025-04-12 17:06:05,,,,The benefit of 8k is on a computer monitor is that linearly scales with both 1440p and 4k That means you can have your desktop at 8k then play games at 1440p or 4k without things looking significantly more pixelated than trying to play 1440p on a 4k monitor for example,mmpucid,1.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmqbetq,DICK-PARKINSONS,,36,2025-04-12 13:36:17,,,,Its fine in that it works and doesnt look bad but being that close to the screen in VR means it would benefit from an 8k resolution The size of the screen and your distance from it are both important factors,mmq8p67,2.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmr1444,japzone,,2,2025-04-12 15:56:59,,,,Think of it in terms of Field of View An immersive TV experience is around 40 of your full vision so thats what youre stretching 4K over The Meta Quest 3 VR headset has a Horizontal FoV of 110 Now youre taking that same 4K display and stretching it over that much wider field Doing that will obviously decrease the perceived pixel density leading you to more easily see said pixels decreasing immersion,mmq8p67,2.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmq26r2,Stingray88,,6,2025-04-12 12:36:17,,,,A lot of content is recorded in higher resolution than the final planned release to give more flexible in post production For instance a lot of movies that will master in 4K are shot in 6K or 8K it allows you to reframe the shot in post and can make VFX look more crisp as well This is not universal though generally only done if you really do need it because its significantly more expensive The amount of big budget VFX heavy movies shot and mastered in 2K and then unpressed to 4K that still happens today would surprise you 2K is 2048x1080 very similar to FHD 1920x1080 Not QHD 1440p the consumer monitor industry abducting 2K to mean 1440p in the last 10 years is absolute nonsense,mmprtf5,1.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmqjzy3,mtodd93,,2,2025-04-12 14:25:10,,,,I agree with pretty much everything stingray88 said The one thing Ill add what you shoot and what you project pixel wise mean very different things One of things about shooting in higher resolution isnt so much future proofing but the quality of the image it self Yes pixels dont solely determine this and thats why the leading cinema camera brand ARRi still has only made 45k cameras at its max That being said though 12k is great for VFX and reframing But it my opinion and why its great for the lower end prosumer cameras is that its so much crispers with less equipment meaning smaller productions can make them work for them As well as when you downscale for lets say social medial the equality still retains it self very well vs Ive seen some 4k camera get a bit muddy when being down graded especially if not having been lit and color graded correctly,mmprtf5,1.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmt5a4q,BigHandLittleSlap,,2,2025-04-12 22:56:45,,,,Some professional video editors were asked to view a 4K and an 8K TV sidebyside with logos hidden They preferred the 4K TV because it was OLED and had better contrast Also youre absolutely spot on with the megabits over megapixels Ive got an 8K camera Nikon Z8 and Ive noticed that either 2K or 4K footage from it looks absolutely amazing simply because the bitrate is stupid high on the order of 800 MBs If I compress it down to something that my relatives can stream over their shitty wifi and rural Internet then the exact same footage starts looking like it was made with a potato That got me thinking and recently I tried the Blackmagic Camera app with my iPhone 16 It can record with a bit rate over 1 Gbps The quality difference is incredible despite being the exact same tiny phone camera as before The lesson is that bitrate and OLED make a far bigger difference than the number of pixels,mmpotua,3.0,1jxdm2z
comment,mmtburk,Jiopaba,,1,2025-04-12 23:37:25,,,,Agreed At least the OLED and other features could eventually make their way to 8K TVs At the moment though its just not worth moving on from 4K unless youre chasing a particular aspect ratio or something in my opinion We didnt move to 1080p for futureproofing we did it because we had content available that needed that quality of display to fully experience Until its entirely reasonable for a person to be pulling down 4K content at a bitrate equal to one fullquality 4K image per frame with only lossless compression used youre still going to get more out of investing into network architecture and compression than buying a display with four times more pixels than you can drive Its like buying a 100000 muscle car with 800 HP so that you can drive to work and back at 35 MPH Maybe once in a while you take it down to the track and let it loose cue up some local 8K content to really show it off but as a daily driver it makes no sense,mmt5a4q,4.0,1jxdm2z

comment,mmrrv6o,obi1kenobi1,,1,2025-04-12 18:14:22,,,,There is an argument that at smaller sizes 4K TV sets already dont make sense for the average use case Admittedly now that 65 has become the de facto standard TV size and larger 7080 TVs arent as unattainable the argument is kind of outdated but for a TV of like 5055 at a viewing distance of 10 feet or more its not just overkill the human retina isnt capable of resolving that much detail Honestly I think the only reason 4K became as ubiquitous as it is was because of marketing and buzzwords along with the fact that at the electronics store you tend to get much closer to the TVs than you would at home so the difference between the two would have been much more impressive and impactful than it would in a mundane home setting Its not like the average person had a need for a 4KTV and in many normal use cases it would be downright impossible for them to really see a difference 8K therefore only makes sense for supersized TVs or home theater systems At sizes of like 120 depending of course on viewing distance then yes 8K would be a visible improvement there is still room to push sharpness further But how many of us have that setup or even have room for that kind of setup if the TVs didnt cost as much as a used car Its an extremely niche thing that will likely remain that way for a long time Thats not to say 8K will never see widespread use for example when it comes to computer monitors since we sit so close to them 8K would be a noticeable improvement over 4K for very large monitors larger than the average person uses but the size s enthusiasts and professionals often use And for that reason I dont really have a problem with 8K content existing though theres really no market for it yet and it doesnt make sense to try and rush it But for normal sized home setups outside of some niche cases 8K doesnt really offer any advantage and the increase in resolution over 4K is largely wasted,,0.0,1jxdm2z
