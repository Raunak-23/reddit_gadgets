comment,n44ie5a,QueezyF,,2,2025-07-20 06:30:13,,,,Summercart and Everdrive are the way to do it I like original carts but its so much more convenient to have the whole N64 library at your disposal Some of those games run high as fuck now,n40gexh,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n45hcqo,steinchen90,,1,2025-07-20 11:55:11,,,,If you dont own any cards why would you buy an Analogue 64 Emulation will provide better results then Also going by Analogues past I highly doubt that it really is 100 compatible with all cartridgesgames,n40dqmv,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n41bdlm,jhimmelberg,,10,2025-07-19 18:25:22,,,,This also just takes a SD card and you can load ROMs on it Not as satisfying as a cartridge but just an option,n400oof,1.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n3zxwvr,MarkZuckerbergsPerm,,125,2025-07-19 14:08:36,,,,It gets a lot worse if you ship it outside the US Analogues insane shipping prices dont make this any easier They once tried charging me 50 dollars to ship a 15 dollar screen protector for the Pocket to the EU,n3zw87u,1.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n41245u,connor42,,15,2025-07-19 17:37:15,,,,Yeah its ridiculous what is the need to clearly profit off shipping just make the device more expensive its dishonest especially when most place just quote you at or close to cost,n3zxwvr,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n3zyhhw,Michqooa,,25,2025-07-19 14:11:43,,,,Yep Disgusting I once asked to buy something in stock and something OOS and have them hold it and ship together so I didnt have to pay 100 for international express as its mandatory snipping They told me to fk off hahaha,n3zxwvr,2.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n42q5pe,FireLucid,,3,2025-07-19 23:05:23,,,,Thats kinda normal when you order stuff that is on backorder but can still add to cart Otherwise the place has to pay for shipping twice,n40lrnz,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n44h40o,Michqooa,,2,2025-07-20 06:18:35,,,,Most places would hold the whole order surely Some places might say no thats fair but the problem is they have mandatory priority international shipping Im trying to buy 2 x 20 items yet have to pay 100 shipping TWICE once for each gadget I pointed out the absurdity of this and they had zero interest in helping,n40lrnz,4.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n40oqur,tinyrickstinyhands,,-13,2025-07-19 16:28:43,,,,Okay Paying 250 for a 30year old console for a resolution upgrade is absolute mark behavior but to each their own Ill just take mine out if I want to play it and as I did for the past 30 years will not care that my N64 isnt 4K,n40l5le,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n41xd6x,EtherBoo,,7,2025-07-19 20:23:47,,,,Im just going to start by saying this product is not aimed at me Id much rather emulate or play the variety of source ports available and in development Theres people who only want to play on original hardware The problem is most modern TVs dont play nice with old consoles especially the N64 which output at different resolutions Sure you have composite inputs and they work fine for DVDs and VHS but not so much games They very often introduce input lag and delay when switching resolutions like Resident Evil 2 does when you go to the item screen In my own experience I hooked up my Wii to my living room TV and it looked like total shit I ended up emulating on my living room PC with a USB Wii bar and its 100x better Your TV may be fine and maybe you dont notice the lag which is even better but its just not always the case This product is aimed at those enthusiasts who want to use original hardware and cartridges and want to use a modern display without issue This will always output at 4k regardless if what the game renders at which makes it very hassle free Its for enthusiastshobbyists You wouldnt find me buying a 5090 but theres a market for that and people pay 2k for video card,n40oqur,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n44kgjo,QueezyF,,2,2025-07-20 06:48:59,,,,I get it I basically went full bore on getting the perfect hookups and a 25 year old Samsung CRT because Rogue Squadron 2 looked like shit on my modern TV when I bought a GameCube years back,n41xd6x,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n42qzjb,montrevux,,3,2025-07-19 23:10:18,,,,so youre not who this product is aimed at and thats ok,n40oqur,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40zlar,cheesystuff,,8,2025-07-19 17:24:33,,,,Analogue devices are premium all around and you pay for the accurate FPGA emulation Especially on a console that still has hiccups in software emulation today,n3zw87u,1.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n3zywo6,shifty_coder,,55,2025-07-19 14:13:59,,,,Its half the original price if you factor in inflation N64 launched at 200USD in 1996 WHICH IS JUST OVER 400 today,n3zw87u,1.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n403dv4,honicthesedgehog,,77,2025-07-19 14:37:52,,,,Yeah but it was cutting edge in 1996 not so much in 2025,n3zywo6,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n409sob,sagevallant,,68,2025-07-19 15:11:20,,,,If youve never tried to jump through the hoops of retro gaming on something other than a CRT I can see why you wouldnt appreciate the convenience of a plug play device like this Its a niche product for a niche market and people will be trying to sell it secondhand for twice as much in a few years Scalpers gonna scalp,n403dv4,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40dm6v,honicthesedgehog,,7,2025-07-19 15:30:58,,,,Oh sure I definitely understand the appeal and suspect itll do pretty well within its niche I just dont think comparing to inflation adjusted 1996 MSRP is a good argument in favor of affordability for about the same price you can get a refurbished Switch or an Xbox One X,n409sob,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40i5va,sagevallant,,7,2025-07-19 15:54:19,,,,Absolutely I dont think this is a product for anyone that doesnt already have the games in some form be it the genuine article or through a flash cart Which is the big problem with it N64 not having a very large library Like Im not shelling out that much money so I can play my Ogre Battle 64 cartridge again Especially when its still saved on my Wii from the WiiShop era,n40dm6v,5.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n432u8f,gsmumbo,,3,2025-07-20 00:21:30,,,,You put some respect on BanjoKazooies name,n40i5va,6.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n41s5ri,TerribleBudget,,4,2025-07-19 19:55:46,,,,what hoops I just shoved the redwhiteyellow plugs in and played The small flatscreen tv I use as a second monitor works fine on both my SNES and N64,n409sob,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n42t9m6,CaptainStabfellow,,8,2025-07-19 23:23:43,,,,The hoops people jump through because they dont want to play in 240p with the shitty picture and input lag that comes from using hardware meant for a CRT TV with a flat panel instead Hoops such as emulation scouring thrift stores and FB marketplace for old CRTs that still work console mods or other external composite to HDMI convertersall of which have their downsides A device that can play original cartridges natively in 4K on modern TVs and with no input lag is exactly what a lot of us have been dreaming of for years,n41s5ri,5.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n44smhh,TerribleBudget,,3,2025-07-20 08:05:04,,,,The graphics thing I get but I must be lucky in that I dont have any noticeable input lag,n42t9m6,6.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n463u77,sagevallant,,0,2025-07-20 14:17:52,,,,Depends on the game The cartridge generations are built for zero lag because there really was none NES SNES Genesis Action games specifically have it worst Then theres some on PS1 Parappa the Rappa is notoriously hard in emulation less on PS2 and thats about the end of it I can tell the difference between Megaman X on SNES and the official collection release But thats a game I grew up with,n44smhh,7.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n44ing6,QueezyF,,1,2025-07-20 06:32:33,,,,If you factor in youre basically getting a RetroTINK with this the price isnt bad Last I checked those were going for like 400,n42t9m6,6.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n45z4nx,Acerhand,,-1,2025-07-20 13:51:04,,,,Those upscalers are ludicrously over priced Thats all this shows They are like Monster HDMI cables and just inflated in value to a niche demographic If you have a demographic who are essentially the audiophile of today and willing to pay insane prices for things that appeal to them you get a situation where someone can make something for very little and sell it for a lot,n44ing6,7.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n4302jb,DomLite,,1,2025-07-20 00:04:22,,,,If youve never tried to jump through the hoops of retro gaming on something other than a CRT Download emulator Adjust resolution and apply CRT filter second part optional but recommended Play Its literally that simple Acting like its some kind of absolutely unattainable level of skill to do so is disingenuous and deceptive If youve ever played a single PC game in your life you know how to open a settings menu and change the resolution and a few graphical settings Thats literally all there is to it Maybe back in the early days of emulation when we were still getting used to home computers and were wary of anything unofficial especially when they had such complex menus as they used to sure In this day and age though Emulation is literally plug and play,n409sob,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n43qc29,Ursa_Solaris,,3,2025-07-20 02:52:10,,,,N64 emulation is notoriously jank Also CRTs have far better latency than anything except a modern OLED and far better motion clarity than any digital display at the same refresh rate To get even close to the motion clarity of a CRT with a 60hz signal you need at least 240hz OLED with either rolling beam simulator shader or black frame insertion and thats just to get close These are completely legitimate reasons to want to play on physical hardware instead of relying emulation and shaders If you dont really care about the quality and you only intend to play the same handful of games everybody else plays that are well tested then yeah emulation is fine But if youre playing niche games or want an authentic visual experience you want a console and a CRT Nothing else comes close Im hoping this systems FPGA is accurate and stable because we wont have working original consoles forever so preserving the original experience going forward requires something like this,n4302jb,5.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n432na7,sagevallant,,1,2025-07-20 00:20:18,,,,You sound personally offended But sure I guess I dont think of emulating and retro gaming as the same thing Emulation is good If they wont preserve things then we have to,n4302jb,5.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n434528,DomLite,,2,2025-07-20 00:29:43,,,,You sound personally offended You sound like youre trying to discredit my response by implying that Im being emotional about it when Im not Dont do that shit Emulation and retro gaming are objectively the same thing Youre playing retro games Whatever the means doesnt matter You also sat there and made it sound like it was some huge hassle to play classic games on a modern tv when its not which was my reason for responding Correcting that assertion was my only reason for responding and I felt the need to call out the dishonest spin What makes me completely disrespect your opinion is the backhanded and casual way youre trying to discredit what I have to say though Makes you sound slimy as fuck Maybe work on that in the future Edit Go right ahead and downvote me It only shows whos actually being personally offended for being called on their BS,n432na7,6.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n412nk4,connor42,,1,2025-07-19 17:39:57,,,,people will be trying to sell it secondhand for twice as much in a few years Many of their products do sell well above retail once theyre out of production though,n409sob,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40inlr,Electricfire19,,7,2025-07-19 15:56:52,,,,This is also pretty cutting edge FPGAs have been around for a long time but are only just starting to take off in the retro emulation world and regardless are still expensive chips Once we start to hopefully see more competition and easier manufacturing prices for these kinds of consoles should go down We actually already have started to see this with Game Boy FPGA consoles But for now with a console like the N64 these prices definitely make sense,n403dv4,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n44ju9r,QueezyF,,2,2025-07-20 06:43:22,,,,Analogue also makes good stuff even if it is on the pricier side Besides maybe the buttons Ive had no issues out of the Pocket,n40inlr,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n4083pm,ProFeces,,19,2025-07-19 15:02:33,,,,To get a pristine N64 today off of a site like DkOldies youre paying between 130180 You can find them for around 70 on eBay in poor condition So lets say you go with a junker off eBay for 70 To mod it so you can hdmi out which will only be 1080p you need a retrogem which is 199 You also have to have extremely proficient soldering skills because those ribbon cables are no joke Most people would have to pay for that to be installed Usually those install services are around 100 So even without the other features like Bluetooth controllers its currently more expensive to buy original hardware and modify it even if you can do the mod yourself and youre not getting 4k but 1080p Its actually a cheaper solution with more benefits,n403dv4,3.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n41dopc,spideyv91,,2,2025-07-19 18:37:47,,,,Its worse at retro game stores for consoles Sometimes you can find a steal but the prices some of these places charge it would make more sense to spend it a little more for something from analogue,n4083pm,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40bhh4,honicthesedgehog,,2,2025-07-19 15:20:01,,,,Yeah but all of that sounds like youre just paying a premium for nostalgia andor for having a physical game system if I just wanted to run N64 games onlets say something other than your phone or laptop whats the cheapest possible option,n4083pm,4.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n40hvqf,ProFeces,,7,2025-07-19 15:52:51,,,,Yeah but all of that sounds like youre just paying a premium for nostalgia This is true and people are willing to pay that premium The desire to get this noatalgia has kept many companies including the one in the OP in business if I just wanted to run N64 games onlets say something other than your phone or laptop whats the cheapest possible option Im assuming youre also including a desktop PC into the exclusions here since you mentioned laptop Youre effectively ruling out emulation at this point So you have four options 1 Buy some super cheap junker N64 off of eBay wont be pretty but will function You wont be able to connect it to a modern TV so you will need at minimum to buy some sort of adapter most of which introduce a lot of lag making some games unplayable But its not THAT expensive of an option You can get one of those adapters for around 20 off of Amazon plus around 70 for a junker console So youre right around 90 Sounds reasonable right Well most of the listings youll find off of eBay are console only So youll also need to buy a power adapter usually around 20 and a controller another 20 if you dont mind a clone controller So youre at around 130 for the cheap option that will look bad and have an unpleasant laggy gameplay Im not exaggerating those video adapters are awful Retrogb does lag tests on those if youre interested in seeing how bad But if youre okay with that price tag of roughly 130 2 Similar to option 1 but instead of getting m HDMI adapter you opt into getting a CRT TV instead These TVs can range anywhere from actually free of youre extremely lucky to several hundred dollars I got my 25 CRT off of offer up for 50 But I consider that to be a lucky find If youre patient enough though you may find something cheap like that So add 30 to option one since all the other things like power adaptercontroller still applies here So youre at around 160 3 Mod the console to work on modern TVs You can buy a cheaper HDMI mods for around 50 Youre only getting 720p out of this mod but were not going for looks here but cost If you can install it yourself youre good If not add another 100 Most people cant mod it themselves so 150 for the mod 70 for the console youre at 230 and still likely need a controller and power cable 4 You get an external scaler like the retrotink Or lesser known Retroscaler2x You can get the latter for around 70 off of Amazon and it will actually look good on your TV So here youre at 140 still likely need a cable and controller so 180 all in and it will look nice on your display Theres no truly cheap option And Id say for most people interested the OP is a great solution for its price point,n40bhh4,5.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n41jak0,obi1kenobi1,,1,2025-07-19 19:07:55,,,,Im almost there but Im waiting to see indepth reviews before I make any decision The thing is as crazy as the price is its not that much more than an HDMI mod for an N64 and thats not counting the difficulty or cost if you dont want to do it yourself of installing it And then youre still stuck with 240p480i output and I might be wrong about the N64 ones but a lot of console HDMI mods are 720p for some reason which means on a 1080p or 4K TV the picture will be blurry and not integer scaled Its definitely targeted at people with deep pockets andor a strong nostalgia for the N64 Im not trying to argue that it is a great value but HDMI and other modern mods for old consoles can be very expensive so compared to those its not that much more money for a huge upgrade in graphics,n3zw87u,1.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n46db5x,ewleonardspock,,2,2025-07-20 15:08:52,,,,I could be wrong but I imagine it comes down to the fact that if you have a 4K TV the image needs to be 4K If your source is 4K youre set If your source isnt 4K the TV needs to upscale it to 4K Doing the 4K upscale on the console means the quality is probably better because itll be optimized for gaming vs the TVs onesizefitsall upscaling It could also help work latency because letting the TV do the upscale will likely add a bit of latency,n41qotp,1.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n40oap5,Meatball132,,-7,2025-07-19 16:26:22,,,,The idea that this is inherently more accurate than software emulation is kind of a marketing thing This is very much still emulation but its done in hardware rather than software There are benefits to this and in this case you have the huge benefit of it working with real cartridges but it doesnt magically mean itll be perfectly accurate with full compatibility It can be inaccurate in the same way a software emulator can,n400t5s,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40sza6,theTrebleClef,,19,2025-07-19 16:51:00,,,,This is a fundamental misunderstanding of how fpga works Emulating in software means writing programming instructions to replicate what original hardware transistors and communication circuits would do Instead of a register in hardware we have a byte in RAM that might be anywhere on the host machine and may not behave the exact same way every time due to threading and other behaviors of modern operating systems Building in fpga correctly means instructing the gate array to create that register in hardware Its in the same addressable memory location and is more likely although maybe not going to perfectly replicate the behavior of the original hardware That doesnt mean the Analogue 3D will perfectly replicate N64 but if done correctly it has an increased possibility to run erratic titles correctly without needing emulatorspecific configuration for different games,n40oap5,3.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40vbpc,Meatball132,,-2,2025-07-19 17:03:09,,,,Yes this explanation aligns with what I understand about these FPGA recreations Im not sure how any of it is so contradictory with what I said that it constitutes a fundamental misunderstanding As I mentioned there _are_ benefits but if you do it correctly there isnt much _inherent_ benefit over a software emulator But I will concede that accurate timing is perhaps a gamechanging advantage which is normally the bane of any software emulator developers existence,n40sza6,4.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40yn8p,theTrebleClef,,5,2025-07-19 17:19:48,,,,Its not impossible but it is difficult to reproduce the electrical characteristics of more advanced processors like the CPU and GPU in the N64 If Analogue was able to correctly reproduce the electrical characteristics and timing they have a chance to get closer than anyone else,n40vbpc,5.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40zz80,Meatball132,,1,2025-07-19 17:26:29,,,,I suppose I agree especially with how poor the N64 emulation scene still is Slight tangent I worked on a recentlyreleased romhack that added VRUVRS mic support to a game and no exaggeration every emulator out there used some modern voice recognition library and then had a hardcoded list of accepted words in the retail games mapped to the VRUVRS command data So they wont work with anything other than those retail games Presumably the FPGA will work with the actual peripherals and that feature of our romhack will work on something other than real hardware and a custom emulator build we made just to update the word list We ran into so many similar emulator issues when making the mod I do wonder how the Analogue will fare,n40yn8p,6.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n42z9ev,DomLite,,0,2025-07-19 23:59:22,,,,You say this like emulation isnt functionally plug and play too Yeah you can futz around with the settings and try to squeeze 120 fps 4k out of everything but most emulators have a very basic set of options with a toggle to enable the more advanced stuff specifically so typical users dont muck around with things they dont understand and break everything The typical emulator lets you load it up drag and drop a rom file onto it and it plays no questions asked If youve ever used a computer before in your life youll know how to navigate a menu and adjust a few settings if you want to tweak the experience and if youre a gamer at all youve probably adjusted your resolution settings and such in a game before Basically stop acting like emulation is rocket science If youre a gamer whos enthusiastic enough to want to play classic stuff like N64 and the like youre familiar enough with computers to download and operate an emulator This device is for those people who have a weird purist boner for playing on hardware and thats fine Emulation is still just as easy way more customizable and thus objectively better and is infinitely less expensive than paying for a brand new 4k N64 in 2025,n3zwgzf,2.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n40a8pg,SScorpio,,8,2025-07-19 15:13:37,,,,FPGA is only as accurate as the dev coded it to be Its software defined hardware so it can have bugs just like anything else Playing real carts is useful for some people But the number of people buying Analogue consoles and then only using an Everdrive on them is mind bobbling For the same price you could have a MiSTer that does all the consoles 2600 SatPSXN64,n40643s,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n43psq6,spilk,,1,2025-07-20 02:48:36,,,,I think you may misunderstand how FPGAs work these are still defined by code written by humans and are just as prone to mistakes as any other kind of code its still a simulation at best they reimplement the behavior of the original hardware its not a 11 gatelevel replica,n40643s,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n40edd0,ocxtitan,,0,2025-07-19 15:34:51,,,,Depends on how you look at it I guess with emulation you can patch and mod away issues that exist in the original games whereas FPGA will run the game exactly the way native hardware did bugs glitches framerate issues and all,n40643s,2.0,1m3wrgi
comment,n409y2c,Declan_McManus,,-1,2025-07-19 15:12:07,,,,IMO its nostalgia bait for millennials who had N64s as kids and now have some disposable income Like it has some interesting technological innovations but by and large its for someone thinking oh neat I have super smash bros in my closet somewhere I should fire that up,n3zw55o,1.0,1m3wrgi

comment,n4009w7,_scyllinice_,,11,2025-07-19 14:21:23,,,,The whole point of these consoles is that they use original cartridges They use FPGA technology to mimic the original hardware as closely as they can bugs and all for as close to if not complete 100 compatibility,n3zw73g,1.0,1m3wrgi
