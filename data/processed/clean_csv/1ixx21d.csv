comment,mepzulm,NycAlex,,390,2025-02-25 16:14:11,,,,I bought the original powerplay mat as soon as it came out in jan 2019 It still goes today i have not charged a single wireless mouse in over 6 years I have used all of these on the same powerplay mat G502 g703 g900 g903 g pro g pro superlight superlight2 g502 hero g502x plus Was well worth the 100 i paid for the mat Edit just read the article Builtin charging cable instead of removable usb this sucks But here is the big one Powerplay 2 no longer has a builtin wireless receiver On powerplay 1 mat i only need to sync mouse to powerplay mat only mat needs to connect usb to my pc On new powerplay mat 2 you have to use usb dongle that comes with your mouse as well as plug in usb cable from mat Fuck that this is some backwards bullshit Now this bullshit requires 2 usb ports for the same shit,,0.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqacrs,semibiquitous,,192,2025-02-25 17:04:16,,,,wtf how did they sign off on selling new version product with LESS features Reading this and especially last two bullet points make this a significant downgrade,mepzulm,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqf8o2,Buttknucks,,31,2025-02-25 17:27:24,,,,Same bought one a while after getting a wireless mouse and never looked back A selling point for me was definitely the built in receiver No connection issues because its always right next to the mouse and I like that it feels like an all in one system Wild that they didnt put a USB port on the base of the pad for the connector at least,mepzulm,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,mer3br9,Nalcomis,,22,2025-02-25 19:20:06,,,,That really is the kicker This shitty receivers are susceptible to all kinds of interference and the back of your pc behind all the components is the worst place for it The receiver being 3 from my hand was absolutely a huge selling point That and the pad has an antenna bigger than the entire Lightspeed usb thing,meqf8o2,2.0,1ixx21d

comment,mew57oa,-FourOhFour-,,3,2025-02-26 14:47:24,,,,Tbf the first few seem like they liked the quality but not the model then the g max line they liked the mouse but wanted the better versions before returning back to the upgraded version of the g502 Id have sucked it up and dealt with a mouse I was content with longer but I can 100 see the logic on the swaps I know I went through 3 mmo mice in 3 years before finally settling on my current which has all the features I wanted,meu52su,2.0,1ixx21d

comment,mmk848m,-FourOhFour-,,1,2025-04-11 13:41:52,,,,If you dont have an mmo mouse already get a cheap one and force yourself to use it for simple things first forward back mute etc see if youre comfortable with the mouse before getting a good one I personally hardly use the mmo side of the mouse now but thats partly due to me cutting back on mmos due to life and even when i do play I barely touch them as its no longer a muscle memory Theyre great mice if you need extra hot keys but it really depends on how you are if you can get the moust out of them As for actual recommendations Naga line was what I used from razer decent quality interchangeable side piece so I wasnt stuck with the mmo setup they also have a dedicated model that has freespin and wireless afaik only big company between Logitech Corsair and Razer to have that setup but name is escaping me which is what I currently use The Logitech mmo mouse was fine but felt it got dirtier than it should and was harder to clean than Id have liked and I dont think I used a corsair and if I did it was brief faintly recall their design not seeming very ergonomic to me,mmi1x9j,4.0,1ixx21d

comment,meq6o0m,hydroptix,,14,2025-02-25 16:46:50,,,,Yep had two start experiencing the dreaded double clicking issue Found out I could buy the switches on Amazon and theyre pretty easy to replace able to be replaced without soldering for the g903 specifically Still annoying it needs to be done at all,meptj5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,mer2zpd,BrunoEye,,2,2025-02-25 19:18:33,,,,Yeah my G900 has worked flawlessly for 6 years since I replaced the switches,meq6o0m,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,mesbck5,frn,,2,2025-02-25 22:48:03,,,,I wouldnt say its easy The whole thing is designed to make the switches the hardest thing to get to Had to remove most of the surprisingly numerous components to get at them and its almost impossible not to bend the battery in the process Took me about 2 hours in total The howto video on YouTube is 45 mins long with cuts and fastforward sections And it only covers the dissasembly,meq6o0m,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,mesgj7n,hydroptix,,2,2025-02-25 23:14:56,,,,I guess by easy I meant theres no soldering required I do remember it being pretty time consuming,mesbck5,4.0,1ixx21d
comment,mepu1rk,Tudar87,,26,2025-02-25 15:45:57,,,,Only issues Ive had is keys wearing down on my WASD on the g915 keyboard Which if Im being honest happened on all of my keyboards after a few years Not saying these are great by any means especially for the price just saying I havent had any issues,meptj5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,merrpev,Emu1981,,8,2025-02-25 21:13:59,,,,keys wearing down on my WASD Doubleshot PBT keycaps are the solution to this the question is whether you can get them for your particular keyboard The keycaps on my old MK750 are still looking pretty much brand new after 6 years of heavy usage Even the keycaps on my old g910 that I had to toss because of bounce on a lot of the keys was fine after 5 years All the previous keyboards that I had used ended up with the majority of the legends wearing off and I used to joke that they were security keyboards because way too many people dont know how to touch type lol,mepu1rk,3.0,1ixx21d

comment,mer1eh0,Pretty_Wonder_3927,,1,2025-02-25 19:11:09,,,,In that case maybe get a keyboard with swappable key caps next time That way you can easily replace the key caps when the writing is worn off,mepu1rk,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,mes4ir1,skorps,,1,2025-02-25 22:14:25,,,,G915 keyboard has replaceable caps but they are nonstandard I got some third party ones because the caps break easily and my cats like to knock my stuff around Ive been happy with the board in general but the caps are a weak point,mer1eh0,4.0,1ixx21d
comment,mes04sr,enraged768,,1,2025-02-25 21:53:21,,,,The only keyboard that Ive owned were this didnt happen was a mionix zibal keyboard but this keyboard wasnt for everyone you had to really type no half ass keypressin I actually think it improved my typing but again wasnt the most enjoyable experience in the beginning It was built like a damn tank though,mepu1rk,3.0,1ixx21d

comment,mernukl,Pingondin,,1,2025-02-25 20:56:04,,,,The last good Logitech gaming mouse I had was the original G5 I got a G500 that started double clicking after 18 months it was replaced under warranty by Logitech with a G500s same problem after 2 years Then I got a G502s which also started double clicking after less than 6 months I gave up and stopped buying Logitech mice,meptj5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,mes7q9z,aberrod,,1,2025-02-25 22:30:03,,,,Jesus christ Im happy to see at least one other person with the same problems Ive had with Logitech My experience with them for mice and headsets for years was absolute garbage Multiple G series mice a year multiple headsets a year and every time Ive complained about it on the internets its always WTF logitech is made of adamantium bro,meptj5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,meueuw1,PM_ME_ONE_EYED_CATS,,2,2025-02-26 06:21:30,,,,I used to always buy Logitech but after the constant breaking down of mice and keyboards its just not worth the hassle,mes7q9z,3.0,1ixx21d

comment,meq7fam,thesaltystaff,,0,2025-02-25 16:50:25,,,,I mean on the other end of the spectrum Ive had a G903 for 6 years and the only issue Ive had is one of the side buttons and the rightclick started doubleclicking last year 25 and about 30m of repair work and its good as new but dirty I only wish that the g700s was as modular on the inside I was rustier with my soldering iron skills back then and ended up frying the board for the left mouseclick otherwise I never would have replaced it Eventually I may replace the internal battery but it still lasts several days of me using it 3ish hours per day I may pick up the mat instead,meptj5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqmiet,ChoMar05,,4,2025-02-25 18:01:30,,,,5 years till failure or requiring a soldering iron still isnt a quality item or the other end of the spectrum though I mean the G903 seems to have fallen in price quite a bit but its still double the price of a keychron And on the other end of the spectrum is my MX Master which is still in regular office use Logitech quality has fallen drastically in recent years while the price hasnt,meq7fam,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqr0gr,thesaltystaff,,1,2025-02-25 18:22:46,,,,The G903 is all plug and play daughter boards for the buttons the soldering iron comment was specifically the G700s And when you can usually find it on sale for 50 or in my case 30 new its a pretty good deal IMO Also with the tiniest bit of digging the expected life expectancy of a mouse is 25 years With mine hitting the top end and I anticipate outlasting it Im pretty happy with it,meqmiet,4.0,1ixx21d
comment,meuosn5,ChoMar05,,1,2025-02-26 07:53:43,,,,The life expectancy of mice doesnt have to be 25 years Thats just for the Premium gamer market and Designer market where people have lots of disposable income and are willing to spend it The cheapest Office mice usually last 5 years and when they fail its usually due to the cable breaking Older gaming mice or wireless mice usually just dont fail especially if they have replaceable batteries And its not like they fail because the highend premium sensor or something is on the edge of what is technologically possible They fail because the tacswitches a cheap well developed item are of the lowest quality possible maybe even designed to fail As I said I still have an MX Master and all my previous gaming and office mice all logitech including 2 MX 1000 which I still have somewhere were retired after 7 years or so because I wanted something new not because they broke And yeah its not just logitech But if I have to deal with enshittification and possible designed obsolescence Im going with the cheapest option and thats never logitech,meqr0gr,5.0,1ixx21d
comment,merdmvs,toomuchsoysauce,,5,2025-02-25 20:08:20,,,,Same except with the G502x Its been a godsend Before Id have to remember to charge the mouse at night but now I completely ignoreforget about it I also like how they include the hard and soft surface as I find myself rotating pretty regularly,mepsrx2,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqlryi,_northernlights_,,3,2025-02-25 17:58:03,,,,Exactly me,mepsrx2,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,mepwxxb,SoapyMacNCheese,,183,2025-02-25 16:00:01,,,,TLDR 20 cheaper Includes one mouse pad instead of 2 no hard pad The charging area goes closer to the corners of the pad Not cross compatible with existing powerplay 1 pucks Removed the RGB Logitech G Logo Went from Micro USB to a fixed cable No more built in Lightspeed mouse dongle The loss of the built in dongle is annoying but understandable they have multiple different lightspeed dongles for their gaming mice now so whatever they included wouldnt work for everybody However they should have added a USB passthrough in its place Having it use USBC instead of a fixed cable would have also been better,,0.0,1ixx21d
comment,meq4l5y,Psaltus,,92,2025-02-25 16:37:00,,,,This is Bad Id rather pay more for more features Having the builtin light speed dongle was a major selling point in me buying the first mousepad Having a detachable cable is whatever but at least it makes it fixable if the cable ever breaks This is byandlarge a downgrade They shouldnt call this a 2 they should call this a lite,mepwxxb,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,mes8eay,Bucket81,,9,2025-02-25 22:33:21,,,,I bet they are doing this for comparability If they come out with better connectivity in a dongle it will work with the pad But it should be cheaper,meq4l5y,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,meweudu,SoapyMacNCheese,,3,2025-02-26 15:36:25,,,,Thats exactly what it is about I think Theyve already come out with better connectivity in the form of the Pro Lightspeed receiver It provides up to 8khz polling rate for some of their higher end gaming mice but I dont think it is backwards compatible with regular lightspeed mice So theyd either have to build multiple variants of the powerplay for the different connectivity methods or include multiple receivers in the pad with a toggle between them Removing the feature was the cleaner and cheaper solution for them especially when you consider all the tech support mess it would cause for them when little Timmy buys the wrong one or has the toggle set wrong for their mouse However they easily could have just put a USB port on the powerplay for you to easily plug your mouses receiver into as a middle ground solution Practical and Future proof This things should at least be 30 cheaper than the outgoing model IMO with all the cost savings theyve done,mes8eay,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,mforboz,cloud9ineteen,,1,2025-03-02 23:02:58,,,,It is definitely 30 cheaper if not more just not to the end customer,meweudu,4.0,1ixx21d
comment,mzwzwby,Azuvector,,2,2025-06-26 17:16:36,,,,I agree that the donglepuck compatibility being able to be changed independently of the power play charger is probably a necessary thing That said fairly inexcusable that they couldnt just have a USB C port on the powerplay hardware that you could plug your dongle into there Having a built in USB cable instead of a port to plug into is an iffy decision as well Usually a hallmark of lower quality products That said its not terrible and getting away from micro USB is a good thing Just wish itd gone USB C instead Personally I switched to hard mouse pads years ago and have never looked back so while I dont mind the inclusion of only a soft pad they dont clearly indicate a compatible hard pad to use instead as an add on accessory instead which is a problem for me The rest sounds good but those arent minor issues,mepwxxb,1.0,1ixx21d
comment,mzx567f,SoapyMacNCheese,,1,2025-06-26 17:40:28,,,,yes at very least they should offer a compatible hard pad as an addon Most people probably used the soft pad so it makes sense not to pack in both and have to build it into the price The way theyve handled that along with the way theyve gone about all these other changes remove the built in dongle but not add a USB for the passthrough remove microUSB but go with a fixed cable instead of USBC screams that this is primarily a cost cutting update and they arent passing much of the savings on to the consumer Granted maybe this is just them trying to keep up with inflation without having to increase the cost for the consumer but it still leaves a bad impression,mzwzwby,2.0,1ixx21d
comment,mepmzmx,RollingThunderPants,,236,2025-02-25 15:10:45,,,,I mean why make something so good you wont have to replace it for years when you can just make schlock that has to be replaced all the time,,0.0,1ixx21d

comment,mepuzly,danny12beje,,11,2025-02-25 15:50:31,,,,Dunno Logitech mice seem to hold up really well with time Even the new ones I cant feel anything different in terms of build quality comparing Mx Master 3 to a 3s g502 wired to wireless,mepp9ra,3.0,1ixx21d
comment,meqipxv,HakimeHomewreckru,,8,2025-02-25 17:43:50,,,,I was a big Logitech fanboy since the mx510 Had 3 newer mice break in just 2 years They replaced my Mx master 3s just last week because the clicks werent registering anymore Had a g502 dongle melt to a liquid in the socket I pulled it out with the plastic hardened in the shape of the usb The quality is much lower but at least they still offer good service,mepuzly,4.0,1ixx21d

comment,meruauj,kooldude700,,3,2025-02-25 21:26:06,,,,Yeah unfortunately they use a stupid switch in some of their popular high end mice models that just ends up double clicking Have never had the issue happen to me mx vertical and m720 triathlon but have had a friend with the old g502 and sibling with the mx anywhere 3 who got that issue,meqlr7g,6.0,1ixx21d

comment,mesnhvy,Warskull,,0,2025-02-25 23:52:34,,,,I dont think Ive ever replaced a Logitech mouse due to it breaking Their stuff lasts My M705 is 65 years old and just as good as when I bought it The thing runs for an absurd amount of time on two AA batteries I think I replaced them 3 times My G502 lasted 5 years and only got replaced because they made a new wireless version in 2019 the wheel still worked but was showing some wear My G502 wireless lasted another 5 years and got replaced because the newer version was on sale that had some upgrades like lower weight I had Logitech mice before that and I cant recall a single one failing I end up buying a new mouse for other reasons before they do In comparison Razer mice had about a 2 year lifespan before they started having major issues sometimes sooner Back then you didnt have a choice the OG Deathadders sensor was so much better than the competition you just dealt with it Cheap products that fall apart is not one of Logitechs flaws,mepp9ra,3.0,1ixx21d

comment,mfj4sbn,PESER6,,1,2025-03-02 01:23:18,,,,Dear Logitech please change the name of this to powerplay lite and rerelease the powerplay 2 with option for a bigger surface area thinner I mean why not add a usb port keep the transmitter upgrade to usb c port maybe add magnetic holders for the mousepads so that they do not slide around and I think thats good enough,,0.0,1ixx21d
