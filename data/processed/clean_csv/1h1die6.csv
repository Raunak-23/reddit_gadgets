comment,lzaxxyq,NorysStorys,,403,2024-11-27 21:01:36,,,,I mean tape is still the best medium for long term archival so this isnt shocking Its awful if you need to regularly access data off it but if its the kind of archive you need to last decades and it gets accessed a handful of times a year then it honestly still hasnt been beaten,,0.0,1h1die6

comment,lzcdnfr,NorysStorys,,105,2024-11-28 02:10:32,,,,it also doesnt degrade very fast like TV shows recorded on tape back in the 60s are still viable and are only getting degraded to the point of issue now in 2024 and much of that wasnt stored in controlled environments so under proper storage conditions tape could very well last a century if stored properly,lzc5gvk,4.0,1h1die6

comment,lzcwlbj,just_a_red,,-3,2024-11-28 04:20:50,,,,Ok For one what is China specific is huawei own version of SSD tape hybrid MED You can get seagate or western digital ssd hDD hybrid hard disks in any computer store And they plus Toshiba offer LTO which is stated to be superior based SSD tape hybrid drives for data centers So for the question is tape SSD hybrids common around the world The answer is absolutely yes,lzceqi4,4.0,1h1die6
comment,lzd1qjs,TheRealJimDandy,,1,2024-11-28 05:00:33,,,,Do you have a link to anything about the Toshiba LTO based SSD tape hybrid drive Im not able to find anything about that And the other example you gave SSD HDD hybrid hard disks have nothing to do with tape,lzcwlbj,5.0,1h1die6
comment,lzd4hau,just_a_red,,2,2024-11-28 05:22:20,,,,For pc it is basically called SSHD SSD and HDD combo There was a similar name for the tape and ssd combo I will comeback Need to go through my catalog where I saw it to get it But what we ended up purchasing is an MLogic mRack DIT which is based on LTO 8 with SSD drives add one Which is very similar but unintegrated SSD LTO tape combo It was considerably cheaper than the Toshiba integrated version option that it was competing against,lzd1qjs,6.0,1h1die6

comment,lzdne14,hiddenuser12345,,2,2024-11-28 08:18:58,,,,I still remember back when I was in high school there were Mac programs that let you hook up a camcorder by FireWire and directly write to and read from the tape so you didnt need to get a dedicated tape drive Of course the problem now is no Mac sold today has FireWire and I cant find the program anymore so even if I had a cable and could get it to recognize my old Sony how do I read the data Thats the problem with patchedtogether solutions,lzcirn5,3.0,1h1die6

comment,lzck7ow,jaguarshark,,3,2024-11-28 02:53:39,,,,Tape is absolutely global as was extremely common up to the last decade as many companies move to other data retention strategies We used to make fun of Flape the early flashtape hybrid systems They were new tech 10 years ago and this was all prolific in USA latam and Canada I sold tons of this stuff,lzb2204,2.0,1h1die6

comment,lzcxxvg,NorysStorys,,7,2024-11-28 04:31:04,,,,Again Flashtape hybrid has been a thing for quite a while the article itself is a flawed piece of journalism thats trying to suggest that China is resorting to using tape where in reality Flashtape hybrid drives are common place in super high density data centre storage globally as the flash mitigates the slow readwrite speeds that tape has inherent to it,lzcdp8b,3.0,1h1die6
comment,lzfnpwe,cubert73,,1,2024-11-28 17:30:02,,,,Yeah The article itself says this device is only available in China but you cant expect people to read,lzcdp8b,3.0,1h1die6

comment,lzcl2vm,Car-face,,19,2024-11-28 02:59:26,,,,Sounds neat yes Well I have a few concerns While modern NAND flash memory cells are very reliable that type of storage doesnt have anything like the same lifespan as magnetic tape does That means theres a good chance that the MED becomes junk long before a normal tape drive would because the internal SSD has failed but SSD failure is only going to lose the most recent warm data no much like most backups theres a recent time period you lose for a failure swapping out the SSD module might not be as easy as plug and play but theres really no reason for it to be linked to the tape drive considering they need to be fully independent anyway Still needs must as the Devil drives or so the saying goes and Huaweis only doing this because it feels it has no choice According to Block and Files report the first range of MEDs will arrive in 2025 with capacities up to 72 TB with a power demand of just 10 of that required by equivalent disk drives Im confused are there any enterprise 72TB HDD on the market today As far as Im aware the largest is a 32TB drive And 10 of the power demand seems like a pretty big benefit for enterprise at scale It honestly sounds like Huawei has come up with a neat intermediate solution between spinning platters and pure tape drives for occasional access data for SME but for some reason it needs to be framed as no no no they must be doing this because of sanctions Its a bad thing,,0.0,1h1die6
comment,lzcyeeg,NorysStorys,,18,2024-11-28 04:34:38,,,,Its just bad journalism pushing a very American centric propaganda line Its just a modern tech version of the soviets are still using animals to Plow fields look at how great American tractors are,lzcl2vm,1.0,1h1die6

comment,lze0xam,OperationMobocracy,,3,2024-11-28 10:47:32,,,,Ive long thought that something like this makes a ton of sense Storage tiering isnt a new idea I remember reading about hierarchical storage systems 20 some years ago that combined cold archiving to tape with hotwarm HDD access in a single file system Hell the idea is used with OneDrive and other cloud storage setups for download on use file sync Compellent SANs would do more performance oriented tiering spreading blocks across SSDs 10k RPM 7200 RPM and 5400 RPM drives Even Microsoft has had a tiered storage setup available since Windows 2012 Where this gets more interesting would be how much intelligence can be baked into the drive shelf itself in combination with the size of the SSD for hotwarm data so that you could get very good predictive transition from tape to SSD It basically comes down to something like if you need block N X of the time you also need block N2 and N3 so well grab block N first and then grab blocks N2 and N3 after so that if you need them theyre already available on SSD With large enough SSDs you can afford to have the X of time be a pretty low number And with enough compute intelligence in the system you could get much more sophisticated analytics on when to pull data when to write it etc The hard part might be keeping the data on tape from getting fragmented Like if you get your block N and make some change when its on SSD great but youll want that on tape eventually but you cant write N in the same place N was located it has to get written in a spot further down the tape reel where the tape hasnt been written For some very infrequent blocks this might not be a big deal but over time it seems like there would be a lot of tape movement and potential for shoeshining Ideally you might want to rewrite the entire tape periodically so that the data was stored in as few feet of tape as necessary and with the most likely needed blocks up front but this seems hard to do without a second SSDtape in the mix,,0.0,1h1die6
