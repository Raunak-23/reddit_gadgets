comment,m0s8939,OJONLYMAYBEDIDIT,,1,2024-12-06 22:59:14,,,,AMD FX CPUs were slower clock for clock than Phenom II Pentium 4 as well they were just better cause they clocked higher Intel 11th gen sucked They rereleased the PS vita and removed the OLED screen The original fat PS3 had hardware emulation and that was dropped to cut costs For a while we had a dip in tv technology as LCD killed the competitors who had better image quality like Plasma DLPSXRD or even the rare HD CRT Wasnt until OLED became cheaper where we got high end display tech back These are more vague idea than a literal decline I suppose Though with something like 10th to 11th gen and the heat generated and the decrease in core counts Id argue they were worse Especially for OEM PCs that used turn cause they thermal throttled to heck and thus performance was actually worse Oh and there was a controversy where some SSD manufacture downgraded their ssds without telling anyone so they sent out the good ones for testing and initial runs and then just cleaning they were using a different manufacturing site And got exposed for decrease in performance,m0s2m6g,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0v7jhd,0kats,,0,2024-12-07 13:38:28,,,,idk why youre getting downvotes i think youre pretty much right i swapped from PC to playstation because i wanted a reliable gaming experience i spent over 1000 building a PC almost exactly 10 years ago and now it takes 2 minutes just to boot up my ps3 however is working just fine and i can pop any disc in and and play no problems my point is that consoles dont age as quickly as computers do and you dont need to play around with graphics settings after installing a game in order to optimise it for your system you just turn it on and it works pretty much always,m0savjn,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0r98al,thegooddoctorben,,6,2024-12-06 19:44:42,,,,Its going to be small increments for the foreseeable future but I do think AI will solve it Right now even the best video games lack realism Landscapes are pretty realistic but any moving element including people animalscreatures and vegetation still looks lowfidelity because of the difficulty of fully modeling movement Yet AI can generate random video already that is extremely realistic There are other fundamental problems IMO that dont have to do with realism of images however For examples games have settled on a janky style of camera movement that is not very natural that turns me off from a lot of firstperson games to be honest I think that could be changed technically now Games also have a hard time figuring out how to represent the real visual experience of looking at faraway detail in real life you can look down the field or track and see detail without sacrificing your awareness of your more proximate context I think its inherent to 2D representations,m0qduz4,2.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qks0e,AtaracticGoat,,43,2024-12-06 17:36:18,,,,Its marketing They currently want you to buy the PS5 so they make it seem like the PS5 is a great console and theres no need to wait to buy because the next gen isnt a big improvement So Go buy one Right Now As soon as next gen is announced they want you to buy that so it will be the greatest thing since sliced bread and way better than the PS5,m0pwlx3,1.0,1h835yc
comment,m0rdv2y,IM_OK_AMA,,18,2024-12-06 20:09:30,,,,Its marketing but its also real Say they make the PS6 able to present 10x more detailed environments than the PS5 In order to take advantage of that game companies would have to hire 10x more artists to actually produce that detail and then some multiplier of that in devs to get the detail in the game and many more managers and other coordination roles to make that work GTA III PS2 was made by about 100 people Red Dead Redemption 1 PS3 was made by a team of nearly 1000 RDR2 PS4 required more than 2000 Were approaching a very real practical limit on how many people can reasonably be paid to work on a game and still have it be profitable not to mention the orchestration costs of trying to wrangle that many people increase exponentially So ultimately even if they made the PS6 more powerful the massive visual leap wont be there the way it was from ps1 to ps2 because its nearly impossible to make games that actually take advantage,m0qks0e,2.0,1h835yc
comment,m0rtv4b,big_chungy_bunggy,,10,2024-12-06 21:36:27,,,,I agree but it will be interesting to see if they use AI 10 years down the road to fill in those extra gap and hopefully not have to significantly reduce team sizes enough to hurt their job market,m0rdv2y,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0r96ui,PrinceDX,,0,2024-12-06 19:44:29,,,,Fragment a game that came out on HoloLens wasis the future of gaming in my mind If they can get the price of AR down thats where I think consoles end up I started a job at this one company and we had HoloLens sitting in its case in a dusty back room I decided to ask around and they basically told me I could take it home and build something if I wanted to that was about 6 years ago now and at this moment Ive never seen better tech than HoloLens I own a psvr2 and have tried many different setups some of them even being prototypes and I still stand by my statement of HoloLens being the pinnacle of ARVR Just sucks that Microsoft always fumbles on their good projects such as Zune,m0q7klw,4.0,1h835yc
comment,m0ri2zn,DarthBuzzard,,5,2024-12-06 20:32:17,,,,I still stand by my statement of HoloLens being the pinnacle of ARVR I think it will be great for casual stuff but transparent AR is dramatically less immersive and lower quality than passthrough AR and VR Today I can whip up some AR games on a Quest 3 and the visuals arent ghostly the field of view is triple the HoloLens and you can have games that blend between AR and VR,m0r96ui,5.0,1h835yc
comment,m0rz19g,PrinceDX,,-1,2024-12-06 22:05:15,,,,Perhaps I should rephrase this a bit I think MS is on track to have the most solid tech I was talking about HL1 but HL2 is out and 3 is in development Ive played with basically every device on the market and some prototypes I think HoloLens is in the lead I cant talk about some things but Id say pass through on the Q3 is still blurry when doing AR compared to what Ive seen,m0ri2zn,6.0,1h835yc
comment,m0s4pxt,DarthBuzzard,,3,2024-12-06 22:38:12,,,,If you care greatly about the quality of the real world then seethrough will be vastly better and that is obviously critical when outdoors so you dont want to use passthrough there However when indoors if Im using a device its probably because I want to have really cool AR content and thats going to be very lacking on even a HoloLens 3 or 4 because transparent optics are far behind passthrough for AR imagery What youll get on a HoloLens 1 2 and eventually 3 are ghostly images that dont give the illusion of truly being solid and theyll be contained within a narrow field of view Passthrough devices will always be much higher quality if you care about content and seethrough devices will be much safer and more socially acceptable Its like the difference between PCs which are beastly machines for stationary locations like your home and phones which are low power devices that otherwise carry you throughout daily life when out and about,m0rz19g,7.0,1h835yc

comment,m0ruxav,willstr1,,3,2024-12-06 21:42:17,,,,AR feels like it is for more practical applications as in training work optimization and such Sure it could be used for games with real world elements ex Pokémon Go but I think those will be too niche to build a hardware market and would only really work if people already had the hardware AR will be more like the early PC space sure some people had high power gaming rigs but for most people it will be a machine for productivity that just happens to also support games as well And I am saying that as a fan of AR as a concept having an IRL HUD would make so many things easier I just dont see a widespread game market for that at least not until everyone already has hardware,m0r96ui,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0rx7le,willstr1,,1,2024-12-06 21:54:59,,,,It has a big problem with high barrier to entry PC gaming benefited from PCs being a productivity tool that got them into peoples lives and into their homes Early consoles benefited from video rentals and playing at friends houses so you got to easily and cheaply try it out before buying VR needs something like that to get in the door Sure there are VR arcades but they are crazy expensive setups not an accurate representation of what you can expect at home And since VR cant really do multiplayer without multiple headsets trying it at a friends house is awkward Maybe a VR company needs to do VR rentals or something where for a reasonable price and credit card on file as a security deposit you can rent a standard headset for a week as well as a few games to try it out and if you like it they would be happy to sell you a headset that was almost identical to the rental one,m0qnil7,6.0,1h835yc

comment,m0vo3z0,Mucher_,,1,2024-12-07 15:21:51,,,,I disagree for a few reasons I will try to be concise This is based on the PSVR2 which I sent back after day two 1 If you wear glasses youll need to shell out for custom eye pieces to swap for the shitty magnifying glasses included Getting it to focus properly takes longer to work out than the likely amount of time of your play session Taking turns Do this over and over to adjust for each head 2 People seem to celebrate the focused point eye tracking Its garbage and makes everything have a fuzzy appearance in the periphery One of the first things I turn off in games are depth of field This is somehow a worse version of that 3 Even though it is considered light it really wears heavy after thirty minutes or so It will never be a replacement for long gaming sessions for this reason 4 Needing basically an entire room dedicated if you want to be able to get the full immersion experience otherwise you are just playing a game with a cumbersome tv helmet 5 This one wont apply to everyone but I legit did not know they were harmful to childrens eyes under 12 The biggest reason I even gave it a try was to do something neat with my kids You cant or shouldnt 6 Cords Fuck cords Youd think a 20 ft cord would be ok but understand you lose your own height of that measure in addition to being a safe distance from hitting your tv or other furniture You also need slack to move around safely In the end you are confined to an imaginary 4ft by 4ft area of play Anything outside of that ends up cutting the game display turning on the pass through camera abruptly and getting you killed 7 It takes three to four times longer to perform any task that isnt a button press as you random swing your hands through the air trying to figure out what shitty position is necessary to complete whatever you are trying to do Its cumbersome and just not there yet 8 When I go to play a game it is for rest and relaxation Stress relief Escaping this world Most people Ive personally ever gamed with do too VR might be immersive from the point of view of your eyes and somewhat the motion controls but otherwise everything about it just reminds you of where you are and breaks immersion Its self defeating 9 This is probably the biggest reason Theres too small of a market share to be profitable for AAA companies to shell out games For these reasons until everything works for every customer or these companies give swappable parts instead of relying on the one size fits all everything needs to be flawlessly wireless and there needs to be more comfort and ergonomics taken into consideration before it ever takes off Even facebook selling headsets at a loss with supposedly the best headset out there cant get it done Its niche at best even in its current form which Im led to believe is waaaaaaaaaaay better than 10 years ago,m0qldyi,5.0,1h835yc
comment,m0w44qq,DarthBuzzard,,2,2024-12-07 16:49:26,,,,but otherwise everything about it just reminds you of where you are and breaks immersion Its self defeating Never heard of this before Ive demoed VR to 1000 people and they all laugh at the immersion of a TV afterwards and call it archaic,m0vo3z0,6.0,1h835yc
comment,m0x4mce,Mucher_,,1,2024-12-07 20:01:57,,,,Yea its almost certain other people have a better experience than I did I would also question how much these people like it when they are trying to play in an actual house versus a demo that is setup for the best experience possible as well as curiosity I mean that genuinely and not snarky Many people have kids and pets that dont give a second thought to running through cords the setup time swapping users etc The 3D effects are cool but it was a slog to do anything I tried playing with a controller after and my experiences with these games instantly improved Once the new wears off as it is definitely neat the detriments start to become more apparent in a real scenario I just wanted to toss my opinion out there Theres so much hype and talk and it just really was not a great experience I bought no mans sky tetris and another I dont remember off the top of my head No mans sky probably offered the biggest difference as tetris was still tetris with some cool 3D effects I purchased these games because they were not VR exclusive and Im glad I made that choice since I sent it back I can still play those games I suspect there might be others that could benefit from my opinion even if Im an outlier,m0w44qq,7.0,1h835yc
comment,m0wfi7l,Huwntar,,2,2024-12-07 17:49:55,,,,I agree with some of these points but also disagree with others I think the concerns about the actual technology and the cords are valid in their current state but that doesnt mean things wont change as they go forward Wireless PCVR is very much a thing and Id argue that its actually more accessible than the corded versions due to the offerings from Meta being the most sold headsets and the cheapest Sure you need a strong network but when thats set up it works well Heaviness of the headset is obviously subjective but I havent had any issues since I got an aftermarket strap w an addon battery Some might struggle with this but others probably wont Again this should get better with the tech Needing a full room is a drag yes I will say though Ive managed to enjoy myself in the living room of an apartment without it taking away too much from the experience This and the set up required are things that wont go away unfortunately Immersion is where I fully disagree Sure some games struggle from unintuitive control schemes or relatively poor graphics almost always caused by the performance demanded for rendering a scene in both eyes at a high resolution but the immersion is unreal in the right games The sense of scale seriously just cant be explained until someone experiences it in the right environment Playing the Outer Wilds was what did it for me It transforms the planets which are unique to insanely exotic areas where your own sense of fear and scale takes over Suddenly mild planet design spoilers Walking on the inside wall of a planet orbiting a black hole is not just unique but massive and terrifyingly high Horror tense shooters are an obvious fit as well In a weird way almost every game becomes a tense experience through VR Half Life Alyx is a great example of this I will say though devs are still learning what feels good in VR and what doesnt 2 handed guns feel pretty bad generally as can melee combat if implemented poorly Archery and pistols feel great generally I do agree though that not every game would be best experiences through VR Im not sure Id want to play a long RPG or Stardew Valleyesque game in it Strategy games as well For all those reasons I really hope it takes off and grabs mainstream adoption because it is so deserving of games that can make use of it,m0vo3z0,6.0,1h835yc
comment,m0x8man,Mucher_,,1,2024-12-07 20:23:54,,,,First thank you for such a well thought out reply I appreciate your points and have little to add from a PC perspective Personally I will never give Meta a penny no matter how accessible or affordable it is I really dont mean this as a jab at anyone but it pains me that they are the current holder of the best cheap headset Also the fact you have to have a facebook account just to use the thing keeps me away as I never have and never will have a FB account I digress I think the biggest take away I got from your info is that fast paced short session quick match games seem to offer the best experience I limited myself to games that werent VR exclusive and thus was unable to test out that type of game Some of them looked fun If your goal is 30 min to 1 hour and on a wireless headset I could see the experience being better I also appreciate your short analysis of different game type controls you mentioned I honestly havent come across info like that There is zero chance I would ever play a horror game lol I dont enjoy jump scares and stuff I watched people play VR resident evil and I just dont hate myself that much lol Another point you made makes a ton of sense regarding genres The types of games you mentioned like long RPGs or long games in general definitely hit home for me Perhaps in the future I will give it another go and try some shooters but that sweet ass pathfinder game is more what Im into I dont play shooters very often I too hope that it progresses theres so many annoyances to deal with from my perspective I also hope the controls advance Everyone seems to echo the handheld controllers but I would much rather prefer a pair of gloves that track my finger movements Part of what kills the immersion for me is that If you want me to grab something i should be able to open my hand reach for the object then close my hand None of this every button changes the context of your movements mess Its not intuitive and just feels like Im trying to play a game with extra steps Again thank you for the insight I hope I wasnt too wordy I struggle with that but wanted to clarify and such,m0wfi7l,7.0,1h835yc

comment,m0ri3e5,DomLite,,1,2024-12-06 20:32:21,,,,Speaking from experience I just replaced my 10yearold custom built PC because my graphics card was so old it was no longer supported by the manufacturer and a game that I wanted to play required a newer driver set which was not available for my GPU Up to this point Ive been playing a lot of modern games and getting surprisingly decent performance out of them Some looked better than others and some I was able to get nice visuals out of at the price of a little frame rate loss but it held up surprisingly well For what I spent on that PC a decade ago I now have a modern machine that I expect to last me another 10 years or so and its running games that the previous one was choking on slightly at medium settings at a buttery smooth 60 FPS at max settings Even prior to this upgrade Ive been saying that consoles are becoming less and less appealing if you really enjoy gaming Yeah theres a handful of exclusive titles but more and more these days everything is coming to PC even if its delayed a little bit because deals are cut to give consoles a bit of an edge due to timed exclusivity Then when it does come to PC you get to putz with the settings and possibly make things look andor run even better than it did on console play with mods all that fun stuff To top that off especially these days upgrading a console means that if you want to continue playing your older games you have to hold on to the previous one and your games because backwards compatibility is simply not a consideration anymore it seems or you have to buy a new version from a digital storefront thats been specifically made to run on your new console even though you already own it Upgrade your PC Heres everything you owned through Steam GOG Epic etc and it probably runs better now Enjoy Thats not to say that consoles dont still have a place but back in the day they made a lot more sense because PCs simply didnt have the kind of power dedicated to gaming that consoles did for the most part or it was overly complex at a time when not everyone was super computer literate Were slowly reaching a point where buying a console is going to cost almost as much as buying a decent gaming PC and its going to do far less Thats not necessarily a bad thing for people who just want to plug and play and use it as a media center but its eventually going to hit critical mass where a console is basically Heres the same hardware but with proprietary software and more restrictions and its going to be very hard to justify console over PC I grabbed a PS5 about a year ago and Im honestly starting to regret having done it because the exclusives that I wanted to play on it are all now on PC and I have more than enough PC power to run them just as well Honestly Im about to tap out on the idea of consoles outside of Nintendo stuff because they tend to do stuff that out there and innovative and have vast libraries of actual exclusives PS4 and PS5 were bought for atthetime exclusives that no longer are and of the one or two games that actually are I cant really justify the price tag When consoles start delivering diminishing returns on generational upgrades is when they start losing the battle with PC,m0pt8y1,2.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qbwtx,jack_the_beast,,1,2024-12-06 16:50:19,,,,its funny that you consider 1440p144htz a baseline for performance and quality it pretty much isnt anything above 60 is a luxury in terms of casual gameplay,m0q0ox8,2.0,1h835yc
comment,m0qf47c,Mr_SlimShady,,7,2024-12-06 17:07:00,,,,Right just like 1600 is a luxury card I didnt say I was expecting that kind of performance from a 500 card I do expect that kind of performance from the 1600 card And saying 1600 is pretty conservative since the majority of the 4090 variants had a starting price of 2000,m0qbwtx,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0r2qsd,DaHalfAsian,,2,2024-12-06 19:10:15,,,,The most popular card on the Steam hardware survey is the 3060 which can capably handle 1080p 120fps or 2k 60fps Besides the GTX 1650 all the other cards in the top 5 are more powerful than the 3060 too,m0r0poj,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0r4t9n,monkey_gamer,,37,2024-12-06 19:21:12,,,,Yes Generally the price of higher technology comes down over time So that 3000 console now will likely cost 500 in 510 years Which will be whatever PlayStation 6 is,m0pw04m,1.0,1h835yc

comment,m0sulwy,Nozinger,,1,2024-12-07 01:20:27,,,,Oh the issue is not cost at all It is that the technology just doesnt exist We will still get more powerful consoles as technology gets cheaper and we get more powerful hardware but the difference is really not that big We are at a point where we just get improved versions of stuff we already have There is no big leap anymore and at the moment it absolutely doesnt look like there is going to be one in the foreseeable future That was different in the past The early 90s to mid 2000s were truly a magical and very wild time for computing development That was when those big leaps between generations were made ps one was a shitty 33mhz chip that actually needed an extra coprocessor to handle the FMVs on the discs ps 2 already had a 300mhz cpu networkign capabilities and a bunch of other stuff and then the next generation with ps3 and xbox 360 we suddenly had 64 bit multicore systems And ever since then we just got more of the same in more powerful The biggest leap we got was the fast storage interface with the current generation and thats cool but its not exactly something revolutionary no raytracing and pathtracing are not the net big thing out there The industry tried to sell it to us as such but it just isnt For the moment we are basically done with our hardware Smaller and more efficient is what we do currently Maybe at some point some manufactureer might be bold enough to go for a radically different architecture that allows for a bunch of new stuff but since that would kill nearly cross platform portability of the software i really dont see that happening The wild times are just over and we are shackled down by standards of times gone by and we aint brave enough to toss them away,m0pw04m,1.0,1h835yc

comment,m1ek9lp,Koil_ting,,0,2024-12-10 19:19:02,,,,I dont have it backwards they would most certainly sell more consoles if they sold them cheaper and that in turn would mean more software sales where they make the money Xbox is circumventing the issue by having people pay for a subscription service that can work on multiple systems which will probably end up working for them If the Series X was 300 out the gate and the PS5 was going for 700 obviously Xbox would have sold a lot more Series Xs than it did which in turn gets more people onto the platform Considering how much they through into game companies they could take the up front hit,m18d6k7,6.0,1h835yc
comment,m1esf7w,SlightlyOffWhiteFire,,1,2024-12-10 20:01:10,,,,Actually i looked it up stupid of me not to and consoles are produced for around their msrp usually at a loss Figures arent exact and vary but that seems to be generally true The issue with your argument still is that you are making massive assumptions about the market Mostly that again reducing the price will result in a massive uptick in sales Honestly I blame the way we teach economics Students are taught the basic supplydemand curve stuff which becomes the a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing problem Im really not interested in taking this argument further because you keep repeating the same exact mistake Suffice it to say that if sony or microsoft decided to take an additional 200 dollar hit on each console they would have to expect AT LEAST a 200 dollar uptick PER CUSTOMER in revenue from licensing and direct sale from their own studios That is an absolutely absurd figure that you are just assuming is true without evidence What you arent getting is profit margins If you shrink profit margin too much then it doesnt matter how many units you sell itll never cover the losses Thats why there are Ferraris and Renaults You cant sell a ferrari for the price of a standard car and make money,m1ek9lp,7.0,1h835yc

comment,m0puvt2,chth,,14,2024-12-06 15:19:42,,,,Exactly GTA V came out right after I graduated high school and Ill be 30 in 2 months Sure GTA V now looks a lot better on my Xbox series X than it did on my PS3 but it only looks marginally better than it did on my gaming PC in 2015 GTA IV on pc can come very close to V in terms of visual fidelity and even playing it through a backwards compatible Xbox is really not that much different from a current generation release beyond having low res textures However the second you try to turn 3 VC or San Andreas into modern looking games youre faced with a huge burden because game design was much more limited in how we could animate characters and the environment You can give CJ 8k textures but his body will still move like youre playing a PS2 Your mission structure is still designed around the limitations of hardware at the time as well In that sense I cant see there being many more dimensions that could be added requiring new hardware that would make our current games feel clunky and outdated,m0pso7j,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qda3i,None,,1,2024-12-06 16:57:22,,,,I booted up Infamous 1 2 Second Son and First Light recently Graphically they hold up even if theyre a teensy bit dated but the biggest difference I noticed was the animation quality Side NPCs had basic stock animations moreso in 1 and 2 than SS and FL than today where side NPCs today sometimes have better animations than even Cole did as the main character But even in SS and FL which are gorgeously rendered and animated games Delsin and Fetch were still a bit wooden compared to someone modern like Aloy,m0pso7j,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qnq7s,None,,1,2024-12-06 17:51:35,,,,SS holds up really well It honestly deserved a better reception than it got But people were cranky that they lost Cole and I think the Native representation was a little too ahead of its time for people to appreciate FL is basically just a victory lap DLC for SS Its good especially if you liked Fetch It gives you a quick little prequel and expands her moveset I think but the game mostly exists as an excuse for its time trial mode where you fight waves of baddies as Fetch Solid lil 8510 DLC,m0qmdwf,5.0,1h835yc
comment,m0qpt4r,That-Maintenance1,,1,2024-12-06 18:02:19,,,,SS holds up really well Yeah gameplay wise it was the best of the series even if the story wasnt quite on par with the first 2 Theres just nothing thats compared to it since imo Its basically the ultimate super power game without feeling locked to one playstyle like in Batman and Spiderman games FL is basically just a victory lap DLC for SS Yeah having loved the movement and feel of neon the most Im surprised I didnt hear about it back when it released Ill need to search around and get a playthrough in Ive been searching for a new game to scratch the itch and I picked up the Prototype games and Sunset Overdrive at the last Steam sale in hopes of catching that same feeling all 3 of the main inFAMOUS games gave me,m0qnq7s,6.0,1h835yc

comment,m0pz0u9,LazyLizzy,,3,2024-12-06 15:42:13,,,,Im on mobile so Im going to keep this short Game engines are not the consoles responsibility a game engine is a suite of tools a developer uses to make a game Engines contained everything from audio physics level designing and having built in libraries for said things Sony or Xbox or Switch cant dictate engines Most companies use the same engines these days anyway unity or unreal unless they run an in house game engine like Bethesda And if you play PC you know its not the engine that makes a game run at 400 fps but the developer and how good they can optimize their project within said engine PS Consoles get a buff for optimization becUse they all have the same hardware in it which really cuts down on complexity for the project and the hardware it needs to support,m0pwk1g,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0q08fw,LazyLizzy,,1,2024-12-06 15:48:38,,,,Ill add to my reply here unreal and unity support consoles natively You dont need a special game engine for a console you just tell the engine what console youre building for And if you want to make the same game work on Xbox the ln you gotta either write it from the ground up time saved cause art and stuff is done already or port it over which can cause its own host of optimization problems Lot of times its easier to make a game for PC and make the game in a way with console releases in mind,m0pzeo8,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qkmsk,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-12-06 17:35:33,,,,Ive found the opposite personally I used to do Wii demos to people and also did VR demos Out of the two Wii never caused anyone to feel like it was anything special but VR has consistently blown minds and caused people to burst into tears in a good way I think that your examples were great leaps but smaller than VR because we already played arcade games so having them at home is just taking the same experience and applying it to your couch CRT 480p TVs to HD TVs revealed plenty of extra detail but at the end of the day its just extra resolving power of graphics and art and doesnt change gameplay Your Zelda example is where things really took a big leap it was both a graphical and gameplay change but even still the control scheme and output device TV still remained the same or similar What makes VR so different is that it is a radical change in control scheme and the only form of digital media of the last 100 years that goes outside the rectangular box that all prior media was displayed on With VR there is no TV no screen just a seamless 3D view,m0qhpk3,3.0,1h835yc

comment,m0qxxbr,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-12-06 18:44:55,,,,You are right that VR is clearly clunky and uncomfortable and that can definitely detract from things If someone can get beyond that then its a crazy concept in general The idea that you can feed imagery and audio into your sensory system to trick the brain that it is having an experience outside of reality is crazy and is one of those sufficiently advanced technologies are indistinguishable from magic examples What brought people to tears were a few things Astro Bot on PSVR which in many ways is like trying Mario 64 for the first time its like stepping into a 3D platformer where it all comes to life Half Life Alyx especially the moments with the striders as its an overwhelming feeling and Star Wars Vader Immortal as it brings the fantasy of being a Jedi and standing before Darth Vader to life for the first time,m0qv53z,5.0,1h835yc

comment,m0sczsh,KrackSmellin,,1,2024-12-06 23:28:03,,,,Think about how gaming hardware working in comparison to a PC The PS5 has old ass video in comparison to something like a 3090 or even a 4090 which kick its ass in comparison But imagine if a gaming company comes along and says optimize the game to work on a 3070ti wiht a i7 8 core proc and tweak it based on the config You could probably do some amazing things But thats what the huge difference on consoles vs PCs are the fact that NIVIDIA finally stepped up these last few years with their apps to sort of know what settings are peak for a game and a certain model video card Dreamcast was an amazing console because it was basically a Windows CEME OS an optimized Direct X release and then games which were geared to eek every ounce of performance from the system Thats why the games looked great for their time especially postN64 being a disc GDR based 1Gb format to make games do what was pretty damn good looking at the time The problem is gaming PCs are mixtures of Frankenstein specs speeds of memory speeds of processors numbers of cores models of video cards etc So many sliding options which is why your can always tweak another setting to make things look amazing,,0.0,1h835yc

comment,m10zn4d,CodyRidley080,,1,2024-12-08 13:28:14,,,,Consoles especially have plateaud for a while outside of what they actually SELL you vs what tech is available vs how they actually utilize the tech out there for performance Since they keep pushing graphics because its easier to showcase to potential customers they reached that level without having appropriately kept performance in level Now they can really only sell you performance upgrades Nintendo is not part of this as much but the same rules apply They have graphics to still sell you and performance they still deny you to sell later because of price points they want to reach For good and ill I am chasing experiences at this point I would sooner buy a Meta Quest 3s or 4 to have new experiences than a next console outside of Switch 2 because you know I have a Steam Deck so I get PC experiences I have a PS5 and Series X I dont want whatever is next without a VERY VERY strong reason,,0.0,1h835yc

comment,m0r678p,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-12-06 19:28:38,,,,VR headsets will remain a niche product Youre basing that off the idea that people arent buying into current products but theyre going to drastically evolve Holograms cannot be invented in the next 20 years so VR has 20 years to improve until consumers want to buy in You bring up Google Glass and stuff as examples of glasseslike devices that people dont care for but thats precisely because they lack value What if VR was in a sunglasseslike form factor Now you have value combined with a decent form factor rather than just one,m0r2pkw,4.0,1h835yc

comment,m0y07a2,LARGames,,1,2024-12-07 22:56:25,,,,The fact you think its a gimmick means you dont actually get it Its been more than there for many years Since the Rift CV1 came out with the touch controllers The only issue for a long time has just been developer motivation to create for a comparatively small user base And yes the switch does dominate every other console But the quest headsets arent even the lowest selling console this generation If VR headsets are niche then so is most other console gaming If you go into a walmart theres a Quest section among all the other console sections Theres millions of active users in games The past few years Quest headsets have been one of the top selling consoles And this year specifically if you checked even amazon the BEST selling consoles The total amount sold still has the Switch on top However the Quest beat the Switch this year specifically You can say that the switch is finally winding down but the fact that the Quests are competing at all means its very very far from niche at this point,m0uicmn,4.0,1h835yc
