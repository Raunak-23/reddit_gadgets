comment,mu1g8yp,ItsmeWillyP,,1573,2025-05-24 17:29:16,,,,From the article you guys are either too lazy or too stupid to read Frank Azor made the statement in a post on X formerly Twitter where he replied to PC hardware YouTuber Michael Quesada who asked how putting 8GB of VRAM on a new graphics card can be justified in 2025 In response Azor said that the majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory adding that the most played games WW worldwide are mostly esports games We wouldnt build it if there wasnt a market for it If 8GB isnt right for you then theres 16GB Same GPU no compromise just memory options Theres nothing wrong with what was said,,0.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu2unvy,turikk,,436,2025-05-24 22:14:38,,,,Its true A vast majority of PC gaming worldwide is on low demand esports games like League of Legends or PUBG at low settings Think outside the box of Reddit and gamers dreaming about ultra settings and instead remember places like PC bangs and Internet Cafes,mu1g8yp,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu38ack,Bamstradamus,,93,2025-05-24 23:39:57,,,,The last 2 gens of GPU releases I have been wondering why suddenly VRAM is being treated like this massive bottleneck Personally I still look at base raster performance if the base rasterization is good then thats what matters I know frame gen and raytracing lean on the VRAM harder then resolution would alone but if you care about running them at 4K your not buying a mid tier card anyway,mu2unvy,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu3btq7,turikk,,38,2025-05-25 00:02:23,,,,Its interesting because the reasons require a bit of nuance and arent necessarily false VRAM is relatively cheap and for the most part it doesnt cost AMD or NVIDIA that much to double the memory storage on a card But the margins on these products are incredibly thin and as Frank pointed out for a huge chunk of that audience its a great product Additionally when you do run out of VRAM its catastrophic on performance not something like a little bit less frames VRAM has definitely been victim to being slung around as a huge benefit or something that doesnt matter or the key indicator of performance much rarer but it used to be told as such But it does matter just not necessarily in the way it would seem on the surface,mu38ack,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu3hp3w,Raddish_,,19,2025-05-25 00:40:46,,,,VRAM is more a limitation nowadays if youre trying to locally host Ai which a lot of people are suddenly interested in doing I have a 16gb card that I cant fathom would have any trouble with any video game but it can only run a dumb distilled deepseek model,mu3btq7,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu49e5o,coltonbyu,,5,2025-05-25 03:51:21,,,,Feels like if your on AMD you are already hamstrung I have 24gb vram but still feel super limited on optionstools,mu3hp3w,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu4cl8e,Raddish_,,2,2025-05-25 04:16:53,,,,Yeah I have NVIDIA so I cant really comment on that So much software is configured for NVIDIA tho like their monopoly and thus why theyre the second most valuable company in the world right now is on GPU software compatibility funnily enough it has nothing to do with the hardware in a vacuum,mu49e5o,6.0,1kucwwz
comment,mudhi3r,ilyich_commies,,1,2025-05-26 17:24:42,,,,Yeah and you also have machine learning researchers and engineers running local experiments with toy models before spending half a million on cloud compute for real stuff A dualquad 4090 or even 3090 rig is a beast for that kind of stuff,mu3hp3w,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu4yr6n,Emu1981,,3,2025-05-25 07:43:49,,,,it doesnt cost AMD or NVIDIA that much to double the memory storage on a card It does cost more than most people realise That said there is also the consideration of if they add too much VRAM to GPUs then people will start buying them for compute workloads which would be detrimental to the gaming market,mu3btq7,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu52b3u,turikk,,5,2025-05-25 08:19:38,,,,Its less than 30 to move from 2GB chips to 4GB chips 8gb total to 16 then again thats about what the cost is for the user too with the RX 9060 XT so its not like AMD is ripping people off AIBs only make like 1020 a card when they sell these its really abysmal margins,mu4yr6n,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu4y3h2,frostygrin,,4,2025-05-25 07:37:13,,,,Additionally when you do run out of VRAM its catastrophic on performance not something like a little bit less frames Its true and false Some games do manage a VRAM shortage by shifting the resources in and out of VRAM but it has a significant if not catastrophic impact on framerate and requires more system RAM too,mu3btq7,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu561ma,Spaceqwe,,4,2025-05-25 08:57:55,,,,Forza Horizon 5 is one of those games that manages it well I set the textures to extreme on my 4GB card and I was able to get around 90 fps while being massively out of vram Game was almost using 4GB of my DDR3 system memory on top of the 4GB of my rx 550,mu4y3h2,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu594je,frostygrin,,5,2025-05-25 09:30:17,,,,One caveat to this is whether youre actually getting extreme textures Many games downgrade quality sometimes visibly in case of VRAM shortage,mu561ma,6.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu6o5p1,ender89,,1,2025-05-25 15:25:27,,,,VRAM is important because it allows you to preload high definition assets into the VRAM because PC games dont have a universal way to stream textures from storage at low latencies Microsoft is pushing for direct storage which would allow the gpu to pull textures at high speeds from the high speed ssd without passing through the cpu The technology is already available on modern consoles but pc players need more vram to make it happen,mu38ack,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,muwedbx,FatBoyStew,,1,2025-05-29 15:31:55,,,,People keep thinking their non4k cards are 4kcards now Hell even my 10GB 3080 hasnt hit Vram issues at 1440p its being bottlenecked by general speedprocessing limitations than VRam,mu38ack,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5wffw,typeguyfiftytwix,,3,2025-05-25 12:49:44,,,,That and modern AAA games are optimized about as well as a fucking trainwreck but outside of those most things run fine on older hardware A friend of mine still uses a 1060 to run things at OK settings as long as he avoids bullshit like space marine 2 which is a crash fest even on newer hardware for no good reason Anything that has AI frame gen as an option spent their competent software dev budget on marketing instead,mu2unvy,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mugqo2k,nordic-nomad,,1,2025-05-27 04:47:06,,,,Top tier gaming consoles have 16gb of vram So thats what most games are going to be pegged at for a while,mu5wffw,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,muluy4e,typeguyfiftytwix,,1,2025-05-27 23:31:37,,,,Thats not VRAM VRAM is dedicated to specifically GPU processes VRAM is part of the GPU itself Top tier consoles the ps5 pro have 16gb of RAM in total For comparison a decent gaming pc may have 32GB of ram plus 816GB of vram in the GPU Ram isnt bottlenecking PC performance Games run like absolute dogshit because modern devs are nowhere near as good at optimization as they used to be because it costs time money and requires skills and game development isnt a high paying field,mugqo2k,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mun9cmr,nordic-nomad,,1,2025-05-28 04:37:30,,,,Gaming consoles are weird The vram and system ram are basically the same pool Its not one to one for comparing to pc specs So yes while on paper it has 16gb of vram itll never have access to all of it,muluy4e,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu331xq,Obi_Vayne_Kenobi,,1,2025-05-24 23:07:13,,,,Ive played a handful of League of Legends matches since I got my RTX 4080 The thing runs League at 900 fps which is useless but also pretty funny Doesnt make the game any better though and Im happy I spend my time and fps with other things now,mu2unvy,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu3wfsl,C10ckw0rks,,1,2025-05-25 02:17:27,,,,I had someone ask why I went out of my way for the 12gb VRAM because I do blender stuff and vtubing However I also know I am not the general public on yhis matter,mu2unvy,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5x8ja,Skynuts,,1,2025-05-25 12:55:04,,,,On the other hand if you play games that are already easy to run on older hardware 5060 is probably not for you when you get like 400 FPS in League of Legends with an old 1060 on low and 1080p I think this whole 8GB VRAM is not enough is a bit overexaggerate but there are a handful of games that exceed 8GB at 1080p to 1440p The Dead Space remake and Hogwarts Legacy just to name a few For something thats supposed to last for a couple of years adding 8GB of VRAM to a lower midrange card makes little sense in 2025,mu2unvy,2.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu5doey,cdxxmike,,-1,2025-05-25 10:16:27,,,,The bias is there because I owned a PC repair shop for 20 years and no joke 80 of gamers that brought their PCs in for help had AMD,mu3mhm7,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5wxyj,typeguyfiftytwix,,0,2025-05-25 12:53:09,,,,AMD is common for first time buyers again because of low cost Its more popular than market share would indicate for people building PCs because people that are concerned about priceperformance ratio instead of maximum high end will also try to learn to build PCs but theyre not usually the technically oriented types,mu5doey,5.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu3n4y2,None,,1,2025-05-25 01:15:50,,,,He uh He has a point Im still on 6GB VRAM I dont do esports other than The Finals on occasion Primarily HEAVILY modded Minecraft and Skyrim It never really seems to struggle For example I push a consistent 120 FPS in Minecraft with textures out the ass shaders on high and 400 mods Nearly all of which relentless on RAM consumption I do have 32GB RAM at least,mu1g8yp,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5h3yu,MrMPFR,,1,2025-05-25 10:49:24,,,,RAM at VRAM arent the same thing the games youre playing are ancient so no wonder why even modded version are fine on 6GB PS5 tripled available shared memory besides OS and that is what caused all the current issues on PC If PC had caught up and bumped VRAM across the board then we wouldnt have all the current issues and complaints,mu3n4y2,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5k2v4,None,,3,2025-05-25 11:15:46,,,,Yes Im aware they arent the same thing Thats precisely why I typed them as VRAM and RAM Not RAM and RAM Im also aware the games I primarily play have been around a while but I play newer games as well Admittedly not the few which demand an absurd amount of VRAM and actually make use of it I would love more VRAM I just dont really see a particular need for it in my use case Especially since Im more than content with 1080p I respect thats not the case for everyone though Edit Also Those old games actually dont even run as well as the newer more visually appealing games either Thats the point of me specifying that its not vanilla At all Its pushed to the maximum limits,mu5h3yu,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu65tf5,MrMPFR,,1,2025-05-25 13:47:48,,,,Sorry mate might have reached a limit with people defending a 299 8GB card in 2025 Im using old HW as well GTX 1060 6GB and a i72600K with 16GB of DDR3 so no indeed not everyone needs to upgrade and you can probably use that 6GB GPU for many years into the future as long as you stick to lastgen and crossgen AAA and current gen eSports and indie games Yep modded Minecraft and Skyrim can be brutal Seus PTGI HRR 3 with large view distances and cranked up settings forces my brothers 1660 TI into sub 20 FPS at 1080p xD,mu5k2v4,4.0,1kucwwz

comment,mv00gme,hirscheyyaltern,,1,2025-05-30 02:32:23,,,,except that 8gb vram is no longer enough for 1080p unless you want to compromise your experience yeah you still can do it but you have to tweak a lot more settings more vram a lot of games would be set it and forget it rather than i have to turn down texture and shadow quality to reduce vram and also turn off the optional RT effects too etc its been shown that the current popular 8gb cards are capable of running games at 1080p from a rastercompute standpoint but quality gets lower because 8gb card users are forced to turn down settings in an otherwise playable experience look at any 5060ti 8 vs 16gb comparison,mu1g8yp,1.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu4k6a0,MooseBoys,,1,2025-05-25 05:22:25,,,,I dont understand the connection between resolution and VRAM requirements Unless something has changed dramatically recently games are still very bad at doing dynamic subtexture residency Most games dont hit anywhere close to 11 texelpixel ratio so unless you artificially cut off a MIP level when playing at 1080p vs 4K youre not going to save any more VRAM than the framebuffer maybe 100MB max In theory with perfect residency you can render a 4K frame with only 64MB of memory Obviously were very far from that,mu1g8yp,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5grot,MrMPFR,,3,2025-05-25 10:46:17,,,,What happened is that the available shared memory on consoles excluding OS basically tripled from PS4PS6 and devs used all that extra memory to push texture quality and graphics fidelity while taking advantage of very sophisticated data streaming APIs to reduce preloading PC pushes settings even further while often relying on outdated data management APIs Its no surprise that things have gotten out of control post crossgen when midrange GPUs after nearly a decade still start at RX 480 8GB in 2016 vs RTX 5060 8GB in 2025 So yeah its incredibly inefficient and I hope that work graphs can somewhat solve that At least according to AMD it can deliver insane 5080x VRAM savings at iso complexity in a compute shader demo from GDC 2024,mu4k6a0,2.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu53a4k,pmjm,,0,2025-05-25 08:29:43,,,,Whats wrong with it is that all of the marketing for the card is based on the 16GB version Theyre banking on the ignorance of customers who only see a 50 lower price and dont know what theyre giving up Theyre even marketing the 16GB version against the 8GB version of the 5060 Ti,mu1g8yp,1.0,1kucwwz

comment,mw9gzj5,BohunkFunk,,0,2025-06-06 04:29:59,,,,I cant see why you chose to do so because none of this pertains to the conversation were having Im not defending 8gb models not saying their performance is any good or acceptable And quite frankly you werent discussing its performance either I still think the 8gb option is egregious because it shouldnt exist outright it confuses consumer and its a scam you can just release an 8gb 1080p card under a different name if you want an eSport card for the eSport player base What I am saying is in direct relation TO your direct conjecture about people being on 1080p because they cant afford too Most people on 1080p actually do just choose to play in 1080p Im one of those because Id rather chase frames and many FPS players will agree And that PC cafes typically run 1080p is cheaper to do so Now if you want to say that 1440p should be the new standard thats a different conversation I think affordable cards should be offered at that entry point because 1440p monitors are cheap and well never seen the swell and shift to 1440p if cards remain at this level TlDr I DONT think this 8gb 9060 should exist because you can just make it a 9050 for that player base And I think cards are all overpriced anyhow But that was never our conversation and it makes your video irrevalaent You have to learn how to communicate with people,mw5flaw,9.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu22urn,SourceNo2702,,4,2025-05-24 19:32:52,,,,Im really not sure why AMD thinks these people would buy this card though Most of these folks have been using the same GPU since 2016 and thats unlikely to change unless it dies on them,mu1ms4j,4.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu2avsk,darxide23,,6,2025-05-24 20:19:31,,,,Youre right but getting downvoted by people who havent any idea what theyre talking about At 1080p 8GB of vram is enough Barely but enough However that applies to the resolution youre rendering at Not the resolution youre displaying at A lot of people on 1080p will see higher vram usage because theyve got some supersampling going on and the game is rendering in 1440 or higher and then downsampling to 1080 Of course this will require more than 8gb of vram but people are just dumb They use the High or Ultra presets without knowing what they change and what they mean Yea those presets will probably use supersampling Turn it off dummies and it will be fine TXAA is just fine at 1080 You dont need high quality DLSS turned on But with all of that said an 8gb model of video card shouldnt cost more than 200 these days Its the budget category it should be priced as such This marketing statement from AMD is just bullshit unless theyre going to price their 8gb cards for 200 EDIT I also just feel like adding that the entire cadre of people spouting bs like 1080p is ugly how could you play like that just sound like the audiophiles who insist on paying thousands of dollars for a network router that conditions the packets so the audio sounds crisper when streamed from your media server Its sheer snobbery Ive played 1080p sidebyside with 1440p and its often difficult to judge which is which on monitors up to around 30 inches or so If you have a behemoth monitor bigger than that then sure I could probably see the point Not all of us fart money,mu0xdjb,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu2o5s0,Val_Oraia,,1,2025-05-24 21:35:18,,,,Pretty much agree with you until you said you played 1080p and 1440p side by side and didnt see a difference I guess you might have been on a 24 1080p is certainly playable especially on 24 hell Im happy with my oled steam decks 800p ofc its a much smaller screen I did notice a pretty big difference moving from 24 1080p to 27 1440p though If someone has the extra bucks its nice Otherwise 1080p is perfectly acceptable Nowadays games made by lazy companies may need more than 8gb even at 1080 tho Theres a lot of unoptimised code and bugs causing memory leaks etc So many games out there using way more resources than they should Wasteful I bet the 8gb cards are going to be something stupid like 450 Maybe even more if tariff go to crazy percentages,mu2avsk,4.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu1hk0g,Olde94,,3,2025-05-24 17:36:02,,,,From what ive seen its more these dont have the raw power for these settings anyway I saw someone trying to make a point yesterday and half of the chart were average fps in the 20s Most would lower settings at that point Im saying this as someone who played BG3Hogwarts on a 6gb 1660ti laptop the last two years on a 1440p screen My limit was not vram but the fact that i only had playable framerate at lowmedium and even then it was only 45fps I would LOVE to see 16gb on cheap cards but i think there is SOME truth to it But its still hardly justifiable given price of cards and cost of ram though,mu0xdjb,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5lzb3,Kered13,,1,2025-05-25 11:31:59,,,,these dont have the raw power for these settings anyway They do though FPS takes a massive hit when the VRAM limit is hit even when the GPU is not fully utilized and this can be observed in many games today on 8 GB cards,mu1hk0g,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5pflc,Olde94,,1,2025-05-25 11:59:43,,,,I was unclear The 8gb variant were at 8fps The 16 gb variant of the 60 series card were doing the 24fps That is why i talk about the cards abilities A drop from 24 to 8fps is DEVASTATING but saying the 16gb allows you to run those settings when the performance is sub 25fps you are at a point where this card would lower settings anyway which then dropped it in to 8gb range if you aimed at 60 Itll be worse in the future though most likely,mu5lzb3,5.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu26guw,happy_and_angry,,2,2025-05-24 19:53:57,,,,Yeah people love to freak out about statements like these on here but the truth is that most people game on 1080p and 8gb vram is plenty Most new games are more than capable of using up 8GB of VRAM at 1080p Im sitting at over 9GB in the main menu of Doom The Dark Ages with the medium preset as we speak idTech8 is a pretty well optimized engine and id are notoriously good at optimizations I just did the same test with Red Dead Redemption 2 a 7 year old game and it peaked around 7GB just standing in a field I hit 7GB in Oblivion Remastered at 1080p inside caves 10 outside Most AAA titles have been listing 16GB as a minimum requirement for a while now even games like Blue Prince Claire Obscur says 8GM minimum The article even goes over this a bit AMD making this statement is a little ridiculous,mu0xdjb,3.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu1a3xx,Haelphadreous,,-1,2025-05-24 16:57:09,,,,Came here to say this its actually kind of a shame as well we dont know exact performance for the 9060 XT 8GB and 9060 8GB cards yet but if they are in the ball park of the 5060 and 5060 Ti 8GB models they have enough processing to run 1440p well in most games but are already limited to 1080p HighVery High in a few new games by their ram I dont understand the people that dont think thats an issue its not like games are suddenly going to become significantly more optimized 3 years from now,mu0xdjb,3.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu3duvh,DrocketX,,4,2025-05-25 00:15:38,,,,Just because it may not need more than 8Gb doesnt necessarily mean that it wont use more than that if its available As long as you have extra memory sitting around not being used your system will frequently just keep old data sitting around in cache just in case it maybe is needed again Your measurement may show that its using 12Gb of data or what have you but a bit chunk of that may be textures that arent currently being used Yeah it slightly improves performance ifwhen that texture might be used again but in most cases the different is going to be pretty minor Theres always a tradeoff between price and performance and if the 8Gb version is running perfectly fine it is rather questionable if its worth the extra 50 or whatever it is to get an extra 2 FPS,mu1qoou,3.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu2jdsu,LemurMemer,,5,2025-05-24 21:07:22,,,,Ive had a 2080 Super since 2019 and can tell you I very damn well need more than 8GB of VRAM because games arent made by the same wizards we had around in the 56th gen of consoles If my peers in CS classes are anything to go off of modern game development is so fucking doomed only passionate part of the industry left is indie games IMO Games should be made by people who want to make them not by those that have to make them,mu0jdm9,1.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu4nx7m,unematti,,1,2025-05-25 05:56:57,,,,My experience is that the gpu boundness comes from the ram running at 79gb full Its actually bloody funny how it can easily run at 50fps which is enough for me btw I finished gta vc back in the day playing it at 15 all through and then just start doing 1fps for of a minute Solely due to ram,mu346q6,3.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu1ae8q,anirban_dev,,15,2025-05-24 16:58:40,,,,The truth is that based on their pricing structure most gamers cant afford a card with more than 8GB Spin is to present it like something that is not even required which would make their very own 7600 XT from last gen the stupidest product ever then PS3 4 and 5 have maintained a similar pricing structure while targeting higher resolutions for comparison,mu1977m,2.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0iyva,iamonelegend,,238,2025-05-24 14:33:30,,,,Yes but it doesnt mesh well with any kind of future proofing Especially with big games like GTA 6 on the horizon who wants a GPU that might struggle in a year on the most popular game in the world This is mostly speculation though I dont think recommended specs for GTA 6 have been published yet It wasnt that long ago where spending anything over 250 would get you a graphics card that would last you half a decade or more at solid settings,mu0ibm9,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0usof,stogie-bear,,26,2025-05-24 15:35:34,,,,I dont think that future proofing goes with cards where the GPU chip itself is really for 1080p If the future games would require more than 8gb for 1080 theyd probably also need more GPU Im instead going to say that conversely the popularity of less expensive gpus APU devices like Steam Decks and Allys gives the game companies an incentive to keep low graphics modes alive and do more optimization that benefits,mu0iyva,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu29948,dastardly740,,1,2025-05-24 20:10:08,,,,That is the thing The issue isnt that most gamers dont need 8gb It is that given the capabilities of that GPU gamers shouldnt be playing at quality and resolutions where having 8gb would be a problem For example at 1440p max quality the 8gb is crippled but the 16gb barely averages 40fps and has 20fps 1 lows Playable Perhaps But you probably end up playing 1080p high quality to get up towards 80fps or so which the 8gb version handles fine As for future proofing the GPU would still be a problem If the GPU can push 100fps at 1440p max quality with 16gb VRAM it is that kind of GPU and an 8gb version makes no sense We can argue about pricing Like is a 1080p GPU with 8gb VRAM for 299 the right price I kind of think 279 would get rid of the criticism,mu0usof,3.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu5e6rt,nipsen,,1,2025-05-25 10:21:32,,,,I mean gddr ram that operates towards a smaller and incomparably much faster cache hub Which basically makes the vram a glorified SSD has always been about cost cutting Its been decades since ram was a noticeable part of the production cost Gddr6 and 7 also use standard modules so that the same ram block can be fused on different card models So what theyre doing is to save pennies on using old gddr blocks of ram that have been in storage for several years and sold to them for cheap But at the same time there is really no reason why a graphics card should need gigantic amounts of Ram given that you are not storing texture packs for the entire game in the SSD on the graphics card to begin with This is a weasel salespitch to take crazy amounts of money for an average graphics card but it is also true that the activeas in it is retrieved actively amount of used vram for a graphics context in even 4k rarely exceeds 6Gb If you further define active graphics context as the resources used that could not be retrieved from system ram instead because of time restraints we are talking about maybe 500Mb at the very highest Of course adding cuda routines that only operate on vram through the bus logic on the graphics card might put the requirement higher with dlss and so on But without that having 16Gb or 8Gb extra storage of really fairly slow onedirectional ram with abysmal write speed is not that interesting or useful In fact even Nvidias driver automatically allocates system ram for storing texture information Both major consoles now use SSDs at the pcie port for storing texture packs So to proclaim that 16Gb plus of the kind of ram we have on graphics cards is necessary is you know false Even if your requirement was optimal speed it is actually the case that the ram interface on the graphics card is not that fast compared to the pcie interface Which in turn is not really that fast anyway Its just faster than needed when compared to retrieving static resources from gddr blocks,mu0q1rb,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5frac,ArchusKanzaki,,1,2025-05-25 10:36:51,,,,I think the point is this If its truly pennies why not just upgrade it and only sell 1 SKU at competitive price And if its truly unnecessary why we see actual performance reduction in some games like Indiana Jones that is truly caused by VRAM exhaustion Ppl rag on Apple before for only using 8GB for Unified Memory in Mac or only having 64GB for base tier in Iphone because its truly pennypinching and marginmaxxing and to also maintain a pricr ladder Why we should give AMD or Nvidia a pass here,mu5e6rt,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5lhmj,nipsen,,1,2025-05-25 11:27:51,,,,I think the point is this If its truly pennies why not just upgrade it and only sell 1 SKU at competitive price Because the its been in storage no one wants this discount is maybe 50 usd per unit Production cost per memory block is of course higher per Gb for these smaller units but the production cost more holistically is incredibly low So had they planned for production of new memory modules in advance in bulk the actual tosales cost might very well have been lower It is a weasel salesmove like pointed out Theyre just shifting ram that the factory and distributor are afraid will not be sold at all So bad planning coupled with weasel salespeople is the reason theyre not just selling a bigger gddr block on the exact same unit indeed for a much more competitive price They know the market is completely ridiculous and they are simply making these choices as a consequence of that And those choices are not reasonable from a technological or productioncost perspective But they are sound as a marketing move for a salesperson And if its truly unnecessary why we see actual performance reduction in some games like Indiana Jones that is truly caused by VRAM exhaustion Thats a completely meaningless term But the reason is that this game like many UE games are constantly fetching world resources above a certain minimum limit regardless of whether theyre actually needed or not And then they will continue to exhaust the available amount of ram if possible You can configure that in UE but most just dont really bother The effect in Indiana Jones which is not really that common just to point that out most developers are completely aware of how silly it is to set it up like that is that once you get past 16Gb the algorithms stop using shared system ram as resource backup even if the shared vram pool is allocated as default And that avoids having to saturate the pcie bus with memory transfers from this very badly set up prefetch So its not that the size of the ram helps with speedily generating information its that a slower badly set up ddr4 system or a not really that fantastically clocked main system is able to offload the badly optimised prefetch system to only halt the graphics card memory bus instead of both the main memory bus and the pcie bus,mu5frac,6.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5lmca,nipsen,,1,2025-05-25 11:28:58,,,,Why we should give AMD or Nvidia a pass here We obviously shouldnt But the problem is that the AMD guy is also right if you look at how games typically use vram which now really is a glorified SSD as explained its a completely reasonable solution to just ditch it altogether Because we dont have algorithms even on machine instruction level that actually address vram directly Even if you use direct vram references in code now thats translated by the driver to some ramstorage that may very well be in system ram rather than on the graphics card Its completely hilarious once you actually look at it because the thing is that even if you only used the vram storage on the graphics card modern games will be designed to have passes that often require some kind of statusfetch or a resource consistency check in main ram before doing the actual operation So because of the way the graphics card memory bus operates basically all cards used for gaming and that dont have specific CUDA instructions on them that are literally the only way to get hardwarepointers into code after its been compiled nowadays could just as well replace the vram with better and not to mention much faster system ram Beyond that just ditching the pcie bus at long last and getting some asynchronous read and writes in instead would of course be the obvious choice Note that on ARM the size of the external rammodules is also used as storage in this sense The 16Gb on iPhone basically refers to an ssd While the closer instructionlevel memory is a different model and has extremely little to do with system operation ram And thats again very different from how the ddrram bus the pcie bus and the vram model was desgined to begin with Which is just on another level when it comes to slowness where each element here the cpu gpu and ddrram all operate towards a bus that literally was designed in the 90s Its incredibly outdated now With the weirdness coming in where a pcie ssd literally is faster than the main ram today While having external storage that would be faster than main memory in the 90s would be laughable Right But thats how that system has aged And adding more ssdstorage on the graphics card in that sense doesnt matter Its not doing anything for us on a better configured system even when keeping the now ancient pci bus,mu5lhmj,7.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5muor,MrMPFR,,1,2025-05-25 11:39:12,,,,While everything you said is true it doesnt matter when games are VRAM hogs stuck in the 90s and reliant on outdated paradigms PC gaming is stuck in the past Microsoft GPU Upload Heaps functionality they unveiled at GDC 2023 looks promising and bypasses the share copy BS over PCIe and effectively acts as pseudounified memory Theres also work graphs to allow the GPU to determine what ressources it needs instead of having to ask the CPU all the time In a compute renderer by AMD at GDC 2024 they showed work graphs can reduce VRAM usage by 5080 times Unfortunately all this new functionality I mentioned is too novel to be relevant for another 5 years Nextgen stuff unfortunately it seems and I hope it gets implemented alongside your suggestions,mu5e6rt,5.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5oed0,nipsen,,2,2025-05-25 11:51:38,,,,I mean its too novel to be directly relevant to any PC graphics card made since Geforce 2 While everything you said is true it doesnt matter when games are VRAM hogs stuck in the 90s and reliant on outdated paradigms The thing is that both major consoles the Unreal Engine framework most other frameworks even ones that are unsupported at this point like what Helldivers 2 is made on dont actually require the outdated paradigm They will treat any ram storage as vram just fine Microsoft launched their DirectStorage or whatever it was as if it was something new its a caching model that has been used since before the ps2 era But their framework now just graphs as you say the behaviour of the program so the ram can allocate on the even more outdated virtul paging memory model on external storage as if it was on the vram block So everyone is avoiding this paradigm except for the hardware manufacturers Actually thats not even true AMD are producing graphics cards for these consoles and for pc that dont have vram at all Nvidia made Tegra which again has no vram next to the graphics cores the graphics module is stuck to the cpu elements and the gpu and cpu calls are used against main memory interchangably This was in you know 2005 something that we expected would be the next paradigm to keep the gpu industry alive That theyd start making at the very least cpuadditions or else gpu modules placed next to the cpu cache like amd eventually did It would be better if they just made cpus that could be liveconfigured with instruction sets ie shader code could be uploaded to instruction cache like AMD would have were it not for Intels x86 should be free but not like that lawsuits But that was in 2005 We never thought that any of this would stick around once the vram was not used directly for simdoperations Right Because once you have a faster memory cache where the shader operations happen youre literally treating vram as a storage unit And the entire reason for having it like really was there in the voodoo era is gone Geforce 2 as mentioned is when this was not having a function any more So its not that the programs are following 90s conventions Its that the peripheral graphics card division is in a business where this convention sells a 100 usd graphics card for 2000 usd,mu5muor,6.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu6ai7o,MrMPFR,,1,2025-05-25 14:13:50,,,,Thanks for the interesting info I was referring to the new functionality I mentioned being too novel Really hope this BS stops during 10th gen console era PC needs to move on instead of being stuck in the past PC still needs VRAM for bandwidth unless we get something else than dGPU or an entirely new type of VRAM thats hyperoptimized for BW instead of capacity But then theres still the issue of legacy support so I doubt VRAM will ever go down on consumer Look at the PhysX 32bit backlash with 50 series and imagine how much worse it would be if older games stopped running on future GPUs Guess it could technically be possible to make it work with less or no VRAM but the amount of software rewrites and headaches probably makes it not worth it theres insane demand for VRAM from AI ATM Do you think the current trend will ever change because I dont see AMD or NVIDIA changing a single thing,mu5oed0,7.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu6fu1i,nipsen,,1,2025-05-25 14:42:27,,,,Good question Its kind of a good example to use PhysX to describe the problem PhysX never was very fast with dedicated hardware implementation or when using CPU cores it always was an NvidiaCuda implementation that specifically used Cuda execution flair towards the memory buslocal cache on the graphics card Similar things could be done in SSE registry hacks basically But having the toolkit there made it easier for a developer to use it But it was never used in anything except for things specifically sponsored by Nvidia Mirrors Edge is maybe the only example I can think of that had a PhysX run that was programmed in a way that required it to run on the graphics card to escape the resubmit curselatency The rest has always been made redundant by Opencl or any other kind of longer instruction programming toolkit that would then run just on a CPU setup or with distributed cores and few critical sections So although PhysX in theory could be a good tool its really just a Cuda marketing ploy that also really isnt relevant on a platform where physicscalculations can either be done in software or with gpgpu applications in entirely different languages Or removing PhysX support in new cards didnt exactly cost Nvidia a lot because literally nothing being released in the last 20 years or so actually use it and there is basically no reason to use it because of the stronger CPUs and more cores than what we had back then So its sort of a marketing ploy that now just would have Cuda engineers sit and pointlessly implement in new hardware where this type of shader program isnt what youre optimising for any more anyway There still was a huge stink about it But its not actually something that new cards from Nvidia would excel at unless it was implemented in a way that would target very old cards running with a very weak cpu So is it a legacy concern to pull that Not really It sucks to lose the window crashing in Mirrors Edge but theres nothing stopping new games from doing this in software a lot faster than Digital IllusionsDice did it then in PhysX probably off hand by one of their assembly or shader specialists probably one before Christina Coffin who did this kind of implementation for the PS3 spu setup for Battlefields later I mean Mirrors Edge was 2008 Remember ME was an unreal engine game with an app for the physics basically And that didnt completely run on the GPU on the PS3 which probably has an unknown story of some sort associated with it But all of that is genuinely redundant even on new Nvidia cards So the question isnt really if these conventions change The question is if these kinds of extra implementations for gameplay elements are even done at all Because thats what we really have now and have had for a long time Developers dont choose to implement complicated things specially when it has to be part of the main loops and not toolkitwise being possible to add as a free addition For example the only games being released on pc recently that have inscene per frame type physics or geometry calculations are No Mans Sky and Spintires Everything else uses gpgpu offline or not timedependent calculations like this Or else its things like Helldivers2 that has inscene calculations again I should say the Sony geniuses had them remove those implementations out of performance concerns and optimisation read someone complains about not getting 3000fps on their 3000 euro graphics card Theyve now quietly put those things back in the game for some reason But most games just dont do this at all They choose an implementation that decouples frame rate from the physics or geometry Which means that there is no interaction between live events and the game world at all You see oneshot resources being fired And thats the convention that has been PC gaming since the 90s albeit with some exceptions So will that change Doubtful But the hardware is increasingly capable even on PC,mu6ai7o,8.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu6rizk,MrMPFR,,2,2025-05-25 15:42:27,,,,Sure PhysX was a gimmick when it launched even more than RTX and not supporting it really doesnt matter people just dont like stuff no longer working it seems Again thanks for the interesting info,mu6fu1i,9.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu740gl,nipsen,,2,2025-05-25 16:45:24,,,,Well it is changing Thats just the thing You write programs now and you dont really concern yourself with it Theres always going to be people in the industry who use those conventions when speaking about it or when creating memory managers and things like that Youll always have some folks like Richard Leadbetter in Eurogamer who will be swearing to a convention or several like this is the only way to do things while romanticising the good old days that he never saw and have never programmed in if he has programmed anything at all when they wrote code on the metal But like I said its not really that Nvidia is not interested in making any changes The Switch and the followup are based on their Tegra setup for example that completely eschews that paradigm The problem is that their peripheral card business is printing money People buy peripheral graphics cards for mining and llm sure Theres an element of that driving the peripheral card prices up to comical levels But the biggest part of the market are you know aging gamers like the people at Sony or Eurogamer or IGN or other ZiffDavis stuff or Pachter and so on who will have disposable incomes high enough to just blow 3000 euro on a graphics card And a great deal of those people will also have time to go online and call for this and that game to utilize more of the vram or to create higher texture packs and things like that That traditionally was associated with vram but which now are stored on ssdstorage or system ram Making that term vram not really refer to anything relevant any more other than in marketing Theres a recurring one in the laptoprealm as well People turn up and are furious that the vram on their laptop with 32Gb system ram on a ryzen apu is only 128Mb And not understanding that the graphics driver is allocating system ram as needed to serve as vram which already is a meaningless term and could happily claim 32Gb if it wasnt for how Windows11 wants to sit on at least 9Gb at all times Would the programming conventions in schools be changed any time soon I guess would be a better question Would it make sense to introduce system design while making it clear that the level14 cache paradigms of Intel and AMD where ram is on the outer edge is the exception to computer architectures Would you start to see Microsoft and Stucky Universities simply treat something as ramstorage vs instruction memory In an attempt to bridge appmaking for phones on ARM and RiscV with the PC sphere Probably But Im not going to make any bets about anything In 2008 I said that if the peripheral graphics card business didnt vanish in three years it would be a miracle of some sort Then Intel successfully sued AMD to abandon their programmable core apu it had generic cpu and gpu cores And basically then extended the lifetime of the cachelayering paradigm it is literally over 20 years now since saving money on the most expensive piece of memory in the cpu the first layer cache made any sense for 20 years Which in turn requires the use of peripheral cards for the graphics modules even in gaming applications even if those graphics card modules are fused to the mainboard This is not a rational business driven by or frankly even affected by the technically most sound designproposals Companies that make the best monitor screens go out of business The most sensible mobile operating systems are not chosen for mobile applications The cpu designs that are the most economical now in the way that they werent in the 80s are still not chosen While programming paradigms that make the job of any programmer incredibly much harder than it should be are not just wished for by some CEOs spawn that cant find their country on a world map much less their arse with both hands but also by actual programmers in the industry Who then after 20 years of loving Big Brother eventually realize that theyve been idiots and move on to a database maintenance job that pays twice the salary This business is incredibly strange,mu6volc,10.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0yio8,GABE_EDD,,6,2025-05-24 15:55:02,,,,Thats not the point You cant run the game at maxed settings even if you wanted to because they wont spend another 8 adding 4GB to the card when manufacturing it Its not that people are unlikely to run maxed settings its that theyre not physically able to run the game maxed out And with the way AAA games have been creeping up VRAM requirements in the last few years maybe in the near future most AAA titles will require 12GB of VRAM for medium settings who knows,mu0xt1e,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu2jsa3,JoostinOnline,,1,2025-05-24 21:09:41,,,,because they wont spend another 8 adding 4GB to the card when manufacturing it To be fair its a lot more complex than that Theyd have to redesign the board and use a much higher memory interface which would significantly increase power draw We also dont actually know how much more memory would cost but its probably more than that Every customer would be happy to eat an extra 8 if thats all it was Im not saying they shouldnt be using a 12GB design with a 192 bit memory interface They did it with the 3060 And they should also do that with the 5060 Ti All Im saying is its not as simple as reddit rants makes people think,mu0yio8,4.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0jb52,Catch_ME,,67,2025-05-24 14:35:19,,,,I think this gpu ram issue is really a conflict between game engine developers and GPU manufacturers Modern game engines now are inefficient and not very well optimized for low ram At the same time AMD and Nvidia are being overly stingy on not giving us enough RAM and saving all the high ram yields of their GPUs to AIML developers We are caught in the middle of corporate propaganda My opinion,,0.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0m394,WelpSigh,,18,2025-05-24 14:50:04,,,,Its really not a game engine issue Textures simply have to go into memory to avoid stuttering 4k textures require more memory There are techniques obviously to manage when things go into memory to try and maximize it but thats a dev decision and oftentimes you just have physical limitations,mu0jb52,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0oeuq,Catch_ME,,15,2025-05-24 15:02:15,,,,I understand Its just weve always have texture compression techniques and art styles that run better on low ram environments I remember when Gotham Knights was released in 2022 It looked like shit compared to Arkham Knight that was released in 2015 A lot of the current generation of games dont look as good as 1 generation back Why The silent hill 2 remake is a perfect example of an unoptimized game The fog isnt used to hide textures Instead every polygon and texture behind the fog is fully processed and loaded into memory A wasted opportunity,mu0m394,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu1gp1j,Crakla,,5,2025-05-24 17:31:33,,,,Exactly I dont know whats happening I feel like every new game is increasing in system requirements for no reason like for example oblivion remaster runs like shit and requires 6gb vram to even start it while RDR2 has a vram requirement of 2gb even though RDR2 looks miles ahead in terms of graphic and textures,mu0oeuq,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5v6cv,MrMPFR,,2,2025-05-25 12:41:16,,,,Games are made around the PS5 console spec which is 78 times more powerful on GPU and CPU side vs PS4 and has almost 3x higher useable VRAM At the same time devs have abandoned baked lighting and simpler forms of GI for open world games and are heavily reliant on upscaling At the same time UE5 is still in betatesting phase and suffers from terrible stuttering No RDR2 doesnt have amazing textures theyre much lower res than all new releases and the rendering is inferior to UE5s Lumen system Technically its inferior but the artstyle is amazing Also RDR2 needs to fit into the PS4s smaller RAM while recent games can take advantage of the PS5s 12GB of useable nonOS memory,mu1gp1j,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5o6jv,MrMPFR,,3,2025-05-25 11:49:54,,,,When you give devs a HW spec theyll max it out PS5 having 3x the amount of usable RAM than PS4 results in higher VRAM usage on PC Yep Art style graphics SH2 was a broken betatest of UE 51 or 52 game built by technically incompetent game devs UE 55 is still a joke and its only now with some experimental features in UE 56 that likely stems from the CDPR and Epic that the engine is finally somewhat useable,mu0oeuq,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu1czlo,wamj,,2,2025-05-24 17:12:16,,,,Weve broken the cycle of developers being constrained by hardware for extended periods of time Look at super Mario bros vs super Mario bros 3 Both on the NES one at the beginning of the console cycle and one towards the end But the graphics improvements are substantial because of programming efficiency from learning the architecture,mu0oeuq,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu20zie,phibetakafka,,2,2025-05-24 19:22:02,,,,Theyre not the same hardware though there is the MMC3 mapping chip on SMB3 that allowed bank switching of ROM data allowing access to much larger amounts of graphical data alongside the fact that SMB1 was 8 MB and SMB3 was 64 MB Most of the improved look and feel is due to the fact that they had 8x as much room for sprites and tiles thanks to the MMC3 There were of course hardware optimizations like a framebuffer hack that allowed simultaneous horizonal and vertical scrolling during flight but in one sense its the complete opposite conclusion of your argument SMB3 looked how it did because it had access to more memory they were just able to build that capacity into game cartridges through secondary chips The best games later in the lifecycle for both NES SNES and N64 all used special chips built into the cartridge Its not at all how things work today you can kind of think of it like comparing a PS5 to a PS5 Pro except the additional capacity was built into the games rather than the system Now if you were talking about the leaps made from the PSX in 94 to 2000 thats more accurate although Id say you have to discount the first year or two as developers were literally learning how to make games in 3D on the fly And weve never seen such a huge leap in hardware optimization since then over the course of a console generation,mu1czlo,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0sb6w,WelpSigh,,2,2025-05-24 15:22:34,,,,Well I do agree that we are seeing less graphical payoff for newer advances A game with really strong art direction last gen might look better than a currentgen game with mediocre art Newer doesnt always mean better Many of the really expensive advances lately have been things that look amazing in very specific circumstances and otherwise is barely noticable I think I couldnt say if SH 2 is unoptimized because we or at least I dont know the performance consequences of doing things otherwise Loading stuff from storage and decompressing textures is computationally expensive This is the timespace tradeoff more memory means less time spent waiting on the CPU or storage reads and vice versa What seems unoptimized is very often simply a design decision by the dev team In other words the more VRAM you use the faster the game runs To be clear maybe they made a bad decision I dont know but just based on what youve said there it seems like it could very well be a perfectly reasonable choice,mu0oeuq,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu5qulx,MrMPFR,,3,2025-05-25 12:10:29,,,,SH2 is based on UE 51 and the issues with the game stem from the early UE5 build incompetence on the game dev side render distance behind fog and remember something about stupidly nongranular and excessive loading of massive chunks of the games leading to huge stutters The amount of improvements on the engine side made in UE 5356 are just insane and UE 56 with the experimental streaming features looks like it might finally be getting to a somewhat usable state Decompression is handled by CPU and with so many threads being mainstream it can easily be handled by background threads or alternatively run on the GPU with DirectStorage GPU decompression The overhead is minimal compared to everything else in the game on the GPU side,mu0sb6w,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu2k5vm,permawl,,1,2025-05-24 21:11:51,,,,Is there even enough resources fast enough dedicated hardware for decompression enough bandwidth and enough cache available on these lower models with 8GB vram for it to make texture compression a viable solution for the amount of assets and textures that modern games have Like on paper yeah compression is a solution but it needs its own set of conditions to work and for a problem created by hardware manufacturers,mu0oeuq,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0n6qo,im_thatoneguy,,11,2025-05-24 14:55:52,,,,Its not about optimization so much as people hating loading screens and pop in Gamers have way higher expectations for what is in game at any given moment Not to mention since we plateaued at 1080p1440p being good enough the only way to increase quality year over year is detail of whats on screen Which generally means more geometry and higher resolution textures People complain about ue5 but forget the ue3 era was the era of blurry textures popping in and lots of convenient elevators Before that we had loading screens every free hundred yardsmeters,mu0jb52,1.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0layf,ArchusKanzaki,,23,2025-05-24 14:45:53,,,,Why does AMD even need to walk into this mess Nvidia already drew all the attention and fire for their 5060 launch Everyone sorta understand that the 8GBversion is there for marginmaxing that is lovely for the SI and shareholders but they can let it slide just to stick it to Nvidia They really do not need to justify this existence Also as a note at least Nvidia is using GDDR7 memory AMD is using older GDDR6 memory so it should be cheaper per card for AMD This card is really made for marginmaxing At least they no longer walk into the same trap of using only 8lanes of PCI Express despite it will be PCIe Gen 5 Should be better for older system I do hope for AMDs sake it wont be worse than Intel B580 at least Will be embarrassing to say the least,,0.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0npva,Zapador,,0,2025-05-24 14:58:38,,,,Exactly my thought If you buy a low endentry level GPU its really only well suited for 1080 and probably without many of the options that would increase VRAM usage so 8 GB should be fine Im still on a 1080Ti with 11 GB and playing at 1440 I have never managed to use 8 GB of VRAM,mu0inth,1.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0uqpw,valqyrie,,8,2025-05-24 15:35:17,,,,Older games arent that bad on VRAM but new titles eat more and more as you can see here even at 1080p youre not safe from it if you crank all the settings up Also dont forget youre buying a brand new card for 300 You should at least have the luxury to play these games at 1080p high settings,mu0npva,2.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu13imu,Zapador,,-3,2025-05-24 16:21:49,,,,An 8 GB card is a low endentry level card that apart from not having a lot of VRAM also doesnt have the processing power to really run anything with all the settings cranked up so the problem will really solve itself You buy such a card to play at a moderate resolution with moderate settings and that will generally not require more than 8 GB of VRAM If you want to play at a higher resolution andor with high settings youll be buying another card that can actually handle that,mu0uqpw,3.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu15cz6,valqyrie,,4,2025-05-24 16:31:47,,,,Bullshit Where most players flock to 1440p and 4k 1080p is already low endentry level If you are suggesting that a 300 brand new card is meant for 720p gaming I dont have anything else to say Not only that I have literally posted a link that shows how 5060ti is capable of playing 1080p high settings but got held back in 8gb version due to VRAM shortage Also not everyone has this knowledge Especially people who build a pc for the first time does not know if 8gb will be enough or not 8gb vram should be a thing of past already Theres no need to defend a billion dollar companys planned obsolescence,mu13imu,4.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu17h1u,Zapador,,-2,2025-05-24 16:43:11,,,,I am suggesting that a 300 entry level card is intended for 1080 on no more than medium settings I never mentioned 720 anywhere had you read the comment you initially replied to you would have noticed that I specifically mentioned 1080 and moderate settings I do agree that 8 GB is still borderline too low today just having 12 would make more sense as some games are poorly optimized But my initial statement still stand that you buy an entry level card to run at a modest resolution and with modest settings,mu15cz6,5.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0ytd4,LessonStudio,,2,2025-05-24 15:56:36,,,,I would argue differently As a programmer I will program to the limits of what is generally available I would be reluctant to make anything for general consumers which would benefit much from a 24GB card But if there were a fairly large number of them out there I would I would not make it so it had to have 24GB but that it would be pretty spectacular if they did For example the LOD game which is played where the trees in the distance do that mutate into more detailed trees as you approach sort of thing would become less apparent with more RAM Other cool programming elements could be used where extreme texture compression could be used where the textures are then decompressed into VRAM You cant do this if you are having to dance the textures in and out of the card And I suspect many many many other cool tricks would start showing up if 20GB was common Plus as an ML person having a card with 24GB would win many hearts and minds One of the limitations with many ML tools right now is VRAM not processing power of the GPU Most of nvidias profits are now coming from MLAI people not gamers The AI world make their tools for nvidia because they have the best cards for this But if AMD had a reasonably priced card with 24GB or way more then the AI world would start making tools for those If I had the choice between two cards for ML 48GB but half the compute power 8GB but full compute power I would as would most choose the 48GB all day long CUDA is an nivida thing but if AMD put out a cheap high RAM card programmers would figure it out both ML and game companies I suspect if you talk to the people at unreal about consumer 48GB cards they would laugh and say When that happens we will take advantage of it but those narrow minded fools arent doing that for less than 5k any time soon They want to milk the AI datacenters for as long as they can I will make a prediction There will be a new entrant in the video card world A chinese one They will make a fairly crappy high VRAM card for an insanely low price It will stumble and trip for the first few releases But it will find its footing and become a major competitor The US will contemplate banning it saying it is spying on AI companies,,0.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0i6cn,chrisdh79,,0,2025-05-24 14:29:14,,,,From the article AMD has stuck its head above the parapet in the increasingly fraught GPU VRAM discussion with the companys chief architect of gaming solutions and former Alienware cofounder Frank Azor claiming that most gamers have no use for more than 8GB of memory on their graphics cards The statement follows the launch of the AMD Radeon RX 9060 XT which comes in both 8GB and 16GB versions and Nvidia coming under heavy criticism for only including 8GB of memory on the GeForce RTX 5060 As Ive just found in my Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 review 8GB is still just about enough memory to run many of the latest games at decent settings as long as you dont go above a resolution of 1920 x 1080 However demanding titles such as Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are already pushing VRAM requirements hard with the RTX 5060 unable to cope with this game above the Medium graphics preset even at 1080p simply because it doesnt have enough memory With the Radeon RX 9060 XT release date coming soon it looks as though AMD is keen to stick up for the cheaper version of its new GPU Frank Azor made the statement in a post on X formerly Twitter where he replied to PC hardware YouTuber Michael Quesada who asked how putting 8GB of VRAM on a new graphics card can be justified in 2025 In response Azor said that the majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory adding that the most played games WW worldwide are mostly esports games We wouldnt build it if there wasnt a market for it If 8GB isnt right for you then theres 16GB Same GPU no compromise just memory options,,0.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu1jds2,jaymemaurice,,0,2025-05-24 17:45:36,,,,Put it this way if you consider a billion grains of sand as the detail your eyes can see would occupy about a solid cubic meter And sure you can slice that up and say each grain of sand on that face of a cube might use 34grains of sand deep for deep colour information you can still slice that 1M cube so many times You can use so many of those grains of sand on so many mini abacuses or build so many objects and representations of objects but it is optimized and it still needs more than 8gb on the gpu yeah right Ignorance The only reason why games need more than 8Gb vram is because 8Gb of vram is available so there isnt a need for optimization,mu1gcrd,1.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu5sxps,alidan,,0,2025-05-25 12:25:32,,,,ok this came in my feed and im not reading it I just want to say a few things look at what AAA use to look like 1015 years ago with under 2 gb of ram and now games are bottlenecking with 16gb they dont look 8x better to justify it sure we dont need more than 8gb but sadly we need more than 8gb because devs are not able to optimize to save their lives and all the technology gen over gen is going into upscaleing look at crysis when that came out nothing could play it over medium not because it was unoptimized I mean look at this game it ran like crap for justifiable reasons and you can tell with todays knowledge where they cut corners to save frames some of its just because they were looking at a between 720p and 1080p resolution and this is 4k get to about 1245 right there even today an effect from 2007 still looks that good the game was single core needed 2 gb of ram and wanted 640mb of video memory you could run it maxed out on a 1gb memory card at a little sub 1080p I built my little brothers computer with a quad core athlon and a 4850 at the time and this part of the game was the benchmark I used today we have games like unbound that looks worse than need for speed from 10 years ago and on a computer that runs need for speed with resources to spare at 4k cant even run unbound at 1080p above 20fps the game does not look better than nfs and thats down to aesthetic choices personally im 100 fine with everything not being perfect in the name of optimization but new games cant even do that correctly either and they dont even optimize,,0.0,1kucwwz

comment,mu0shvb,ireadthingsliterally,,-1,2025-05-24 15:23:33,,,,Hell at 1080p I cant even get AAA games to use 8GB no matter what I turn on I usually end up around 65GB,,0.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu0z2oy,RO4DHOG,,-1,2025-05-24 15:57:58,,,,People purchase AMD products to save money Less VRAM is less money Most gamers dont use Virtual Reality or use AI generative tools that depend on VRAM,,0.0,1kucwwz
comment,mu1y1us,unematti,,-1,2025-05-24 19:05:20,,,,To be fair Yeah its mostly enough Been playing games at 1440p on the 8gb 7700S Now Thats nice and all But I did have to reduce some settings SPECIFICALLY due to the ram amount I dont NEED it That might also mean I get to save a bit of money And many people rather save money than turn everything up So most people dont need more Its fine Mediocre isnt bad its just nothing special,,0.0,1kucwwz
