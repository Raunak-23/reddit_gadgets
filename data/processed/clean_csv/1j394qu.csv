comment,mfybb0r,subaru5555rallymax,,76,2025-03-04 12:56:53,,,,How often are laptops out in the sun Probably more often than people reading past the headline Lenovo said that the solar panels can absorb even ambient light in a persons surroundings to give a user an extra hour of laptop use at the end of an eighthour work day,mfy4anh,1.0,1j394qu

comment,mfynppx,xclame,,12,2025-03-04 14:11:57,,,,Exactly what I was thinking The solar panel working even at 1 means that it works and you can claim that your machine is solar powered Then add in that the increase battery hours that they claim is likely under perfect indoor conditions excuse me if I bullshit on this But also if you are inside where it supposedly gives you 1 extra hour of battery use couldnt you just plug it into the outlet This ONLY makes sense outside but then also it DOESNT make sense outside because who is using their laptop outside for that long to make this worth it I will believe it when someone that isnt paid by Lenovo gives me numbers,mfykpap,3.0,1j394qu
comment,mfylv0t,Deamane,,6,2025-03-04 14:01:19,,,,Id love to see math on that because I kinda doubt ambient indoor lighting can provide that much power to a modern laptop honestly,mfybb0r,2.0,1j394qu

comment,mfzuw69,geodude224,,5,2025-03-04 17:40:07,,,,Doing environmental work I have to carry a laptop in the field with me a ton Granted thats a pretty niche use case but having some extra juice in the field could be useful for me,mfy4anh,1.0,1j394qu
comment,mfzy90b,natefrogg1,,3,2025-03-04 17:55:31,,,,All the laptops we have bought for work in the last couple of years can charge from usbc so an anker usb battery can keep them running for many more hours than the built in one Recently we bought a fold out 100 watt solar panel that had usbc ports built in that thing exceeded our expectations in full sun it gives enough power to the laptop to keep the battery full while using it until the sun sets,mfzuw69,2.0,1j394qu

comment,mfy5wzd,Peter_Nincompoop,,9,2025-03-04 12:19:43,,,,Why take a single screen and fold it to make two screen spaces What benefit is there to doing that when its not actually expanding the space Multitasking exists and two windows can be placed on screen at the same time,,0.0,1j394qu
comment,mfy6eyw,Captain-Highwind,,3,2025-03-04 12:23:21,,,,Its equally baffling since they already offer a dual screen laptop yoga book 9i I can appreciate pushing technology but sometimes concepts can stay conceptsprototypes,mfy5wzd,1.0,1j394qu
comment,mg19jxa,wingspantt,,0,2025-03-04 21:34:23,,,,I have the 9i and its great This seems like a step back for me Only benefit would be being able to fold away the large screen Otherwise it seems kind of pointless,mfy6eyw,2.0,1j394qu

comment,n47l9ib,geomedge,,1,2025-07-20 18:49:09,,,,The solar paneled laptop is quite a cool invention I could see many uses such as the fact that id be able to charge on the go and even when im outdoors and want to chill out after a long hike walk A tent doesnt absorb all the light so that light that does get through would still be enough to charge the laptop a substantial amount Though I do think it should have a none charging state where the solar panel by itself powers it and if it doesnt have enough power the battery kicks in,,0.0,1j394qu
