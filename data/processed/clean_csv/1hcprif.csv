comment,m20z8e3,None,,1,2024-12-14 15:34:55,,,,It doesnt sound like that safe of a thing to assume Or at least it depends how you define supporting VR My assumption is it will be similar to Apple Vision Sure it supports VR the games will run but its not designed for it so theres no controllers for it Thats gonna kill the actual practicality of playing If Google figures out how to make controllers that are good for gaming without being to scary or complicated for Sheryl in accounting to use for her virtual desktop then theyll beexactly in the same place as Meta is with the Quest 3 That is its selling but not at the rate its supposed to And the people who buy it use it for a year or so and then theres widespread user reports here on Reddit of the headsets collecting dust Google has a lot of work to do that so far several other companies have tried and are failing to get it off the ground level,m20satk,2.0,1hcprif
comment,m226f8d,DesomorphineTears,,3,2024-12-14 19:41:11,,,,Google isnt shipping first party hardware they want other companies to use Android on their headset This Samsung headset will have controllers it is for gaming as well,m20z8e3,3.0,1hcprif

comment,m1tq675,None,,8,2024-12-13 07:04:12,,,,Who gives a fuck about OS when you can use Steamlink to play your entire VR library from your PC You think anyone cares about the shitty free apps that come pre installed on any device Dont get me wrong I know the Quest isnt the best headset on the market but anyone developing on mixed only is developing a product that has no market of value Theyre making a novelty device that will be scrapped Companies cant even get gamers onboard with VR how the hell are they going to build an entire consumer base for an uncomfortable mask that does half the shit your phone does,m1tlyiy,2.0,1hcprif

comment,m1uoow1,None,,1,2024-12-13 12:57:49,,,,Its everyones foot in the door and its what will drive the technology the fastest The fact that theyre developing AR instead of VR does kinda show theyve failed to tap into the segmented market of gamers Its not that I think gamers are the key to mainstream because youre right theyre not Its that gamers as a community are not shy of new tech and are very often early adopters Theyre the most easy to sell on new shit and they cant even tap that market Even now that Quest is the cost of a Switch no one cares about VRAR the quest does both and not very many people know how the OS feels because not very many people bought it or any other headset for that matter If they cant get tech savvy early adopters to get onboard how are they gonna sell it to Cheryl down the street Theres no practical use The absolute best they can hope for is the same direction Meta is now leaning with their quest after failing to capture gamersactual users enterprise app suites businessfriendly apps that somehow try and make augmented or virtual reality meetings desirable even tho still to date no company makes a headset thats comfortable to wear for 60min at a time let alone a full day of meetings A laptop does everything a business meeting needs Can be projected or streamed to be viewed easily and comfortably by everyone I bring up gaming so much because its the niche market for the niche product Businesses dont need power point to be a fully immersive experience in order to better enjoy the actuarial graphs that Steve made So whats the niche that makes AR even remotely appetizing to buy into when Office 365 already has so many competing products that are more accessible and significantly more practical on a computer than a headset,m1tr9ls,4.0,1hcprif
comment,m1yxyzn,pahamack,,1,2024-12-14 04:11:05,,,,Im not sure if any of what you said is true about gamers are very often the early adopters Was it gamers who bought the first smartphones Id argue it was business users who drove sales of those old Nokia phones that ran on Symbian and especially all those Blackberrys You scoff at the business use case but we dont actually know that until the product becomes good enough for that use case Those early smartphones were pretty shitty too Youre on the right track with what are essentially zoom calls but imagine being able to put up a whole trade show or showroom in a virtual space with live vendors all using glasses that are just a little bigger than some raybans Thats the future these guys think theyll be able to deliver on Meta isnt a gaming company What they are foreseeing are tools for connecting people especially people that want to sell stuff,m1uoow1,5.0,1hcprif
comment,m1zcxi9,None,,1,2024-12-14 06:23:04,,,,Sorry I guess maybe its not clear I meant in gaming Gamers are early adopter in gamingtech because thats their market This is evidenced by the volume of preorder sales Additionally the gaming market buys into the latest and greatest pc components and monitors and TVs and sound systems So Im not talking about smartphones Im talking about who is interested in immersive experiences and thats gamers There isnt any other large scale market I can think of that is so digitally plugged in and ready to be immersed in digitalliving which is the aim of mixed reality Gamers are blood thirst for new tech They crave immersion and highly palpable experiences that feel tangential They should have been easily sold on VR and mixed reality But Google canceled Google glasses nearly 10 years ago because mixed reality didnt grasp a wide audience And again meta is now leaning heavily into business suite products because their first attempt at gamers also isnt panning out like they hoped when they bought out oculus in the first place,m1yxyzn,6.0,1hcprif
comment,m218j8j,pahamack,,1,2024-12-14 16:29:08,,,,id argue that business and social use is always the endgame for meta and going into games is just something to justify keeping on throwing money at oculus and VR tech in general some years ago Meta threw a bunch of money to buy a company developing lifelike realistic avatars im sure the use case for games is there but even more so for social and business use Theyre not a gaming company The business is built around connecting people and exploiting user data in a variety of ways,m1zcxi9,7.0,1hcprif
comment,m21wldv,None,,1,2024-12-14 18:45:04,,,,I agree completely and will piggy back by saying Google and Samsung are also not gaming companies Which is why I dont think VR is their focus Because it isnt Its not trying to be I just think that VR and gaming is the only way to get that tech off the ground in order to make it more accessible to a wider audience I truly feel that gamers should be the market for RD I just dont see any practical use for business suite apps that will result in a sustainable product for longer than 2 years just like many of Googles other scrapped innovations They couldnt even get AR eye glasses off the ground and they think people will want a whole ass mask Its just silly The only people asking for full immersion are gamers and no serious contender is pumping into that on the scale required to get it off the ground Meta has done the best so far but it seems like theyre waning now,m218j8j,8.0,1hcprif
comment,m21xnbi,pahamack,,1,2024-12-14 18:51:03,,,,The whole ass mask is not the final form These are intermediary products Thats why these companies are focusing on AR rather than VR The goal is to make them look like a pair of shades or glasses IMO its going to take a long time but theyll eventually get there Its inevitable more jobs are being done from home More shopping is being done from home Lots of blue collar jobs are going to be taken over by robots Things like meetings but also things like art galleries trade shows museums markets will start having virtual versions when these things get the actually good version just like the first iphone just like how smartphones were kind of a niche thing then blew up Technically speaking maybe cloud computing is the answer Get all the heavy workload out of the device and just hook it up to the internet,m21wldv,9.0,1hcprif
comment,m21z1ma,None,,0,2024-12-14 18:59:02,,,,Im all for the tech dont get me wrong it just seems to me to have been shown over the last 10 years that the general public are not quick to jump onboard with augmented reality stuff stemming back from the Google glasses flop Meanwhile you have a market thats itching to buy products that would further the research they need to accomplish in order to achieve mass market appeal for things like Google glasses and all that market wants is games to look more like Half Life Alyx Instead they keep getting shitty ports like Skyrim that have so much aliasing its unplayable without mods But if they produced more high fidelity high performing gaming experiences theyd have a market ready and willing to buy every game released at full price and preordered Im not a preorderer but again this market speaks for itself They could develop everything they want to accomplish for business suites by implanting and testing new designs in games Instead they seem to be trying to make another thing that does exactly what the Quest or Vive can already do without really furthering how the apps are gonna function on it Ill be happy if this pans out Ill even buy one but Im just predicting this is gonna flop,m21xnbi,10.0,1hcprif
comment,m1rrbuc,Agomir,,8,2024-12-12 23:02:38,,,,I get the impression a lot of other commenters didnt really read the article So Google is making an Android XR operating system and a modern version of the Google glasses As per Googles hack record I wouldnt be surprised if the glasses didnt last long before being pulled The actual XR headset is made by Samsung so thats a completely different kettle of fish I guess the lifespan of Android XR will depend a lot on the success of this headset But dont forget the Quest headsets also run on a version of Android So we could see more collaboration between Meta and Google and maybe both OSs will end up merging That is basically part of Metas long term vision for the metaverse and no the metaverse isnt that failed app and it hasnt been abandoned,,0.0,1hcprif
comment,m1tmdf2,Navetoor,,3,2024-12-13 06:27:13,,,,Based on demos and first hand experiences Android XR is already better than Metas Theres zero chance Meta and Google collaborate that ship has long sailed In 5 years I think Android XR is the market share leader,m1rrbuc,1.0,1hcprif
