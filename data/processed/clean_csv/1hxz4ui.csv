comment,m6ifweo,JohnB456,,32,2025-01-11 02:13:38,,,,I always think its a bit weird when people push back on a new innovative device simply because they cant see a use case for themselves Like just dont buy it then its not like this new thing being created is taking something from you and youre not forced to buyinvest in it It might not be useful to you now but later down the road it could be Also innovation leads to the evolution of that tech Sure its vertical here Maybe down the line that helps them evolve the tech to increase width Then combining the two could make a rollable and foldable screen You can fold it to 14 then size as a phone then unfold it to be a full on laptoptablet Or imagine those curved screens like we have now but now it can curve from the top and sides giving you a screen that displays a bit overhead like a half dome Talk about a wild immersive experience for gaming,,0.0,1hxz4ui

comment,m6in547,Xanikk999,,-7,2025-01-11 02:56:36,,,,There is cause for legitimate concern This is not my view but I can give one example It used to be the norm for browsers to have the fileedithistory toolbar at the top and not a sidebar like in most browsers Now only Firefox afaik has this option Its a simple preference but for many people its hard to adjust to these things and minor things annoy them especially for people on the autism spectrum So when the industry stops offering these things we are left with no alternative for the way we like things,m6ifweo,1.0,1hxz4ui
comment,m6ior2v,JohnB456,,15,2025-01-11 03:06:29,,,,I dont think that example works here at all Youre talking about a browser or software that can be used across many devices Thus affecting many devices with any change made and the impact is bigger What Im talking about is new hardware innovation That potential problems only affect that particular piece of hardware Also like I said you dont have to buy it While a browser you need to use for the Interneta browser isnt also a new innovated piece of software Also your counterpoint is about an aspect of the browser but not the browser in its entirety You probably agree a browser its great but you have differing preference What Im talking about is akin to the browser and not an aspect of the browser Like your argument would be like I dont want a screen that rolls vertically I prefer a screen that rolls horizontal But you agree having a rolling screen regardless is a good thing If that makes sense Sorry for the lengthy reply got carried away lol,m6in547,2.0,1hxz4ui
comment,m6njpis,NeuroXc,,-7,2025-01-11 23:06:55,,,,The push back is because eventually the old techs will be considered obsolete I wish we still had phones with physical keyboards I have to correct my phone way too many times on a touch screen because it thinks my finger is over a different letter And I have tiny fingers I cant imagine how people with big hands use a touchscreen keyboard,m6ifweo,1.0,1hxz4ui
comment,m6nlw3c,JohnB456,,4,2025-01-11 23:19:11,,,,It doesnt make sense it hasnt even made it to the market to be able to tell if it will replace regular screens Like I get your issue with the touchscreen But you wouldnt not invent the touchscreen on the premise you might not like it You still invent the thing and try it out If it seems good you push it out to market then consumers will dictate its staying power by either buying it or not Then you try and fix the issue that crop up from mass production and improve on the tech I highly doubt this is going to somehow replace all laptop screens Thats unfortunate your touchscreen is like that but that sounds like a bug I dont have a problem with the touch screen and my fingers arent small Not all touch screens are equal either,m6njpis,2.0,1hxz4ui

comment,m6eg5rq,TehOwn,,11,2025-01-10 13:47:14,,,,If implemented well it shouldnt get any kinks ever There will be wear and tear though as there is for any moving part As someone who spent many years fixing laptops my concern would be the screen connector Used to have a bunch of those wear out just with normal screens due to the lid action,m6effj3,3.0,1hxz4ui

comment,m6ksjs4,azlan194,,4,2025-01-11 14:11:15,,,,I dont think you understand the difference between screens and monitors in this context By screens they meant looking at several opened application on their desktop like a browser a spreadsheet a zoom call a calendar and what not So its annoying having to switch between different tabs if you are using a laptop with no other monitors,m6j3k90,6.0,1hxz4ui
