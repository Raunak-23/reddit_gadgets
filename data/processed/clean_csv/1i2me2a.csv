comment,m7g1bul,roiki11,,5,2025-01-16 13:16:19,,,,Yea it would be great But seeing as youll have to pass 500 watts to modern high end gpus I dont see it ever working out properly The board space and terminal size requirements are just too big Just like the 12vHP,m7g0s97,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7g1qwl,wkavinsky,,5,2025-01-16 13:18:57,,,,500w on a 12v supply for a round trip of 2m typical cable length would be 8awg on a single cable The connector needs to be better and the wires need to be much thicker,m7g1bul,3.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7g34a2,roiki11,,7,2025-01-16 13:27:33,,,,Thats why they use 8 or more cables And where did you get the 2m from The pcie cables are usually 50cm or less,m7g1qwl,4.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7gc5tn,wkavinsky,,3,2025-01-16 14:21:17,,,,Round trip distance is the important one so double the cable length Calculators for wire sizing dont go down to 12m they start at 018m All 8x16awg is barely the same current carrying capability as 1x8awg which is why you see fires and scorching as soon as theres an issue with one of the 8 positive wires,m7g34a2,5.0,1i2me2a

comment,m7izz4a,TooStrangeForWeird,,-5,2025-01-16 22:09:49,,,,If your power supply has the little switch on the back to change between voltages you can just replace the breaker with a 220240v breaker Just gotta make sure not to plug anything else into the same breaker And make sure its not the same breaker for your lights in the same room Is it a good idea Probably not Would it work Well I could get it to work Idk about most people I wouldnt recommend it,m7hb7xd,3.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7gff8r,None,,18,2025-01-16 14:39:39,,,,1000w is 8amps On a 15 amp breaker you can safely use 12 Which means we can go up to about 1440w before we start needing to discuss 30 amp breakers becoming a standard in NA homes for the office lol,m7g1h63,1.0,1i2me2a

comment,m7gsfp7,None,,4,2025-01-16 15:47:07,,,,what do you mean The plugs are all still 120v so a 30amp breaker works just fine for a PC You just have more headroom I agree though maybe 30 is too extreme because you then move to 102 cable which is a lot more expensive than 142,m7gotuj,3.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7gxxd1,trainbrain27,,7,2025-01-16 16:13:46,,,,20 and 30 amp plugs and outlets are different shapes You can plug a 15 amp cord into a 20 amp outlet or put a 15 amp outlet on a 20 amp breaker but a cord designed for 20 amps has a rotated pin that wont fit in a 15 amp socket and neither fits in a 30 amp socket Adapters are available its perfectly safe to plug a 15 into a 30 but if you go the other way and demand more current things can go poorly,m7gsfp7,4.0,1i2me2a

comment,m7hsk0g,RoboErectus,,6,2025-01-16 18:40:19,,,,Whats coming in 10 years for gaming pc 1 electricians installing 240v lines and outlets like your dryer or electric oven use Andor 2 gaming extension cords 12 or god forbid even 10 gauge with accessories for safely routing them through your house making sure theyre on separate breakers etc Or 3 grid tie Lithium battery setups that charge overnight to give you some hours of extra amps for gaming Maybe this gets built into your PC case In any case lots of accessories are going to start coming when theres simply no more juice to pull Even if things get lets say 50 more efficient yoy historically as we get more power efficient we still use more power An example would be lighting we use far more electricity to light our homes with LED than we did with Incandescent The lights themselves use less power but we use more of them I cant wait for all the shenanigans as people discover just how fucked the wiring in their walls has been this whole time Between multimillion dollar houses and wwiiera homes I have never lived in a place that didnt have some really tucked electrical nearly always as a result of handyman types over the years And somebow on a new build I discovered armored cable going directly into a pvc box,m7g1h63,1.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7j0vs2,TooStrangeForWeird,,8,2025-01-16 22:14:17,,,,An example would be lighting we use far more electricity to light our homes with LED than we did with Incandescent The lights themselves use less power but we use more of them This isnt even close Most of my bulbs are 512 watts Its not like I went and added a bunch of new fixtures when I switched over I could see some new builds adding more lights than usual but not like 5x as many For regular homes with a bathroom vanity like mine with 6 bulbs in it I dropped from 240W to 30W,m7hsk0g,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7jv1k0,kaleidoleaf,,7,2025-01-17 00:57:39,,,,Lol no we do not use more power with LEDs They pull 10 of the wattage and people did not install 10x the lights,m7hsk0g,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7j683p,ThePretzul,,2,2025-01-16 22:41:15,,,,Not really You can have a 120V circuit rated for 20 amps pretty easy Thats 2400 Watts with monitors and accessories taking 400 or less and the rest of the PC being maybe 400 combined at most,m7g1h63,1.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7jbiba,MeeMeeGod,,3,2025-01-16 23:09:14,,,,A circuit breaker cannot carry more than 80 of its rating 20 amp breaker would be 16 amps which is 1920 watts,m7j683p,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7krrpm,loogie97,,2,2025-01-17 04:15:03,,,,Typical wall outlet is 15 amps On the low end you get 80 of 15amps at 120volts 1440 watts On a 20amp circuit you can get that up to 1920 watts That all depends on the pc being the only thing on the circuit Someone could fire up a vacuum and knock out the pc,m7g1h63,1.0,1i2me2a

comment,m7g0lsp,mattcraft,,14,2025-01-16 13:11:39,,,,I hear what youre saying but then additional power conversion will happen on the graphics card taking up real estate and causing it to dissipate more heat Theres tradeoffs,m7fsv2x,1.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7p2i5x,nullstring,,1,2025-01-17 21:14:50,,,,You sure about that I dont think the graphics cards run off 12v anyway so there would need to be the same conversion going on Instead of 12v to whatever it would be 36v to whatever I think itd be fine,m7g0lsp,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7pf2eg,mattcraft,,1,2025-01-17 22:18:19,,,,Yes Im sure The stated goal here is to move more power and the method they chose to do it was to use a higher voltage If more power is moved then more heat will need to be dissipated There are other factors such as the power supply system doesnt exist and would be incompatible with all previous PSUs so all purchasers would need an additional component to use their GPU A standards shift is possible but unlikely You are right nVidia GPUs are running the CPU around 105 volts and the memory around 135 volts if I recall correctly There is already power conditioning that happens on the board and there are a lot of implications if you change the input voltage from 12 to 36v If anything 24v makes a lot of sense because many offtheshelve components are available for this type of power nVidia has had very little incentive to reduce power consumption but a lot of incentive to increase performance Their design has focused on brute power instead of efficiency Question is how far will they take it,m7p2i5x,3.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7g2rw7,None,,-1,2025-01-16 13:25:25,,,,I hear what youre saying so we invented a liquid cooler from Corsair for 45999 that covers the entire graphics card in liquid nitrogen to offset the heat Also you cant touch the liquid and theres a risk it could explode and set your home on fire if you play more than 45ish minutes Tradeoffs,m7g0lsp,2.0,1i2me2a

comment,m7hmk6z,None,,-5,2025-01-16 18:11:49,,,,Yup Sometimes Im right on the money like sulfur compounds being a driving component of cannabiss distinctive skunky smell and it not being a terpenoid or sequesterpene most times Im a laughing stock And thats okay having a wrong opinion or idea like this isnt bad People just want to point and laugh at others to make them selves feel better Do you feel like youre having a better day now,m7gy5q5,2.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7jm8kd,Bacon_Techie,,2,2025-01-17 00:08:41,,,,Wireless communication introduces significantly more latency Because of that it will never happen One thing that limits a lot of stuff is simply how fast data can be pushed through a connection and wireless communication simply does not allow that at a fundamental level And this has already happened components get combined and shrunk down All the parts are necessary and taking them away just means building them into another component somewhere else Take away the GPU you put it into the CPU or solder it to the motherboard Boards are used because they are the most space efficient and cost effective to produce,m7g5uut,1.0,1i2me2a
comment,m7lpgna,narkotikahaj,,1,2025-01-17 09:21:51,,,,Thats like saying that you hate doing things the most efficient way and youd really like more overhead with wireless protocols and hardware Not to mention the clusterfuck of EMI this would bring Sincerely an actual electronics engineer,m7g5uut,1.0,1i2me2a
