comment,mgh9qwx,dustofdeath,,205,2025-03-07 08:21:08,,,,So no GPU RMA but the whole laptop will have to go back to the factory disassembled reworked and sold as refurbished This will cost Nvidia more than just a chip replacement,,0.0,1j5dath
comment,mkrepx8,AllDoggoIsGoodDoggo,,1,2025-03-31 22:09:23,,,,Oh Im sure theyll still be selling them as brand new as long as they catch it before it gets to the initial consumer Pretty shady though to be buying a computer that was torn apart and has swapped out parts as for brand new pricing,mgh9qwx,1.0,1j5dath
comment,mggqobw,wilco-roger,,328,2025-03-07 05:31:26,,,,So theyre shipping junk right NVIDIA made a faulty product knew about it and shipped it anyway Is that the story,,0.0,1j5dath
comment,mggtwfq,elasticthumbtack,,136,2025-03-07 05:56:21,,,,Thats what I dont get How could they have missed this If they didnt why would they think it would never get noticed A recall of this magnitude is going to be way more costly,mggqobw,1.0,1j5dath
comment,mghf5os,covfefe-boy,,110,2025-03-07 09:17:22,,,,I think the numbers are that NVIDIA is selling something like 30x50x the business in AI chips now vs gaming hardware So they dont care they dont want to just give up their foothold in the gaming market but its become small potatoes to them so the best hardware goes to the massive AI orders and their gaming stock gets the worst quality stuff,mggtwfq,2.0,1j5dath

comment,mghnxjn,T_Dizzle_My_Nizzle,,68,2025-03-07 10:47:14,,,,Thats more to do with the AI side of the business than the gaming side though Their stock dropped after DeepSeek R1 was released something that made investors worry that we may not need so many GPUs to make frontier language models,mghhspf,4.0,1j5dath

comment,mghmn7m,Arnhermland,,27,2025-03-07 10:34:45,,,,Its barely down as far as I can tell Its gone down 27 of the total stock value on the year to date did you straight up just not check the stock price or something,mghk3s1,5.0,1j5dath
comment,mghntye,blither86,,-29,2025-03-07 10:46:17,,,,How is year to date helpful when they said last couple of months I asked because my close friend owns nvidia stock and whenever I see a news article about their stock dropping I rib him about it and hes always said its not down much 15 over the last two months isnt exactly massive Im hoping for a much larger drop,mghmn7m,6.0,1j5dath
comment,mgho9of,Arnhermland,,25,2025-03-07 10:50:26,,,,How is year to date helpful when they said last couple of months because 2 months ago literally a couple months was January 6th the start of the year,mghntye,7.0,1j5dath

comment,mghojsp,blither86,,-25,2025-03-07 10:53:07,,,,Isnt year to date the last entire calendar year from today as a starting point Ah perhaps not So 27 since Jan 21st edit I meant Jan 1st at work typo and 15 in last two months,mgho9of,8.0,1j5dath
comment,mghp6qv,Arnhermland,,14,2025-03-07 10:59:12,,,,Year to date YTD refers to the period beginning on the first day of the current calendar year or fiscal year up to the current date And no again if you checked its down 27 actually a bit more than that over the last 2 months which is also the YTD I dont know where you got random that 21st date from,mghojsp,9.0,1j5dath

comment,mgitcgs,itsalongwalkhome,,4,2025-03-07 15:21:35,,,,Its barely down as far as I can tell Well if you looked you would see its down 27 in the last few months YTD mishap was brought up after this and while funny is forgivable Its just silly you commented so confidently without checking hangman E,mgiriu9,9.0,1j5dath
comment,mgiuviu,blither86,,1,2025-03-07 15:29:11,,,,Meh I think the reason is they said massive and I wasnt convinced because as I say my friend has some stock Ive since asked him and he said he bought it ages ago so even the 27 decline YTD isnt a big deal for him although he did recently sell some of course he wishes hed sold more at the high point,mgitcgs,10.0,1j5dath
comment,mgixfhz,itsalongwalkhome,,2,2025-03-07 15:41:42,,,,Herein lies the problem You now say you werent convinced it was massive and instead you respond back implying you looked it up but instead its just information you gained off a friend regarding their unique position Its not so much about you not being convinced its about you not even checking and believing everyone is in the same boat as your friend,mgiuviu,11.0,1j5dath

comment,mghm3fz,Wheelyjoephone,,3,2025-03-07 10:29:18,,,,Its down 15 in the last month and 20 over the last year Given their market cap thats around 600bn,mghk3s1,5.0,1j5dath

comment,mgiuyi5,Green0Photon,,5,2025-03-07 15:29:35,,,,My only possible reasonable guess is that they thought it was a difficult software issue that they could solve after launch and it would cost way more money withdrawing all cards pre launch instead of all the issues getting it fixed post launch But even then it seems like this is a hardware issue and pretty unlikely for them to not realize it at launch,mggtwfq,2.0,1j5dath
comment,mgls21s,ttubehtnitahwtahw1,,0,2025-03-08 00:25:28,,,,easier to ask for forgiveness than permission Not to mention no one is really gonna give a fuck Just look at the misleading memory issues that the 900 series had No one cared nvidia bounced back if it even needed a bounce,mggtwfq,2.0,1j5dath
comment,mgi7gcb,Awake00,,4,2025-03-07 13:19:45,,,,My brother is a gamer but I usually build his pcs for him or introduce him to games He would have no idea about any of this and would be happy with his new GPU if he had just got one,mggqobw,1.0,1j5dath
comment,mglqrhw,poopyheadthrowaway,,2,2025-03-08 00:17:59,,,,I mean by that standard hed probably have no idea and be happy if you swapped his GPU out for one model lower,mgi7gcb,2.0,1j5dath
comment,mgls3gf,Awake00,,1,2025-03-08 00:25:42,,,,Nah I taught him about viewing fps on afterburner He has a 2070s right now I told him his days of running things at ultrahigh will soon be over 1080 monitor so if he gets any slow down to pull that up and adjust settings accordingly,mglqrhw,3.0,1j5dath

comment,mghhtd6,QuickQuirk,,57,2025-03-07 09:45:21,,,,render output unit or raster operations pipeline depending on who you ask An important part of the GPU graphics processsing that handles tasks near the end of the graphics rendering Antialiasing colour compression writing to the output buffer and Im sure more stuff Basically having less will bottleneck other parts of ther GPU slowing things down under some circumstances,mgh8oqt,1.0,1j5dath
comment,mghowti,101m4n,,27,2025-03-07 10:56:34,,,,ELI5 explanation theyre special hardware in the GPU that turns the coordinates of a triangle into a list of pixels within the triangle so the GPU can then go and render those pixels This is called rasterisation hence ROP raster operation processor If you dont have enough of them then the shader cores might run out of work and sit idle Pipeline looks kinda like this Calculate where triangles are shaders Calculate where pixels fall within triangle ROPs Calculate colour of pixel shaders,mgh8oqt,1.0,1j5dath
comment,mgk422j,gauderio,,1,2025-03-07 19:04:24,,,,Can you run your own code on ROPs like you run on vertex and pixel shaders,mghowti,2.0,1j5dath
comment,mglc3oh,101m4n,,3,2025-03-07 22:54:32,,,,Nope theyre application specific like tensor or RT cores at least as far as Im aware,mgk422j,3.0,1j5dath
comment,mglfbe8,101m4n,,2,2025-03-07 23:12:13,,,,Also there arent really dedicated pixel and fragment shaders in GPUs anymore Rather a whole mess of generic shaders that can fulfil the role of either,mgk422j,3.0,1j5dath

comment,mghnzwb,meunbear,,19,2025-03-07 10:47:51,,,,I recently switched to AMD from only using Intel in my PCs since my first Pentium 4 machine I made I suppose its time to go back to AMD for GPUs too Been only using nvidia since my 9800 gtx before that was ATI Nvidia just got way too big for their britches gpus for games are just not what they care about anymore,,0.0,1j5dath

comment,mgku79w,Cyberdyne_T-888,,6,2025-03-07 21:21:12,,,,I picked up an Intel Arc A310 ECO Awesome for transcoding video There have been some hiccups with fan issues and drivers Its mostly fixed now Fan is too small and thus loud though If I run across a cheap Intel Arc B580 Ill probably pick it up Not top of the line but excellent value,mgk4ux9,3.0,1j5dath
comment,mglk474,Dt2_0,,2,2025-03-07 23:39:39,,,,ARC B580 is great but hard to find as its the only GPU on the value side of things worth buying right now Intel doesnt compete in the high end and B580 is solidly at the lower end of midrange Its an excellent product for the market segment tho,mgk4ux9,3.0,1j5dath
comment,mgobkjk,wakkawakkaaaa,,2,2025-03-08 12:44:50,,,,the only GPU on the value side of things worth buying right now RX 9070 XT is another value oriented card at the midhigh end if you can find it at msrp,mglk474,4.0,1j5dath
comment,mgq434l,Dt2_0,,4,2025-03-08 18:46:27,,,,By value I was meaning the 200300 price range but yes the 9070XT is a great deal and offers stellar performance for the money but it is 600,mgobkjk,5.0,1j5dath
comment,mglw8e1,sold_snek,,1,2025-03-08 00:49:35,,,,gpus for games are just not what they care about anymore Theyre the best in performance still because theres just no other options but even in the data center space NVIDIA is obnoxious to work with Its really just the company in general,mghnzwb,1.0,1j5dath

comment,mgkl0qi,DriftMantis,,1,2025-03-07 20:26:32,,,,Im pretty sure these new cards are only going to be a slight improvement over the 4000 series anyway The desktop gpu is more powerful mostly because it takes 50 watts more power which is not really an option on a laptop card The only real selling point is the multi frame Gen which to be honest sounds like crap anyway who wants bad latency and an artifacting crappy image in exchange for fancy motion smoothing We will see but with the way it is the rtx 4080 mobile should beat the 5070 mobile anyway The amd refresh should provide similar performance for a lot less money but not quite the same performance in heavy ray tracing All in all kind of a pointless upgrade cycle unless you are really due forneeding an upgrade That said the new efficiency in synthetic benchmarks should make for better workstation gpus but kind of underwhelming for gaming,,0.0,1j5dath
