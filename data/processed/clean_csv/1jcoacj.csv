comment,mi4xwin,Boatingboy57,,-7,2025-03-16 19:22:49,,,,Good use Then again we have been using ICEs and gas generators to do the same thing Maybe ICE and EV can coexist,,0.0,1jcoacj

comment,mi6u8vn,Boatingboy57,,4,2025-03-17 01:31:07,,,,No but we recharged phones and laptops and other USB devices during Hurricane Sandy And yes I have powered a house with an ICE generator They are pretty popular,mi6l4nn,2.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi6paq0,tejanaqkilica,,0,2025-03-17 01:01:01,,,,You can use a normal car to power all kinds of devices like laptops phones mini fridge and so on To power your entire house you use a generator and call it a day Its going to do a better than an EV anyway,mi6l4nn,2.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi6tzpr,Boatingboy57,,2,2025-03-17 01:29:30,,,,Thank you You got it,mi6paq0,3.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi8nfww,thewavefixation,,2,2025-03-17 11:03:10,,,,How is a generator going to do a better job A petrol powered generator is only 25 efficient at best A battery is a much better solution,mi6paq0,3.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi8pocr,tejanaqkilica,,1,2025-03-17 11:22:01,,,,This isnt a physics class Im talking about a real world scenario In case of a natural disaster where I have to stay multiple days without power a generator is going to do a better job not only because it scales up better but also by having a better uptime than an EV,mi8nfww,4.0,1jcoacj

comment,mi4xe7r,opeth10657,,4,2025-03-16 19:20:15,,,,Ford lent out a bunch of F150s with the built in generators when texas froze over a few years ago Having a home generator is a better option than using up the battery on your transportation,mi4ug5m,1.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi4zdat,Soulpatch7,,1,2025-03-16 19:30:07,,,,absolutely but if someone in your family is on dialysis or oxygen whatever gets the job done is perfect and because generators are expensive my portable gas one has a hardwired dedicated plugin that can run half my house at a time including HVAC and appliances and was 4k allin and i havent bought an EV yet its my only solution Now reverse that Id run shit off my F150 and not buy a generator if i didnt have one because its a redundant investment,mi4xe7r,2.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi51q4k,opeth10657,,1,2025-03-16 19:41:46,,,,As far as I know EVs still need something to backfeed power in the same as a generator Would still have to turn off the mains if the power goes out,mi4zdat,3.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi5442m,Soulpatch7,,2,2025-03-16 19:53:42,,,,negative if its charged and youre inverted edit and this discussion is dumb w people downvoting for what if i have an EV and my power is out and my EV runs low i can go to any fucking charger on the planet to spice it back up i dont get the mainline power cucks here,mi51q4k,4.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi5er0k,opeth10657,,0,2025-03-16 20:46:45,,,,if i have an EV and my power is out and my EV runs low i can go to any fucking charger on the planet to spice it back up The problem i always had with this is that if your power is out it might be out other places near you so who knows where youre going to charge meanwhile youre using up the EV power to keep your house going With a gas generator you can keep a couple cans in your garage and youre good to go negative if its charged and youre inverted Would still need the mains turned off so youre not feeding power back into the grid Guys working on the lines would love if if youre feeding back out when they have everything shut off,mi5442m,5.0,1jcoacj
comment,mi5mvlo,Soulpatch7,,1,2025-03-16 21:27:56,,,,It might be It might also be that there is no more electrical grid anywhere Then were obviously into the wisdom of solar were not disagreeing but troubleshooting endless potential issues is endless and pointless,mi5er0k,6.0,1jcoacj

comment,mi4vzqw,SmooK_LV,,10,2025-03-16 19:13:18,,,,Because he probably only knows the Ford F150 as being capable of vehicletoload However in Australia BYDs are pretty popular and they also have that capability as do Hyundais and Kias Id say Ford is in the minority having only one model capable of that,mi4qej7,2.0,1jcoacj

comment,mi711da,Slow-Class,,1,2025-03-17 02:13:32,,,,They used to but like everything else bigger companies bought smaller companies and it became cheaper to send Australia the cars they build for everyone else than build there and all the factories closed down,mi69su5,6.0,1jcoacj
