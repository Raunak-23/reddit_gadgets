comment,lz8joe5,TheyCallMeMrMaybe,,21,2024-11-27 13:13:18,,,,Why does this remind me of the OG Xboxs Duke controller,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzpt268,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-30 14:34:03,,,,Cuz the grips dont stick out as much vs the middle of the body compared to most other controllers,lz8joe5,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8ln9z,lesmiserablesss,,70,2024-11-27 13:26:50,,,,The large TouchPad on right side of the OG Steam Controller is the biggest reason I use it I love using it for aiming in games I cannot utilize the TouchPad on the steam deck due to how small and low it is on the device They shouldve kept at least one big circle pad,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9w3by,parisidiot,,17,2024-11-27 17:44:39,,,,but it looks like it has two giant touch pads right in reach of your thumbs,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9zt2m,lesmiserablesss,,9,2024-11-27 18:03:36,,,,The og controller has a large concave circle and you cant get that same design with a joystick in that space,lz9w3by,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzptdpw,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2024-11-30 14:36:14,,,,IMO both analogue sticks were perfectly fine being replaced with the trackpads the trackpads were a straight upgrade to analogues and the haptics etc made it AMAZING The main mistake they made was adding a left analogue stick rather than a DPAD,lz9zt2m,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,lza5kgg,MCA2142,,7,2024-11-27 18:33:13,,,,Right touch pad Gyro aim activation on Left trigger is amazing for FPS games,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzc2pz3,chr0nicpirate,,3,2024-11-28 01:00:12,,,,I honestly really like the steam controller other than the fact it only has one joystick I got one when it was on clearance for like 5 couple years back If they had just given it dual sticks and kept one of the touch pads in a normal dpad it would have been an s Plus tier controller with all of its features The only including one joystick was just so insanely stupid and probably saved them like 050 per unit in manufacturer costs It basically made it doomed to fail,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzcwroo,adubsix3,,1,2024-11-28 04:22:10,,,,Yeah for real Keep the og layout add like a micro right joystick Like a switch or PSP joystick,lzc2pz3,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9wlcs,None,,2,2024-11-27 17:47:14,,,,can you sync the steam controller to the deck via bluetooth i dont have a deck on the controller and im curious,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lza0bor,lesmiserablesss,,2,2024-11-27 18:06:15,,,,Yes it does,lz9wlcs,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzakfe1,None,,1,2024-11-27 19:50:20,,,,seems crappy to carry both but seems like a acceptable compromise,lza0bor,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzawthp,GimpyGeek,,1,2024-11-27 20:55:43,,,,Im also curious about the odd angulation on the touch pads as well Makes me wonder how thats going to work for keeping things straight or using things like the old ipod clickwheel style scroll thing albeit that probably isnt gonna feel good in a square format so much anyway,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzf7fn6,that_toof,,1,2024-11-28 16:01:05,,,,We still use ours for web browsing scrolling on that thing was so nice,lz8ln9z,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8t30d,Hamuelin,,22,2024-11-27 14:14:34,,,,Big if true A lot of us wanted both two sticks and trackpads like the deck has,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbexq7,baltimoresports,,4,2024-11-27 22:32:26,,,,Calling it now Steam OS 30 general release at the same time as the controller release,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzetbek,Skcuszeps,,2,2024-11-28 14:38:37,,,,Ive not followed anything with versioning is anything big expected with 30 Support for general installation on other hardware,lzbexq7,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzex05k,baltimoresports,,2,2024-11-28 15:01:15,,,,Basically SteamDeck OS for a general release Still some issues with NVIDIA but its been solid on AMD with some of the clone distros like Bazzite,lzetbek,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzh4wln,Skcuszeps,,2,2024-11-28 22:33:32,,,,Im rocking Bazzite on my laptop and ally X and its been solid Will be cool to try out steamOS,lzex05k,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,m17j5tw,cgaWolf,,1,2024-12-09 15:56:51,,,,Steam OS 3 This breaks my brain I thought Valve didnt do 3s,lzbexq7,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8kdcu,Senior1292,,20,2024-11-27 13:18:11,,,,This isnt really a PC Controller for gaming more of a controller for the Deck when its docked Because it departs so much from the original its not really a Steam Controller 2 but a Steam Deck Controller,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8ky61,nmarf16,,27,2024-11-27 13:22:10,,,,Imo if the touch pads are anything like the steam deck touchpad and if it has good gyro I absolutely could see this for PC since itd be appealing to controller users who want to switch to PC Itd make FPS games easier and more playable and a ton of other games like RTS games that arent competitive could be playable,lz8kdcu,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8mehu,Senior1292,,-6,2024-11-27 13:31:48,,,,I dont mean that it wouldnt be used for PC I mean more like the primary intention is for it to be used as controller for the Steam Deck when its docked If it was designed for PC first then it would have been closer to the Steam Controller design with two large trackpads as the primary input method I just cant see the ABXY buttons bumpers and triggers being ergonomically nice to use with the trackpads due to their positioning and joysticks are inferior to the trackpads of the Steam Controller,lz8ky61,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9lc7j,nmarf16,,8,2024-11-27 16:49:15,,,,I mean the games youd want a controller like this for steam deck were likely built for PC so I dont see why the design would differ much If youve used the steam deck track pad its clear its meant to replicate what youd want a mouse to do within the confines of a less than ideal setting thumb on trackpad vs mouse is an obstacle for designers,lz8mehu,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz986or,Skcuszeps,,10,2024-11-27 15:40:47,,,,No its definitely a PC STEAM controller The deck has no special functionality other than hardware Steam does It turns any PC into a Deck Want to couch play a mouse heavy game on your PC using a controller Now you can Want touchpad macro wheel menus on your PC with a controller Now you can Valve is thinking much broader Its not to control the steam deck Its to turn every competitors hardware into a steam deck since it brings deck functionality to every PC It could normalize touchpads as a controller input,lz8kdcu,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9mqln,Senior1292,,-2,2024-11-27 16:56:28,,,,I feel like youve entirely missed the point Im making Hopefully I can clarify Want to couch play a mouse heavy game on your PC using a controller Now you can Want touchpad macro wheel menus on your PC with a controller Now you can Ive been doing this for nearly a decade with the original Steam Controller If they were making the Steam Controller 2 then it would be an iteration of the Steam Controller For example largely the same form factor 4 buttons on the back higher refresh rate gyro higher quality finish etc Based on the 3D model from the Steam VR Files Valve had basically taken the Steam Deck and removed the screen I imagine a fairly large percentage of the people who buy this will already have a Steam Deck and will use it as their controller for when its docked or they dont want to hold it as its fairly weighty as it should have the exact same inputs in pretty much the same place Instead of being the Steam Controller 20 I see it as the Steam Deck Controller 10 that can obviously also be used on PCs but I feel that the main target audience and reason its been made is because of the Steam Deck,lz986or,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9qhk9,Skcuszeps,,3,2024-11-27 17:15:50,,,,Youre pretty hung up on the name when all we know is its project name and its coined the steam controller 2 by people talking about it Valve does not release hardware hell even software without a were trying to advance technology reason VR headset released forced other companies to do so Steam boxes and steam controllers were test platforms that lead to the deck and other console like PCs They are not releasing this to simply be a controller designed for the deck that can be used for PC This is to advance something Like turning all hardware into a steam deck with radial menus and easy mouse control Or to normalize touchpads on a controller with use of steam input or devs can natively support it now Think bigger,lz9mqln,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9w393,Senior1292,,-3,2024-11-27 17:44:39,,,,Were not seeing eye to eye here so Im going to leave it after this comment Ignore the name my original point was that this controller looks like its going to be closer to the Steam Desk than Steam Controller and so I feel that even though this will be called the Steam Controller because if Valve called it a Steam Deck Controller people would assume you can only use it for the Steam Deck it isnt really what Ive been hoping theyd make for the last 6 or 7 years Valve does not release hardware hell even software without a were trying to advance technology reason I honestly think in this case its as simple as They saw how successful the Deck and the demand for a controller with the same controls was too they said they wanted to make a dedicated controller for it so they have done The rest of what you said I think is over thinking it,lz9qhk9,4.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzcour6,SiccmaDE7930,,1,2024-11-28 03:24:58,,,,Just because it isnt exactly what you specifically wanted it to be doesnt mean it isnt what it is,lz9w393,5.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzeqwcr,Skcuszeps,,0,2024-11-28 14:23:01,,,,its going to be closer to the Steam Desk than Steam Controller and so I feel that even though this will be called the Steam Controller because if Valve called it a Steam Deck Controller people would assume you can only use it for the Steam Deck it isnt really what Ive been hoping theyd make for the last 6 or 7 years So theres the real issue Its not what you wanted That doesnt validate anything youve said,lz9w393,5.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbcdrc,cjngo1,,2,2024-11-27 22:18:03,,,,Wdym The steamdeck controller works fine on windows I have installed it and tried it would love to have that on my actual pc,lz8kdcu,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbv5aq,fixminer,,1,2024-11-28 00:12:06,,,,But the Steam Decks library consist entirely of PC games Why would it matter if its connected to a Deck or a PC If it works well for one it works well for the other,lz8kdcu,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz8yyrl,BeamImpact,,4,2024-11-27 14:49:37,,,,That looks like I could accidentally hit those touchpads when using the sticks The touchpad location also doesnt look ideal or lets say comfortable,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lz9w03t,Moskeeto93,,5,2024-11-27 17:44:12,,,,Input to the touchpads on the Deck are disabled when the joysticks are being touchedmoved,lz8yyrl,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzaxmc6,GimpyGeek,,2,2024-11-27 20:59:55,,,,As someone that doesnt have a deck thats an interesting thing to clarify I was thinking the same thing Beam was that is good to hear though as that placement does seem a bit suspect,lz9w03t,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbbype,LevianMcBirdo,,2,2024-11-27 22:15:43,,,,A small addition when the corresponding joystick is being used,lz9w03t,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzc03f7,8bit-wizard,,1,2024-11-28 00:43:23,,,,This depends on the game If your control profile is jumping back and forth between emulating controller inputs and mousekeyboard inputs this will naturally happen Most games dont accept input from both sources at once Some dont let you swap back and forth between the two at all,lz9w03t,2.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzc0edl,Moskeeto93,,1,2024-11-28 00:45:18,,,,This has nothing to do with the games Its hardcoded into the firmware itself If you touch the right stick the right trackpad is completely disabled This was actually an issue for me when trying to create a custom tate mode profile through Steam Input,lzc03f7,3.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzc20i8,8bit-wizard,,1,2024-11-28 00:55:38,,,,Huh That seems like an oversight on Valves part I guess Ive never needed a profile that necessitated both of them at once,lzc0edl,4.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbhsvk,Flecca,,1,2024-11-27 22:48:59,,,,Oh boy Well I guess it doesnt have to be pretty to be great nothing does now that I think about it,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzfhnux,SirBreazy,,1,2024-11-28 16:56:58,,,,Doesnt look ergonomic for analog stick users,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbaf62,SpookOpsTheLine,,0,2024-11-27 22:07:10,,,,Looks a bit unwieldy I wanted to be a fan of the OG steam controller but tbh it was a jack of all trades and bad at all of them youre way better off just using a regular controller or mouse and keyboard unless you play gameswith no controller support like Civ or smth,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzaq5jy,raymondcy,,-1,2024-11-27 20:20:38,,,,If it doesnt have paddles on the bottom of the controller like the Xbox Elite then it can go directly to the hall of shame,,0.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbc3ws,LevianMcBirdo,,7,2024-11-27 22:16:31,,,,It will The first one had two and the steam deck even 4 doubt theyll drop that,lzaq5jy,1.0,1h12vzt
comment,lzbci97,raymondcy,,2,2024-11-27 22:18:43,,,,My apologies then I did not know that Thank you for the correction,lzbc3ws,2.0,1h12vzt
