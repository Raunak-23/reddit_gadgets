comment,mvjtqtj,Bloody_Sunday,,6,2025-06-02 07:18:16,,,,Exactly like my own MX3 Just about its only flaw and occasionally a need to have a higher DPI But otherwise perfect imo Its battery life after ages off owning one is still uncanny and unaffected Fully ergonomic with its buttons layout and palm curves exactly where I want them Has also served me well for gaming too Super comfy layout buttons and curves Other than a tiny latency and not super accurate DPI I have felt no need to get any other gaming mouse and Ive tried quite a few,mvjkhrd,3.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvmowje,ccai,,1,2025-06-02 18:12:16,,,,The lack of a horizontal scroll wheel makes it a far lesser option for many My wife has no issue with her MX Anywhere 2S as she wanted a more compact mouse It makes little to no difference to her work flow as it primarily consists of readingcreating documents and emailing Meanwhile I benefit greatly from the horizontal scrolling on the daily to readily access out of view column values on spreadsheets and DB tables Easy access of XY axis scrolling is just so much more efficient for my workflow If size and horizontal scroll wheels arent dealbreakers the Logitech M720 Triathlon is about half the price of the Mx Anywhere it just isnt rechargeable via USB A single AA battery lasts months and months even with heavy use It works well with rechargeable NiMH batteries as well I find the ergonomics to be better on the M720 as well when compared to the Anywhere series As for size it sits between the MX Anywhere and the MX Master,mvkmb99,3.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvm0fms,stempoweredu,,2,2025-06-02 16:17:37,,,,Im on the other side I owned an original MX Master and an MX Master 2 and I just wont buy them anymore Their lifespan isnt considerably longer than other much less expensive Logitech offerings And notably all mice seem to have far shorter lifespans than they used to and I baby my mice The feature set isnt gamechanging I struggle to find a need for the horizontal scroll wheel on a regular basis Ergonomics The MX Master came out at a time when most ergonomicfocused mice lacked any other premium features This is no longer the case and indeed many average mice have excellent ergonomics Resolution Polling Im a CAD guy and gamer so high DPI matters to me The sensors in even runofthemill mice have gotten to the point that theyre more than fine Logitech is absurdly obstinate about taking the deviceswitch button off of the bottom and putting it on top of the mouse This is why I daily drive the MX720 so I can seamlessly switch between laptop desktop and more It lacks the features that matter to me Replaceable batteries easily removable parts for cleaning All in all the MX Master became an overpriced unnecessary spectacle Im much happier with my 720,mvjlj3l,2.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvmq0ie,ccai,,2,2025-06-02 18:17:33,,,,I disagree using a mouse at all while in spreadsheets is a massive slowdown Then thats irrelevant to you whether or not you have a horizontal scroll wheel The inclusion doesnt slow you down as its not a forced feature that disables your kb shortcuts its not an either or situation Not everyone edits spreadsheets many just use them to view data from generated reports so KB shortcuts dont speed up workflow for everyone who works with spreadsheets I agree with uDigital_loop its amazing to scroll in XY axis with ease in spreadsheets and db tables for those of us that view them more than edit or create them,mvm2cof,5.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjpub7,vpsj,,8,2025-06-02 06:40:30,,,,I have the 2 and its slowly getting worse and worse I also hate that I have to keep a mini micro usb cable just to charge it Should I wait for the 4 or buy the 3 Or get one of those Razer mice,mvjd105,1.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvkkvrj,ccai,,6,2025-06-02 11:34:10,,,,I have to keep a mini usb cable just to charge it Microusb If youre a bit handy and know how to solder its not a super difficult process to convert it to usbc Its a matter of disassembling clipping off the port and soldering two wires the hardest part is filing the hole larger for the new port,mvjpub7,2.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvmusrl,995a3c3c3c3c2424,,3,2025-06-02 18:40:39,,,,I upgraded to a 3 a while back to get USB C and it was fine for a while but then the left button started doubleclicking itself when I only singleclicked which seems to be a common problem with the 3 So I switched back to the old 2 that I still had lying around,mvjpub7,2.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvjrvtt,Trippydippy1,,2,2025-06-02 06:59:50,,,,Like a comment in this thread said theres has leprosy I can say the same and seen the rubber degraded on anothers 3 theres something about it which is worse then the 2 Still very good and lasted for a few years at this point of daily use just looks ugly now,mvjpub7,2.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjt4ey,ctyldsley,,5,2025-06-02 07:11:58,,,,Why do they always randomly get laggy using the dongle Doesnt matter if its the 2 or 3 they both exhibit the behaviour on different machines Unplug replug fixes it but then itll do it randomly again,mvjd105,1.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvkayn3,Newtronic,,5,2025-06-02 10:12:08,,,,I have found it depends on the internal configuration of the USB Some computers share the USB port across all peripherals including the internal ones and this can cause lags and stuttering Some USBs are shared and other might not be so try different ports,mvjt4ey,2.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjpzvg,kushangaza,,6,2025-06-02 06:41:56,,,,Its been a while since I tried but if I remember correctly they do work as USB mice if you plug them in with the cable attached No wireless connection necessary,mvjnwn1,2.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvjr7vx,Spyder638,,3,2025-06-02 06:53:31,,,,This is incorrect Source recently got locked out of my PC when my dongle stopped working which both my keyboard and mouse make use of Tried to go wired to at least connect via Bluetooth but nothing worked Edit to be clear you can charge your mouse using a wire and still use the mouse but the communication is still 100 wireless,mvjpzvg,3.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvke8a1,Spyder638,,6,2025-06-02 10:41:26,,,,Plugging them in and charging while in use is fine but its still communicating with your devices wirelessly If you turn off Bluetooth and dont have a dongle in your devices you will not be able to use the mouse,mvkdm3y,5.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvkevaj,GregLittlefield,,2,2025-06-02 10:46:48,,,,I see Thats weird Why did they do it like that,mvke8a1,6.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvkfimb,Spyder638,,3,2025-06-02 10:52:05,,,,Who knows but its really silly especially if you want to use these via bluetooth which is reasonable saying there are quite a lot of people myself included who experience some sort of lagstutter with the unifying dongle It means if you need to switch BT off on youre gonna need another means to switch it back on,mvkevaj,7.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvl4pbv,Ripdog,,1,2025-06-02 13:40:02,,,,Because it would be a whole lot of duplicated circuitry likely an extra chip and more complexity in the firmware to handle a USB mode Presumably they judged it wouldnt be worth the cost when very few people would use it or choose to buy the mouse due to USB mode existing,mvkevaj,7.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvmfjj8,GfxJG,,1,2025-06-02 17:28:52,,,,Genuine question Why I charge mine literally 2 hours if even that every other month Is that really such a dealbreaker for you that youd prefer the downsides to a wired mouse,mvjnwn1,2.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvpe1gq,dbabon,,1,2025-06-03 02:50:49,,,,Its not charging that bothers me I just genuinely hate bluetooth So many factors about my environment workspace whichever computer Im using etc make it really unreliable IMO Ive been in some really crucial work moments where I found my mouse just suddenly not connecting full battery or unable to be recognized on a new system etc It drives me crazy especially because I love the mouse so much otherwise,mvmfjj8,3.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjhxzg,nagi603,,10,2025-06-02 05:27:42,,,,Probably more of a optimize out the one thing we do not advertise or even list in our specs sheet operating a component well outside its rated specifications shortening lifetime But hey x month battery life can be listed everywhere In the meanwhile I still have 3 Performance MX mice 1 main formerly 1 office now 2 backups with only a single dead switch fixed Some on their 3rd AA battery But oh the tragedy of having to insert the charging cable once or twice a week,mvjgdmr,3.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvle2eo,FilteringAccount123,,1,2025-06-02 14:29:23,,,,Yeah I dont understand why battery life would be such a big bragging point on the nonanywhere model Id gladly trade some battery life for things like a higher polling rate or other QoL things Or just have a performance modeendurance mode switch,mvjhxzg,4.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvosgx0,zzazzzz,,4,2025-06-03 00:39:54,,,,because its their only market advantage no other mouse comes even close to logitechs battery life other than that you can find a mouse in every single stat that outperforms logitech and just from personal experience every one of my failing switches that double clicked ect was physical damage to the switch not any undervolting causing damage and all of them i fixed with some superglue to fill out the indent on the switch so i am kind of dubious on the undervolting causing the issue even more so given that many ppl have changed their switches to third party ones and did not ecounter the issue again,mvle2eo,5.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjf1nl,Aleyla,,1,2025-06-02 05:02:58,,,,The article lists the following problems with the 3s the Logitech MX Master 3S has a polling rate of just 125Hz via Bluetooth and the USB dongle which can feel sluggish on fast monitors with refresh rates of 240Hz or more Sluggish The mx master isnt sold as a gaming mouse It is targeted towards developers and other creative professionals Additionally the Darkfield laser sensor works on many surfaces such as glass but has a resolution of only 8000 DPI Which is more than enough for the target market At just under 5 oz the MX Master 3S also weighs more than twice as much as some highend gaming mice Again not a gaming mouse Also highly subjective I very much appreciate the higher weight Far better than the cheap feel from lighter mice Lastly Logitech doesnt offer the option to store the USB dongle inside the mouse which can be practical when transporting or using the mouse on the go The only time I needed to pull the usb thing out of my laptop is when Ive replaced the laptop Not having onboard storage for the dongle is not an issue for the target market Theres plenty of gaming mice The article writer should kindly fuck off and stick with one of those,,0.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjh8xq,4kVHS,,10,2025-06-02 05:21:40,,,,USBC is tiny and can easily be adapted to USBA in a compact form factor But going USBA to USBC requires a bulky adapter making it stick out more Its not 2005 anymore Logitech needs to start using USBC on everything,mvjg9fj,2.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvjhmut,ArchusKanzaki,,-9,2025-06-02 05:25:01,,,,Yeah but USBC is too tiny imo I have a Yubikey 5C for work in my laptop and its so tiny its difficult to take it out of the slot Not sure how much Logitech will be able to shrink down the receiver too given that smaller receiver also means smaller antenna I think there are pros and cons but I do think that sticking with USBA is still easier the likely desktop user probably will prefer that,mvjh8xq,3.0,1l18y3p
comment,mvjly4z,Eurynom0s,,3,2025-06-02 06:03:41,,,,Wut This has nothing to do with the size of USBC vs USBA your job just gave you the smallest Yubikey You can have very flush USBA dongles too,mvjhmut,4.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvodncj,TheStealthyPotato,,2,2025-06-02 23:14:30,,,,If your complaint is that USBA is barely big enough then perhaps youd prefer the USBC with USBA adapter And then the people who want a small USBC dongle can be happy too,mvjmrgc,6.0,1l18y3p

comment,mvjk0h9,ArchusKanzaki,,2,2025-06-02 05:46:04,,,,Look Im not against you and I actually kinda agree with you on second and third point but I will pointout that they fixed your first point on the 3S variant along with adding 8000 DPI sensor Its silent now and the silence really makes me contemplate on whether to replace my own Anywhere 3 I made another post saying that I would lineup for preorder if they put onboard memory increase the polling rate not asking for 1000 but 125 is too low and put in something that makes me able to switch device without liftingup entire mouse I am ok with heavy mouse I am not ok with needing to lift them up to switch device Also I do have the M720 Triathlon but while its like 8090 of MX Master its still not MX Master The sensor is definitely a step below MX Master along with the scroll wheel definitely feeling worse and functioning worse no autoswitch between ratcheting and infinite The thumb rest position is also worse I do like that the switch device button is ontop though and there is a place for dongle but thats kinda it,mvjin9b,5.0,1l18y3p
