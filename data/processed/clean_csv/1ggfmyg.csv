comment,luu70q2,m0_m0ney,,3,2024-11-01 11:02:08,,,,Hypothetically couldnt they just come up with a new standard and include both chips in the phone Seems like the most reasonable idea,lus469w,3.0,1ggfmyg
comment,luubsxf,Stingray88,,5,2024-11-01 11:43:15,,,,Yes Apples already done exactly that with their AirPods They have standard Bluetooth chips so they can be used with any device but they also include their Hseries chips to facilitate extra features with iOS and Mac devices that Bluetooth alone doesnt support If Apple ever adds truly lossless audio to AirPods thats how itll arrive And itll surely only work in the Apple ecosystem Everyone else will have to wait for a nonproprietary standard,luu70q2,4.0,1ggfmyg

comment,lusgmrz,no_user_name_person,,21,2024-11-01 01:16:54,,,,Its a huge investment to build up a team of engineers and continually grow for the future Apple just partnered up a few collages to sponsor them with apple codesigned courses on silicon engineering Apple will provide immense resources for students to design and manufacture their own chip as well as help them understand their creation with a follow up measurement course This new silicon initiative is a great investment to find better engineers in the future similar things are being done by Nvidia and Texas Instruments,lurdphh,1.0,1ggfmyg

comment,luulg04,Sylvurphlame,,4,2024-11-01 12:53:19,,,,Oh Im good with it No snark If dropping things like power adapters and headphones when Ive accumulated drawers full of them means they dont raise the price more often Im good with it Same logic applies to Apple taking more components inhouse,luugc4g,3.0,1ggfmyg

comment,luu4g1i,Heimerdahl,,-3,2024-11-01 10:37:55,,,,Id love if there were some camera configuration options when buying a phone Theres just a bunch of things that have become standard that I really dont care about Like the front facing camera I really dont need it Or as you said the big camera bump in the back I love me some high quality pictures but Id happily take a phone with a basic camera and a little adapter to attach some super fancy ones if required Save a bunch of space and money and get better ergonomics while still getting a high quality device because I do care about other things,lusyiu6,2.0,1ggfmyg

comment,luuojyl,pluush,,0,2024-11-01 13:13:10,,,,Yeah one can only hope though Maybe a timeshare is possible like Wifi Extender feature in some Android phones or how Airdrop works using the same bands as Wifi even when still connected to Wifi,luunuq0,2.0,1ggfmyg
