comment,mq9flge,hybridfrost,,1,2025-05-02 20:39:22,,,,Theyre too cheap because they pay their employees shit wages and run the developers into the ground to finish games The true cost of games is obscured because of all the free labor that goes into crunch time for games to get done on time Indie games can be successful because they make simpler games with smaller teams Games like GTA6 take tons of staff and resources to make and can only charge like 70 Basically no one wants to pay the true cost for the labor that goes into making a game And the cost of games today is waaayyy cheaper even at 8090 each SNES games were like 90 in the early 90s about 188 in todays dollars,mq9c2ir,7.0,1kc89ci
