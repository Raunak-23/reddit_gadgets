comment,mju87fg,None,,639,2025-03-26 14:34:41,,,,steam and things like it are just about the only drm i can tolerate logging into my steam account is a small price to pay for download anywhere unlimited times no keeping track of discs and keys and automated and centralized updates,,0.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjupicc,leastlol,,275,2025-03-26 16:00:50,,,,I hesitated to move to Steam from just CS15 for CS16 for around a half year or so because I wasnt terribly comfortable with conceding that much control of my games to a video game company I begrudgingly made an account because I love counterstrike and wanted to play on populated servers but steam being a requirement still feels kind of hamfisted The Orange box also requiring it for single player games felt even more nonsensical since most of steams features at the time had to do with things like server lists and friends Now I think Valve has been a good steward and has not abused its position as the controller of your access to your video games and has added features to ensure that you can still access them offline but I still dont think features you mentioned necessitate additional DRM for the game itself I think tolerate like you said is probably the right word for it,mju87fg,1.0,1jkcrbu

comment,mjzfhzt,curiousplatypus25,,3,2025-03-27 09:31:13,,,,I think people forget that Steam was once a semi controversial player in the gaming scene I remember getting Total War Shogun 2 as a gift with my Sony Vaio laptop and we were shocked that a game on a disk would require you to install a thirdparty application to be able to install and play it I actually refused to install steam for quite some time until some friends convinced me to play TF2 and then I made an account It seemed more acceptable for a F2P game,mjupicc,2.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjv9mj5,CrumbsCrumbs,,6,2025-03-26 17:37:07,,,,You definitely need some form of DRM once youre allowing unlimited downloads on unlimited PCs Why would anyone other than resellers buy a new game for retail price if the second its released people could start selling info for an account that just bought the game,mjupicc,2.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjvae6y,regal_foxy,,22,2025-03-26 17:40:44,,,,GOG offers unlimited downloads on unlimited PCs and theyre killing it its true they dont get new releases as often but Id argue that if valve didnt maje DRM acceptable then they would absolutely get new releases,mjv9mj5,3.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjvdago,CrumbsCrumbs,,16,2025-03-26 17:54:11,,,,It is the opposite If Steam didnt handle DRM then a lot of publishers wouldnt be willing to put their big new games on it Like what currently happens with GoG Weve already seen what happened when publishers thought pirating was too big of a risk with PC games they just stopped selling them You wont get DRM free triplea games you will just stop getting PC ports of triplea games,mjvae6y,4.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjvi5in,regal_foxy,,7,2025-03-26 18:17:25,,,,Thats a fair point Indeed most AAA publishers suck and fail to realize that the impact piracy has on them is often negligible and would probably rather not sell the games at all than risk widespread piracy,mjvdago,5.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjxm5v7,Emu1981,,7,2025-03-27 00:39:47,,,,Indeed most AAA publishers suck and fail to realize that the impact piracy has on them is often negligible The problem is that if you make piracy too easy then people will just pirate the content instead of buying it this is what happened when MP3s hit the scene back in the late 90s There is that sweet spot there where your content is protected enough to discourage casual piracy but not protected so well that it negatively affects people who actually pay for the content,mjvi5in,6.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjxrils,regal_foxy,,9,2025-03-27 01:10:35,,,,I think its better said that if you make content too expensive or difficult to access then people will resort to piracy 37 of traffic to pirating websites are from users without a a VPN so they dont really know what theyre doing but still pirating So Its plenty easy to pirate and there are imo plenty of legitimate reasons to pirate something those reasons usually being too high of a cost andor poor quality from legal sources Music piracy is even easier to commit nowadays but people dont because they can listen for free or they can pay a relatively cheap price to steam almost whatever music they could want from Spotify or Tidal or whatever other provider Back then people were just getting enough computer space to store MP3s and there werent music streaming providers So for people to legitimately get all the music they were now being pushed to consume especially thanks to MP3 players and the iPod they had to either pirate or spend loads of cash on CDs upon CDs upon CDs So again the cost of entry for the new standard was too high and piracy was the only realistic option for most people The same would happen today if games started costing 200 per release and that would be the game publishers fault People would crack the DRM and theyd get loads more people pirating it Because of the cost not because of how easily accessible the piracy is You dont need DRM you just need to make things reasonable to access legally,mjxm5v7,7.0,1jkcrbu

comment,mjvwl9b,leastlol,,3,2025-03-26 19:28:09,,,,You can do checks for that kind of account activity pretty trivially but in general giving access to your account requires giving the login information to the person as well which gives them control over the account Account hijacking is sort of protected with things like email verification but the hassle isnt exactly trivial to deal with when youre trying to sell downloads to a game you purchased at a fraction of what Valve is selling it for To your point even having an account to download the game is DRM but my colloquial definition is for software that is continuously validating the users right to use the software they are running That is to say DRM that can invalidate a users ability to use their software after theyve purchased and downloaded it Im more open to forms of DRM that dont require surveilling the user in order to validate the softwares use every time you run it,mjv9mj5,3.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjw1klv,CrumbsCrumbs,,2,2025-03-26 19:52:31,,,,I dont think youre getting what Im actually saying Today on Steam if I create a new account just to buy the newest AAA game I could sell that account to someone else And they would need to keep the account to keep playing the game I cant sell it to a second person or two people would need the account simultaneously With your plan no live checks on the account at all I could sell that account to someone else And they could download the game and have it forever And I could reset the password and sell the account again and my second customer would have the game forever And then I could reset the password and sell the account again and another customer has another copy forever CD key resellers would effectively have infinite CD keys and the freedom to set their price at whatever they want all with Valves seal of approval,mjvwl9b,4.0,1jkcrbu

comment,mjxjsc9,CrumbsCrumbs,,2,2025-03-27 00:26:22,,,,They also specialize in Good Old Games Theyre a lot less worried about you selling the install for 5 because their current top seller is a 25 year old game that costs 250 There are only a few big modern games that release new on GoG from the more outspoken studios like Larian,mjxbfoq,6.0,1jkcrbu
comment,mjxubar,TooStrangeForWeird,,0,2025-03-27 01:27:02,,,,And those big modern games also sell very well Its obviously a workable model Iirc Gabe of Steam said something like the best way to prevent pirating is to make a better productservice People do the same with music too Its super easy to just pirate the music you like and youre good to go But people like Spotify better so they use itpay for it,mjxjsc9,7.0,1jkcrbu

comment,mjyhs68,leastlol,,2,2025-03-27 03:56:13,,,,You have X downloads of this file remaining is exactly the kind of garbage DRM other companies tried that allowed Steam to become the main storefront for PC gaming Its really not though Steam would have become what it is regardless of whether not other companies used things like limited downloads because the alternatives were rolling your own online distribution system or big box stores Steam handled a lot more than DRM and while it probably persuaded some publishers to sign on it wasnt the selling point The captive user base and the infrastructure that Valve had developed was what made Steam compelling Not having to build out your own store updater distribution system online multiplayer and then subsequently attract users to your platform was what dissuaded companies from rolling their own solutions They forced anyone that wanted to continue playing popular games like counterstrike and day of defeat onto their platform and then forced anyone who wanted to play one of the most anticipated games of all time Half Life 2 onto their platform They also apparently did a great job of convincing people that alwayson DRM is fine as long as Valve is the one doing it That its fine that you cant open a game you ostensibly own if you dont have internet or if you didnt update the game to the newest version Steam wasnt competing with other online stores or with DRM They were competing with the the inconvenience of creating your own online platform or publishing physical titles with all the expenses of manufacturing and dealing with retailers that that entailed The problem with SecuROM was not that users have philosophical problems with DRM the problem is that it was really fucking annoying when you just wanted to play a game So like what happened with the launch of Half Life 2 And then people pirate instead of purchasing and publishers decide its not worth it to develop for PC and were back where we were before Steam We were arguably in a better place in PC Gaming before Steam though Id hesitate to blame Steam for that one,mjxiae5,13.0,1jkcrbu
