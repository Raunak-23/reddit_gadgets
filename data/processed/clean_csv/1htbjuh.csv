comment,m5tz5ee,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-07 06:05:49,,,,LEDs will never be able to do decent black levels with anywhere near 10k nits since the backlight would be so bright it will always bleed through Will have to be an emissive pixel tech like OLED or microLED Of course when even DolbyVison is now mastered at 4k nits there is no point of anything more Also what people dont realize is the HDR spec ie the PQ gamma curve was designed for very low ambient light If you turn off all of the lights and let your eyes adjust on a properly calibrated OLED dark scenes can be pretty good The problem there is your eyes can perceive 10 orders of magnitude But not all at once and not in rapid succession 10k nits along with good black levels is pointless unless the top end is used very sparingly and in small specular areas because it can mess up for low light vision for minutes afterwards,m5d7box,5.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5dsc2k,TrptJim,,22,2025-01-04 17:36:49,,,,People assume that high brightness is fullscreen brightness like youd be staring at the surface of the sun watching any content Thats not how this stuff works Its about displaying things as bright as they can be in real life Nothing we have today can do that yet Its the smaller highlights like a bright spotlight sparks coming from molten hot metal reflections of the sun that really show off where extra brightness can come into play,m5d3xne,4.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5tzohm,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-07 06:10:27,,,,Not just safety most high nit displays have a max percentage of screen coverage because they cant draw enough power to light up the whole screen that brightly For example 600 nits at 10 screen window which is a pretty nice HDR OLED display spec,m5dy0t3,7.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5d9tot,mattmaster68,,18,2025-01-04 15:58:57,,,,Edit I got Mini LED and Micro LED mixed up and NanoLED is a way better term like another user suggested TLDR WOOHOO for Mini LED tech making great picture relatively affordable Im a huge fan of Mini LEDs It feels like its just a step down from OLED I bought a 55 TLC Q7 last year needed the best TV I could find at a certain price point after months of research and understanding Rtings Rtings testing I also made about a dozen trips to Walmart Target and BestBuy just to look at the TVs Omitting OLED technology the only upgrades I see that may be financially feasible are the Hisense U8 or TLC Q8 The super highend Samsung and LG TVs are off the table completely for me but at that price point I might as well just buy an OLED I know nobody asked but one of my biggest pet peeves is when people only care about the size of a TV and not the performance I have a measly 55 Q7 and the picture is way better than a 75 entrylevel Samsung or LG TV on the floor at WalMart lmao Some of my relatives have these massive TVs and theyre always in shock when they see the picture on my budget TV A bigger TV better picture Oh and the Q7 is way cheaper Mini LED FTW,m5cecme,4.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5d2ot3,HulksInvinciblePants,,12,2025-01-04 15:18:07,,,,If were dreaming 600hz is the ideal refresh rate Supports every target framerate 24 30 50 60 120 With the at said 05ms GtG isnt fast enough for 600hz so this all feels gimmicky You need about 016ms 100 response which is significantly closer to OLEDs 02ms OLEDs GtG is 003ms for reference so were talking a panel 16x slower Being able to accept the signal is not the same as being able to produce the result,m5cclwv,3.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5h1a7u,g0atmeal,,1,2025-01-05 04:31:24,,,,I would say the same for 1200hz since thats getting more to the point where people cant see the difference anymore even sidebyside However I dont see those targets ever being used outside of certain cases like esports The reason is because for the average PCconsole of the current generation developers will pick a target framerate eg 3060120 and maximize visual fidelity with the hardware budget in mind Developers would sooner double texture resolution LOD distance poly count etc long before anyone could get the chance to take advantage of such high fps This holds true because lowminimum settings continue to creep up You simply cant play some current games even on flagship hardware of long past Modern AAA games nowadays can barely manage to break 4k 100fps at high settings on 4090 builds and thats with frame generation And even playing those same games at 1080p you seldom see 200fps,m5d2ot3,4.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5cjvwf,VanillaSoftArtist,,22,2025-01-04 13:12:04,,,,Burnin is what scares me most about OLED I know its not instant and that the tech has come a long way since the early days like the first PlayStation Vita model They have things to reduce the likelihood But still the technology doesnt seem ideal for a PC unless youre a gamer who plays multiple games mostly If youre someone like me whose taskbar is almost always on the screen since Im drawing or writing documents more than gaming that shit sounds like a burnin nightmare A shame since the pure black levels are so great on my phone and Switch,m5cclwv,3.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5cuqf8,JBWalker1,,8,2025-01-04 14:28:42,,,,Almost every main phone uses OLED too including iPhones now and it doesnt seem like a common issue on those either Loads of people scroll instagram and reddit and others for hours a day every day so if OLED burn in was still an issue I feel like wed hear about it a lot more on our phones OLED burn in seems to be a non issue on any decent OLED screen for years now but it still gets mentioned as if it hasnt improved at all,m5cs7uz,5.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5cwkg0,VanillaSoftArtist,,3,2025-01-04 14:40:33,,,,Ive seen cases of it happening on modern screens not phones admittedly Not as bad as in the past but still a concern always in the back of my mind Itd be ideal if it were completely eliminated but it seems impossible And I know image retention temporary soft burnin is different and far less of a worry It can even happen on LCDs,m5cuqf8,6.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5di7zy,NickCharlesYT,,20,2025-01-04 16:43:47,,,,I play some rhythm games at a very high level and while I cant easily see the difference between my 144hz and 480hz monitors I can feel it in the controls As such the higher refresh rate does consistently produce higher scores for me I suspect its just in how the game renders more frames and thus is more accurate in handling mouse movements control presses and score calculations This would be because both mouse acceleration and scores are calculated on a per frame basis in the game so more frames more data points higher accuracy and less interpolation Thats a very niche benefit though and its not why I bought the 480hz capable display in the first place,m5cy32u,2.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5dw45z,Xendrus,,12,2025-01-04 17:56:21,,,,Frame pacing is more about your frame rate that isnt really dependent on your refresh rate 120fps 60hz will feel WAY better than 6060 for that reason But you can literally see the 480 being 100 perfectly smooth in the slow mo footage and the 240hz teleports the character every few pixels along That has to help with rhythm timing even if subconsciously,m5di7zy,3.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5dwu6c,NickCharlesYT,,6,2025-01-04 18:00:07,,,,its a bit of both I think because Ive tried 480fps on the 144hz display and it feels a little better than 144fps144hz but not as good as 480 on both It is definitely to the point of diminishing returns though I think for most it would not be perceivable without many hours of practice,m5dw45z,4.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5ehff7,MwSkyterror,,13,2025-01-04 19:46:07,,,,Refresh rate is only a single factor in motion clarity Response time and image persistence are just as important but often ignored by consumers The first 240hz monitors were not much better than 120144hz monitors in motion clarity due to having slow response times This gave rise to the idea that 240hz is only a bit better than 144hz but a more accurate statement is that 240hz with 6ms total response time is only a bit better than 144hz 8ms response time When you see the full picture its not surprising that there isnt a huge improvement because the response times barely got better and the image persistence is still nowhere near good Some monitors tried to improve image persistence but almost all of them run into problems with crosstalk and brightness Same thing happened to the first 360hz monitors But with 480hz monitors it was different Some werent a big improvement but with the proliferation of OLED there was eventually a 480hz OLED monitor The 01ms response times of OLED were a huge leap forward for motion clarity compared to IPS and TN which peaked at 34ms at the fastest For the first time in over a decade there was a large improvement in two areas required for motion clarity instead of just one and its once again a night and day difference between 480hz OLED with 01ms response time and 240hz IPS with 6ms like switching from 60 to 120 480hz OLED is amazing like looking through a window but its not perfect yet It has fast enough response time for sure and arguably enough refresh rate for what CPUs can reasonably achieve in real games right now but those monitors are all still sample and hold displays with image persistence of around 2ms Thats still 2px of motion blur at 1000pxsec movement Good but ideally wed have 05ms persistence To answer your question it depends on the other 2 numbers A hypothetical 200hz display with 01ms response times and 05ms image persistence would have you begging for higher refresh rate because you could clearly see the choppiness Probably all the way up to 500800hz But a 750hz TN monitor that still has a hypothetical 2ms response time will not give the improvement youd hope for from the 50 fps jump plus theres practically no games where you can hold a stable 750fps in actual combat More stuff on blurbusters and aperturegrille Oh and all the manufacturer response time labels are useless Response time is not strictly defined so they can put whatever they want on there A monitor may have some transitions that are indeed 1ms but it doesnt matter when their definition of a transition is horribly incomplete and this number only applies to a specific transition,m5cduyv,2.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5gd3v4,JukePlz,,3,2025-01-05 02:03:05,,,,71Mbit per frame is enough for 1080p with 24bit color may even be enough for HDR depending on the HDR standard used and what the protocol overhead is Besides most of these highend gaming monitors likely leverage DSC so realistically the bandwidth used will be a third of the calculated You do have a point tho and with such high refresh rates it can be dangerously close to bandwidth saturation in some situations and greatly limits the resolutions you can play at That was also a consideration in the LTT video mentioned as not even the 4090 could properly feed the monitor with current transport protocols,m5g5po3,2.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5hytnf,JukePlz,,1,2025-01-05 09:35:24,,,,For latency it should be technically measurable still since its not exactly frame duplication as client sidedprediction is a thing and you can keep adjusting your crosshair even if the serversided calculation for bullets or player movement is gated But it does mean that theres less to be gained after some thresholds I think that all things considered the real world advantage outside of the marketing gimmick are none Id love to see someone try tho but since the difference between 60 240 is 10ms and then from 240 750 only 3ms its gonna take a big sample size and fighting to eliminate other more important external factors to get any measurable difference these monitors bring to real world scenarios in gaming,m5hv9ts,2.0,1htbjuh

comment,mtprcn7,JukePlz,,1,2025-05-22 20:07:58,,,,I think youre right about CS2 at least When I tested this with a card more powerful than a 1080TI I thought that my system was not CPU bound because utilization was 3050 or something like that but turns out that Source2 is still the same piece of steaming shit when it comes to multithreading and will still bottleneck on your CPU based on the performance of just a few cores so its possible to be CPU bound with low processor use even when using the setting for performance cores only Whats worse Valve has made this even less transparent by making it harder to use performance overlays by scaring users into needing a flag to allow third party tools and allegedly affecting trust score so I didnt notice at the time this was the case but RTSS confirms it is,mtkijq4,2.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5fl5af,ob_knoxious,,3,2025-01-04 23:23:55,,,,This is an oversimplification but the reason pro players use strange resolution is so they can stretch the aspect ratio Most common is to play 43 stretched onto 169 or to play boxed in then stretched 1610 This allows player models to be wider and blockier making it easier to place your crosshair onto them If you know much about video resolutions you will know this means part of your screen is cut off but in reality this ends up not mattering with how high level CS is played You have to manually clear or account for every angle with utility so if a player was in your 43 stretched cutoff zone it usually doesnt matter that you didnt see them because they already killed you and the wider effective FOV would not have made a difference because your crosshair placement was off If you havent played much CS or Valorant this likely sounds insane but trust me it does make a difference I was nowhere near pro but did play around 2000 hours of CSGO in high school and played in several tournaments and was lucky enough to play against some actual pros a few times CS is often just seen as a more serious cod but the games are dramatically different Most CS pros have a seemingly absurd setup that they use to maximize every theoretical advantage that makes it difficult for outsiders to review products aimed at professionals Because of this its difficult to review products targeted at them,m5epatb,5.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5dnhha,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT,,1,2025-01-04 17:11:17,,,,I mean higher refresh rate is going to give you less input latency Even if it is marginal the higher it goes Obviously people in a blind test wont notice the marginal difference but it still is just objectively better Especially if you are a pro,m5dbmow,3.0,1htbjuh
comment,m5e54z6,sarhoshamiral,,2,2025-01-04 18:42:48,,,,The latency part is questionable because you have to factor in input processing too But even assuming input lags behind by just 1 frame in every case while it would make a technical difference if blind tests show pros cant differentiate it then it is wasted processing power Human brain and vision has certain limits after all I would love to see a blind study showing pro gamers being able to differentiate between 120hz 240hz and above For myself 60hz is where my limit seems to be personally I dont really see a noticeable difference between 60 and 120hz for example,m5dnhha,4.0,1htbjuh

comment,m61k8kc,t0FF,,1,2025-01-08 13:07:56,,,,Maybe Doesnt change the fact that this specific experience was done with pilot and up to 250hz not highter Its really easy to make a blind test to see if people can actually find which screen is the one running on 360hz but so far I seen none which is intriguing at the very least,m61hy26,10.0,1htbjuh

comment,m5gvtmo,gay_manta_ray,,3,2025-01-05 03:55:29,,,,sure pixels on lcd and oled displays dont just instantly turn off once theyve drawn the current frame the frame persists for a short period of time after the frame is drawn leading to persistence blur persistence blur not to be confused with pixel response time is how long a frame is visible between the transition to the next frame lcd and oled displays both have high persistence blur making response time figures the speed at which a pixel changes from gray to gray or black to white mostly irrelevant for motion clarity this is why advertised 1ms response times for displays doesnt translate into 1000hz motion clarity onto ulmb and bfi on lcds ulmb strobes turns off and then on the backlight in between frames while bfi inserts a black frame in between each frame on oled displays both of these processes are designed to eliminate persistence blur by either turning the backlight off or forcing a black frame in between every frame for example if you are using 120hz with bfi on an oled TV like the LG c1 its actually showing 240 frames per second but every other frame is black the problem is that both bfi and ulmb are far from perfect theyre bandaid solutions for inherently flawed lcd and oled display technology even with a backlight strobing at 480hz persistence blur is still slightly visible preventing you from achieving razor sharp motion clarity and when i say razor sharp i mean the ability to look around in a game and have things like text appear exactly as sharp as they would if you werent moving at all currently no lcd or oled display can achieve this how the fp2141 is relevant the NEC fp2141 is one of the best and last CRT monitors ever made i still own one and play quake on it regularly CRT monitors use an electron beam to scan or activate the phosphors of the display which draws each frame these phosphors only stay on as the beam is scanning the display and turn off immediately after theyre scanned somewhere in the microsecond range this completely eliminates any persistence blur and allows for perfect motion clarity even at 160hz what this all means is that even with four times the refresh rate 480hz and bandaid solutions to persistence blur we still arent quite at the level of motion clarity that CRTs were at over 20 years ago it will likely take a new technology like microled for us to achieve this but thats a long ways off,m5gdvpn,2.0,1htbjuh
