comment,mdu07ha,Ben_SRQ,,31,2025-02-20 17:15:48,,,,Help an older guy out I thought based meant A word used when you agree with something or when you want to recognize someone for being themselves Especially common in online political slang From Urban Dictionary But I cant really make that definition jive see I told you I was old with your use of it It seems like your use of based is just another way of saying appropriate Thanks in advance,mdr8gpf,1.0,1itqtyb

comment,mdu5x9x,FilthyStatist1991,,4,2025-02-20 17:42:06,,,,Correct when you agree with something I believe it started as right wing political slang for agreeing with someone often when their opinion is thought to initially be unpopular But is in fact popular,mdu07ha,2.0,1itqtyb
comment,mdvs4y3,Yungdolan,,19,2025-02-20 22:09:20,,,,To be real it started in the late 2000s with an underground Bay Area hiphop artist known as Based God He wasnt known for his lyrical skill but rather work ethic and positivity Originally being based is remaining true often to yourself and in a positive manner despite all odds Based God coined the term and embodied this For example releasing over 40 projects in one year despite constant negative criticism and never stooping to their level of hate because he would rather spread love While he was never recognized for his musical prowess his platform allowed him to guest lecture at places such as MIT NYU UCLA Princeton etc Many artists within the hiphop industry credit him for his unique platform and based began to spread beyond his fanbase some not even rap fans and hiphop in general However similar to woke the term has been adopted by those who have no knowledge of origin and its taken on other meaning The originator would detest based being used to support a person promoting messages putting down a fellow human despite standing against criticism being true to the origin,mdu5x9x,3.0,1itqtyb

comment,mdv4dy1,Jestersage,,1,2025-02-20 20:18:28,,,,Basically yeah Many slang employ a close enough mentality and tend to evolved that way You already notice the you agree with something and so you just apply it that way In fact its probably far closer to translation between different languages As many researches have shown including CIAs Mokuzatsu translation cannot be one to one I also found it similar to ingame text chat ie back in the 00s when you have to type something quickly so you fill in the gap based on context,mdu07ha,2.0,1itqtyb

comment,mdtjtn9,L0rdV0n,,10,2025-02-20 15:59:51,,,,I dont think they have the manpower or expertise for that eOS is just a slightly modified version of LineageOS And it only runs on phones that LineageOS already supports so they probably arent doing any of the deeper level development like they probably dont work on the hardware compatibility or anything like that,mdtbdi6,1.0,1itqtyb
comment,mdtwafp,miguel-styx,,5,2025-02-20 16:57:40,,,,LineageOS does have x86 builds if you want you can even run them in Waydroid careful this build has issues with the ndk translators Besides the hardware compatibility part is already done by BlissOS team the only part they probably have to do is to recompile the apps for x86 probably Then again I am no expert on this I have made apps in React Native and Flutter and they do allow x86 builds to be compiled largely I am curious what tech they use in their system apps though Been thinking of contributing one for LineageOS,mdtjtn9,2.0,1itqtyb
comment,mesgr44,L0rdV0n,,1,2025-02-25 23:16:06,,,,Oh cool I had no idea They should do an x86 build then like may as well reach more devices Especially if they are going to try to compete with Google,mdtwafp,3.0,1itqtyb
