comment,m1vw8m5,TheMacMan,,746,2024-12-13 17:12:40,,,,Technically this isnt because of the USBC deadline The law applies to devices INTRODUCED after January 1 2025 Since the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 were introduced before then they can continue sale if they choose Its only NEWLY RELEASED devices that must have USBC So this is Apples choice not due to the EU regulations,,0.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1w1owc,TheMacMan,,65,2024-12-13 17:41:33,,,,No problem Initially folks were saying that itd effect the current iPhone but it would really not impact them until the iPhone 17 release in 2026 because itd be the first new model introduced after the requirement went into effect Folks need to remember this only applies to cellphones The same does not apply to things like laptops and other USBpowered devices,m1vzspj,2.0,1hda6w5

comment,m22yrek,y0l0naise,,1,2024-12-14 22:29:16,,,,I dont think that makes a lot of sense A lot of people get their phones with a plan which typically run for 1 or 2 years Hijacking this already existing pattern makes it so much easier for them to make money off of They have been experimenting with slowing down hardware releases in another however Initially by putting new insides in older outsides with the iPhone SE but also my iPhone 15 carries the same processor as the iPhone 14 Pro did This basically means putting a year old hardware in that years phone Theyve changed back with the iPhone 16 though,m1yzhl6,5.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1wh3w9,randompantsfoto,,68,2024-12-13 19:02:52,,,,Yup this is totally Apple taking advantage of the situation and spinning it as an excuse to only sell newer more expensive phones Sneaky,m1vw8m5,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zgox0,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,3,2024-12-14 07:02:09,,,,Theyre just discontinuing old product like every normal company does The 14 was 2 generations ago Why would they keep making 14s when that production line could be making newer phones Apple probably keeps old models of product for sale longer than most others but after a point theyre just not worth it any more Id be shocked if Apple were moving significant units of 14s and they never sold significant units of the SE,m1wh3w9,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m2f4m74,LetsJerkCircular,,1,2024-12-17 00:46:05,,,,They allude to it in the article but Apple has what they call their lineup Its basically their list of devices that are currently still for sale brand new through Apple Like they said in the article Apple would typically keep the 14 and the SE3 in the lineup until the 17 series comes out and when a new SE comes out respectively Regardless of the validity or reasoning behind this were all here talking about Apple,m1zgox0,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1wl11h,TheMacMan,,15,2024-12-13 19:23:23,,,,How many old iPhone 14 are they selling in Europe when they have the 15 and 16 available Come on its been out for over 3 years Its not as if buyers havent had enough time to make that purchase if they wanted it Guess theyll just have to purchase a refurbished unit,m1wh3w9,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1xgyw6,Kramer7969,,13,2024-12-13 22:18:25,,,,I just bought a 12 was an upgrade from the X No new phone does anything I cant do or need to do People made fun of me in the early 2000s for always having a new phone who needs a phone with a camera they asked lol now is the opposite,m1wl11h,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1yks6k,rogue_giant,,3,2024-12-14 02:34:02,,,,Im happy with the iPhone SE that I have Its not a mega sized phone that barely fits in my pocket and I much rather prefer having an actual home button over a slightly larger screen,m1xgyw6,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zp8lv,AbyssalRedemption,,3,2024-12-14 08:38:21,,,,Same had the SE 2020 since its release and honestly its the last phone that has the basic features that I actually like and would go for given the choice I HATE how were still getting bigger and bigger phones and the companies keep pushing for that no buttons only screen design model Give me back my compact phone with tactile feedback smfh,m1yks6k,5.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1yzzmt,Buttersaucewac,,3,2024-12-14 04:27:22,,,,I get the new upgrades every 2 years through work Galaxy A and iPhone doing QA on our mobile apps and it never feels like a noticeable difference anymore for the high end flagship models The budget models are improving steadily but iPhone 12 to 14 to 16 only minor incremental improvements I would happily use an iPhone 12 today and miss nothing,m1xgyw6,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1z9hqy,blackweebow,,2,2024-12-14 05:49:21,,,,I didnt even know my work iphone 12 was an Xr until yesterday There is no difference outside of the number of cameras on the back,m1yzzmt,5.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zp2mq,AbyssalRedemption,,3,2024-12-14 08:36:23,,,,Same been content with my 2020 SE since it came out and will probably gold onto it until the security updates stop in twothree years or so I dont want nor need any of the fancy AI mumbojumbo every new phone comes with now Dont want any new gimmicky tech either like the folding screen trend were seeing now Just give me a phone that fits in the palm of my hand has a decent processor decent batter large hard drive and the ability to access every conventional app I need and Im content,m1xgyw6,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m21vhze,cyankitten,,2,2024-12-14 18:38:50,,,,Some of the things the newer models have erm I have an XS Well I dont WANT fingerprint recognition etc I dont mind it as an OPTION but Id be wary of anything that forced it Nor do I want 5G Ill stay away from that for as long as I possibly can Again I dont mind if its an OPTION but I dont want a phone that ONLY has 5G fingerprints Im keeping my XS too as long as I can I dont know how much longer it has left but yeah With a bajillion photos too sometimes that switch over is a pain too,m1zp2mq,5.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zykjs,Eruannster,,3,2024-12-14 10:29:06,,,,Electronic retailers are still selling iPhone 11 and 12 models at a pretty hefty discount compared to newer models They are still incredibly good phones even by todays standards Im still rocking an iPhone XR and its still getting updates,m1wl11h,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m21vnau,cyankitten,,1,2024-12-14 18:39:40,,,,For me XS recently it updated too,m1zykjs,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1x7ofz,Jim3001,,9,2024-12-13 21:26:39,,,,Realistically the question should be How many people dont want to shell out 1000 for a phone I guarantee that those older models are being sold cheaply to kids and the elderly,m1wl11h,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1xg22z,Mystic_L,,14,2024-12-13 22:13:10,,,,Ive just had a quick scan of the EU common charger regulation which this article is referring to The regulation applies to devices being placed on the market simplistically that is typically as it arrives in the first port within the EU Placed on the market applies to each individual device so its entirely plausible that this blocks Apple from making the device available if it wasnt already in the EU at the cut off date Changing the the lightning port for a usbc port is likely not as straight forward as it seems it may drive the need for a complete change to the pan to accommodate the port if its a different wiring configuration size or power regulation needs There would be a change to the design of the case and the assembly line to manufacture Plus changes to middleware and drivers to support the changeand need be supported in life for the phone in software updates this could run into the millions Id guess Apple have taken the decision with a relatively old device to discontinue it for the EU as the cost benefit doesnt stack up,m1vw8m5,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zyh96,Eruannster,,5,2024-12-14 10:28:01,,,,Also they are rumored to be launching a new iPhone SE model in early 2025 which I assume may compete with the 14 and SE in pricefeatures and they would rather have customers buy their New Cool Thing,m1xg22z,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1xjsn8,loljetfuel,,5,2024-12-13 22:34:56,,,,The law applies to devices INTRODUCED after January 1 2025 Ive seen people saying this and people disputing this saying its any new device SOLD after that date but I havent seen an authoritative source either way Any chance you have one handy,m1vw8m5,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1xkakt,TheMacMan,,4,2024-12-13 22:37:50,,,,Not offhand but the adopted text is linked at the bottom of this release,m1xjsn8,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1xlw4t,loljetfuel,,20,2024-12-13 22:47:10,,,,Appreciate that Based on that source I was able to find the EUs implementation guide which says This will not prevent existing stock of equipment that have been placed on the EU market before the entry into application of the new rules from being sold legally after the entry into application of the new rules The Blue Guide contains further detailed guidance on that matter notably in section 2 See also the answer to question 43 emphasis mine source So its actually _incorrect_ to say that it only applies to items introduced after that date it applies to items _placed on the market_ after that date That term applies to devices not models or model lines That means that if there are iPhones with lightning connectors already in stock within the EU they dont have to be removed from stock after the rule goes into effect But Apple cannot ship additional phones with that connector into the market after that date,m1xkakt,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1yluce,brucebrowde,,-2,2024-12-14 02:41:29,,,,My understanding is iPhone SE and 14 are not being produced anymore so this point is kind of moot,m1xlw4t,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zz7fw,Oreelz,,12,2024-12-14 10:36:37,,,,Im realy gering tired of this shit Big companys blame EU regualtions for buisness decisions is dangerous They want to damage the trust to democratic goverments and institutions Which is unverstandable cause the EU in fact regulates them in favor for the customer EU You cant sell new products without usbc Apple Bohoo the EU doesnt allow us to sell our old products buy our new expensive shit EU You cant exploit your monopole and cut out the competition Google Bohoo the EU forbids that we link Maps,m1vw8m5,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1zybad,Eruannster,,3,2024-12-14 10:26:04,,,,Also this only seems to apply to Apple themselves Other retailers will happily sell stock of whatever iPhones they have lying around Hell you can still buy iPhone 11 and 12 from electronic retailers at a pretty decent discount I assume that Apple is halting sales of these devices because they want to sell their rumored upcoming new iPhone SE which is rumored to launch early 2025 and they dont want to cut into their own sales with competing devices,m1vw8m5,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1uew91,Jugales,,416,2024-12-13 11:35:37,,,,Might not be a popular Reddit opinion but thats fair Cant expect companies to go back to the design board for previous generations of products People who want cheaper phones will probably go to Android When the consumer and company are both losing thats compromise The benefit is universal charging and I think its worth the loss,,0.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1ujtlg,Sylvurphlame,,128,2024-12-13 12:19:44,,,,Doesnt the rumor mill say theyre releasing an iPhone SE4 in March or April That would have USBC anyway,m1uew91,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1x05nm,obi1kenobi1,,19,2024-12-13 20:45:21,,,,Yeah but the rumor mill also said it would be March 2024 and before that it said late 2023 When it comes to the SE specifically the rumor mill is exactly that unfounded rumors with no basis in reality,m1ujtlg,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1yagmy,Sylvurphlame,,8,2024-12-14 01:23:24,,,,Its not really any more unfounded than the rumors that fly around about the iPhone and iPhone Pro until right before the actual release Thats where you have to apply critical thinking A fourth generation iPhone SE in 2023 never made any sense because 1 they had just released one in 2022 and 2 Apple was having to look at shifting to USBC for the EU No way were they releasing USBC on the iPhone SE before it debuted on the iPhone and iPhone Pro A 2024 release was a little more plausible but I suspect they had to change things to accommodate Apple Intelligence which delayed production,m1x05nm,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m21vnmg,None,,2,2024-12-14 18:39:43,,,,To be fair us SE users arent probably the types that buy a new device the instant theyre released or we wouldnt have the cheapest version of the iPhone Im not sitting here waiting for the new version When mine breaks Ill buy it,m1x05nm,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m22dco5,obi1kenobi1,,1,2024-12-14 20:21:50,,,,That kind of depends on which rumor you follow and why you want an SE If youre a home button holdout then the idea of a new phone in that form factor could be a day one buy Or even a hypothetical phone that ditches the home button but has an iPadstyle TouchID sensor instead of FaceID could appeal to some people Or you could be like my father who is hoping for the next SE to have the 1213 Mini form factor but with USBC like his work phone Hes been putting off upgrading his SE2 for almost a year now waiting for the SE that might not even happen instead of buying a 13 Mini or a cheap subsidized 1516 that has USBC and no matter what form factor it ends up having hell probably be a day one buyer of the next SE But yeah if it ends up being something more mundane like a normal iPhone 1216 form factor with an LCD instead of OLED and one camera then its probably not going to have a lot of day one buyers,m21vnmg,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m22k311,None,,2,2024-12-14 21:01:41,,,,Im just thinking if apple had data that showed SE users would be buying a ton of them theyd be faster to come out like other models of the iPhone Id be willing to bet money that most SE users purchase it for the cost above all else I do love my home button though,m22dco5,5.0,1hda6w5
comment,m2qzq7v,thehighshibe,,2,2024-12-19 00:46:30,,,,No one at Apple or Foxconn is willing to risk their job and legal issues just to leak the fuckin SE model of the iPhone lol Go big or go home theyll obviously risk it for the flagships if theyre going to risk it at all,m1x05nm,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1uszhz,Inform-All,,-16,2024-12-13 13:28:11,,,,Not with the typical SE style USBC and no home button Its also a marginally larger phone than before With a higher price point than before Seems to defeat the purpose of the SE,m1ujtlg,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1uuf2x,Sylvurphlame,,38,2024-12-13 13:37:50,,,,The price point is only predicted to be slightly higher at 499 USD versus 429 last I read If anything thats pretty good given inflation post COVID And thats not even talking about the spec bump to support AI Which will benefit you even if you dont use AI USBC is going to be mandatory to sell it in the EU As for the Home ButtonTouch ID Just let it go Its over Those are dead technologies on the iPhone,m1uszhz,3.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1v63gw,Few_Direction9007,,14,2024-12-13 14:50:50,,,,Not just didnt sell well enough it was the biggest iPhone flop of all time The mini 1 was 5 of its generations sales and the mini 2 was 3 Those are unbelievably awful sales figures Its too bad because it was a good product but the mini was apocalyptically unpopular,m1upuzj,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1w6xm5,dertechie,,10,2024-12-13 18:08:59,,,,Honestly the mini feels like the kind of product you revive on a 35 year cycle and sell for a year each time and be clear that its a one year revival Theres not enough people buying to make sense for continuous production though 35 of iPhone sales is still a lot of phones,m1v63gw,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1vsx2o,Mental_Tea_4084,,14,2024-12-13 16:55:00,,,,Everyone Ive talked to that had one loved it though I had to console several of them when I worked for Verizon as they tried to order the latest mini just to find out that it doesnt exist,m1v63gw,4.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1xmyc4,mezzzolino,,1,2024-12-13 22:53:34,,,,I think it was intentional The SE was a way to have employees optionally use a companysupplied iPhone without having the luxuryvibes,m1uuah9,5.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1uzjyd,BWCDD4,,-1,2024-12-13 14:11:05,,,,Mini users are delusional Why would you expect them to do that and cater to your niche when there is no substantial demand for a mini The SE is popular because its normal sized larger phones in general are also more popular hence they released the 16 plus At best you can hope they turn it into an every 34 years phone,m1us3ri,4.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1v1nsb,meeeeelz,,-8,2024-12-13 14:24:09,,,,You are delusional There is ample demand for a mini variant I work in UX design and the amount of 13 Mini designers I work with outweigh the huge cumbersome bricklike tablets we call phones today The 13 Mini has a smaller footprint than the current SE and a much larger screen,m1uzjyd,5.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1v4tn4,Few_Direction9007,,10,2024-12-13 14:43:20,,,,Nah youre the one whos delusional dont get me wrong I love the mini I wish it was more popular but it was apples biggest iPhone failure period The first mini made up just 5 of the iPhone 13 generation sales and the mini 2 made up just 3 of the 14th gen It was an absolute disaster of a product for them Literally the worst selling iPhone ever made Sorry but with this one its absolutely the consumer telling Apple they dont want this A vocal minority say they want a small phone but the sales numbers speak way louder than a few Reddit posts Dont blame Apple one bit even though I very much wish I could get a modern mini with USB C,m1v1nsb,6.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1w454e,None,,2,2024-12-13 17:54:18,,,,See I used to be all gung ho on smaller phones Had an iPhone 5S as my first smartphone then a XS then my Galaxy S22 I smashed my Galaxy S22 with a dumbbell a couple weeks ago when I wasnt paying attention and am now borrowing my roommates old Note 20 I actually find I can type so much more accurately on a larger display and am not bothered by it as much now I just ordered an iPhone 15 Pro Max to replace it and Im comfy with the size on it I wasnt on a 16 Pro Max though which is the largest new smartphone and actually cannot be held onehanded because my hands are so small I think its one of those things where you use it long enough and kinda just gaslight yourself into liking it because I was set on never getting a larger phone until now,m1uwn72,3.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1w7s7l,dertechie,,2,2024-12-13 18:13:30,,,,I dont get it either Got a PM when I upgraded to see what all the fuss was about Ended up returning it for a regular Pro It has some upsides The big screen is nice and the battery lasts forever However I cant one hand it at all Every interaction beyond scrolling basically takes two hands The battery is amazing but its overkill I forgot to plug in last night and still have 47 on a Pro,m1uwn72,3.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1vc1n7,None,,1,2024-12-13 15:24:36,,,,I can see it honestly I have a 13 and while I absolutely love it I do find certain things less ergonomic because I have larger hands That said the top to bottom reach on my 13 while using one hand is extremely difficult so theres pros and cons to both sizes Really I want a phone that is more square than a skinny rectangle Ive never liked the super wide screen feel of phones personally,m1uwn72,3.0,1hda6w5

comment,m21ae8n,House_Of_Doubt,,1,2024-12-14 16:39:41,,,,Unfortunately its very unlikely we will see another mini At least for several generations Their low sales volume is just too hard to justify when considering all of the RD and manufacturing costs that go into making a new model We may eventually see another when demand is deemed high enough andor Apple feels like blowing some cash to gainretain brand loyalty,m1wjngi,1.0,1hda6w5
comment,m21pun2,Ehmc130,,1,2024-12-14 18:06:39,,,,I agree for the most part but I think the upcoming release of the 4th generation iPhone SE may take on more of that market segment of a smaller more economical entry into the Apple ecosystem I dont believe well see a flagship model with a smaller chassis based on a more vocal minority of customers I could be off base but I believe the iPhone Plus has been selling better than the Mini ever did Cook has always been a numbers first CEO if its not profitable enough hes not going to let it happen,m21ae8n,2.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1ue3qh,chrisdh79,,46,2024-12-13 11:27:47,,,,From the article As reported by iGeneration Apple will stop selling the iPhone SE and the iPhone 14 series at the end of the year as the USBC universal charging connector deadline comes into effect Right now the oldest phones still sold directly through Apple are the thirdgeneration iPhone SE the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus As these phones feature a Lightning port they are in violation of the European Union policy which goes into effect starting January 2025 Apple could have elected to make a new version of these devices with USBC ports instead of Lightning but they have not done so Instead the company has decided to simply discontinue these models slightly earlier than they otherwise would However it is not that big a loss In spring 2025 Apple will launch the new fourthgeneration iPhone SE which will naturally feature a USBC port The new iPhone SE is expected to resemble an iPhone 14 in chassis design featuring edgetoedge screen upgraded camera and USBC charging,,0.0,1hda6w5

comment,m1v5v2a,chrisagiddings,,5,2024-12-13 14:49:27,,,,Someone authorizes the CE mark for electronics in Europe so the bureaucracy absolutely knows when the device was released and could enforce penalties on only newer products They could easily choose to rescind certification andor force recalls within the Eurozone as well a method of regulatory enforcement Theyre unlikely to do any of these things But they have options,m1uvkwe,2.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1vls3a,notjfd,,7,2024-12-13 16:17:17,,,,CE does not mean that it was authorized CE is not a certificate but a mark It means that the manufacturer _affirms_ ie promises to be compliant with regulatory requirements Some electronics in order to be compliant need to be certified eg wireless products Some larger products require that the factory is also compliant with safetyregulatory standards and must be inspected But no a CE mark does not imply it was approvedcertifiedauthorisedreviewed by any official unless that product category requires it few do,m1v5v2a,3.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1vmj9y,chrisagiddings,,1,2024-12-13 16:21:15,,,,My understanding is the CE mark is akin to the FCC mark which requires a regulatory certification for the physical product,m1vls3a,4.0,1hda6w5
comment,m1vzq62,notjfd,,6,2024-12-13 17:31:12,,,,FCC certification is required for devices that emit radiation eg wifiequipped laptops Not all devices fall within that scope Batterypowered devices with no radios like flashlights require no FCC approval CE on the other hand covers _every_ product sold in the internal market Kids toys must be compliant with EU regulations like the Toy Safety Directive 200948EC In this case the CE mark is nothing more than a selfdeclaration from the manufacturer that these regulations are followed If you make a kids toy that has wireless emissions eg a wifiequipped talking bear then it also has to comply with the Radio Equipment Directive RED 201453EU Its this directive the RED that requires certification So for wireless products the CE mark _does_ mean its certified but the vast majority of products are not covered by regulations that require certification,m1vmj9y,5.0,1hda6w5
