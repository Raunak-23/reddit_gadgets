comment,m2hr4q2,jakgal04,,592,2024-12-17 13:46:38,,,,I work in public safety and this looming threat of banning Chinese made drones is something that would seriously affect us more than people know The fact of the matter is theres not a single decent US made drone that we can use as a viable replacement We currently have a Matrice 300 two Matrice 30Ts two Mavic 3 Enterprises and an Avata We have at least 23 wins a month with these things whether its finding a missing person in the woods finding a boater overboard or sending the drones in ahead of police for emergency situations We have a Skydio thats so horribly bad that it never leaves its case Theres a company that takes Mavics guts them and adds in US made components but the interface is horrible the latency is a disaster and its not reliable at all Other than that everything else is extremely overpriced and significantly outdated technology,,0.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2jg3ed,munche,,54,2024-12-17 19:23:23,,,,They dont need a drone to know where you are all the time If bluetooth is on on your phone its pinging readers all over the place to track what aisles you linger on in a store If you drive a vehicle there are vast networks of private and government owned license plate readers that log every single vehicle going by This isnt even getting into the fact that basically every app on your phone store loyalty card or anything you can think of is harvesting as much data as humanly possible about you and selling it off en masse Youre already being tracked all the time by basically everything you interact with We need a much more coherent data privacy policy than China bad,m2j801u,5.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2jtaqb,LowDownSkankyDude,,8,2024-12-17 20:33:24,,,,Yeah Im not trying to imply that drones are the issue rather that theyre an expansion of the issue The more ways to track the worse tracking is going to get and the harder it will be to reign it in A point I think were well beyond,m2jg3ed,6.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2k8i6y,munche,,13,2024-12-17 21:54:05,,,,The problem is we need sweeping data privacy reform for everyone and these bullshit moves against China Only dont actually help You think those data brokers wont sell all of this information to any foreign government who asks Why wouldnt they They ban DJI drones so the American company that just got handed the market can do all of the nefarious data gathering things we worried about and sell it to China or anyone else for profit Hooray Meanwhile the consumer gets a worse product at a higher price and their privacy is just as violated if not moreso,m2jtaqb,7.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2pdplr,cladogenesis,,0,2024-12-18 19:27:02,,,,It is absolutely technically possible to embed hardware that gives an adversary full control over a device regardless of what software you load onto it Smartphones are a case in point since the baseband processor typically runs its own OS and has unsupervised access to RAM and other resources Is the fear warranted Absolutely Is the policy worth the negative impacts I dont know I do know theres nothing magic about building a drone The market can fill this gap with a little bit of time The hardest part is the chips which admittedly are a bit magical because of their complex international supply chains but this hurdle is minimal compared to the much larger problem we need to solve with respect to our smartphones PCs cars etc relying on Chinese semiconductors One last thing if Washington is handwringing about a potential digital threat from China its probably already a reality The CCP can make stuff happen And weve probably been doing something similar to them,m2iovh8,4.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2rja5r,Surefitkw,,3,2024-12-19 02:47:38,,,,I dont think its particularly easy to do what DJI has done especially not since cost of acquisition is going to be a key factor Look at what happened to GoPro when they tried to compete Im no expert but Ive read that DJI is a decade ahead of rivals and it has all the advantages of scale now They are just superior drones in every way Are we going to nationally subsidize a USbuilt alternative now Because if the private sector tries it theyre going to get murdered like GoPro The requirement to build and crew ships used for domestic transport in the United States has NOT worked out particularly well and now this is basically proposing to do the same thing Yes if your only option is an Americanmade drone with 60 of the performance at 200 of the cost some industries will just be forced to eat that cost But that isnt going to magically incubate a DJIworthy US dronemaker it will result in lazy expensive manufacturing just like we see with domestic shipping and transportation builds via the Jones Act,m2pdplr,5.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2ipxft,Onceforlife,,26,2024-12-17 17:05:54,,,,Thing is Ukrains survival depends on this whereas in the good ol US of A its more of a political and also lobbying move to do it Since Trump is always an ass to Ukraine about them not offering anything back how about ask for their source code so US government can also override the drones Even thats ridiculous cause I know in the pentagon there must be multiple teams capable of doing this,m2ik2sq,3.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2ixetf,livahd,,5,2024-12-17 17:45:40,,,,Thats the move I could totally see the reasoning behind the caution of using Chinese drones especially when DJI has integrated social media to share your footage Who knows what they have the ability to do with gps and HD footage Id have no problem flashing it to a domestic platform thats comparable if it came down to it,m2hy3np,2.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2izbwk,GrynaiTaip,,11,2024-12-17 17:55:37,,,,Who knows what they have the ability to do Everything DJI drones broadcast not just their own GPS coordinates but also those of the operator Russia really liked this feature they could aim their artillery at operators rather than trying to shoot down the drones so Ukraine had to quickly figure out how to change the software,m2ixetf,3.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2s1zb4,hbomb57,,1,2024-12-19 05:00:49,,,,DJIs at least used to have some sketchy shit in their software This has been an issue for about 10 years 8 years ago some people were raising alarms about how good they were but usable for even remotely sensitive work Any potential military replacements were killed by dumb requirements Like resistance to extended submergence in salt water or mcode gps or name another thing thats incompatible with low cost But weve been reflashing dji drones for quite a few years also That being said you wont find dji in my home,m2hy3np,2.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2j9tc8,pmjm,,24,2024-12-17 18:50:26,,,,Im only familiar with drones in the context of photography and cinematography but I agree with you The Chinese drones are lightyears ahead of stuff designed domestically which end up being manufactured in China anyway The sad truth is that our lawmakers dont care about our use cases Theyre pushing a narrative and their political base is eating it up Retirees are the largest voting block and they are largely clueless about our modern world especially in tech So the politicians dont care how many lives these policies affect or cost theyre going to do this and grandstand about it as if theyre heroes,m2hr4q2,1.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2mwo85,Bayesian11,,1,2024-12-18 09:44:06,,,,Their narrative is everything china made is based on technology stolen from the US If youre willing to pay a premium you can buy American counterparts which are of better quality,m2j9tc8,2.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2ize9i,-GameWarden-,,13,2024-12-17 17:55:57,,,,I work for a federal agency and weve had to use the Parrot ANACFI USA gov model and it works The guys who do use it much more than me do say its usable but a step down Obviously its way more expensive so for small or state agencies its a big purchase But that always what you get when something is Fully TAA NDAA and Berry Compliant,m2hr4q2,1.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2j1eqn,jakgal04,,12,2024-12-17 18:06:33,,,,This was our experience when we trialed it as well Its okay but feels like a decent step back at 3x the price compared to our M3E The biggest drawback for us was the transmission power The Anafi seemed to suffer horribly in urban environments with signal interference Our DJI lineup doesnt miss a beat,m2ize9i,2.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2hw4zu,Lord_Tsarkon,,38,2024-12-17 14:19:10,,,,Isnt this because the American made good stuff is only used for military Make more money off government than regular people Even if the Chinese are taking your Chinese drone data as long as its forests and saving people and looking at whales who fuckin cares If you work on Military base or defense program than ban those there then Simple,m2hr4q2,1.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2hxjr1,Mama_Skip,,91,2024-12-17 14:27:56,,,,I dont think banning the Chinese drones is necessarily the bad idea the bad idea is doing so without first incentivizing domestic drone production to replace it in an easy transition,m2hw4zu,2.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2i6tpu,Yancy_Farnesworth,,-7,2024-12-17 15:22:43,,,,This is one of those rare instances where specific tariffs could be beneficial Only if its done in concert with allies against Chinese made drones The CCPs playbook has always been to fund businesses through massive government incentive programs and undercut the rest of the world to end competition Its quite literally a government funded monopoly The only real way to fight that is to specifically make their products more expensive,m2hxjr1,3.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2ifg4q,SETHW,,25,2024-12-17 16:10:08,,,,they also save a lot of overhead by limiting maximum profit companies can take that playbook you describe could be said about usa france germany etc just the same with the exception that prices dont fall because legal corruption allows executives to pocket the majority of the subsidies as bonuses and inflate profits for shareholders I mean fuck the CCP for a lot of reasons but we shouldnt be punishing them for figuring out that theres an advantage to prices better reflecting the real costs of production if anything we need our representative government to better represent people and act as a counterbalance to the greed sick motives of corporations instead its all completely captured and all value is being sucked away into a few very rich pockets with very little output to show for it Honestly the west feels like russia with oligarchs these days,m2i6tpu,4.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2ilmh6,Yancy_Farnesworth,,-3,2024-12-17 16:43:07,,,,The CCP does not limit how much profit their companies can make in particular the ones selling to the global market They do have some price controls in place but those deal with domestic markets and not foreign ones Yes the playbook has been used to some extent by other countries But generally speaking not to the extent that the CCP does You are underestimating the extent of government subsidy the CCP puts toward these initiatives Rare earth metals for example are an area where the CCP has explicitly dumped on the market in order to put competitors out of business Hell they explicitly crashed REE markets when the US was reopening a mine a decade ago and immediately increased prices after that mine went out of business To say that the US is anything like the Russian situation is seriously insane To draw any comparison to the Russian oligarchs and the amount of power they have over the government is nuts Youre either dramatically underestimating the amount of corruption the Russian government has or severely overestimating how rife it is in the US The US by no means is a paragon of noncorruption but Russia is quite literally a kleptocratic state built on a foundation of state owned enterprises sold to specific individuals,m2ifg4q,5.0,1hgagoc

comment,m2o42cz,Yancy_Farnesworth,,1,2024-12-18 15:25:50,,,,Did I ever claim its not a big deal It certainly is And the point is that were not at the point of Russia yet And there are still safeguards in place that will reign in Trump and his ilk There are things that can be done to turn it around peacefully The only way to turn that around in Russia is a violent revolution unless Putin decides to cede power,m2k81zc,9.0,1hgagoc
comment,m2q7n0p,munche,,1,2024-12-18 22:01:34,,,,What safeguards The people who spent the last 6 months warning us about the destruction of our democracy are smiling and doing photo ops and bragging about how willing to work with Trumps team they are Theres nobody guarding the gates Trump is openly going to loot and privatize as much of the government as humanly possible and they cant even be bothered to muster up a protest against the cabinet nominees Just watching a car careen towards a cliff at 100mph and shrugging saying im sure itll be fine,m2o42cz,10.0,1hgagoc
