comment,mofioyz,HippityHoppityBoop,,211,2025-04-22 13:51:54,,,,lol US speed running into the closed economies the developing world used to have They learnt their lessons and realized how quality of life and quality of products drops with protectionism and opened up their economies while the US is going the other way On the bright side some more deserving countryies will take up the mantle of global economic leadership,,0.0,1k541x9
comment,mofvn1r,dw444,,44,2025-04-22 14:58:31,,,,This requires more nuance Developing countries actually need protectionism and every single developing country that has transitioned to developed since WW2 has done so with heavily protected economies The only exception to this is Hong Kong Protectionism for developing countries and devleoped ones is not the same and doesnt serve the same purpose Too many people claim ChinaKoreaJapaninsert similar country here developed through free trade which is false They all liberalized and heavily promoted export regimes while basically shutting off their domestic economies to most imports that werent capital goods,mofioyz,1.0,1k541x9
comment,mogvd6h,Jusanden,,33,2025-04-22 17:50:55,,,,Tariffs do have a place and purpose To protect domestic industries as they develop and become cost competitive with the world If the US wants to rekindle a manufacturing base then tariffs would be one tool out of many that could be leveraged to do so Whether or not that even makes sense to do when the US is a largely service based economy nowadays is a different story The way the current tariffs has been rolled out however is a fucking disaster,mofvn1r,2.0,1k541x9
comment,mohors0,Zaptruder,,12,2025-04-22 20:15:47,,,,This You talk to your industries and figure out what level of protection and subsidy they need on what time frame in order to encourage the accelerating development of that industry Trump otoh is simply using tarriffs to implode the American economy and global trade is collateral to that So that his billionaire buddies can carve up and divide America into technofacistmonarchies,mogvd6h,3.0,1k541x9
comment,moj6784,dw444,,-1,2025-04-23 01:05:44,,,,If you do that you end up with rent seeking industries and in a middle income trap like Malaysia or India You tell your industries that they get x level of protection for y number of years after which theyre on their own During that time you shut down all foreign competition in the domestic market allow imports of capital goods on preferential terms and pray that they make something of it,mohors0,4.0,1k541x9

comment,monza83,ArrogantAnalyst,,2,2025-04-23 19:54:28,,,,And the funny thing is if theres one big winner of globalization it would be the US The US and my country Germany did profit like crazy from the international economy that formed after WWII And the US did not only become the biggest economical powerhouse it also became a huge cultural leader All this power hard and soft currently gets thrown out of the window with both hands Its crazy to watch,mofioyz,1.0,1k541x9

comment,mop4boa,darklordenron,,3,2025-04-23 23:27:09,,,,That would have happened had it not been for the fact that I specifically bought this camera to help capture my first childs first year on the planet I was very invested in receiving it and had eyes on it every few weeks checking progress Unfortunately it came like five months after she was already here Fucking Fuji they lost my trust with that botched release I wish my x100f never fell off that mountainside,mol5wnp,6.0,1k541x9
