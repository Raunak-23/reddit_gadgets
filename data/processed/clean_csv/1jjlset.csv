comment,mjqmfj9,DameonKormar,,23,2025-03-25 22:47:40,,,,Because it used to be the standard price for video cards and pretty much every manufacturer has a version at that price The higher priced cards back in the 10X20X days were guaranteed higher binned or had some fancy cooling added on,mjqenrc,2.0,1jjlset
comment,mjrsjzr,saoyraan,,3,2025-03-26 02:43:38,,,,Throw in US is a retail economy Msrp is there to prevent competitors from fighting each other over prices Then problem is the graphic card industry is nearly a monopoly It is also a critical product every PC needs Throw in crypto that is consuming the graphic cards at a unreal rate they dont want to play by that model When brick and mortar retailers want in on the secondary market they get hate because its clear as day price gouging Remove msrp and say hey its supply and demand good luck guys Similar practices are done in magic the gathering and other card games Its why you see special promos grt bought up by a single guy in a store just to go to the secondary market to flip them,mjqmfj9,3.0,1jjlset
comment,mjsjl7o,holliss,,2,2025-03-26 06:22:04,,,,You are probably too young to remember but before the crypto boom the MSRP was actually what the base cards were sold for with the fancier cards being a little more expensive And they were also in stock at most places,mjqenrc,2.0,1jjlset

comment,mjuf3dk,mrnuts,,1,2025-03-26 15:09:10,,,,Do ppl still buy video cards to mine bitcoin No not in any meaningful numbers But NVIDIA is still producing a lot of chips for nongaming purposes and selling them to companies that make AI LLMs like OpenAI Anthropic etc This focus on making GPUs for the LLM market is shifting factory capacity away from the gaming side of things and for the past few years they have been making money hand over fist in the AI market higher spec higher margin chips than on the gaming side which makes the gaming GPU side a bit of an afterthought for them currently which is negatively impacting the supply of gaming GPUs and contributing to this overall pricing problem,mjrsdly,2.0,1jjlset

comment,mjp1ses,Xaaeon,,6,2025-03-25 18:06:27,,,,Lets be real though the 9070XT is on par with the 5070 Ti not the 5080 Although I do agree that should be more than enough for gamers even at 4k and with Nvidia being the way they are as a long time Nvidia buyer Im ready to switch Source,mjo3thm,1.0,1jjlset
comment,mjqsrxe,ghostpicnic,,4,2025-03-25 23:20:16,,,,The 9070XT is definitely not more than enough at 4K For reference on Indiana Jones at 1440p the RTX 5080 averages only 54fps on ultra settings PC optimization is SO bad that the 3rd most powerful consumer graphics card ever made cant even hit 60fps on some major tripleA titles in JUST 1440p While thats an extreme example it goes show the state of optimization on PC is absolutely abysmal right now As an owner Ive experienced it firsthand the 5080 STRUGGLES with some games at 4K and thats with Nvidias proprietary features doing some of the heavy lifting A less powerful GPU without access to that tech is absolutely not a 4K card,mjp1ses,2.0,1jjlset
comment,mjyxolu,Doppelkammertoaster,,1,2025-03-27 06:16:59,,,,The question is how many optimize their game for 4k Its not the way most people play,mjqsrxe,3.0,1jjlset
comment,mjqyjs5,Xaaeon,,1,2025-03-25 23:51:07,,,,I have a 4070 Ti Super and I played Indiana Jones on high at 4k using DLSS Balanced getting well over 60fps 90 as far as I recall and the 9070 XT is a bit faster than mine However its definitely a lot worse at RT so you may be right specifically about Indiana Jones since it forces RT I also cant disagree that there are a lot of unoptimized games on PC But leveraging FSR4DLSS definitely gets this tier of card comfortably in a playable range at 4k if perhaps not with RT settings although I can also do 4k Cyberpunk with High RT settings and get a very playable framerate with DLSS I havent used FSR4 myself but according to Hardware Unboxed and Digital Foundry it seems somewhere between DLSS3 and 4 so thats a pretty good result,mjqsrxe,3.0,1jjlset
comment,mjphk2q,CMDR_omnicognate,,2,2025-03-25 19:23:39,,,,Except the difference is not that large and a 5080 costs about twice what a 9070XT does and also wont catch on fire because its poorly designed,mjp1ses,2.0,1jjlset

comment,mjpmnhc,rolfraikou,,2,2025-03-25 19:48:51,,,,Truth There are some features I absolutely would prefer on the NVIDIA options None of them are worth so much money Like if my dream car was literally double the price to have power windows I would just suffer through the crank windows in order to save half the damn price Same thing here A 9070XT just makes more sense even if you lose some features that are really nice,mjo3thm,1.0,1jjlset

comment,mjqkwu3,corut,,0,2025-03-25 22:39:41,,,,1200 for the 9070xt isnt that much out of line from the 600USD MSRP once you convert and add GST and there are a few powercolor ones for that price,mjqi08h,4.0,1jjlset
comment,mjqzc3y,rpkarma,,2,2025-03-25 23:55:22,,,,Yes it is you know that GST is only 10 so theres a near 200AUD difference on top of and those powercolour ones are sold out or 1399 you cant buy them for that price anyway,mjqkwu3,5.0,1jjlset
comment,mjrk6nn,corut,,0,2025-03-26 01:53:35,,,,And you realise things are more expensive in general in Australia due to things like location population and consumerworkers rights yeah 150 above us MSRP is actually a low markup Also things that go out of stock arent gone forever they do actually come back into stock over time,mjqzc3y,6.0,1jjlset

comment,mjq8npx,corut,,6,2025-03-25 21:36:00,,,,9070xt actually does well in ray tracing and FRS 4 is on par with dlss 3 now And a least the 9070 series has 16gb of RAM Paying 5070 prices for 12gb is insane,mjoeotn,2.0,1jjlset
comment,mjtlyru,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-03-26 12:27:59,,,,Benchmarks prove what I said go watch some videos When ray tracing or upscaling is involved the 9070XT has lower framerates than a 5070 in the vast majority of games And DLSS3 was last gen and is wildly inferior to DLSS4 so thats far from the high praise youre presenting it as,mjq8npx,3.0,1jjlset
