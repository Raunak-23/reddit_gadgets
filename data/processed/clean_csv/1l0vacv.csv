comment,mvh9yy2,ScientiaProtestas,,30,2025-06-01 20:55:51,,,,There are many users that are very happy with windows for arm over on rsurface Not all of my usage is through a browser so I got a Surface Laptop with Intel And many apps do have Arm versions So this might be a good deal for some,,0.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvjrhee,BenjiSBRK,,4,2025-06-02 06:56:01,,,,My current laptop is a Surface Laptop Go 2 which is a bit underpowered but my usage is mostly Chrome and a few other things Ive been on the lookout for a replacement but there are no alternatives with this form factor and build quality The 13 Surface Laptop might finally be it,mvh9yy2,1.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvjuiyo,ScientiaProtestas,,2,2025-06-02 07:26:13,,,,rsurface is a good place to post any questions you might have Most things will run under emulation if there isnt native support Battery life of the previous arm model was great I am sure people will post reviews on there You could also check out last years Surface Laptop 7 SnapDragon which starts at 999 and you can find it on sale,mvjrhee,2.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvi8oqa,IBJON,,7,2025-06-02 00:13:22,,,,I have a surface pro with a Snapdragon chip It can do literally everything my Intel laptop can do so Im not sure what you mean in regards to not doing everything through a browser The apps that dont have a dedicated ARM build can usually be emulated and Windows will do that automatically The only app I havent been able to run is software for my Camera and thats a Sony issue,mvh9yy2,1.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvirewy,ScientiaProtestas,,17,2025-06-02 02:11:00,,,,Gaming is better on the Intel version I do coding so things work better if I stick with Intel Last I checked Ableton wasnt working,mvi8oqa,2.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvirm51,IBJON,,0,2025-06-02 02:12:18,,,,Im a developer as well and Ive had no issues Im not gaming on a surface tablet though and Im sure that goes for most people,mvirewy,3.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvjhbpb,ScientiaProtestas,,4,2025-06-02 05:22:21,,,,I am glad you like yours As I said many are happy with them,mvirm51,4.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvnd4b3,sosthaboss,,4,2025-06-02 20:08:46,,,,Its great that it works for you but boldly pronouncing it can do literally everything intel can do is just wrong Lots of people use apps that cant easily be emulatedported even if you dont FWIW I had an old arm surface 2 tablet back in the day so Ive run into this personally Im sure its better now though,mvirm51,4.0,1l0vacv
comment,mvnhf3p,IBJON,,-1,2025-06-02 20:29:04,,,,Its great that it works for you but boldly pronouncing it can do literally everything intel can do If youre going to quote me get the quote right because I didnt say it can do everything Intel can do I said it can do everything my Intel laptop can do meaning everything I do on my laptop which is quite a bit as Im a software engineer and a grad student can be done on my Surface Pro Yes there are issues with compatibility and emulation which I acknowledged but I was also clearly speaking anecdotally,mvnd4b3,5.0,1l0vacv

comment,mvmzamf,TheReverend5,,2,2025-06-02 19:02:01,,,,Its not surprising if youve been paying attention since the M chips were released Apple Laptops have been among the best options in their price segments since the M1 laptops Depending on when in the lifecycle you were comparing sometimes there was no other remotely comparable competition in terms of mobile computing for the money,mvi11nh,3.0,1l0vacv
