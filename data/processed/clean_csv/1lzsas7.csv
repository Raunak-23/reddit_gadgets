comment,n35fz3u,th0rn-,,41,2025-07-14 21:31:31,,,,I once worked for a company that used a tape backup solution that used a proprietary compression algorithm that supposedly caused less wear and tear on the tapes making them last longer if they were reused The tapes actually seemed to be fine after an extended period but the tape backup device failed after 12 months The manufacturer had also gone out of business and we couldnt source any replacement tape drives to read the backup data The tapes were fine though,,0.0,1lzsas7
