comment,mu4c0cb,astro_plane,,17,2025-05-25 04:12:08,,,,Theyre getting so hot we need small little fans on them Their form factor makes them terrible for heat transfer,mu20j2b,1.0,1kuirn8

comment,mu27qji,asian_monkey_welder,,6,2025-05-24 20:01:20,,,,For SFF its nice for anything bigger can we get SATA lanes into PCIe speeds Would be nice to not have just m2s be fast,mu20j2b,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu28xud,PhantomGaming27249,,14,2025-05-24 20:08:20,,,,It exists its called u2 but outside of data centers its basically dead,mu27qji,2.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu2vbzx,djk29a_,,7,2025-05-24 22:18:49,,,,More recently that would be u3 but its kind of a decrepit set of standards given the market for SSDs outside consumers has bifurcated into low margin low volume smaller scale colos and high margin high volume customized SSDs for hyperscalers,mu28xud,3.0,1kuirn8

comment,mu2l1kx,linduin,,32,2025-05-24 21:16:56,,,,While peak sequential speed is important for some workloads I would much rather see an increase of random readwrite speeds I feel like there hasnt been any major leaps in random workloads for awhile,,0.0,1kuirn8
comment,mub0mds,certifiedintelligent,,3,2025-05-26 07:24:40,,,,This is why I have no desire to upgrade from my PCIe3 Optane drives,mu2l1kx,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mudsutb,Bluecolty,,3,2025-05-26 18:20:51,,,,I do wonder if this is in part due to big marketing numbers I cant imagine thats the case but I really wouldnt be surprised Big sequential numbers can be put on the side of a box 30 GIGABYTES A SECOND LOOK AT OUR PRODUCT ITS SO FAST Random read and write improvements would be such a blessing,mu2l1kx,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu4zho8,unematti,,4,2025-05-25 07:51:04,,,,That is exactly why Im considering Gen 5 SSDs in my future Gen 4 capable machine Gen 5 random reads dont reach Gen 4 max speed even but they are much faster than random Gen 4,mu2l1kx,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu2dwsh,ioncloud9,,3,2025-05-24 20:36:32,,,,Thats going to use up too many pcie lanes,,0.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu3w9qm,dertechie,,6,2025-05-25 02:16:16,,,,Its Gen6 x4 lanes same number of lanes as current NVMe drives,mu2dwsh,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu4b5cz,firedrakes,,1,2025-05-25 04:05:16,,,,Still uses to many lanes,mu3w9qm,2.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu32wpz,DirectlyTalkingToYou,,3,2025-05-24 23:06:21,,,,Gonna need new MOBOs with 240v 40A power supplies simple,mu2dwsh,1.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu9m6um,CosmicCreeperz,,3,2025-05-26 01:04:06,,,,Youre in luck the stupid PC stats race has now moved into PSUs with several companies announcing 3000W at Computex Not quite 240v required yet but it will require its own 120v 30A circuit,mu32wpz,2.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu9moef,DirectlyTalkingToYou,,1,2025-05-26 01:07:12,,,,lol wow So youd need a 30A breaker rated at 100 duty or a regular 40A breaker rated at 80 to pass code This thing would have to be hardwired or need a twistlock plug lol,mu9m6um,3.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu9oqgi,CosmicCreeperz,,3,2025-05-26 01:20:00,,,,Holy hell I just looked up the Seasonic 3200W it can do 267A on the 12v rail 94 efficiency hah damn well better be efficient Might be able to start a car with that I actually think it might just require 240v since most 120v single outlets in the US are only rated to 1800W Since the intended use is to power 4 high end GPUs this is basically an AI platform,mu9moef,4.0,1kuirn8
comment,mubmzuc,DirectlyTalkingToYou,,2,2025-05-26 11:02:50,,,,I think youre right Its more cost effective to run 122 20A wire to your PC and do a 240v 20A 620R outlet and have 3840W to play with instead of doing some big huge install on a 120v 30A or 50A outlet MOST likely people will just run two extension cords from two different outlets on different breakers in there home and rig up some extension cord Y Splitter to get 240v into the new power supply OR run a big fat 103 or 83 extension cord from their stove or dryer lol,mu9oqgi,5.0,1kuirn8
comment,mucxpty,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-05-26 15:46:07,,,,Well most likely this will be in an office server room Id say data center but no data center install is going to use Seasonic or Asus parts Really most likely this is a gimmick for bragging rights I just dont see anyone wanting to install 12000 of 5090s in a system at home with a retail consumer power supply just to trainrun AI models,mubmzuc,6.0,1kuirn8

comment,mua0crx,WannaBMonkey,,2,2025-05-26 02:34:05,,,,I want to use ssds for backups I want the equivalent of a 5400rpm spinning disk I want a massive ssd with 200mbs speeds that can write that all day Where is my stack of whatever the cheapest bin of chips is put on a massive pcb version of a ssd,mu2mhbp,1.0,1kuirn8

comment,mu4dnk7,astro_plane,,1,2025-05-25 04:25:39,,,,These speeds are mind blowing I bet boot times would be almost instant and direct drive speeds would load that much faster I bet Doom Dark Ages would have zero loading times with those speeds and that game already has insanely fast loading I can also see it being useful for page files in certain scenarios and maybe LLMs so they dont have to be loaded into RAM I dont really know shit about LLMs though so maybe someone whos smart could clue me in,,0.0,1kuirn8
comment,mu9ncxd,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-05-26 01:11:20,,,,Problem at this point is it will end up being memoryCPUetc bandwidth limited and even worse it will go WAY beyond the capabilities of Windows file system drivers etc Its going to be insanely expensive and require equally expensive hardware and tuned OS drivers probably with an OS like Linux with options for high performance file systems etc to keep up with it Even PCIe Gen5 SSDs are minimally better on Windows PCs in practical applications It could be interesting for some LLM models especially those that may do reasoning on different models or group of experts etc that may load more than one Probably wont benefit single large models as they need to be in high speed video RAM and wouldnt be paged on demand it would need to load parameters in etc,mu4dnk7,1.0,1kuirn8
