comment,mjtq821,CruisinJo214,,223,2025-03-26 12:54:57,,,,All in one machines sound amazing but usually they do all the tasks decently enough but not as well as a dedicated machine Has Bambu managed to overcome that No idea its probably out of my price range,,0.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjus1s5,BizzyM,,76,2025-03-26 16:13:20,,,,FTFA Bambu actually sent me a whole new printer after the first one failed tests that cheaper 3D printers easily passed my second printer is doing far better but Im still getting better quality out of my old P1P Plus the H2Ds dualnozzle feature isnt working reliably for me I did finish Bambus bicycle helmet after a nearly threeday print but I wont be able to wear it given all the unsightly bits of carbonfiber laced PETG sticking out and the conspicuous gaps in its TPU padding,mjtq821,1.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjufycp,SHADOWSTRIKE1,,39,2025-03-26 15:13:29,,,,Yeah thats exactly my thought This probably does each thing ok and at a price point where you could get one machine that does a certain one of those things much better While I understand there is some shared technology regarding axial positioning of printing and laser heads these tasks sound like theyd be best served by specialty devices A Dremel doesnt cover the workload of a drill press despite both being based on a circular rotating motor,mjtq821,1.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjv8xr6,techieman33,,24,2025-03-26 17:33:49,,,,The consensus seems to be that the cutter and pen could be nice additions for occasional use But the laser should be avoided unless space is the absolute priority Lasers are messy and they stink It will quickly make the inside of the printer filthy which will have to be cleaned to keep the 3D printing part of it working like it should And it looks like its a fairly extensive process Most people will be much better off buying a separate laser unit from a place like Xtool for similar money as Bambus add on,mjtq821,1.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjuqa38,VitaminPb,,10,2025-03-26 16:04:37,,,,I skimmed most of the review The laser cutting is an additional attachment you have to add AND CALIBRATE when you want to use it It isnt an allinon Its a reconfiguration of the machine not an integrated part,mjtq821,1.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjwm8l3,Shoelebubba,,4,2025-03-26 21:27:21,,,,The laser part makes no sense to me Typically you dont want the inside of an enclosed 3D printer to get dusty from anything and some filament types will accumulate dust over time But laser cutters are basically dust makers alongside making everything smell like a laser cut them Even in their wiki theres a picture of a used H2D thats already laced with dust from the laser cutting process The cutter and marker seem neat like you could find a use case for it since it only takes an extra attachment and an extra plate,mjtq821,1.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjui5i0,C6500,,60,2025-03-26 15:24:36,,,,Their current printers and all other consumer 3D printers allow you a free choice of software and protocols such as better Slicers The whole 3d printing ecosystem is very open source focused and driven Bambu decided to lock down access to their printers with a firmware update and force the use of a shitty middleware to send gcode etc to the printer Thats the very short version Their hardware is good but noone in their right mind should ever buy one again,mju8vl7,2.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjwagpu,None,,0,2025-03-26 20:33:52,,,,Thats a terrible take when its for a child The kid aint going to have the know how to figure out the settings to get a decent print like a Bambu will do out of the box He isnt going to need the gcode and he doesnt care what apps he has to use to print with the printer Not everyone needs a prusa,mjvwldg,6.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjwi387,tastyratz,,1,2025-03-26 21:08:06,,,,You are gonna get GREAT prints out of the box from a Creality K1K2 or a Qidi plus4max3 at a fraction of the cost and will have multi material printing out of both this year An A1 mini is a great intro to 3d printing with a small printer Id agree with that Bambu isnt the only reliable printer anymore however,mjwagpu,7.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjwstx3,None,,0,2025-03-26 22:01:10,,,,Thats literally my point He can just buy him an A1 mini for a fraction of the price of any of the printers you mentioned And the A1 outlines anything in a comparable price point out of the box Not to mention I said prusa is not great for kids compared to an A1,mjwi387,8.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjy4o8b,tastyratz,,2,2025-03-27 02:28:22,,,,A1 is a great starter printer but Bambus current practices mean it may not remain a great printer What you get with an A1 is disposable pricing if it no longer works for you or you decide the hobby isnt for you at least you werent that invested It really depends on the kid on what makes sense for them but its natural for people to be hesitant about buying a bambu still,mjwstx3,9.0,1jka3pc
comment,mk3anbi,PotusThePlant,,0,2025-03-27 23:01:57,,,,If the kid can work with 3d models then they know how to use a screwdriver With a Prusa theyd actually learn stuff Theyd be getting an actual tool instead of a locked down toy,mjwagpu,7.0,1jka3pc

comment,mk02bna,tastyratz,,2,2025-03-27 12:37:34,,,,Everything you do with this device can burn down your house We quickly forget how many 3d printers have had thermal runaway fires because modern ones have some newer safeguards to prevent damage to your home and the equipment The competing small laser engraver devices they are trying to roll into their device do not have those same limitations Lightburn and LaserGRBL are the standards,mjzbzvq,4.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjukrmd,tastyratz,,10,2025-03-26 15:37:47,,,,How so They said if you dont want the changes dont update your firmware on existing printers They are also saying if you want to use the new ams2pro with your existing printer you have to update your firmware If you want to use any new upgrades or hardware you have to get into the new firmware that includes the new bambu suite locking you down I also wonder what firmware ships with new equipment sales at this point as well Chances are its coming with the changes For existing printers with the existing capacity the answer was we wont make you install the update if you dont want it effectively freezing you where youre at That means if you dont want to be further locked in you effectively lose all new feature updates,mjufkwg,4.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjw7n89,IMissNarwhalBacon,,1,2025-03-26 20:21:10,,,,For one companies just try again and again Once a company tries to go closed source they will keep trying until they succeed Bambu should be brought to a point of bankruptcy regardless of their policy changes They should be regarded as an example ofa bad company that was destroyed But people like you say they learned their lesson and allow them to regroup and fuck over another batch of consumers,mju8efb,2.0,1jka3pc
comment,mk00fyo,HengaHox,,1,2025-03-27 12:25:09,,,,I mean if they fixed the product I dont see a reason to avoid it The fixed firmware is out there so it cant be rebroken Of course dont be a blind consumer but if the product is exactly what you need at the right price I dont see what the point is of depriving yourself of exactly what you need If its literally the right thing for you then get it,mjw7n89,3.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjymvuk,alidan,,3,2025-03-27 04:36:05,,,,in all honesty a 3d printer is every one of those tools but with a z access as well there is no reason it shouldnt be able to do all these tasks just fine the laser cutter though will cause a mess inside so that is a questionable one and with the cost of a laser cutter almost entirely being in the laser itself its probably better just to get one of those separately,mjuc1dq,1.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjuqy4o,None,,9,2025-03-26 16:07:54,,,,Dedicated machines do not have to worry about the same level of smoothness required by a 3d printer especially in the Z direction Also the lens used to measure and verify flow are going to have to be thoroughly cleaned constantly Most 2 axis laser cutters normally need none of that Thats why all in ones typically are not a thing,mjuppty,2.0,1jka3pc

comment,mk8mu6e,deadgirlrevvy,,1,2025-03-28 19:45:00,,,,Excellent point The inside of my CNC enclosure is caked with soot and residue when I use my laser on it I hate that I have to swap out my spindle to use the laser and vice versa I am going to just make another motion platform and slap the laser head on it so that they are not a two in one device I cannot imagine dealing with the nastiness a laser leaves behind in a 3D printer enclosure Thats the stuff of nightmares frankly No Way In Hell,mju0rr4,3.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjwf4fy,Hendlton,,3,2025-03-26 20:55:02,,,,Since this is a good place as any to ask whats actually wrong with super cheap laser engravers I was looking at buying one and they seem to range from like 200 to 900 and they all appear to have the exact same capabilities other than like WiFi control and stuff like that which I really dont care about Im assuming theres a catch so what is it PS I really dont need to cut anything Im just interested in engraving No need for engraving metal either since that seems to be something cheap engravers arent capable of,mjtye9p,2.0,1jka3pc
comment,mka5rto,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-03-29 00:40:05,,,,The diode lasers tend to be closer to 400nm and the Co2 lasers tend to be closer to 680 Acyrlic for example will cut well with a CO2 laser but 400nm will pretty much pass through You also have more high power options is CO2 lasers K40 lasers are 40watts but you dont really get cheap engravers much more than 10 or 20 For occasional engraving thats probably fine just do more passes but it makes a big difference for cutting,mjwf4fy,3.0,1jka3pc
comment,mkcx6jt,Hendlton,,2,2025-03-29 14:18:01,,,,Like I said I dont plan on cutting anything anyway From what Ive seen on YouTube weaker lasers tend to be better because they have a smaller dot which allows for more detailed engravings Do CO2 and fiber lasers have even smaller dots or do they just have the ability to cut more materials at greater speeds This isnt something Im looking to do commercially so Im not going to drop like 5000 on a laser I have a 3D printer and this is sort of the next step in my CNC adventures Unfortunately there doesnt seem to be that much info on YouTube at least nowhere near as much as for 3D printing Most videos are just Heres an engraving on some wood It did it Here it is cutting some foam Its very hard to find detailed technical specs and comparisons and like I said in my comment above its really hard to tell what the difference is between cheap and expensive diode lasers They all seem to do the exact same thing whether theyre xTool or some random Chinese brand I guess one big advantage is that when you buy from a reputable company you can trust that theyre not lying about their specs and that a 10W laser is actually 10W,mka5rto,4.0,1jka3pc
comment,mkeacn7,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-03-29 18:44:48,,,,A lot of it is quality of lifeease of use stuff The expensive ones will have stuff like a camera for positioning and endstops honeycomb air assist etc I have the elegoo phecda and Ive upgraded a bit by adding those features but its just another thing to do Getting the placement correct on pieces can be really difficult without endstopscamera for example The nicest ones have enclosures and fume extraction If youre getting a cheaper machine expect to pay another 100 for lightburn as well Its like you can 3d print the same object with an ender3 or a P1S but the P1S adds enough reliability and quality of life features to be worth the premium youll pay for it Say you wanted to engrave 200 dog tags On a cheap machine you might have to place them one by one sometimes get the positioning off figure out a ventillation situation get your own honeycomb and lightburn The glasses that came with it are cheap so you have top worry about your eyes the whole time The expensive machine is enclosed and has fume extraction and a camera that lets you take a picture of the tags and engrave them wherever they happen to be on the bed and do the whole things in one go Must faster and easier Time saved is money,mkcx6jt,5.0,1jka3pc
comment,mkehcs3,Hendlton,,1,2025-03-29 19:22:49,,,,First thank you for taking the time to respond Im definitely getting lightburn It seems to be the best software on the market From what Ive seen ventilation is very important even though Im definitely not going to be doing this kind of stuff in an enclosed space Some YT videos say that you can still smell the burnt stuff even with a filtration system Safety glasses are another important thing I wouldnt trust a cheap pair of gloves let alone something thats supposed to stop me from going blind I was planning on buying a tried and tested pair no matter what comes with the machine The camera positioning system seems like a big deal but I dont know if Im going to engrave 200 things total let alone 200 of the same thing Air assist seems essential so Im definitely looking at buying a machine that has it so I dont have to improvise something I have an Ender 5 so I totally get your analogy It can be fiddly a lot of the time and its relatively slow but Ive never come across something I really wanted to print but couldnt Im happy with it and if I had to buy my first 3D printer again I dont think I would go for a more expensive one The balance of cost vs practicality vs ability is just right Im looking for that kind of balance in a laser engraver,mkeacn7,6.0,1jka3pc
comment,mklr40a,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,2,2025-03-30 23:50:59,,,,FWIW as a hobbyist Ive quite liked the 20W phecda so far as my first laser I used the glowforge at the local makespace a bit as well and for messing around making boxes signs and such the phecda works great Probably no need for more than 10W if you arent cutting Most of the 5W10W machines seem to have similar construction so I think youll do pretty well with one of them,mkehcs3,7.0,1jka3pc

comment,mjtxr0s,tastyratz,,20,2025-03-26 13:39:22,,,,As a P1S owner Im going to effectively repost here with some more comments what I posted in the OpenBambu sub Honestly this thing really tells me how out of touch Bambu is and how much they are not listening to their user base it feels like a cash scramble as they slowly lose their market positioning The x1c was great at the time but priced at nearly double the P1S its really only there for legacy farm compatibility Its no longer a value leader They should put the board touchscreen and chamber sensor on the P1S with native 90w heater and sell it for 899 as a P1S turbo and retire the X1C With the addition of the chamber heater in the H2D its really displacing the X1E but those are pretty rare in the wild The H2D feels like they are SKU forcing a step up from the X1C to get that profit spread but it really does not bring enough to the table for the pricing Now we have the Prusa one as the premium option and QIDI is really breathing down their door You expect to pay more for a Bambu sure but everyone else is launching their own multimaterial options in the next year and they look pretty good That means there is going to be a lot of competition It feels like an awkward SKU The kind of people who are tinkerers who would swap in and out a laser head here are small scale etsy sellers and home users the kind of people who are not paying nearly 2 grand for a machine like this BASE and 3500 with all the options If they wanted to be a market disruptor they needed to do this for 500 less than the base price minimum with the laser head Bambu is stuck in their own past and it will be the boat anchor that sinks them from relevance I cant imagine giving them 3500 for anything as a consumer or any space with the developer mode and firmware stunts this year They also locked this printer down for the new options laser does not work outside of their closed system youre locked in While the machine is pretty cool its WILDLY out of its target audience pricing there People are not spending 3500 for a hobbyist targeted cricut and pen plotter Granted its a cool machine and has a lot of neat small features but why would I pay triple the price of a p1s for this for idex more watts and an optional laser head If I wanted a 10w laser Creality has one for 338 I could get a P1S AMS and a laser for 13rd the price Its convenient and slick as an AIO but is it slick enough for an upcharge of thousands over the rapidly evolving competition,,0.0,1jka3pc
comment,mju4k1q,Namenloser23,,9,2025-03-26 14:15:46,,,,The laser part imo a gimmick but I dont think this printer is misplaced To me this is clearly targeting the prosumer professional niche of the Prusa XL and is a vastly superior offering in my opinion 2 Extruders are enough for most multimaterial options think support filaments or mixing materials while the MMU can cover multicolor applications The Heated Chamber filters also make it much more versatile and you get all this for 700 H2D non AMS vs XL 2 Extruder 1500 H2DAMS vs XL 4 Extruder less,mjtxr0s,1.0,1jka3pc
comment,mju9bdp,tastyratz,,5,2025-03-26 14:40:21,,,,The 2 idex in the H2D have separate feeds and the new AMS2PRO they developed for this has a single outlet That means if you want to use an AMS with both nozzles here you need to have 2 AMS units per printer They developed the new AMS to go with this and they missed that opportunity completely A lot of people are going to be very disappointed that they have to swap around what filament should be on the external spool holder based on what they are printing at the time It makes this much less convenient to point and click If you want a heated chamber the QIDI plus4 can do that for you for less than the cost of a P1S and QIDI has their own MMU launching this year Maybe a Creality K2 is more your speed Bambu has a lot of things that just work though which are great for professionals and print farm owners except they threatened the print farm control business recently making them a risky business investment for people who want more than 1 machine and this machine supports their lockout agenda by not allowing you to use your own software integrations for the new functions like laser cutting Its not just slicers its mass monitoring and control for fleet management They really struck the confidence in the farm market and this printer shows they plan to continue in the same direction so how many home users are going to spend THAT much money when they are far more willing to accept some compromises with alternative machines When the X1C launched printing was absolutely a lot more cumbersome and they brought a lot of simplicity and just works to a market full of floundering Ender clones That is no longer the case today however All these alternatives are JUST as easy to use as a Bambu and work JUST as well in most cases Bambu had a head start but they are pricing like they are bringing a lot more to the table than their competitors are which simply stopped being the case years ago,mju4k1q,2.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjupieh,Namenloser23,,1,2025-03-26 16:00:50,,,,They developed the new AMS to go with this and they missed that opportunity completely I dont think this is a big issue for their target audience Mixing Materials is the main point of having two extruders and you dont want to feed incompatible materials anyway If you want to go for the zero interaction method most people would probably be fine with having one extruder for their base material PLAABSPETG and using the second one for their modifiers support filament highshore flexibles etc If youre going for low shore flexibles you cant use the AMS anyway so how many home users are going to spend THAT much money when they are far more willing to accept some compromises with alternative machines Bambu was the brand that got the market moving away from alternatives with compromises iE the army of Ender 3 clones trying to undercut each other at the 300USD price point There are currently zero printers that dont have some downsides compared to it I share concerns about bambus path and am not in the market for a printer at that price point for the foreseeable future but I do see a ton of reasons why professionals and hobbyists that are not in the 3d printing space would choose it over its competitors I am also extremely hyped on the effect this printer could have on the market DualExtruder systems have been in an extreme niche basically since their existence and bambus entry into the space will almost certainly inspire other manufacturers to compete in that market,mju9bdp,3.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjuwgvr,tastyratz,,1,2025-03-26 16:34:47,,,,I dont think this is a big issue for their target audience It really depends if you want to just have support material and TPU and call it good sure You probably want a drybox to feed from in that case instead of the external spool otherwise youre constantly putting it in the ams2 to dry back out Its also no good for engineering filaments Think about what this means for actually using the idex though Lets say you want to print a red and black nylon part You could not have red and black nylon in the AMS for no purge idex print You would have to remove the second color from the AMS and manually feed it That means every single 2 or more color print not just suppporttpu requires you go play filament musical chairs How often are you going to do that when you are doing this professionally to prototype when you can just tell it to use the AMS and disregard the waste so you can print and walk away I think the idex really loses its appeal because its a touch point on every print and people are VERY spoiled by their AMS Bambu was the brand that got the market moving away from alternatives with compromises iE the army of Ender 3 clones trying to undercut each other at the 300USD price point There are currently zero printers that dont have some downsides compared to it I think thats their pedigree but also their heel They normalized a lot of things that then became baseline which reduced quite a bit of challenges but that means they were pioneers who led not are leading pioneers at the front of the quadrant Its almost like making a new graphics card where there have been so many leap frogs over the years Bambu raised the bar for everyone including their competition They dont have that advantage for this printer I am also extremely hyped on the effect this printer could have on the market DualExtruder systems have been in an extreme niche basically since their existence and bambus entry into the space will almost certainly inspire other manufacturers to compete in that market Ill agree with that I think Bambu really pioneered and normalized multimaterial with the AMS and inspired all the AMS clones hitting the market today This machine COULD result in a resurgence in idex options hitting the market the IDEX however could just be the natural evolution to multi material printing becoming almost standard in the market It might also just be what would have been borne of it either way A lot of exciting printers and printing products are launching this year I think the H2D is going to age out to low volume rapidly,mjupieh,4.0,1jka3pc
comment,mjvc3ao,Namenloser23,,1,2025-03-26 17:48:37,,,,How often are you going to do that when you are doing this professionally to prototype when you can just tell it to use the AMS and disregard the waste so you can print and walk away Thats pretty much what I expect people will do in that scenario People probably wont care about filament waste in that environment The cost is negligible and the users arent paying for it anyway If you simply want multicolor get a single extruder printer its realistically gonna cheaper anyway Bambu raised the bar for everyone including their competition They dont have that advantage for this printer This isnt the absolute leap frog that the X1C was at the time but it still raises the bar only that this time its direct competitors are professional prosumer printers like the S8 and XL and it is positioned very competitively here It was probably always going to be a much more niche product than their existing lineup I do agree with one of your earlier points that the X1C is starting to show its age and suspect bambu might start transitioning its lineup to printers based on the H2Ds tech If I were them Id start by making an X2C that has all the H2D features minus the Dual Extruder chamber heating automatic vents filtration nozzle cam servomotors and then cut that down into a p2 series,mjuwgvr,5.0,1jka3pc

comment,mju5ufh,tastyratz,,3,2025-03-26 14:22:26,,,,Exactly Bambu is trying to get a premium for their ecosystem as the apple of the printer world Its worth some markup and they did make a premium product here but its a 3500 printer package targeting a 1750 budget consumer audience People spending 3500 are far more serious about making money with it and this is a shopsmith hobby machine in a small business price bracket If someone wants to spend THAT much money they are getting a dedicated Co2 or going straight to fiber laser,mju1rj2,2.0,1jka3pc
