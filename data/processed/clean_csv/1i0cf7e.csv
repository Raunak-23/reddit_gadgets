comment,m6y4f9p,swiftcrane,,10,2025-01-13 17:08:36,,,,Preferably the CPU would always use as much power as it has cooling available to it My guesses 1 Being able to safely assess how much cooling it has and adjust the limit safely becomes too risky for ranges that are outside normal operation Essentially why risk letting the CPU ever go that high if it malfunctions if almost nobody will do this 2 Even if it has that much cooling its not clear what its lifespan is in this configuration so possibly it falls outside of the safe operating specs regardless of cooling,m6xmbtu,5.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m72lcuc,Ratiofarming,,1,2025-01-14 09:09:46,,,,It definitely wasnt Current and power consumption go down with temperature because the resistance drops with it Also for frequency records you dont really load the CPU You just set the clock speed and verfiy it Nothing more This CPU may well have been well under 100 watts for that if not below 50,m6x8zq0,3.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m78e33u,Ajsat3801,,1,2025-01-15 06:14:16,,,,Say you are reading the output of a sequence of 10 logic gates and that would take time x But if your clock frequency is too high say x2 then youll read the data at time x2 when your data is not ready so youll be reading some garbage value So to read the correct value your clock has to be slowed down so that you read it at time x to get your desired output They have a pretty high emphasis on slack during my VLSI class but idk how it translates to in IRL in terms of overclock,m752o0v,4.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6xrcgw,h4terade,,18,2025-01-13 16:04:10,,,,Others have stated the physical limitations of chips but another reason I believe is that because you get more return these days by increasing the number of cores and available threads Instead of dealing with all the trouble of thermal properties and voltage increases just squeeze more cores on it and get better performance,m6wywpg,1.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6yc0dg,The_JSQuareD,,22,2025-01-13 17:45:16,,,,I remember it feeling like 4 GHz was a hard limit The 14900KS has a stock max turbo boost of 62 GHz well over a supposed 5 GHz limit In fact max core frequencies have been rising steadily Though perhaps not as quickly as they did in the pentium days Blame physics for that were hitting physical limitations Though even if frequency doesnt go up much IPC instructions per cycle number of coresthreads and efficiency are still going up pretty quickly Max boost frequencies for some recent Intel cpu generations 7th gen 45 GHz 8th gen 47 GHz 9th gen 50 GHz 10th gen 53 GHz 11th gen 52 GHz 12th gen 53 GHz 13th gen 60 GHz 14th gen 62 GHz Though the latest 200 series CPUs are a step down in max frequencies again with the 285k having a max boost frequency of 57 GHz Over on the red team the latest CPUs also have a max boost clock of 57 GHz Thats up from 41 GHz for Zen 1 which was released around the same time as Intel 7th Gen,m6wywpg,1.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6ysoje,The_JSQuareD,,6,2025-01-13 19:05:28,,,,An Intel Pcore is only something like 4mm x 2mm so I dont think distance is really the issue Also strictly speaking that would only limit latency not frequency That being said electrical signal propagation in silicon is slower than the speed of light in vacuum I believe the main issue is just heat dissipation,m6yki4a,3.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m70524k,Raider480,,2,2025-01-13 23:04:13,,,,I remember it feeling like 4 GHz was a hard limit Sure especially ca Westmere OP has a bit of a point though I mean I ran a 2500k at 5GHz for what feels like an eternity Even 10 generations on Intel only hit 5255GHz on the top i9 chips in 12th gen Seeing as 13th14th gen are clearly past the point of rapid degradation though I personally wouldnt really count those,m6yc0dg,2.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m7081ga,The_JSQuareD,,2,2025-01-13 23:20:27,,,,Max boost on the 2500k stock was only 37 GHz though So if you were running it at 5 GHz that was a significant overclock Comparing that to the stock frequencies of later generations doesnt seem entirely fair,m70524k,3.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6zsy1p,cat_prophecy,,1,2025-01-13 22:01:23,,,,I remember it feeling like 1ghz was the hard limit The first Athlon processors were capable of doing it when you used liquid nitrogen cooling,m6yc0dg,2.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6zsphb,thrthrthr322,,3,2025-01-13 22:00:12,,,,One limiting factor is related to Dennard Scaling Sort of simple explanation for a long time as we shrunk transistors the power density of the chip stayed the same This basically means you crammed a bunch more transistors from one generation to the next but the chips used the same amount of power and generated the same amount of heat Power density stayed the same because many circuit parameters related to the smaller transistor would go down like capacitance voltage which in turn allowed frequency increase holding power constant Higher capacitance voltage and frequency all increase power But eventually when the transistors got small enough around 1020ish years ago other transistor factors that used to not affect things mattered a lot more at these now very small sizes These smaller transistors experience proportionally more leakage current and the threshold voltage cant continue to decrease by as much More powerheat generated in the same area means much harder to increase frequency which would further increase powerheat This isnt the only reason but an important one that has made much higher frequencies quite difficult,m6wywpg,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6yitdb,Turmfalke_,,1,2025-01-13 18:17:55,,,,A higher frequency doesnt necessarily mean more instructions executed Obviously when overlocking compared to the same hardware it does but modern cpus just do more during a single tact,m6wywpg,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6ztptf,censored_username,,1,2025-01-13 22:05:16,,,,Theres a couple of things going on First of all we could run chips at a higher frequency but this would dramatically increase chip power draw It scales roughly like this P C f V2 Where C is the total capacitance being switched scales roughly with the amount of gates f is the frequency and V the voltage the chip is running on To run at a higher frequency the voltage will need to be increased This increase is roughly linear so we can also state P C f3 Meanwhile the actual amount of work the processor can do scales only linearly with the frequency it is running on Which leads to the conclusion that the efficiency amount of work done divided by power draw scales with 1f2 Therefore power efficiency plummets if we just keep driving up the voltage This results in chips that cannot reasonably be cooled or would damage themselves over time In the past we managed to avoid this bottleneck by minimizing the C term in the equation By shrinking transistors smaller and smaller and putting them closer and closer together we were able to minimize the total capacitance that needed to be switched This allowed us to run up the frequency while keeping the voltage needed mostly constant Unfortunately as you go smaller and smaller other effects start to dominate Eventually parasitic capacitances and wire selfinductance become a problem and you cannot shrink any further This is the barrier that stopped the increases in frequency While modern lithography is getting more and more accurate we cannot shrink transistors much further in physical size The meagre gains since then have been because weve been switching to altering their geometry which allows them to work with less of a voltage difference,m6wywpg,1.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6wz1ta,Psykotyrant,,11,2025-01-13 13:20:32,,,,But can it run Crysis,,0.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6xcy38,thechildishweekend,,24,2025-01-13 14:47:34,,,,I thought this was pretty funny I know its an overdone meme but it works in this context because Crytek anticipated CPUs moving towards higher clock ratios instead of what we got which is just more threads with higher IPC Pretty sure they made their engine specifically with the assumption that wed be running 10GHz CPUs in the nearish future,m6wz1ta,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6yc7fd,The_JSQuareD,,3,2025-01-13 17:46:13,,,,Can it run Crysis purely on the CPU with software based rendering,m6wz1ta,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6xlm35,LeCrushinator,,2,2025-01-13 15:34:54,,,,Just fast enough to match AMD performance,,0.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6yo80x,oandakid718,,3,2025-01-13 18:43:52,,,,I dont wanna be that guy but as someone who upgraded to a 9800x3d after being team intel for nearly 20 years a lot of random issues that I was having were magically fixed Im talking about fan curves working properly for once random ingame stutters fixing themselves nvidia surround setup working etc Crazy work,m6xlm35,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6zwl3g,bonesnaps,,3,2025-01-13 22:19:51,,,,Id be that guy but 9800X3D stock in Canada is shockingly bad,m6yo80x,2.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m72hzyp,gyph256,,2,2025-01-14 08:32:39,,,,The random stutters on Nvidia cards is caused by running any software that reads the power output of the GPU,m6yo80x,2.0,1i0cf7e

comment,m6z8c7z,idebugthusiexist,,0,2025-01-13 20:21:26,,,,Ok but what really is the practical use in doing this,,0.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m6zxp4e,iamcts,,1,2025-01-13 22:25:32,,,,There isnt one except for bragging rights Extreme overclocking is just there to see the theoretical maximum of a chip and the silicon lottery,m6z8c7z,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m724nha,GustavSnapper,,1,2025-01-14 06:18:34,,,,Its exactly the same practicality as running a 4s quarter mile time It does literally nothing for you other than give a big fat dopamine hit Surprisingly people have all kinds of hobbies they do for just the enjoyment of the hobby,m6z8c7z,1.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m726esy,idebugthusiexist,,1,2025-01-14 06:34:53,,,,Oh okay so no benchmarks or anything Just bragging This seems not very newsworthy or scientific,m724nha,2.0,1i0cf7e
comment,m726wue,GustavSnapper,,0,2025-01-14 06:39:37,,,,I mean Im sure they run benchmarks and are probably very fast but these guys arent about chasing benchmark scores some are they just want to set insane frequencies Not everything needs to have a higher meaning Just take it on face value Its a most impressive OC frequency for a gaming CPU nothing more nothing less,m726esy,3.0,1i0cf7e
