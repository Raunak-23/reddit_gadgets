comment,mn4ul4h,alidan,,-1,2025-04-14 21:52:39,,,,Personally I have monitor failure with the backlight mine has around 6070 dimming zones and any number of them dimturn off after 20 or so minutes of turning it on still useable but very noticeable I am having a hard time justifying a like for like side grade 800 over just getting a big screen beyond 2 this is one of those things people who havent tried using vr as a display or even modern vr in generally cant wrap their heads around they are VERY capable of replacing monitors in the case of bsb it would hit around 100150 nits at max with a normal limit of 70 nits and reviewers who didnt know ahead of time had no idea it wasnt hdr for me to get the same class of monitor as that costs around 15003000 and because it would be static instead of constantly shifting pixels like with a hmd and you shifting your body slightly all the time burn in will happen regardless of what you get but it would take a hell of alot longer with a dimfar less heat producing oled in a light controlled environment now keep i mind if apple vision can math the quality of their reference monitor at least image quality wise they can produce it for cheaper sell it cheaper and expand the ecosystems and this is the major thing people dont understand because of current vr reporting the first company that gets mass adoption will add several trillion to their market cap people with any amount of future vision see it for what it is they just cant predict when facebook is trying as hard as possible to brute force it I would argue bsb is already there but the buy in cost is a hard swallow for someone who is new I honestly believe the thing that would sell people on vr more than anything else would be a 2 person demo one person is across the store and you are seated on a ok couch in an otherwise crappy apartment put the vr on and you have 3 modes full pass through well furnished apartment and theater mode and your friend is right next to you watch the same show movie or hell just play a game with each other that would be what sells it for normal people to make it their everyday life thing think of it this way at 13 or less the cost of a high end tv you can get better than a high end tv and thats just current pricing realistically we will hit a point where optics are at their peak and you cant really get better we are already kind of there where people with access to pimax 8k and bsb2 choose bsb2 over pimax even though pimax is objectively better on all other specs because how good the optics are in bsb2 at that point the panels are just a module see pimax as an example of that where the upgrade comes from a new module and at that point you are talking about 2 1 inch displays you may not know this but most of the cost for a display is all in the fact you can only get so many of them off one sheet of motherglass you would get around 1300 displays or 650 sets of vr displays in a sings 800 55 inch motherglass space if we hit the point that vr is everywhere the prices for certain aspects for them will become a 1 time cost and then crashing for everything else to become a commodity,mn1u9gz,2.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn1w824,hopskipjumprun,,109,2025-04-14 12:41:18,,,,If Gurmans new reporting is accurate it sounds like Tim Cook will stop at nothing to ensure that Apple not Meta will deliver the new iPhone moment that the introduction of appealing true AR glasses could be Can this tech really have an iPhone moment that gets the masses on board I can see some companies adopting it but what can it deliver to the average person in a more convenient form than they already have devices for Genuinely curious about it because reviews of the first Vision Pro seemed neat but leaned closer to novelty rather than something I could see myself using long term,,0.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2oojw,Useful44723,,3,2025-04-14 15:20:11,,,,For some that probably can be cool for sure But that price is a thing of its own Even if it had even more features I would not buy it I know that I would drop it and the warranty would cover my 2000 repair bill It has happened before with other stuff,mn2kc65,5.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn3rg8d,Trixles,,7,2025-04-14 18:31:39,,,,Anything beyond 1000 is pretty much a nostarter for most Americans And couple that with the fact that it doesnt really do anything you cant already accomplish for much cheaper Pretty much dead in the water until they can get it 1000,mn2oojw,6.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn93am7,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-04-15 15:55:31,,,,Apple has had internal versions of that for a decade But they decided not to productize it as its not a good mass market strategy compared to their ultimate goal of an iPhone being that puck At this point its mostly a power problem Thats what the XR glasses I mentioned do you can plug it into your phone Their issue is that they are so lightweight and low power because they use a microOLED projected via waveguide so the FOV isnt great 4550 degrees and its not capable of true ARVR due to lack of good 6DoF tracking I fully expect the solution in 15 years or so is a lightweight sunglassesstyle HMD connected to a phone There are just a bunch of basic technical problems to solve first with power wireless video bandwidth FOV etc Orion is a cool demo but a 70 degree FOV and 2 hour battery life at 720x540 res is a LONG way off from a successful product,mn7s1qe,5.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2fq07,Kindness_of_cats,,20,2025-04-14 14:34:15,,,,People have been trying to find mass market use cases for VR for a very very long time I honestly dont see it coming VR just generally is one of those things that sounds amazing until you realize that your phone or tablet or laptop is more practical to use Even gaming which is by far its most mainstream use has struggled to get all that big in the scheme of things I also honestly think its more than just needing a killer app The technology itself has a lot of baked in inherent problems for average consumers Its always going to be isolating and require everyone have a headset on to share experiences its always going to have battery issues its always going to cause people to feel like the person wearing it is isolated from everyone around them its always going to mess with your appearance its always going to be less convenient to carry with you than a phone or a laptoptablet its always going to have input limitations These are things which cant simply be iterated away because theyre fundamental to how the technology works They can be improved but not removed Pass through can help the person wearing it feel less isolated but it wont change the fact that people around them will want to see their actual eyes and know they have their attention when interacting Making them lighter and smaller can help with comfort and travel convenience but battery packs will still have to be a thing and anything shaped like goggles or glasses will be harder to fit into a bag or your pocket than a laptop or phone By the time you solve enough of these problems sufficiently to go mainstream and basically come out with smart glasses you have a a very different product that will be severely compromised in many of the things VR headsets try to accomplish Im convinced VR is just a stepping stone to AR for mainstream consumers and that it will remain a fairly niche technology And even then I think they may well struggle to gain mass adoption People absolutely loathe wearing anything on their face many will prefer sticking plastic lenses in their eyes over wearing glasses to be able to fucking see Itll have to offer a lot for consumers to get over that inherent problem,mn1wxpq,2.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn51svm,None,,3,2025-04-14 22:33:54,,,,Innovation needs 2 of 3 things to take mainstream hold It needs to be better in every way to the alternatives It needs to have an easy learning curve It needs to seamlessly fit in with how we interact with the world I think VR is being oversold by futurists and people who have seen one too many scifi movies Talk to any normal person who has tried the tech its interesting but in a world where people are using multiple screens at once doing that while wearing a headset seems incredibly unnecessary Just feels like people constantly trying to put a square peg in a round hole because the square peg is new and different,mn2fq07,3.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn59uc8,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-04-14 23:20:37,,,,Talk to any normal person who has tried the tech its interesting but in a world where people are using multiple screens at once doing that while wearing a headset seems incredibly unnecessary Thats just one usecase though The main appeal of VR is its ability to induce a sense of presence which has a lot of applications in areas like education entertainment fitness health and social,mn51svm,4.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn5g5t9,None,,2,2025-04-14 23:57:00,,,,But those usecases are so incredibly specific that they dont create enough demand for total adoption Most people dont need one and arent going to spend insane money for the one feature that looks interesting to them VR will always be a novelty device because it does certain things really well but it doesnt fix a problem we all have and it doesnt directly tie into our way of living Low profile AR has a better shot of being useful and fitting in but still the battery break through needs to happen for it to really have a chance and no one is going to be wearing full Vision Pro headsets all day everyday Will never happen,mn59uc8,5.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn5h2dl,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-04-15 00:02:19,,,,VR fixes a constant need people have travel More specifically it lets people go to places events and most importantly other people in a realistic and convincing way without the resources time and money needed for physical travel Most people can attest to the many places and people in life that they cant physically reach on a frequent basis VR therefore has huge usecases as a standin for this,mn5g5t9,6.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn2icp0,DarthBuzzard,,0,2025-04-14 14:47:55,,,,Its always going to be isolating and require everyone have a headset on to share experiences its always going to have battery issues its always going to cause people to feel like the person wearing it is isolated from everyone around them its always going to mess with your appearance its always going to be less convenient to carry with you than a phone or a laptoptablet its always going to have input limitations Arent you just basing this off current technology without thinking about how it will evolve Isolation isnt even necessarily a barrier to mass adoption considering headphones cant be shared and are used by a billion users worldwide Battery life could be solved with unforeseen breakthroughs in battery technology Future improvements to Vision Pros EyeSight display can enable people to feel like the user is not isolated from them Messing with appearance perhaps with regards to eye makeup but messing with the hair will be solved as they slim down There isnt much need to carry them with you like a phone they are meant to be stationary devices Input limitations exist for phones too They are very slow and bad at productivity and multitasking VRAR combined with future EMG advancements has the potential to leapfrog all other forms of input in speed multitasking efficiency,mn2fq07,3.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn3ig6w,Kindness_of_cats,,2,2025-04-14 17:47:38,,,,Arent you just basing this off current technology without thinking about how it will evolve Not in any realistic way no thats kind of my point To go line by line Isolation isnt even necessarily a barrier to mass adoption considering headphones cant be shared and are used by a billion users worldwide The key difference is that you can easily just change audio sources to output sound through your speakers when you want to share music or video That is definitionally impossible with VR experiences you either need to be wearing a headset yourself or hand your headset to someone else You cant iterate out of that problem its baked into the technology Battery life could be solved with unforeseen breakthroughs in battery technology We are getting breakthroughs in battery technology all the time and they are used to power devices that demand more power than ever Battery iteration isnt isolated from all other product iteration A breakthrough that is so large it makes sticking longlasting batteries into something as necessarily powerhungry and lightweight as a headset is just shy of cold fusion territory Its possible but either so far away or so speculative that its not really worth talking about Youre going to be dealing with a short battery life andor the need for wirespacks for the foreseeable future Future improvements to Vision Pros EyeSight display can enable people to feel like the user is not isolated from them Youre dealing with deeply ingrained issues of instinct and cultural norms People want to see your eyes not representations of them and to know that they have your undivided attention This is not going to change anytime soon and better feeds of your eyeballs projected onto a screen wont really fix that Youre going to need to be taking them off whenever you interact with people unless you want to get the same reaction that you would when chatting while staring at your phone or computer screen Which is a pain in the fucking ass for something strapped to your head Speaking of Messing with appearance perhaps with regards to eye makeup but messing with the hair will be solved as they slim down Eye makeup yes but also foundation smudging off is going to be an issue after a while of use Youre probably going to develop a ring around where the goggles rest Hair is the biggie though and its not going to be solved by slimming down anything due to the need for a strap going around you head A lot of hairstyles will simply be a nonstarter for use with headsets since it will just squish them down and any time you have to put a strap around your head its going to mess up your hair getting it off Theres no iterating yourself out of that issue its a matter of physics There isnt much need to carry them with you like a phone they are meant to be stationary devices Are they though Because certainly thats not how Apple has tried to sell their headset Use when traveling especially has been a major part of their pitch Input limitations exist for phones too They are very slow and bad at productivity and multitasking Limitations sure but I just fundamentally do not agree that its remotely comparable Its been clear since Blackberry fucking imploded in the late 2000s that digital keyboards arent actually a real problem for most consumers and large chunks of people at this point literally prefer to do as much of their computing on their phonestablets Meanwhile headsets just do not have any workable method of input other than physical accessories or the holographic garbage that Apple tried to make work on the first Vision Pro VRAR combined with future EMG advancements has the potential to leapfrog all other forms of input in speed multitasking efficiency Im sorry but if youre expecting me to take EMG advancements seriously as a possible solution to this then were back in cold fusion territory It further solidifies my impression that people who think VR is going to take off are kind of stuck in a mindset that refuses to admit it hasnt turned out to be the magical wonder technology that SciFi stories depicted And once again I think AR glasses are a different story and more likely to take offbut theyre also different product entirely that VR is a stepping stone towards,mn2icp0,4.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn3okr7,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-04-14 18:17:23,,,,The key difference is that you can easily just change audio sources to output sound through your speakers when you want to share music or video I agree that you cant do this with VR aside from screen sharing though thats not the same However I really have a hard time imagining people changing the output to speakers often or caring all that much about that feature Sounds like a very fringe thing to me as I would expect most people just use their headphones for themselves 247 outside a few rare exceptions Youre going to be dealing with a short battery life andor the need for wirespacks for the foreseeable future Ill agree with you there Youre dealing with deeply ingrained issues of instinct and cultural norms People want to see your eyes not representations of them and to know that they have your undivided attention Is it going to matter if its visually indistinguishable from seeing the persons real eyes Theres no iterating yourself out of that issue its a matter of physics You can definitely iterate yourself out of the hair issue by having really lightweight HMDs that have good weight balance without a top strap How far off is that Probably a long ways off but its physically possible and large chunks of people at this point literally prefer to do as much of their computing on their phonestablets or the holographic garbage that Apple tried to make work on the first Vision Pro For their general leisure needs this is true but its rare that you see someone do actual work on a phonetablet unless its specialized for their job like digital artists Desktops and laptops remain by a large margin the productivity device of choice You say Vision Pros input is garbage but a common sentiment among those that have tried Vision Pro is that its the most personable personal computer theyve used to such a degree that people describe it almost like mind reading because of how seamless the eyetracked interface is The speed leaves a lot to be desired and thats why I mentioned EMG Time will tell how far EMG goes but if the potential is fully realized then it would leapfrog over not just smartphones but the ageold mouse and keyboard that is considered the fastest input weve invented If it goes smoothly EMG will allow a user to type with their hands in their pockets or resting behind their head while lying down in bed at faster speeds than a physical keyboard with much less effort than either physical or touchscreen typing since youd barely be moving your hands and fingers perhaps not even moving at all These things have been demonstrated Its physically possible The question is how can this generalize to the wider population be affordable be mass producible and so on Thats the tough part And it further solidifies my impression that people who think VR is going to take off are kind of stuck in a mindset that refuses to admit it hasnt turned out to be the magical wonder technology that SciFi stories depicted I mean if you look at Ready Player One as a basis then all of the hardware already exists in places like Meta and Apples labs usually relegated to separate prototypes So its physically possible to eventually get there Funnily enough on the software side Ive already experienced every experience and activity described in the Ready Player One book and movie thats already happening today just at a much lower fidelity and scale,mn3ig6w,5.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn3ac9q,Tolken,,4,2025-04-14 17:08:33,,,,The iphone moment ALSO relied on almost every other manufacturer being caught flat footed as to where the tech was really headed Its easy to forget but iOS predates Android OS and blackberry misjudged what the market really wanted If Apple just sits back and waits for VR to be present and important everywhere already another party could already be in the correct position thereby not giving Apple a chance to jump in with a major improvement and take over This is a big reason why the Apple Car project failedBy the time Apple heavily spent RD to try to jump in There wasnt room to leapfrog as others were already successfully pushing the tech as farfast as it could go,mn1wrkv,2.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2gwcx,typo180,,1,2025-04-14 14:40:24,,,,Walking around on the street or interacting socially Sure Sitting on public transportation at your desk or in a coffee shop Who cares Im not sure wearing one all day while youre out and about is the best usecase either Its makes a neat tech demo to have the glasses tell you about the things youre looking at but thats not necessarily how people are going to want to use it,mn29woq,4.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2hfch,Kindness_of_cats,,3,2025-04-14 14:43:08,,,,Yeah I feel like people underestimate severely the issues with how headsets affect your appearance First you just straight up look like a dork wearing them Second they ruin your hair and your makeup because theyre literally strapped onto your head and face Third they ask you to set aside tens of thousands of years of evolutionary instincts and be okay with not seeing peoples eyes its the tech equivalent of wearing sunglasses indoors Also frankly most people just dont like wearing things on their face And I think this is an issue even AR glasses with struggle with breaking through People dont like wearing glasses when they need them to see anything and youre expecting them to wear your product I think AR glasses are more likely to go mainstream but even then I think theres a good chance they justdont In part because of simply asking people to wear something on their face and which alters their appearance,mn1xe0o,2.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn2hxhh,guiltyofnothing,,1,2025-04-14 14:45:46,,,,Youre 100 right and I think a lot of this can be overcome if there was just an overwhelming use case for headsets and AR but there really just isnt yet for the average consumer As it stands its an expensive piece of hardware that lacks a clear purpose that makes you look like dumb and is borderline impractical to use,mn2hfch,3.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn27c5c,None,,3,2025-04-14 13:49:00,,,,Yes as the computing and battery tech improves ar will eventually be the height of wearable tech What we have currently is the novelty form factor that allows testing and market research They will of course gather data from you in its current form to help them develop it as well as fund it Eventually Tony stark glasses will be a thing Heads up displays with built in ai and speakers built in That is probably 20 years away if not more The bigger issues in ar development will be an impending hot war if this trade war sparks off 510 years of physical conflict will stall luxury item manufacturing,mn1w824,1.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn8akrm,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,2,2025-04-15 13:27:14,,,,The market for MP3 players before the iPod was growing and the market for portable music players was well established for decades The iPod was simply one of the first MP3 players to hit the sweet spot for storage capacity physical size and nice user interface A lot of people say that athe iPhone was the first smartphone but even that isnt necessarily taking into account all the devices that came before it There was devices like the Palm Treo incorporated things like a cell phone PDA and other functionality into a single device The iPhone iterated on that and made it so much better which is why it was so popular But the demand was already there waiting for someone to have a clean interface Apple basically takes products that are well understood and creates better versions of them But there is no existing device thats just a computing oriented VR headset Even the market for VR headsets in general is rather small and if you take out the gaming aspect there just doesnt seem to be much of a use for them Maybe in the professional market for things like employee training or visualizing 3D environments but they dont seem to be focused on that too much either Their entire focus seems to be a replacement for monitors while you are seated at your desk working on basic office applications and browsing the web,mn5wjnb,5.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn61d6o,swb1003,,1,2025-04-15 02:04:28,,,,Ive been an almost daily PSVR2 user since launch day its incredibly impressive stuff even to this day My biggest gripes are cable tether Its really not THAT big of a deal for me vast majority of my use is in my sim rig for gt7 and asis its almost perfect for stationary use I also understand the necessity for the cable if only for power An onboard power source would add heft to a lets face it already bulky hmd weight Again not REALLY an issue for reasons Ill get into below weight isnt the most common factor for me coming out of headset and breaking immersion but I havent looked at specs nor do I have any other hmd experience to reference the PSVR2 isnt exactly light Even with the cable tetherlighter device it isnt something I find myself wearing for 23 hours at a clip lack of spatial awareness I totally love strapping into my rig and flipping the headset down and completely losing myself in gran turismo its so easy to lose myself in the game which is good Except sometimes I wish I could like see where a water bottle is or something I envision a way to display some sort of marker inheadset to signify a specified location in the real world Itd be cool to be able to like stick a small sensor or something on a water bottle so I could see where it is Longer sessions of drunks rock and gt7 are often interrupted by trying to find something in the real world more often than anything else And I get thats a me problem not a devicetech thing but its my biggest complaint That turned out longer than I thought,mn3q789,5.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn2hu9a,notsurewhereireddit,,1,2025-04-14 14:45:18,,,,Right I use VR almost exclusively for meditation Tripp app It is so immersive already and Im excited to see where they take it Immersive storytelling is going to be incredible too Look at how cool Soda Island is even with the super basic graphics,mn27c6l,3.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn312ap,QuadraticCowboy,,-1,2025-04-14 16:22:17,,,,Eh its not really that cool What were learning is that HUDs look useful because they generate selfevident proof points that the AI is assisting the user They provide colorful novel experiences that make the user happy However their actual usefulness is minimal because their use cases compete with smartphones and a good device with sensors and AI outperforms a 3d goggle display because 1 better battery and mobility 2 easier interface We probably wont get another killer portable device ever at least for next 20 years The only consumer devices well get will be 1 drones for lastmile deliveries replacing cars and 2 AI hubs for home use ie PCs acting as a privacy firewall so AI can operate in edge without sending raw private data to cloud servers,mn27c6l,3.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn32ylk,LongBeakedSnipe,,0,2025-04-14 16:31:49,,,,You can label your product as new tech but it doesnt really mean much if it does almost nothing novel compared with its competition That said the markup is expected on apple products and if you add that markup onto the price of top end headsets the price does make sense But I think there is a certain amount of suspending disbelief involved with convincing oneself that this was expensive because it was new tech It was higher end with a whopping markupthats all,mn2hfu0,4.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn3nlya,pixel_of_moral_decay,,4,2025-04-14 18:12:33,,,,People forget this isnt a new pattern Just on a different scale The original iPod was seen as too expensive too It sold but not nearly how people hopedexpected Those tiny hard drives werent even in high scale production at the time so the amount they could produce was limited The cheaper models later on are what really gained traction and brought people into the ecosystem and led to them eventually upgrading to the larger more expensive iPods Then the iPhone was a shift of that platform again I think this is the same But on a different scale it will take a few iterations but cheaper models will hook people in and then well see wider adoption Still not sure what the iPhone type use case will be that makes it ubiquitous,mn1yvfj,1.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn462nd,Public-Restaurant968,,5,2025-04-14 19:46:25,,,,The problem isnt solely on the pricing side I could afford a Vision Pro but the capabilities arent that exciting to me Even at 1k not sure if Id buy it unless there were more significant libraries of immersive videos or games or apps With flagship products youre anchoring other differentiating feature as worth it or youll settle for the inferior version But in this case the core use cases arent exciting to the general consumer market,mn2n3cr,2.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn4nl89,evilbarron2,,1,2025-04-14 21:14:41,,,,Thats a valid concern but again youre really not the target market The target market is your yuppie sister who knows nothing about MR or your neighbor whos always bringing over a new microbrew Do you think those folks will look at a future Vision product and not buy it because the App Library isnt as big as they expected Remember that this exact complaint was repeated by tech commentators at the iPhones launch when explaining why it would never take off I just dont think thats how the publics mind works,mn462nd,3.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn4ohx2,Public-Restaurant968,,1,2025-04-14 21:19:33,,,,Its not about the future product Its about getting market fit for what you buy it for today Lets assume my sister is a prototypical persona youre talking about give me 3 use cases an AVP would deliver on usage at least 34 times a week Yeah not much This is about buying something and being let down once you realize you dont get much value out of it Its like Apple and its intelligence pitch Have you tried it Massively underwhelming considering the alternatives Im a massive Apple fan I tried the AVP for a week so did my wife and friends Outside of the initial cool factor I didnt have much reason to use it on a weekly basis Thats probably why Meta Ray Bans were such a hit and why Apple is desperate for to win that part of the market Meta is building that entry level product that can upgrade into something more advanced ie their Quest You need people to try before you can convince them to buy and not return,mn4nl89,4.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn4rfsq,evilbarron2,,1,2025-04-14 21:35:27,,,,Yes Ive tried it I also own a Quest 3 which I try to use daily Im not a gamer the only game I play is Demeo and occasionally the MR action games I constantly try to use it for watching movies and work but the UI is so userhateful that I always give up after a short while I never forget Im wearing the headset Now the AVP is also heavy But in my one day of getting to use it its nice to have rich geek friends I did get into the zone multiple times while using it for work at my desk on my couch outside on the deck even apologies on the toilet The quality of the experience including but not limited to the realism of digital objects placed IRL is the killer app in my opinion There wasnt anything specific I did but there wasnt anything I couldnt do that I wanted to and it worked pretty smoothly I definitely noticed when I took it off but then I also notice pain in my back and wrists after spending hours at my laptop I cant tell you what any specific person will use a Vision product for any more than I can tell you what your most important usecase for your laptop is What I am comfortable saying is that whatever people want to use Vision products for it will involve far less friction to access on an Apple Vision device than on any other current headset it remains to be seen how smoothly Android XR works This is what Apple is selling and it is perennially undervalued by enthusiasts willing to put up with all sorts of hassles and roadblocks to do stuff with VRMR,mn4ohx2,5.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2qli2,evilbarron2,,0,2025-04-14 15:29:55,,,,Apple is completely uninterested in selling to people who know what SteamVR or ALVR even are The Vision products are simply not for them any more than a MacBook is designed for someone who enjoys compiling their own Linux kernel Please try to evaluate the AVP in the context of all the other products theyve ever created Apple tries to build things that the average person uninterested in the guts of technology can just use They charge a premium for that easeofuse and they actively try to create public desire for their products via pricing and the illusion of scarcity And its working once again in the publics mind the AVP is now positioned as crazily overpriced but much higherquality and desirable than the alternatives like a Bentley SUV compared to Honda and Hyundai SUVs If the price of a Bentley came down to 2x or 15x the price of a Honda CRV then a lot of people would be looking for a way to afford the Bentley Apply this to consumer electronics and you have something that looks very much like what Apples done in computers mp3 players phones watches headphones tablets smart speakers settop boxes and now MR headsets Given that Apple successfully follows this playbook time and time again its kinda surprising to me that so few people seem to actually grasp this Ive seen multiple generations of tech writers tie themselves in knots because they just cant grasp this basic concept,mn25zlv,1.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn22rqm,gendabenda,,2,2025-04-14 13:22:13,,,,VR as a segment has been fighting to grow since the late 80s and still hasnt hit massadoption but youre right VR is still alive and will eventually hit practical application I have a PSVR and Quest for example But this is about the AVP 12 About walking around with 5000 in Tech strapped to your face the entire time that weighs as much as wearing 30 pairs of sunglasses at the same time Its just not practical reasonable or feasible Apple preys on early tech adopters and trendsetting to sell devices which works well with a proven device like the iphone but the AVP has largely been heralded as a flop and missed projections across the board Will the AVP2 be a hit I dont see it happening,mn1zjhu,2.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn240wh,DarthBuzzard,,0,2025-04-14 13:29:43,,,,I wouldnt take the word of tech journalists at face value for what is a flop and what isnt What these journalists fail to realize is that Apple had only enough parts for around 500k units to be manufactured in its first year and that was because the supply chain for MicroOLED displays is still very immature VR only had its first consumer run in the 1990s as the 1980s days was purely enterprise and arcade solutions After the small 1990s run no one attempted VR again until the 2010s Investment over time rather than time by itself is how technology matures so its no surprise that VR hasnt taken off yet since its immature technology with a lot of future advancements cooking behind the scenes There is no expectation at Apple that AVP2 will be a hit Perhaps not even AVP3 because thats the Pro line Apple intends to release a nonPro line at some point and theyre well aware that it will take multiple iterations to be a hit because the path to maturity is quite long,mn22rqm,3.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn36wob,gendabenda,,1,2025-04-14 16:51:36,,,,I posted this on another comment but I tried to ignore sensationalist views and focus on numbers There are approx 14 billion iphone users globally whereas estimated total sales of AVP are 500k That is 004 adoption rate and declining On average 8 of iphone users buy a new iphone annually this is the market they needed to penetrate That equates to 112 million units These are people willing to blow 1000 just to have the latest thing with small incrememental upgrades and doso annually Yet only 045 of those super early adopters bothered with the AVP 500000 AVP sales 112 million iphone 16 upgrades Less than 1 of people who blow thousands on Apple products annually bothered Thats a flop to me and everyone else Get that 500000 number to 11 million and we can talk although I wouldnt be surprised if the AVP2 numbers were softer,mn240wh,4.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn3hwdu,gendabenda,,1,2025-04-14 17:45:02,,,,Apple Vision Pro was only meant to sell at maximum 500k units in its first year Says who This entire launch has been entirely surrounded by rumormilling and speculation Youre simply taking the most common EOY rumor they sold around 500k units and comparing it to the low end of production rumors theyve already assembled approx 500600k this year and saying well its 11 so thats a success You could also rumormill the 600k as well a short of 100k units and claim it missed projections by 350000000 Show some proof somewhere I can show views all day of how it disappointed give me some views where its a success,mn3dhyo,6.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn3d9bz,gendabenda,,1,2025-04-14 17:22:48,,,,You said wireless headphones not Airpods People have always understood and eagerly awaited true lossless comfortable wireless headphones People complained about Airpods when they launched absolutely but it wasnt because they didnt value the innovation or how they looked it was entirely because they were insanely expensive with subpar sound were lost constantly had poor battery life and were essentially impossible to repair cost was almost if not identical to replace at genius bars as it was to repair one,mn399ro,4.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn1x3go,Hoserposerbro,,0,2025-04-14 12:47:02,,,,Did you see the new ai project that can deliver any sporting event like a Yankees game for example in real time 3D meaning you can view it from any location or viewing angle putting yourself in the POV of the batter or any other player at any time That is the type of technology that is going to make VR goggles an every household electronic Edit the company behind it is called Arcturus,,0.0,1jyxic1
comment,mn1z4qw,mittelwerk,,4,2025-04-14 12:59:53,,,,Isnt the point of watching sporting events on TV the fact that whoever is broadcasting the event picks the best angles and also tells the viewer whats happening As an example if a player say scores a threepoint shot or gets a foul the broadcasting team immediately cuts to the play or the player in question while the commentator explains what happened while also replaying the scene If I were to watch the game like I was there I would miss those plays It would be great as a novelty but after the novelty wears out I cant see myself watching an sports event that way not to mention it still would have to deal with the limitations of modern VR like narrow FOV and motion sickness Imagine watching say a Formula 1 race from the drivers POV,mn1x3go,1.0,1jyxic1

comment,mn2ort2,mittelwerk,,1,2025-04-14 15:20:40,,,,Modern VR is not even close to the Ford T I mean do we have fullbody immersion Wide FOV Complete holodeckstyle freedom to move in all directions like we move IRL ie by walking And last but not least did we cure VRinduced motion sickness something that we dont even know what actually causes it Then and only then VR solves all those issues we can talk about VR becoming mainstream,mn2norj,3.0,1jyxic1
