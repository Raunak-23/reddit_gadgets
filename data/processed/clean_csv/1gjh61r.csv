comment,lve7atl,LeCrushinator,,446,2024-11-04 19:06:58,,,,Its crazy that the STM32H730ZBI6 ARM MCU in the Alarmo is probably 3050x as fast as my 486 DX233Mhz machine that I had when I first played Doom when it was released If you could take the Alarmo back in a time machine to the early 90s itd be one of the fastest computers on the planet,,0.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveok96,Starfox-sf,,18,2024-11-04 20:32:03,,,,DX2 did not exist in 33mhz,lve7atl,1.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveuabx,LeCrushinator,,13,2024-11-04 21:00:00,,,,I was a kid so I might be misremembering its possible that it was a 66mhz and said 33mhz if you turned off the turbo setting,lveok96,2.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveunkq,Starfox-sf,,8,2024-11-04 21:01:49,,,,33mhz bus speed 66mhz CPU yes,lveuabx,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvf3zds,nefthep,,5,2024-11-04 21:48:41,,,,Yeah that half speed FSB sucked when upgrading dx2 to a Pentium Overdrive It really held it back,lveunkq,4.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvf5y28,Starfox-sf,,-1,2024-11-04 21:58:35,,,,Not really Quad L1 higher IPC much better FPU and didnt suffer from FDIV I had it running as a headless Linux serverrouter for a while,lvf3zds,5.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfbvcg,nefthep,,3,2024-11-04 22:29:53,,,,My FSB was locked 25 Mhz while my Pentium Overdrive was 90 Mhz It made a huge reduction in potential performance on my setup,lvf5y28,6.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfil9p,Starfox-sf,,-1,2024-11-04 23:06:31,,,,POD was running at 63mhz 25x multiplier and your FSB was only using 75 bandwidth,lvfbvcg,7.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfwuu3,nefthep,,3,2024-11-05 00:26:26,,,,Yeah as soon as Socket 7 came out I did a full upgrade to 233 I sometimes miss that old dx2 Gateway 2000,lvfil9p,8.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfx6ls,Starfox-sf,,1,2024-11-05 00:28:19,,,,I had that DX2 Socket 4 VLB model with ATI VLB card Not sure why yours was stuck at 25mhz,lvfwuu3,9.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvg3zj1,nefthep,,1,2024-11-05 01:07:43,,,,I had the weirdo 50Mhz CPU model maybe thats why,lvfx6ls,10.0,1gjh61r

comment,lvd8fnz,ey3s0up,,241,2024-11-04 16:16:12,,,,I swear you can get DOOM to run on anything,,0.0,1gjh61r
comment,lve4gc2,cosmos7,,163,2024-11-04 18:53:03,,,,Doom was a welloptimized game written in C and designed to run on a 486 a chip introduced 35 years ago By modern standards it will run on just about anything,lvd8fnz,1.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvhoidt,JohnTitorsdaughter,,11,2024-11-05 07:56:13,,,,It also introduced a legacy bug that is still found in games today TLDR they used the wrong value for pi,lve4gc2,2.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvhvfna,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,10,2024-11-05 09:14:31,,,,It does what it was designed to do so not actually bugs The wrong value of Pi only because it was rounded to 10 digitsnot actually wrong,lvhoidt,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvl7cz6,JohnTitorsdaughter,,1,2024-11-05 21:06:43,,,,The problem wasnt that he round to 10 digits The issue was created because the 10th digit was wrong,lvhvfna,4.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvhsjr3,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,3,2024-11-05 08:41:29,,,,Its mainly because DOOM doesnt rely on anymany OS specific libraries just common C libraries that have been ported to many platforms The people who do this have a list of the few problem libraries that remain and replacements for them Figuring out how the screen has been attached to the MCU is probably where most of the work is,lve4gc2,2.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvmotfv,mrturret,,1,2024-11-06 01:58:31,,,,It also helps that the code is extremely well written and documented,lvhsjr3,3.0,1gjh61r

comment,lvdsh7w,_RADIANTSUN_,,93,2024-11-04 17:54:54,,,,Honestly this one isnt really what we are talking about when we say does DOOM run on it You can run any program on potatoes if you count the energy generation part of the chain Eg if they used solar power its not really DOOM running on the Sun Its more like running off the power source than running on it,lvdivvv,2.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvdt3yd,UncaringNonchalance,,25,2024-11-04 17:57:55,,,,Yeah still always found it interesting though lol,lvdsh7w,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvdzdv9,skinwill,,11,2024-11-04 18:28:26,,,,How about getting it to run so efficiently it can be powered by potatoes Those spuds dont make much power,lvdsh7w,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveia23,_PM_ME_PANGOLINS_,,12,2024-11-04 20:01:07,,,,100 pounds of potatoes is a lot You can get 5V out of a boiled potato which is standard processor operating voltage You just need enough to last as long as you want to play,lvdzdv9,4.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveo8e6,Starfox-sf,,7,2024-11-04 20:30:26,,,,Equalo set out to get Doom running on a Raspberry Pi Zero calculating hed need about 770 slices of potatoes to generate the 100120 milliamps and 5 volts required,lveia23,5.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveizgd,skinwill,,-3,2024-11-04 20:04:35,,,,They only got 120mA at 5V Thats like one fourth of a cheap phone charger,lveia23,5.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvekpnv,_PM_ME_PANGOLINS_,,6,2024-11-04 20:13:06,,,,You can get embedded processors that run that low Moving up a bit the original Raspberry Pi took 700mA or a handful of potatoes Edit The Raspberry Pi Zero in fact only draws 120mA at peak,lveizgd,6.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvelhif,skinwill,,3,2024-11-04 20:16:56,,,,Yup back in the day the original version of doom needed a 486 which took a lot more than 120mA Now it can run on tiny embedded processors like the one in the graphic calculator in the article Im calling that an achievement,lvekpnv,7.0,1gjh61r
comment,lve79f8,Onebadmuthajama,,2,2024-11-04 19:06:47,,,,Im waiting on doom inside of doom lol,lvdsh7w,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvgbrhh,None,,1,2024-11-05 01:53:10,,,,Doom running on The Sun Hmmmmm,lvdsh7w,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveijjc,PradaWestCoast,,8,2024-11-04 20:02:24,,,,Thats not as interesting as the person who ran it on a pregnancy test lol,lvdivvv,2.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvekxz8,MelancholyArtichoke,,14,2024-11-04 20:14:15,,,,That one was exaggerated The pregnancy test had a screen installed and Doom wasnt running on the test so much as it was just using the installed screen as a video output device,lveijjc,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfnsrg,Liquid_Hate_Train,,3,2024-11-04 23:35:11,,,,The original one you see most often wasnt even that it was a higher resolution OLED put in the housing though it was later done on an actual test screen,lvekxz8,4.0,1gjh61r
comment,lveitzg,UncaringNonchalance,,1,2024-11-04 20:03:50,,,,Oh shit never heard of that one,lveijjc,3.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvfrq8j,None,,2,2024-11-04 23:57:08,,,,As a programmer this is absolutely invalid to the actual DOOM test The TI calculator port of DOOM is a shoddy mock FPS and while I appreciate that they can make a calculator run off potatoes this absolutely in no way passes the can it run DOOM test in any meaningful way Its neat but its not potatoes running DOOM,lvdivvv,2.0,1gjh61r

comment,lvdru8u,ey3s0up,,1,2024-11-04 17:51:51,,,,Thanks for the links I find it very fascinating that the original DOOM can be booted up on such random things Please keep sharing,lvd8fnz,1.0,1gjh61r

comment,lvd9z61,msnmck,,50,2024-11-04 16:24:15,,,,But does it play Doom like a printer or play Doom like a pregnancy test A lot of these claims are lies If its just using the screen it doesnt count Edit The article claims it runs natively Mazel tov if true,,0.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvdym0h,narwhal_breeder,,29,2024-11-04 18:24:39,,,,The Alarmo runs an STM32 people have had native ports for it for a while 10 years at least,lvd9z61,1.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvmogqd,mrturret,,2,2024-11-06 01:56:24,,,,But does it play Doom like a printer or play Doom like a pregnancy test The printer one is real A security reasercher found a vulnerability on some Canon printers and demonstrated it by running Doom Mind you the colors glitched out but it was still Doom A lot of these claims are lies The vast majority of them arent If theres a way to run unsigned code on a device thats fast enough and has a screen Doom has probably already been ported to it The engine is open source extremely well documented and was designed to be easily ported from the beginning,lvd9z61,1.0,1gjh61r
comment,lvnnlm6,msnmck,,1,2024-11-06 05:36:58,,,,I was mainly referring to the claims that Doom ran on a digital pregnancy test when in reality the person making the claim just wired another device into its screen Impressive but not video games on your refrigerator impressive,lvmogqd,2.0,1gjh61r
