comment,lx2b7wn,koolaidismything,,83,2024-11-14 09:47:37,,,,Dont even trust that I bought a 6p cause it came with a lifetime of 100gb google cloud storage They reneged that within two years and then had the balls to charge my card 20 for that same storage Pissed me off they did that so I fought it and got the charge removed and told them to eat shit My iPhone 11 I bought in 2019 still works and I use it like 6 hours a day Has iOS 181 Ill never go back to android Not for me anymore Edit whoever below somehow got a bunch of upvotes saying I was wrong and it was like 5gb for a few months is full of shit I was stuck between it and the new Note when I got a google email saying anyone who pre ordered the 6p got lifetime of 100gb storage in googles cloud services Im realistic I didnt think Id be on my deathbed with that still in 50 years I figured Id get 2 Maybe 3 years of it though AT LEAST Nope Oh and that phone was miserable luckily I was able to sell for a good amount,lx27fbl,3.0,1gr02ls
comment,lx2ls4b,aleuts,,30,2024-11-14 11:36:59,,,,It pisses me off so much when reviewers keep saying it has a billion years worth of updates Its not been long enough for one company to honour it yet And going by most of their histories as you said they always renege I have a iPhone 15 pro max and really want a folding phone but even the current models are months behind on updates so its either I keep my phone or just buy the cheapest second hand foldable and hope the hardware isnt on its last legs where my backup iPhone XR is still working great bar the battery,lx2b7wn,4.0,1gr02ls

comment,lx602b3,FireLucid,,1,2024-11-14 22:56:19,,,,Apple and Google have yet to renege on updates the other OEMs are a crap shoot Google has recently upped theirs to 7 years which is great I guess running their own chips helps a lot they are not reliant on a 3rd party for firmware stuff Even the original Pixel still has unlimited Google photo uploads I should work out how to do that with my old photos I still have a Pixel in a drawer I thought the Google Photos perk ended with the 5 series,lx2ls4b,5.0,1gr02ls
comment,lx2hmft,notjordansime,,35,2024-11-14 10:56:51,,,,Same Teenage me thought itd be sick to customize my phone and whatnot It was fun at first but then stuff stops working as expected custom launchers arent as snappy and I just defaulted to the default Then there were other things that just made the whole operating system feel like a jumbled mess or a house of cards built by 20 people with differing opinions on cardhousearchitecture Little things really added up The final nail in the coffin was reaching out to support for a different issue using the Google one app you have to PAY for support btw When it opened the support ticket it did so in an inaccessible window in Google chrome I could hear the agent join the chat and send a message then leave the chat about 5 mins later Then they wouldnt let me open a new support ticket because that one just closed Its not like I was using the Samsung browser or anything not that that should cause issues as its the default configuration the phone ships with I was trying to contact google about an issue with one of googles digital products through google support and a google browser Whole software pipeline was Google operated but it still didnt work Bought an iPhone that same day,lx2b7wn,4.0,1gr02ls
comment,lx4oeur,Yancy_Farnesworth,,5,2024-11-14 18:51:56,,,,To be fair it isnt particularly Googles fault as the support window is essentially dictated by Qualcomm They couldnt support it longer even if they wanted to All Qualcomm SoC phones have that in common Which is why the only devices you see with a longer support window are nonQualcomm SoCs One of those being iPhones Luckily Google is now making their own SoCs starting with the Pixel 7 so Qualcomm cant force them into a shorter support window I dont know why the Pixel 7s support window is so short though,lx2b7wn,4.0,1gr02ls

comment,lx3tl3j,procursive,,14,2024-11-14 16:15:13,,,,Part of it is that Android isnt nearly as update sensitive as iOS is You could be 5 major Android versions out of date and chances are youll have a really hard time finding a common app that wont work and youll still be recieving updates for Google Play Services and most system apps Meanwhile on iOS every single system app only ever gets updated with system updates and once youre a couple of versions out of date some major apps will probably start to dislike your device OFC that doesnt excuse the pathetic support that most Android phones get but its the reason why the whole ecosystem could exist in that state for 15 years without changing,lx25glt,2.0,1gr02ls
comment,lx4150i,notjordansime,,8,2024-11-14 16:54:06,,,,Youre absolutely right All of my last android phones were out of date and it was a nothing burger Even the security patches were years out of date on the one phone and I had zero issues Meanwhile using an out of date iPhone without any sort of newer Apple device to do the stupid purchased list workaround thing SUCKS Okay for web browsing and using the apps I already had but like the moment you need a new app its just like aghhhhhh KILL me,lx3tl3j,3.0,1gr02ls

comment,lx4q6cn,Yancy_Farnesworth,,0,2024-11-14 19:00:50,,,,flashing a custom rom is still possible That comes with a lot of massive asterisks It is nowhere near replacing official support and more often than not gives people a false sense of security A lot of the time those are essentially skins They cannot replace the kernel of the OS because that requires either access to the SoC driver source code or reverse engineering it Which means that youre still running an old out of support OS on your device with associated security issues Heartbleed a few years ago was a huge issue because patching it required patching the kernel The exceptions are distributions like LineageOS They reverse engineer the SoC drivers allowing them to update the kernel But that is hit or miss because those builds usually dont pass the full suite of tests that Google provides for official builds,lx265k6,3.0,1gr02ls
comment,lx5xocj,mrtruthiness,,2,2024-11-14 22:43:44,,,,Didnt Google just commit to 7 years of updates Or is that only for certainpremium models Its not a retroactive 7 years The Pixel 7 series has 5 years of updates The Pixel 8 and Pixel 9 series has 7 years of updates The Pixel 5 was 3 years and I dont know about the Pixel 6,lx25glt,2.0,1gr02ls
