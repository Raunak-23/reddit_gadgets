comment,m8yo4r4,ArchusKanzaki,,56,2025-01-24 19:22:29,,,,Being honest foldability is overrated As long as the case profile is still similar being able to fold it flat is better for longevity of the hinge And the case profile do be similar With that said My XM4 I got for free from credit card signup is still basically perfect for me I dont see much reason to buy XM5 or XM6 just for the hinge,m8x9yks,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8z6k1k,eras,,21,2025-01-24 20:50:04,,,,I though have a backpack where the XM2 fits folded on its pouch Cant imagine it fitting in without the ability to fill in that big empty space in the center,m8yo4r4,2.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8y6c5r,finlandery,,16,2025-01-24 17:59:55,,,,Changing battery on xm3 is really easy Highly recommend if your battery starts to get old instead buying new headphones Its like 15min job even when looking youtube video for how to do it and you only need small philips and something thin and sturdy to open plastic clips,m8xiq2l,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yqh6q,suprememau,,6,2025-01-24 19:33:29,,,,Same XM3 its been one of the best purchases i did still going strong,m8xiq2l,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yncsm,ArchusKanzaki,,13,2025-01-24 19:18:52,,,,If you are on Android LDAC is way better than AptX and iirc its available for everyone If you are on Iphone their AAC implementation is honestly alot better than on Androids I only sorta notice the difference with LDAC on Android at least,m8xdbmg,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8z8get,DBrEmoKiddo,,4,2025-01-24 20:58:59,,,,Yeah LDAC is awesome I use a mac Its been a minute since I tried AAC I force aptx always Maybe it got better When I bought xm3 I still had my xm4 and listening side by side it distorted on a certain levels and lost dinamic even on lower levels The day I got xm4 I use my android to tested and loved probaly was on LDAC Thats why I boiled down to the codec Since 99 of the time I use it on my mac it simply was not going to cut for me,m8yncsm,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8zyps2,plumzki,,2,2025-01-24 23:06:52,,,,LDAC is great for phone use but honestly as someone who uses wireless to pc aptx LL was always a must for me before now the newer LC3 codec with low latency mode fills that spot for me now so if they release it with LC3 it might be worth looking into for me,m8yncsm,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yg3u4,nukem996,,8,2025-01-24 18:45:13,,,,LDAC is significantly better but Apple refuses to support it Luckily Android and Linux come with out of the box support,m8xdbmg,2.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8z6tpj,DBrEmoKiddo,,1,2025-01-24 20:51:19,,,,Yeah and thats ok I gave my xm4 to a friend of mine and she dont hear the difference either For reference I do music production amateurish but still I have studio monitors in my desk When you dont know what you should be listening its super hard to catch the differences My problem I was thinking I was upgrading and got a downgrade of quality,m8yg3to,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m91yvhw,The_JSQuareD,,0,2025-01-25 06:47:41,,,,XM4 still folds I have had the XM3 for years and recently bought the XM4 for work Basically identical design but the XM4 has some additional features,m8xdbmg,2.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8ykxcy,IB_Yolked,,2,2025-01-24 19:07:31,,,,Wish they hadnt degraded the foldability of those headphones As someone who owns both the size profile of the case is essentially the same The sound quality upgrade is significant and noticeably better too not sure what the other guy is talking about,m8x9yks,1.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8zudk7,WalnutWhipWilly,,1,2025-01-24 22:44:39,,,,Also still wearing the XM2s they work very well All I ever see in the Sony headphones sub are people posting pictures of broken joints on the XM5s to the extent people on the sub recommend the XM4s as the model to buy the m5s were not a very well thought out or user friendly concept This thinkingapproach to design would make me sceptical about any further models without some good reviews,m8x9yks,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m90eq88,Expln,,1,2025-01-25 00:32:51,,,,Bro totally unrelated question but I am desperate is there a way at all to purchase original replacement pads for the XM3 headphones mines are SO worn out and I cannot find the original ones my headphones work perfectly fine but the pads are basically a dead body,m8x9yks,1.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8x8etq,Sicnics,,88,2025-01-24 15:22:49,,,,i use the xm5s daily For listening to youtube their great The only feature that would make existing owners worth upgrading is if the bluetooth audio was better quality when the mic is in use but i think it might be a limitation of bluetooth Otherwise their top notch,,0.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xavpv,DrBhu,,24,2025-01-24 15:34:38,,,,The headset got 2 channels When you use the mic one channel will be used for that There are bt chips which got 3 channels And i think rhey already where a thing when the headset came out I would like to see them waterproof I had a hard time when I discovered that my 400 bucks headset cant take slightly rain,m8x8etq,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xh5ca,toastbot,,13,2025-01-24 16:04:05,,,,I had a hard time when I discovered that my 400 bucks headset cant take slightly rain Hear this Sony Perfect chance to bring back the 90s Sony SPORTS line A waterresistant version of these in glossyellow with gray accents could be an amazing nichethrowback design Make a version for April Fools and see the response you get,m8xavpv,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8zxp8h,DrBhu,,4,2025-01-24 23:01:35,,,,Atleast splashproof would be nice Every other producer seems to have no problem making their expensive headsets watersplashproof And weirdly the automaticnoise supression which should check in which environment it should turn updown the noise cancelling is getting worse every day I had to switch to manual because it started to do the opposite of its job,m8xh5ca,3.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8xbrcb,BigLan2,,24,2025-01-24 15:38:49,,,,They earpieces fold flat but only in one direction so you can lay them on a table but they dont fold up towards the headband to make them more compact They come with a decent case though but its just bulky,m8xaasi,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yonub,ArchusKanzaki,,3,2025-01-24 19:24:59,,,,The case that comes default with XM4 is also pretty bulky though Its not that different from XM5s Unless you are a fan of folding both earcups to pack them without case the added durability of not needing to fold one side to pack them into the default case probably better for majority of user,m8xbrcb,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xh3v7,labe225,,3,2025-01-24 16:03:53,,,,Yeah that is one of my biggest complaints Its not a huge issue for me since I typically dont have much in my backpack but its a bit more of a challenge if both my wife and I want to pack everything into one backpack,m8xbrcb,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yovs1,ArchusKanzaki,,3,2025-01-24 19:26:01,,,,Do you fold both cups and pack them without case Im pretty sure the default case for XM4 and XM5 is pretty similar,m8xh3v7,4.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8yr1ml,labe225,,2,2025-01-24 19:36:08,,,,Nope they stay in the case The XM4 case is slightly smaller since the headphones can fold up a bit more than the XM5 Volume wise the case is about 40 larger for the XM5,m8yovs1,5.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xeeuv,tenemu,,8,2025-01-24 15:51:17,,,,Is that why selecting headphones over headset makes it sound so much better,m8x8etq,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xfs01,Sicnics,,8,2025-01-24 15:57:40,,,,that article details the issue with bluetooth headsetsWhen the headset microphone is enabled it swaps to a HFP driver which has mono audio not sure if thats the case with newer headsets,m8xeeuv,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xhf1g,narwhal_breeder,,14,2025-01-24 16:05:21,,,,It is the case with newer headsets its why gaming headsets all use dongles The Bluetooth spec has lagged behind,m8xfs01,3.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8yqkt6,DevinOlsen,,4,2025-01-24 19:33:58,,,,lol no it doesnt Outside of a tiny window of tech enthusiasts I would bet almost nobody knows and understanding the Sony naming for their headphones I own a pair and genuinely couldnt have told you the letters XM are in the model name,m8x935t,2.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8xb5au,ThinkpadLaptop,,11,2025-01-24 15:35:53,,,,Its actually really good branding Its a non professional consumer product with a long weird name that makes it sound like its a professional studio headset the likes of a sennheiserbeyerdynamicsaudiotechnica or even sony themselves 34235235XC WHATEVER Used to work in retail tech and After hearing SKULLCANDY DESTROYER and JBL CRAZYBASS and airpods max and bose quietcomfort just mentioning a name like that really caught on to peoples ears and made them raise an eyebrow in interest since it sounds like it focuses on audio quality more than the others whether it actually sounds better or not Today I see XM3sXM4sXM5s all the time over here locally in the GTA area and people generally know somewhat about them,m8x7af8,1.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8xdjlu,ThinkpadLaptop,,1,2025-01-24 15:47:12,,,,The actual consumer from my experience isnt googling things Theyll go off either hype they heard from an online reviewer which always mentions the XMs or airpods a friends recommendation or what the salesman in store said If not that whatevers cheapest and hearing about the XMs makes them more likely to eye something cheaper from the CH or whatever else line At least the ones in store For all I know people shopping on Amazon have different opinions and thought processing,m8xczg2,3.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xfjoh,Thandor369,,4,2025-01-24 15:56:35,,,,Yes but why not put that known XM brand forward because not it is 8th and 9th symbols out of 10 in the name I dont see how having something like XM6H and XM5F will hurt and I didnt even changed letters I just removed ones that are basically useless for regular consumer,m8xdjlu,4.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8x9c1t,Myarmhasteeth,,8,2025-01-24 15:27:13,,,,People just say xm as in xm3 xm4 etc Because exactly very bad naming I have the xm3 and had to google every time someone asked me what the product name was even the model You reserve stuff like that for internal unique naming not for the final consumer to deal with,m8x7af8,1.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8xa1v0,danielv123,,5,2025-01-24 15:30:38,,,,These have been in a league of their own for anc performance for years Bose now as an offering that is in some ways better but its the same price range,m8x7rx2,3.0,1i8xlgz

comment,m8xa21e,Paragonswift,,3,2025-01-24 15:30:39,,,,Tough to swallow pill the difference in sound quality between low end BT headphones and high end BT headphones is greater and more noticable to an average user than the difference between good BT headphones and wired headphones,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8x8qge,Senior1292,,2,2025-01-24 15:24:21,,,,I have a pair of XM4s and theyre really nice for the Noise Cancellation when working in the office or travelling I also got them at a decent discount The sound quality is solid and they would probably sound better if I wasnt streaming music through Spotify,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xd7d6,diablosinmusica,,-2,2025-01-24 15:45:36,,,,Theyre limited by Bluetooth Even running on a lossless format theyre still not going to pass a certain point Plenty of high end headphones just crank the bass to hide it,m8x8qge,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8x99pk,iguacu,,2,2025-01-24 15:26:55,,,,If youre in an isolated work environment where you can wear them a lot of the day they are unbeatable for longterm comfort ANC making phone calls while typing listening to computer audio etc Literally one of the best ways I spend money If I were just using them occasionally to listen to music and never at work less so And the price caps out at 400 they dont reach the prices of upperend audiophile headphones,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8x9vet,dead_fritz,,2,2025-01-24 15:29:46,,,,I didnt either until I took a flight with a pair of QuietComforts Its headphones you can comfortably wear for hours with the best combo of active and passive noise cancellation These headphones sell themselves on being a premium experience with solid build quality and features like being able to switch between Bluetooth and wired playback better batteries etc,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xggox,Thandor369,,1,2025-01-24 16:00:51,,,,For the wast majority of people limiting factor will be streaming service they use not wireless protocol,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8x7sj1,None,,-3,2025-01-24 15:19:50,,,,Sony tends to put overkill bass in their headphones so you wont be hearing those highs anyways Conversely if you need noise canceling to hear your headphones then you wouldnt be enjoying the quality in that enivronment either,m8x7282,1.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xa90o,danielv123,,1,2025-01-24 15:31:34,,,,I do wish it was possible to have it not go into turd mode as soon as the mic is activated though,m8x7sj1,2.0,1i8xlgz
comment,m8xc9vv,diablosinmusica,,-2,2025-01-24 15:41:14,,,,Yup A lot of expensive headphones just crank the bass to hide the poor quality of Bluetooth,m8x7sj1,2.0,1i8xlgz
