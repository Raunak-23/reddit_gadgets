comment,m2nrep0,thisischemistry,,426,2024-12-18 14:10:23,,,,A couple of questions really Are the rates of vulnerabilities and exploits higher than the average for such devices Are the compromised devices delivered in that state or does it happen after they have been in use for a bit Is security for these devices increasing or decreasing Are these builtin exploits or are these failures of programming and bad security Ive used TPLink network equipment and found them to be more stable and hardened than many alternatives If these arent designed backdoors and the devices are as good or better than the competition then why ban them According to an article linked in the current article The hackers exploit a vulnerability in the routers to gain remote code execution capability although the specific exploit method is still under investigation So this seems to be just a normal runofthemill exploited vulnerability something that should be patched but not something that should be banned under the guise of national security This seems like a trade war instead of safety concerns,,0.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2quhz1,thisischemistry,,-1,2024-12-19 00:14:45,,,,Well if they are smart it would be pretty easy to hide that kind of traffic They could hide it in other traffic as you visit web sites or play online games for example However thats starting to get a bit paranoid about network safety Its a good thought though Layered security is best and relying on more than one ecosystem is a good thing so they cover each others gaps,m2qby0j,4.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2r491i,thisischemistry,,-1,2024-12-19 01:14:25,,,,The endpoint doesnt have a window into the local network the router does If both are involved then local information can be leaked easily even with a firewall,m2qywt1,6.0,1hh1ubj
comment,m2r5fes,mithie007,,6,2024-12-19 01:21:36,,,,Yes but the contention is how can the router leak that information If it tries to send the traffic to an unrecognized endpoint your firewall will catch it You mentioned masquerading as normal traffic but that would only work if the endpoint is complicit Like if its hijacking some payload for sending to googlecom then unless googlecom is complicit that hijacked packet dies at google My point is the router cannot magically sneak traffic past the firewall If it could then your firewall is the one thats compromised,m2r491i,7.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2wcz8z,MachinaThatGoesBing,,5,2024-12-19 23:06:37,,,,Indeed Its hard not to miss the xenophobic component of all this when Facebook has openly admitted to engaging in large scale psychological experimentation on people without consent We should regulate the behavior of all these companies hoovering up data We should ban all kinds of practices they regularly engage in The perverse incentives that made Walmart buy Vizio the TV company to bolster their advertising business should be carefully cautiously deliberately regulated away But instead we have this big dumb freakout specifically about TikTok mostly because the youths are there And people on this site act like its different but how many horrible harassment andor political movements has reddit helped birth generally based on disinformation and lies Theyre often a disgusting hybrid of both of those when they come from here,m2qabs2,7.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2oqfp9,xAdakis,,-6,2024-12-18 17:25:41,,,,I put very little stock into these reported vulnerabilities and similar security advisories You remember the whole MeltdownSpectre exploit several years ago that sent everyone scrambling to patch firmware and disable or inhibit highprecision timingclocks Yeah I was tasked with implementing and analyzing that exploit for an upper elective Computer Science course I discovered that yes it was possible but VERY impractical to actually exploit For starters you had to reconfigurerecompile a linux kernel to turn off several memory isolation features which had been enabled by default in the kernel for a least a decade before the exploit was published to make it work and it took a VERY long time to scan memory once you managed to pull off the exploit It was going to take 30 days to dump the contents of 4GB of memory on the typical lab workstation I was testing on and there was no guarantee that ANY sensitive information would be present in the section of memory you happened to be scanning at that time I was never able to retrieve information from a running browser or other process I was only ever able to retrieve data from a small target program I wrote that continuously hammered a flag into the CPUs memory cache and share that memory address with the program exploiting the vulnerability Thus unless someone is actively exploiting something and gaining access to systems I pay very little attention to reported vulnerabilities,m2nrep0,1.0,1hh1ubj
comment,m2q3oxx,dark_sylinc,,8,2024-12-18 21:40:57,,,,What the heck are you talking about Meltdown was so severe I was able to make a 50 line of code app that would get the root password out of an unpatched unmitigated Intel CPU in around 2 seconds Once you get the root password its game over You have full access to the entire machine Meltdown was so severe there were proof showing the exploit working from JavaScript Spectre was indeed much harder to exploit but it was a severe problem This is a working JS proof from a browser leaking around 750 bytes second Again enough to get the root password if ran from native since Javascript cannot use the root passw to escalate And the main problem were Virtual Machines Particularly the Cloud You could dump what every other instance was doing You could even takeown the hypervisor and once youre there you can dump at full speed For starters you had to reconfigurerecompile a linux kernel to turn off several memory isolation features which had been enabled by default in the kernel for a least a decade before the exploit was published to make it work To properly defend from Meltdown the kernel needs to be compiled with KAISER which was merged into mainline on December 29th 2017 KASLR only made it slightly harder instead of getting the root password instantaneously it took up to 5 seconds For Spectre the kernel had to be rebuilt with retpolines,m2oqfp9,2.0,1hh1ubj
comment,m2ouk8x,thisischemistry,,3,2024-12-18 17:47:15,,,,They are good for jumpingoff points to test the security of a device but as you said very many of them are highlytheoretical exploits with very few realworld applications Often its more important to see how good the organization is at patching and addressing the security issues rather than simply the number or the quality of the reported vulnerabilities,m2oqfp9,2.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2p4ia7,Helpmehelpyoulong,,6,2024-12-18 18:39:04,,,,Yeah the old WRT was such a beauty My only gripe was the antennae Every netgear unit Ive ever had failed before it was time to upgrade Never had an issue with other brands and the TPlink stuff has been running fine even in harsh conditions for ages Very solid gear they sell The admin gui is usually very to the point and not loaded with a bunch of idiocy like netgear stuff is Love their products but sucks if they have vulnerabilities that cant be patched I suspect its all made in CCP land and if they want to backdoor it they can,m2om8kg,2.0,1hh1ubj
comment,m2p3z6k,frostedhifi,,11,2024-12-18 18:36:15,,,,I spent almost a month in an anechoic chamber trying to pass a WiFi performance test which kept failing Turns out our product worked fine but the netgear nighthawk gaming router we were testing against wasnt up to snuff The problem turned out to be that netgear cheaped out on the Ethernet interface the packaging heavily implied it supported 25gb when it was in fact 1gb I will never buy netgear again,m2om8kg,2.0,1hh1ubj

comment,m2pd1lg,None,,2,2024-12-18 19:23:31,,,,Each connection your router has between the internet and an application on the PC takes some amount of RAM on the router to facilitate Now if you run something like bittorrent that opens way more connections than usual it can quickly burn through the RAM available on the router and when the router runs out the only thing it can do is crash since routers lack mass storage for making a swap file You can configure your bittorrent client to dial back on connections but many software update clients especially for games run their own version of bittorrent or something similar and those dont have any facility to limit the number of connections Some old routers I used to use with tens of MB of RAM would frequently crap themselves whenever I updated WoW it was super frustrating,m2p9b0c,3.0,1hh1ubj
