comment,m87o4j8,JoeyBigtimes,,22,2025-01-20 19:24:24,,,,Not anywhere near the same thing The N64s stick used optical encoders for the analog input It was the plastic on plastic grinding that eventually made the sticks loose the optical encoders still worked fine No other console has used this technology,m878vuc,7.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m8afodn,Goddamn_Grongigas,,0,2025-01-21 03:36:12,,,,Its a crapshoot The reason why we hear so much about controller drift now is because of internet forums Fact of the matter is there has never been enough of this happening to really put a dent in anything it just seems like a lot because of loud echochambers in places like reddit we frequent Hell sticks on arcades even fail after too much usebeing too rough with them But it really isnt as widespread as people here claim,m89gqgl,8.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86l3mh,starcoder,,-4,2025-01-20 16:28:45,,,,I am speaking from past experience with my pile of unusable joycons Probably back when they finally started doing it because they were faced with a massive lawsuit It wasnt even worth my time then I just bought contact cleaner canned air tools and learned how to take them apart and clean them myself Weeks of wait and paying for shipping was why I didnt do it It honestly was better for me at the time to just spend a few bucks on Amazon and a Saturday afternoon than bother with it it didnt ever fix the problem but it helped for a short time My experience was a while ago bottom line is that it wasnt even worth it at that point They were denying that it was a problem right up until they started the offer to fix them,m86ffgf,6.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86tyje,Decent_Commercial381,,0,2025-01-20 17:09:36,,,,The problem is you had to get them replaced twice and the likely scenario is they will start drifting again anyway You just gonna mail them back and forth forever,m86mbif,8.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m87v17x,Unknwn_Ent,,1,2025-01-20 19:55:38,,,,Made worse by the fact you also werent guaranteed the same joycons back So you could send in rarelimited edition joycons all to get back a basic set of blue and red thatd still have the same issue after some play time Its why I never sent mine in cause I bought the animal crossing edition SPECIFICALLY for the colors of the joycons so I just learned to repair em Which is shitty cause now their design flaw was coming directly out of my pocket even more so The only benefit is you can replace OG joycon joysticks with hall effect sensors So if you dont mind the cost you coulda had this functionality a while ago,m85v8y8,4.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m85vwhp,Revolutionary--man,,20,2025-01-20 14:21:46,,,,Nintendo decided it was cheaper to fix Joycons for free as compensation and live with the problem than it was to invest in the RD needed to fix the actual problem to begin with I imagine the arithmetic changed on this when planning for the Switch 2 if theyre making the claim this headline suggests but i still doubt it,m85ujnu,3.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m86tdjh,staatsclaas,,4,2025-01-20 17:06:55,,,,This is the only way they could avoid doing a complete recall and replacement of every single joycon produced Im fairly confident they want to avoid the issue entirely this time around,m85vwhp,4.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m87zzqp,Calophon,,1,2025-01-20 20:18:29,,,,Whats wild to me is that even if your joycon is out of warranty they will fix it if you mail it in and the toggle sticks are easy to replace yourself due to the ribbon connectors By contrast my Xbox controller got even worse stick drift than I have ever experienced with a switch joycon and Xbox refused to service it Just flat out said no When I called customer service they basically told me to get fucked and take it to a repair shop Fixing an Xbox controller is not as easy because the toggles are soldered on,m85u011,2.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86xwud,Dhiox,,15,2025-01-20 17:27:38,,,,Yeah no thats simply made up Nintendo spent thousands if not millions on shipping and repairs for joycons with drift They paid for the whole process to get a joycon repaired no questions asked On top of that they faced reputational damage regarding build quality due to this defect On top of that Nintendo is historically extremely prideful to a ridiculous degree Their devs legit got angry with Reggie when he told them they should package wii sports for free with the wii instead of selling it separately because the devs saw it as an insult to their work Theres no way a company as prideful as Nintendo would introduce an intentional defect into their hardware,m86x0s4,3.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m87ojg7,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2025-01-20 19:26:18,,,,The reason none of the consoles make their controllers with hall effect sticks is because they want you to get stick drift and buy a new one This is actually completely false and made up because there is a totally different reason all the console manufacturers use potentiometers instead its that potentiometers can vary and degrade in quality meanwhile Hall sensors break all at once if something is wrong So when anticipating across shippings dozens of millions of units with potentiometers there is very low chance someone opens up their new Xbox and finds the controller has no analogue input Whereas many players might just never even notice with a slightly shitty potentiometer analogue,m86x0s4,3.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m88020q,PowerScreamingASMR,,1,2025-01-20 20:18:47,,,,Unless you have a credible source for any of this you also just made it up And frankly I dont buy this reasoning because faulty hardware can and will happen if youre shipping millions of units no matter what kind of sticks you have Do you have a source that would verify your claim that hall effect sticks are more prone to being faulty on arrival And if companies are only considering hardware condition on arrival then it doesnt exactly refute my comment that companies are intentionally using shitty hardware that will break after some time Planned obsolescence is rampant across all tech There is no reason to assume consoles are exempt from this,m87ojg7,4.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m88d7wr,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2025-01-20 21:17:19,,,,There seems to be some miscommunication I am not saying Hall Effect Sticks are more prone than potentiometers to be faulty on arrival I am saying Hall effect sticks go from tracking fine to notracking in one go They dont degrade over time or perform slightly poorly like pots can they function fine until they fail all at once Since they are not a magic defect free technology that never fails there will always be some defect rate Same as with pots Probably across millions of units there will be some thousands of defective units which do inevitably end up going out across either type of stick But on potentiometer sticks most people who do receive a defective one will never notice they didnt get a perfect analogue stick vs they will notice if the analogue stick is nonfunctional vs on Hall Effect sticks the people with defective sticks actually will notice because they will have zero tracking Thats why pots were the better choice for the scale that consoles and their pack in controllers are moving on,m88020q,5.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m88m8dn,PowerScreamingASMR,,1,2025-01-20 21:57:19,,,,I really dont understand what point you are trying to make here What does it matter that many people wont notice their potentiometer sticks arent perfect Is the argument youre going for that they are minimising the amount of refunded controllers by using potentiometer sticks Thats not mutually exclusive with planned obsolescence The fact is that potentiometer sticks degrade over time and are known to develop stick drift whereas hall effect sticks dont If their goal was to deliver a durable product they would use hall effect,m88d7wr,6.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m89aaj6,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2025-01-20 23:55:47,,,,Idk why you are so heated Im just saying the real reason all console manufacturers have made this choice in the past for their main controller is because potentiometers have a gradual more acceptable failure mode for a large rollout It has nothing to do with wanting people to buy more controllers because their previous onee analogue stick degraded lol,m88m8dn,7.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m8avre3,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-01-21 05:19:55,,,,Nah they have been produced economically for well over a decade plenty of time to have switched but they havent because the failure mode is different and the consumer experience is very different when conceivably little Timmy can play his Christmas PS5 for years not realizing he has an underperforming pot analogue stick whereas he would be real mad right away if his HE stick is completely nonfunctional Its certainly not because they want you to buy another one,m8atd9y,9.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m8bamlv,PowerScreamingASMR,,1,2025-01-21 07:25:33,,,,Im not heated at all Im just trying to understand where youre coming from It has nothing to do with wanting people to buy more controllers because their previous onee analogue stick degraded lol I just dont know how you can claim that so confidently How could you possibly know that potentiometers have a gradual more acceptable failure mode for a large rollout This is kind of assuming both of them fail at similar rates isnt it Again how do you know that And if nintendo can opt for hall effect sticks then clearly it shows that these arent unsuitable for large scale rollouts,m89aaj6,8.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m8gfwno,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-01-22 01:11:08,,,,I just dont know how you can claim that so confidently How could you possibly know that It is just a hilariously contrived explanation for all companies supposedly undermining their own products in tandem when the obviously straightforward explanation for why they all do it is readily available Eg if that was their priority why would Nintendo switch to pun intended Hall Effect sticks as per these rumors They just decide to stop making phat bank on selling new controllers because the bad PR was hurting the Switch the best selling system so much or it was too legally risky This is kind of assuming both of them fail at similar rates isnt it Again how do you know that The industry standard for electronics is around 25 across the board the reason has nothing to do withinherent robustness of the technologies involved always happens to be the same by chance or that its impossible to ship eg potentiometer sticks with near 0 failure its because that is an efficient threshold items commonly converge to due to the way batch testing is conducted statistically it becomes more expensive with more and more complex items down the chain where these error rates compound and design margins get smaller Due to supply chain complexity process variationsyield rates almost never being 100 basic scale QA testing strategy and engineering markups at every step this is just a general effective threshold most items converge to for mass manufacturing Fun side point this kind of QA thresholding is also the exact reason behind the 1000 milspec screwdriver meme And if nintendo can opt for hall effect sticks then clearly it shows that these arent unsuitable for large scale rollouts I was only discussing why it has been the case so far we dont even know for sure if Nintendo is using HE sticks let alone what might have changed their mind on that eg maybe they decided that spending more money on HE sticks more WA is worth it because the PR hit really is worth it anyway since there are no counterbalancing benefits of selling a bunch of pot sticks controllers on degrading pot controllers being considered Lol,m8bamlv,9.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m868peb,goodnames679,,78,2025-01-20 15:29:43,,,,Correct but I think theyre implying that hopefully the major console manufacturers will all adopt halleffect sticks in the near future This would be the first official controller for a major console to use Hall Effect since the Dreamcast and the Saturn before it Sony did have some pretty advanced controllers in the PS3 era that used MRTMR but they scrapped it for the dualpurpose of lowering cost and maintaining controller sales,m85um0o,2.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m8f91e5,alidan,,1,2025-01-21 21:36:57,,,,its less soldering skill that you would need and just how much of a pain in the ass it would be to put back together I did a mod for my little brother a while back where I took a ruined controller and refurbed it with a different shell and leds getting the thing to go back together was painful even with some of the thinnest wires I ever used at the time and I know that playstation was even worth with how compact everything is and I can only imagine its gotten worse over the years just looked up what would need to be done it seems like while its an upgrade its one of those things thats not worth doing unless you have a bad controller easy enough to replace the old one with the new I personally have experience with surface mount and microchip soldering but this looks FAR more accessible than most of the smaller crap I did as long as you have a steady hand and know how to tell a good solder joint from a bad it should be easily doable make sure you have some flux if you do it dont rely on flux in the solder itself that crap almost never works,m8d3qx8,6.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m85u35e,danielv123,,60,2025-01-20 14:11:03,,,,Funny how that works I know a company that ships joysticks to oil rigs Their new models has a lot larger deadzone in the center position than the old potentiometer based ones Turns out they use 2 hall effect sensors on each axis with one end of the sensor in the middle position meaning the sensor gives out 0v when its close to the center So apparently it is possible to screw up hall effect joysticks too,m85rrsm,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m8ac3je,dunno0019,,2,2025-01-21 03:15:51,,,,Well in all that shopping Ive only actually bought 2 And 1 wasnt even hall effect lol But mostly because I didnt know about HE and I just really needed something smaller than a ds4 That was the 8bitdo Lite 2 It is a really great little troller And I am highly impressed with everything 8bitdo And Ive been kicking myself ever since because there are a few of their models that are were only like 5 more with HE but I got stuck on wanting smaller Meanwhile I only got my Gamesir X2s like a week ago This thing is pretty impressive so far If you are looking for a discount Backbone this thing is great Half the price of a Backbone wHE joysticks and triggers And the only reason I got the X2s was because the 8bitdo Backbonestyle troller is for some reason only for Android so far I really like 8bitdo products lol IVe heard great things about their SN30 Pro 2 and Ultimate lines of trollers Just gotta make sure you grab a hall effect version when you are shopping They have a lot of very similar models that each have their own little differences,m8a9zbx,3.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m8by68t,ChocoJesus,,2,2025-01-21 11:22:44,,,,I just got a magres TMR controller yesterday Gamesir Cyclone 2 TMR is supposed to be more precise and less perceptible to stick drift then Hall effect I was considering a Scuf or Xbox elite but they all had Hall effect Across the board stick drift after 12 years seems like a regular problem with every controller Im still putting the controller through its paces but getting a magres TMR controller over Hall effect seemed worth trying Like it so far but a time well time situation Only seen TMR sticks in Chinese controllers so far but hopefully if they are better well see them more soon,m8a9zbx,3.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m88z8hd,Nozinger,,1,2025-01-20 22:58:41,,,,So the way this works is that all sticks generate bad readings over time What changed was not our sticks getting worse and all of that but the other way round out sticks got more precise Deadzones shrank and even miniscule movements are picked up by modern sticks without any issue On older systems you might have to move the stick a lot more for the same change The problem with higher precision is that if you get a bad reading that is also picked up more easily That is where the stickdrift issue comes from Theoretically you can solve that in software enough to at least make these issues manageable but for some reason the industry decided to dumb down the controller interface so hard that at most you get a sensitivity slider Peopel see these controllers as plug and play hardware you just put in and they have to work without settng up maintenance or anyy customisation but that is jsut not how precision hardware works You sometimes need to set new parameters so that the hardware keeps working perfectly Its not difficult to include a short sticks setup guide in your system software We had that Not even that long ago i think i saw something like that on the xbox one Nowadays on the ps5 you can decide how bright the light on the controller is,m85s4u1,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86dqln,RedTalon19,,26,2025-01-20 15:54:07,,,,This is not a Nintendo specific issue Its a cheap joystick issue thats easily avoidable by using Hall Effect style joysticks Normal joysticks work by having 2 physical pieces touch each other and over time the friction will wear them down and eventually the joystick inputs will become less precise and may even produce erratic inputs unintended by the user This decrease in accuracy and reliability is dubbed joystick drift stick drift or simply drift The Hall Effect was discovered by a physicist named Hall who proved that a conductor placed between 2 magnets will produce an electrical current The important fact here is that none of these components need to touch each other in order to work Joysticks based on this Hall Effect technology suffer no stick drift because there is nothing to wear down The only downside They are more expensive to make and I believe slightly heavier but that is very marginal at most Dont quote me on this,m8640bz,1.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m86asqz,jstnryan,,9,2025-01-20 15:39:57,,,,Drift is when a joystick doesnt selfcenter or causes ingame movement when not touched Hall Effect is a physical property used in electronic sensors where a magnet causes an electric field in a sensor that is used to determine the position of the magnet,m8640bz,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86l5vz,Nobody_1707,,1,2025-01-20 16:29:02,,,,Joysticks that dont use hall effect sensors naturally have wear and tear due to friction which eventually causes drift or quickly causes drift in the case of JoyCons As no piece ever touches another using a Hall effect sensor there is no friction and the stick will continue to work driftfree indefinitely,m86i0n0,3.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m86mdz3,jstnryan,,1,2025-01-20 16:34:44,,,,I am not completely knowledgeable about Switchspecifics on this but its clear that the original JoyCon used a different type of sensor that was possibly prone to interference by dirt for example or that degraded in performance quickly Hall Effect sensors on the other hand are an old tried and tested technology that are really only susceptible to magnetic interference high levels or at very close range or physical interference if something breaks or gets misaligned Hall Effect is commonly used in industrial machines and robotic equipment think anywhere a servo motor exists to track or index center motor movements Magnets attached to moving parts on a wheel gear or belt are used as reference points which are used to calculate distance angle or to calibrate center as they pass over or by the Hall sensor In the case of the new Switch Im imagining that there are one or two at 90 to each other magnets attached to the bottom of the joystick and two or four for error correction or redundancy Hall sensors very close to those magnets to detect the position of the joystick The magnets induce a varying electrical field in the sensor as they move near it so in this way as the joystick is moved around the position can be calculated by combining the X and Yoffsets,m86i0n0,3.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m89fihf,jwrice,,1,2025-01-21 00:23:14,,,,Its simple for me If the sticks still suffer from the same stick drift problems then I will not buy any more Nintendo consoles Same goes for Sony and their future consoles Were supposed to be buying games and not having to replace our controllers every year because theyre defective and not built to last Never had issues with my PS1 or PS2 controllers,,0.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m8cefgy,Thedarkb,,2,2025-01-21 13:25:55,,,,The PS1 and PS2 both filter out drift with software if you hold a stick in a direction while you boot up the system itll cause drift until you reset because the algorithm will think that the position you started it in is zero,m89fihf,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m8fcjsu,madmofo145,,1,2025-01-21 21:52:45,,,,Id say maybe My general guess is that the Switch 2 will have gone through a more vigorous round of QA then the Switch did which Im sure Nintendo wanted on the market ASAP I doubt we see issues like the nearly forgotten launch era Joycon range issue fixed by adding some non conductive foam,m85wm7g,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m86fjul,hanlonmj,,2,2025-01-20 16:02:39,,,,Stick drift is not due to weakening springs Its due to the potentiometers wearing each other down with use Most drifting sticks likely still have perfectly good springs,m85verf,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m866bc2,alexthegreat63,,4,2025-01-20 15:17:57,,,,I think there are two different types of drift the drift from the sticks physically getting stuckthe springs not returning the stick to the center and then theres drift from the sensors failing,m85xblc,1.0,1i5qkmv

comment,m85tg7v,Suprehombre,,17,2025-01-20 14:07:12,,,,Going strictly off the images which were both doing that single plug is not how its connected to the body It looks like the surrounding color plastic is what actually locks it in,m85ssmg,1.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m85uhcc,Sylvurphlame,,3,2025-01-20 14:13:24,,,,I agree The images Ive seen of the Switch 2 in handheld mode dont show that colored top So that implies its completely within the frame of the body That should be reasonably resistant to torque Im just curious as to why the connection isnt a USBC form factor which would make the connector tab itself more secure in general I presume either magnets or locking tabs hold the Joy Con in place when its attached to the body,m85tg7v,2.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m85vnog,Suprehombre,,3,2025-01-20 14:20:19,,,,They probably created their own port for two reasons First is probably a speed thing Charging and reporting The second would be to restrict third party production Youd have to get the license from Nintendo to produce a controller Theyd have it patented to restrict any unauthorized reproductions,m85uhcc,3.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m85wzwk,Sylvurphlame,,3,2025-01-20 14:28:03,,,,Speed and charging could be more than handled by even the minimum USBCUSB2 specs You do have a point about licensing and unauthorized accessories,m85vnog,4.0,1i5qkmv
comment,m8ea3ii,Suprehombre,,1,2025-01-21 18:58:45,,,,The speed probably isnt the biggest factor but propriety definitely is Microsoft and Sony use a closed system with their wireless which they both use Bluetooth now but have it restricted,m85wzwk,5.0,1i5qkmv
