comment,m4dj5mv,justenf99,,-15,2024-12-29 16:48:14,,,,Because the government should not be dictating what a business offers in its products Its a disgusting abuse of power As well its totally unnecessary because you can easily get inexpensive adapters that let you use usbc cables with iPhones I predict that this will also stifle the innovation and adoption of newer and better technology as every advance will require government action to allow its use,m4caj9q,1.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4dpwu3,snajk138,,18,2024-12-29 17:23:28,,,,Sure like our standardized outlets stifled innovation or what Do you remember how it was before the EU made USB mandatory When each manufacturer had its own charging cable standard that they also changed every year so you had to get new cables for every new phone That was the solution the market proposed keep throwing away working things so that they could be payed more Keep sucking the corporate dicks all you want but I am happy we the people and the government keep them in check,m4dj5mv,2.0,1hnfal0

comment,m4jnnzs,audigex,,1,2024-12-30 16:48:54,,,,If anything I do this MORE now than a few years ago On my desk in front of me are a DAC for my headphones and an 8bitdo Ultimate controller in its dock Both use USBC for both powercharging and data the controllers dock communicates with the controller via 24GHz and back to the PC using USBC Its true that most of the time I just need power but its definitely not unheard of to use USBC for data transfer too,m4bocah,3.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4l8eub,lolercoptercrash,,1,2024-12-30 21:38:20,,,,But you have that on your desk at all times You are not gonna be surprised by the need for a data cable very often That DAC probably came with the data cable you need and you will use the cable after you throw the DAC away I almost never need to carry a data USBC to USBC cable with me I still dont hear many examples where people do Im not saying at home you wont use USB C for data im saying people will almost never find themselves in a situation where they need a USB C data cable typically when you are traveling and they only have power,m4jnnzs,4.0,1hnfal0
comment,m44shtf,sylfy,,0,2024-12-28 02:24:00,,,,The USB PD part looks like a step in the right direction but this makes no mention about the mess of standards that USB is the whole bunch of cables with different capabilities and data transfer speeds At the end of the day it looks like a poorly thought through topdown implementation,m43mjpf,1.0,1hnfal0
comment,m46jgfa,Kyrond,,6,2024-12-28 11:53:49,,,,This is just about charging My BT headphones razer and powerbank dont need to talk to each other just receivegive power The other mess is only caused by USB IF and manufacturers,m44shtf,2.0,1hnfal0
comment,m47s9mx,danielv123,,1,2024-12-28 17:05:35,,,,There is one thing Id like defined in the charging standard If I plug my laptop into a laptop what happens A C the laptop with the C port charges C C Who knows It comes up quite a bit for example I was on a trip and wanted to charge my flashlight from a portable power station Flashlight decided to start charging the power station instead,m46jgfa,3.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4jnz64,audigex,,1,2024-12-30 16:50:29,,,,That flashlight presumably functions as a power bank It should offer you the option to charge or discharge either through two different ports like my power banks all have or some sort of control The fact it doesnt is a fault of your power bank,m47s9mx,4.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4jr8di,danielv123,,1,2024-12-30 17:07:08,,,,Doesnt fix the issue My phone only had one port so a dedicated discharge port doesnt make sense My laptop allows charging on all ports which is nice but leaves it ambiguous when it will allow discharging from those same ports,m4jnz64,5.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4jrtuv,audigex,,1,2024-12-30 17:10:13,,,,Really that should be part of the device settings and firmwaresoftware its not something USB should be negotiating because theres no way to programmatically detect it Youd have the same problem whatever type of cable and port you used because fundamentally its a decision for the user to make So I dont think thats a USBC issue thats just the manufacturers of the devices not giving the user enough control over their functionality,m4jr8di,6.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4jse3a,danielv123,,1,2024-12-30 17:13:05,,,,The device settings and firmwaresoftware are designed after the USB specification I think the USB specification should specify how to handle this,m4jrtuv,7.0,1hnfal0
comment,m4jzzsa,audigex,,1,2024-12-30 17:52:01,,,,That doesnt make sense because its not something that can be negotiated unless it was a simple case of the device with more power sending power to the one with less The spec tells you how they should electrically negotiate not how they decide which sends power A phone laptop and power bank all function very differently so they cant all use the same software option or button or whatever so how do you specify that Or to flip this around a moment how would you specify it The only thing Id perhaps say is that the specification should include some kind of if the device is capable of both sending and receiving power the device must provide a function for the user to toggle whether the device is configured to send or receive power Auto is permitted in which case the device will respect the request from the other end or if both are on auto then the device with more charge will send power to the other But you cant specify details beyond that and individual manufacturers could include it now but dont bother And either way its not something specific to USBC nor does anyone else do it better,m4jse3a,8.0,1hnfal0

comment,m49batu,DrKersh,,7,2024-12-28 22:06:35,,,,best thing I did last year was to buy some decent cables for everything I could have connected at the same time and dont even bother to remove the clip from any new one I got with anything I purchase Every cable is rated for pd 31 240w or 40gbps and call it a day for at least the next 5 years probably 8,,0.0,1hnfal0

comment,m4cwxi5,Krimsonrain,,3,2024-12-29 14:40:36,,,,I just buy a quality cable that says it is rated for the functions I need it for I have literally never had an issue with a USB c cable not doing what I need it to The free ones that come with cheap rechargeable devices are obviously only going to charge the device Youre making this way more complicated than it needs to be and seem like you just want to complain If you really want to grandstand about e waste start researching disposable vapes and how much lithium plastic and pcbs gets thrown away into trash cans each day,m4cw97t,3.0,1hnfal0

comment,m4jpi4d,audigex,,2,2024-12-30 16:58:13,,,,Even as an iPhone user and lover Ive still got my iPhone 3GS in a drawer I still think USBC is the better standard than Lightning it allows for far more power and much higher data rates Within arms reach of me are my USBC iPhone 15 2023 and my USBC Airpods 4 2024 On the same desk are my lightning iPad Air 2015 and my old Airpods 2018 which I used until last week USBC is way better They can charge faster and the devices can charge each other which is SO useful Eg I forgot to charge my Airpods but could just charge them from my phone I can charge my fiancees phone from my phone when she had signal and I didnt but she had no battery left I love my iPhone I love my Airpods I love my iPad I love my MacBook and my Mac Mini So I sure as shit dont hate Apple but I still think USBC is better,m48iswr,3.0,1hnfal0
