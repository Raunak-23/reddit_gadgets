comment,n0krhaq,kinisonkhan,,3,2025-06-30 13:46:08,,,,And when 50006000 mAh solid state batteries start showing up for smart phones Apple will shrink the battery 3500 to make the phone thinner,n0khqzy,1.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0kpcvu,PitchforkSquints,,6,2025-06-30 13:34:24,,,,I really dont see the point Glasses maybe The current crop of AR glasses still look like they came out of a halloween nerd costume but theyre kind of getting there More VR strapon goggles though People are done with these and they barely ever started being into them The videos of weirdos on the subway doing cringe minority report hand motions in their vision pros was the nail in the coffin It was a cool gimmick 8 years ago but the novelty of beat saber and stereoscopic porn only lasts so long Im sure VRchat still has a small but dedicated and probably very crusty community of NEETs but its all too cumbersome and finicky for average people We still dont even have reliable insideout body tracking At this point I dont see anything short of a sciencefiction full dive technology exciting people about VR again AR smart glasses have much more promise assuming miniaturization of the tech continues to where they dont look so goofy,,0.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0ky35t,DarthBuzzard,,3,2025-06-30 14:20:39,,,,At this point I dont see anything short of a sciencefiction full dive technology exciting people about VR again Id disagree VR has many massive breakthrough advancements left A high resolution slim visor or curved sunglasses device without side effects that offers photorealistic social telepresence will feel radically different to the VR of today and it would be in a convenient package that people could wear for hours on end without discomfort It was a cool gimmick 8 years ago 8 years is a small amount of time in the hardware industry The novelty of hyperrealistic VR HMDs basically wont wear off because it will be too realistic for that to occur,n0kpcvu,1.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0ldr2c,PitchforkSquints,,3,2025-06-30 15:37:44,,,,The novelty of hyperrealistic VR HMDs basically wont wear off because it will be too realistic for that to occur What youre describing would be a long ways off based on our current tech and understanding of thermodynamics Even then more realistic visuals cant fix the inherent issues that come with having a screen strapped to your face freedom of movement proprioception motion sickness eye strain etc On that kind of time scale my money is on braincomputer interface development where we ditch external optics entirely We already have paralyzed people controlling video games with a brain implant so were on the road,n0ky35t,2.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0lf60g,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-06-30 15:44:38,,,,Having an allday battery life in a near glasses form factor is the hard part that we dont really know how to deal with right now However simply getting a small form factor with photorealistic visuals is not only something we have line of sight to but its not even far off Apple Vision Pro is almost there with photorealistic avatars and the fullbody versions seem very attainable over the next 10 years Quest 3 has some cloud rendered gaussian splat environments They are completely photorealistic Just the other week some major advances in volumetric video were made Meta are planning to launch a Vision Protype device next year at a cheaper price with 15th the weight of a Quest 3 said to look like oversized glasses rather than a headset Eye strain is solvable in the somewhat near term with variable focus optics Combined with latency improvements and dynamic distortion correction nausea will completely disappear from VR usage other than when you have the movement disconnect Movement isnt really possible to solve in a perfect way without a brain interface or at least without something like galvanic vestibular stimulation Ill give you that but its not really needed for VR to be valuable On that kind of time scale my money is on braincomputer interface development where we ditch external optics entirely We already have paralyzed people controlling video games with a brain implant so were on the road Writing to the brain is a totally different ballgame In order for a brain interface to take over the role of VR HMDs it needs to be capable of safely writing photorealistic multisensory data into the brain generalized across the population Thats so far off certainly multiple decades at least,n0ldr2c,3.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0lociu,PitchforkSquints,,2,2025-06-30 16:28:41,,,,That video is really cool Combined with latency improvements and dynamic distortion correction nausea will completely disappear from VR usage other than when you have the movement disconnect Isnt the movement part pretty critical though Im sure very few people get motion sick in VR when their POV is static but how much useful content is that way Latency might help but its that sensory disconnect moving visually yet standing still that brings on the nausea Most people I know get immediately dizzy when I let them try any game that uses smooth rotation instead of snap turn POV Hell I still get kinda dizzy While I do agree with your points about a braincomputer interface being way far off I still think AR is closer to mass adoption in a few years than VR ever will be at least for individual consumers While the HMD tech does appear to be improving a bunch of those currently intractable factors need to align A light portable unobtrusive yet immersive realistic display that has a battery life of more than an hour or two for a price that normal people are willing to pay Hopefully I eat my words in a few years when we get a breakthrough in wireless energy transmission or solid state battery tech,n0lf60g,4.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0lzndp,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-06-30 17:21:34,,,,but how much useful content is that way The majority of VRs usecases and content wont really care much about moving realistically throughout a world It would always be better if you could do it but the lack of it doesnt mean it cant be a valuable medium for the masses You never want to move around if youre using VR as a computing or stationary media consumption device You dont need to move around much in a sports stadium concert or comedy club All the social usecases of VR would show serious value even if teleportation is used because youre still getting the feeling of being face to face with your friends Its mostly gaming that cares about moving fast throughout virtual worlds Gaming will be a major part of VR but I dont think it will be the main attraction I still think AR is closer to mass adoption in a few years than VR ever will be at least for individual consumers How though Seethrough AR glasses involve a substantially harder set of engineering problems Take a look at Metas 20K30K estimated production cost Orion AR glasses prototype A technical marvel no doubt but lets compare them to a 300 VR headset 40 less field of view somewhere around 720x540 per eye versus roughly 2Kx2K per eye for a 300 VR headset worse tracking quality 10x less processing power not bright enough to work outside and virtual objects cannot be opaque The way I like to look at this is VR will be the cheap high quality stationary device for the home like a PC AR will be the expensive low quality mobile device for the outdoors like a highend smartphone The hurdles for AR glasses are so high that it will take many years before the market can shift high tens of millions of units Even if we ignore all the quality concerns just getting the glasses into mass production and getting people to spend 10001500 on them will take quite a while,n0lociu,5.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0qw387,PitchforkSquints,,3,2025-07-01 12:22:32,,,,You make a lot of good points as far as entertainment and media consumption go For sure AR has difficult problems to solve as does VR but I dont think it has to be even 50 as good on performance as VR to see huge proliferation The thing is I think weve been talking about slightly different things Im not concerned about which tech is more promising for visual fidelity or performance but which one consumers will actually be motivated to purchase I dont think consumption of multimedia is even a factor in considering AR to be the winner here You say VR will be a cheap stationary device for the home like a PC but how many people even have a stationary home PC today It would have to be seriously cheap and much more compelling than it is now to supplant the TV which already sits on that throne Smartphones though everyone has How you make the smartphone better is by making it invisible Thats why wearables like smartwatches have proliferated See my post to another commenter for my whole take on where I think AR is going here if you care Even if the quality is crappy compared to VR all they have to do is miniaturize The bottleneck will absolutely be battery technology but make them nigh indistinguishable from regular glasses and thats a wrap for civilization,n0lzndp,6.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0r6qdj,DarthBuzzard,,0,2025-07-01 13:25:36,,,,While its true that home computers have declined a lot since their heyday they are still a mass market industry serving hundreds of millions of users I think VR can fit into that category and also that of tablets and laptops too since you could take it to other stationary locations like a hotel or coffee shop AR I expect will have multiple billions of users so yeah it will be more popular but thats also going to take a very long time to occur Remember that manufacturing general purpose AR glasses is going to be a tall order and they will be very expensive for years So I dont see how its possible for AR to leapfrog the VR market and be the first to mass adoption What I see happening is VRMR gets there first and settles into a hundreds of millions level market Then AR gets to that point too and eventually it goes well beyond that into multi billions I really dont think VR headsets will become a household item in 2030 years like the TV is now I can imagine VR at that time going beyond a billion users maybe not multi billions but north of a billion and I think its because the allure will just be so great at that point 2030 years from now were talking about technology well beyond even Ready Player One Every second in VR would feel utterly hyperrealistic making it something real close to an experience machine,n0qw387,7.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0mc229,Sirisian,,1,2025-06-30 18:18:39,,,,What youre describing would be a long ways off based on our current tech and understanding of thermodynamics Even then more realistic visuals cant fix the inherent issues that come with having a screen strapped to your face freedom of movement proprioception motion sickness eye strain etc Current timelines are 2040s Apple was about to change that timeline by building their own MicroLED production but they backed out a year ago Dual 16K240Hz with event camera eye tracking should have no motion sickness Ive mentioned before but Apple and Meta are largely brand building for these future glasses Creating devkits and building the OS and ecosystem to capture the transition All the big companies are keeping pace at the moment until the hardware is ready There are other missing pieces including the computing so its not like any company can really get that far ahead right now,n0ldr2c,3.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0mwbq2,Shapes_in_Clouds,,1,2025-06-30 19:57:20,,,,AR glasses and VR headsets are ultimately almost identical technologies at their core the biggest difference being the opticaldisplay stack And this is such a massive obstacle and limiting factor for AR glasses The Orion demo Meta showed off as their aspirational in ten years consumer product was not something I think the vast majority of people will spend on It does things smartphones already do today but worse Why would anyone choose to watch a low res transparent video with poor color saturation on their glasses over the rich high res images of OLEDs on their smartphone The VR headset form factor at least also offers compelling immersive experiences that arent possible on any other device and there is a reasonably attainable path to miniaturizing the hardware enough to make it comfortable and also achieve the high levels of display fidelity people are used to To me the VR headset form factor we see in the Apple VisionMeta Quest has the best chance of success Both passthrough AR and fully immersive VR capable Get it down to size comparable to Big Screen Beyond under 200 grams offload compute and battery with optional black out gaskets similar to what the Quest Pro had Not something people will wear all the time but a reasonably useful device for home use and portability That all said I do agree in general that this entire product category is fighting an uphill battle to capture market share in a world where people are approaching devicecontent fatigue Its arguable whether ARVR is truly needed or desired The right feature mix use cases and price point will continue to be elusive,n0kpcvu,1.0,1lo6drf
comment,n0qt1vz,PitchforkSquints,,1,2025-07-01 12:02:25,,,,Why would anyone choose to watch a low res transparent video with poor color saturation on their glasses over the rich high res images of OLEDs on their smartphone I think the actual potential of AR goes way beyond just consuming multimedia If theyre eventually able to shrink AR glasses frames to where they just look like sunglasses I imagine theyd be at least as prolific as smartwatches are now It would be a lifestyle product a tool Ignoring the black mirror surveillance state consequences youd have a high definition camera capable of recording photovideo attached to your natural POV You dont have to think about pointing it at your subject you just look That alone would be huge to reduce the wall of phones effect you see at shows and public spectacles You could overlay google maps on your vision while navigating a new city which could highlight POI or a planned route like you have a video game nav marker You could use an AI assistant to catalog and remember people youve met including names and pertinent information including social media profiles Facial recognition and analysis to give you information on their potential mood disposition towards you detect lyingdeceptioncontradictions reading social cues for those who might need it Record conversations and transcribe into notes Nobody forgets anything anymore if they dont want to Having something like google lens constantly available to give you information on literally any object youre looking at Plants animals instant price comparisons while shopping calorie readouts for food translating text or audio Imagine the applications for ballistics and not just guns but stuff like sports You could get live shot tracing or predictions for ball flight bounce trajectory wind speed visualization You would have to ban them at billiards halls for sure I can think of a million more A lot of this is stuff is technology available today but seamlessly integrating it into a package you could just have on your face seeing everything without everyone knowing youre doing it by having to point your phone at it would absolutely change the world and probably for the worse Technology like this would be abused be it by governments corporations or just regular people Intentionally or unintentionally it would probably make our social lives worse People would absolutely come to rely on it like we do phones If we think things are dystopian now imagine when everyone has an alwayson camera attached to their head walking around reading everyones face and internet presence That was a long way to say Im not concerned about which tech is more impressive but more about which I believe the population at large has a higher chance of adopting I really dont think VR headsets will become a household item in 2030 years like the TV is now The TV is still undefeated for nearly 100 years and thats because you dont have to buy one for each person who wants to view it No matter how light or thin an HMD gets its still a strange looking thing on your face meaning it has little utility outside the home Tons of people dont even have home computers anymore why would they want TV goggles that only one person can watch and they wouldnt want to be seen wearing outside Im confident people would go crazy for something that looks more natural and discreet even if it only does 75 of what the better tech does Thats why smartwatches arent the size of pipboys You could definitely do a lot more with a giant wristband bracer thing but nobody would buy that Its doing too much Instead you have smartwatches that more or less look like watches They dont stick out but they add perceived value Thats why I think AR is our eventual awful future if they can work out the form factor,n0mwbq2,2.0,1lo6drf

comment,n0kw10s,OIlberger,,1,2025-06-30 14:09:58,,,,I could see AR glasses being almost as big as smartphones its just a smartphone UI superimposed over the real world instead of tilting your head down to look at a device And its handsfree I think people will prefer that not that I think it will make society any better,n0kpcvu,1.0,1lo6drf
