comment,mw8zrek,h3rpad3rp,,1,2025-06-06 02:35:39,,,,Unfortunately as much as I like Apple for their stance on privacy I just cannot stand IOS Ive been using an Apple phone for work for like 6 years and I still hate every single moment that I have to use the thing as anything other than a phone Unfortunately Android was made by a personal data mining advertising company So it feels pretty bad to like Android more at this point But hey at least I can tell Samsung to go pound sand next time I need a phone,mw4tey3,1.0,1l3w0m7
comment,mw9av9e,None,,1,2025-06-06 03:45:50,,,,There are some privacy focused versions of android you can probably use I think most android phones let you install them I havent had an android in a long time but from what I remember only issue you run into is some apps like banking payment etc dont work with them Might be something you can look into,mw8zrek,2.0,1l3w0m7

comment,mw90uto,h3rpad3rp,,3,2025-06-06 02:42:27,,,,It is one thing for a free website to try and force its users to view ads It is quite another thing for a company to sell you a 1000 device and then push creepy ads that use your own likeness to try to manipulate you It is opt in for now but it is pretty unlikely to stay that way imo,mw6gqjv,1.0,1l3w0m7
