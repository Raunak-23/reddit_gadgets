comment,mij977a,spif,,7,2025-03-19 00:12:48,,,,Apple offered better discounts for libraries and schools back then The total cost of ownership was cheaper when taking that into account Most people didnt need software that only ran on Windows when using the library computer They needed a web browser and maybe Word Nowadays they only really need a web browser Except for libraries that offer classes in different kinds of software and have morebetter IT staff and budgets for that kind of thing,mij6fmf,4.0,1je7l0w
comment,mikjrjm,Eurynom0s,,1,2025-03-19 05:14:07,,,,This was also back in the days of Macs legitimately benefiting from security through obscurity so libraries and schools could put them out without having to worry about them immediately becoming ridden with malware,mij977a,5.0,1je7l0w
comment,mjpt0i7,min0nim,,1,2025-03-25 20:19:03,,,,Well yes but also OS8 and 9 were legitimately very secure for the time and implemented firewalls and other lock downs out of the box which made it easy for people to get a basic level of security Protected memory and separate userland space and all the other features we need and expect now were of course lacking But it just wasnt an easy target compared to the masses of Win98 and ME machines around,mikjrjm,6.0,1je7l0w
comment,mjq5zz9,Eurynom0s,,1,2025-03-25 21:22:29,,,,I mean Mac malware still generally not sure if its 100 but I think its still at least most of it requires the user to not be paying enough attention and affirmatively actually hit okay on something right And that its still not like the bad old days of Windows where your entire computer could get pwned just from going to a malicious website,mjpt0i7,7.0,1je7l0w

comment,mij7dex,Bamstradamus,,1,2025-03-19 00:02:30,,,,Very few institutions buy PCs that would be upgradeable and just sell them off when its time to upgrade An easy way to get your first gaming PC is find a university selling inventory to the public check and see if it has expansion slots and then stick a GPU in it Why pay your IT dept to upgrade a system instead of replace it with something new that has a warranty that your getting a discount on since your buying 40 at a time,mihkuit,2.0,1je7l0w

comment,mimhaye,zbubblez,,1,2025-03-19 14:30:30,,,,Was waiting for this answer and its true it has 2 buttons but they are not apparent or separated on the top profile of the mouse so it still feels like right clicking a track pad I dont count it as a true 2 button mouse since the top is 1 surface Also it charges from the bottom of the mouse hahaha,mil0ml1,3.0,1je7l0w
comment,mir7fnf,benanderson89,,0,2025-03-20 06:29:19,,,,If you can type on an abstract visual representation of a keyboard on a flat slab of glass then you can move your finger slightly to right of centre and push down to trigger the context menu All the functionality of this mouse makes my G502 feel antiquated for anything even remotely productive Charging it is fine Because the battery is actually good youre getting a month or months out of this thing and you can get yourself a days worth of charge on a piss break away from your desk Same argument with electric cars honestly just plug it in when youre asleep,mimhaye,4.0,1je7l0w

comment,miheerh,mBertin,,18,2025-03-18 18:41:20,,,,The iMac breathed new life into Apple when it was on life support the iPod and iTunes expanded their market reach and the iPhone turned them into a trilliondollar juggernaut Of course the early to mid 2000s Microsoft clusterfuck likely played a role but very few companies have reinvented themselves so many times and remained this successful,,0.0,1je7l0w
comment,miihkkc,DismalEconomics,,14,2025-03-18 21:47:54,,,,Im pretty confident that the iPod was obviously the product responsible for apples rebirth both financially and in popularity iPod introduced in 2001 by the end of 2003 iTunes was already the market leader for purchasing music Apples revenue from 1997 through 2003 was basically stagnating bouncing back n forth between 55 to 65 billion also during these years earnings were dismal to very thin 1997 negative 08 billion then 05B 06B 04 03 0035 02B for years 19982003 respectively In 2004 revenue 97 billion 2005 162 Billion 2006 207B 2007 265B 2008 348B In first quarter of 2007 iPods were still responsible for 50 of Apples revenue iPhone is introduced in 2008 so revenues continue to grow but iPod sales start declining and making up less and less of Apples total revenue It really becomes obvious when you look at earnings vs revenue also when you consider the first apple retail store in introduced 2001 is almost instantly successful and by 2011 its the 1 retail location in terms sales vs square footage etc etc I just dont feel like iMacs were moving the needle much at all before IPods really started bringing widespread attention to Apple again I think memories are a bit distorted because iMacs introduction were only 2 year prior to iPods so yes plenty of people purchased and remember iMacs but imho the popularity really didnt start ramping up until iPods started becoming popular,miheerh,1.0,1je7l0w
comment,mikvh6r,Axtvueiz,,3,2025-03-19 07:10:30,,,,The iMac was more of a direction thing it moved apple away from their focus on what seemed to be like commercial and businesses and recognised the gap in the consumer Apples goal with the iMac wasnt to market it to businesses and have every office in the world use mac but for regular every day people to have access to cutting edge technology like the internet but to do so in a way that looked cool and also was really easy to use and understand The iPod was a sales juggernaut and definitely pulled them out of the shitter but the iPod was an iMac accessory and part of the budding apple ecosystem that focuses on the average consumer its something apple still excels at today and why they cant be beaten,miihkkc,2.0,1je7l0w
comment,mijvz2z,Daigonik,,3,2025-03-19 02:23:28,,,,Youre right the first actual commercial hit of the Jobs era was the iPod While the iMac was successful it paled in comparison to the iPod simply because Macs in general were pretty niche back then and even today dont sell that much volume compared to other manufacturers What was important about the iMac was that it proved that Apple was going to be ok They went from launching flop after flop during most of the 90s to finally landing on a compelling and successful product that showcased a focused vision,miihkkc,2.0,1je7l0w
comment,mikkqsw,Eurynom0s,,2,2025-03-19 05:23:00,,,,the iPhone turned them into a trilliondollar juggernaut My favorite bit of iPhone trivia is Apple originally wanted to launch the iPhone on Verizon since Verizon far and away had the best US network in 2007 but Verizon was still in its glory days of wanting psychotic levels of control over any phone it allowed on its network so it wound up on ATT because ATT had the nextbest network and was willing to let Apple keep all of the control over the phone And remember this was before the App Store the original iPhone was launched assuming you only had the apps Apple gave you,miheerh,1.0,1je7l0w
