comment,m7lhh6k,JustCrazyIdeas,,10,2025-01-17 07:53:41,,,,You could link a news article to a gif of a streaming hot pile of shit and redditors would blindly up vote it without clicking on the link if the title makes you feel good reinforces a preconceived notion about something and the thumbnail backs its up At least this platform still has a down voting feature that in theory is a check against BS articles like this but m ore often than in the past theyre prevalence is making it challenging to stomp out shit content like this,m7hs642,1.0,1i2rgrk

comment,m7m0bxn,Germanofthebored,,2,2025-01-17 11:16:41,,,,I think you underestimate the impact of artificial light in the equatorial region In Uganda its roughly 12 hours year round That means without a light source you have to get all your work done between 6 am and 6 pm So you cant study after you have had dinner and you have to have dinner done right after you get home from school Even simple electrical lanterns lamp oil is an ongoing expense and not cheap can make a massive difference under these circumstances Plus the batteries can also charge cell phones which are becoming the internet for many people in the global South White LEDs with their high efficiency have become a massive help for these reasons and I am sure that this is why the guy who developed the blue LED a 10 cent part got the Nobel in physics the year after the Large hadron collider multi billion and an army of scientists got it for the Higgs boson,m7j2gxm,1.0,1i2rgrk

comment,m7rpwse,ReddFro,,1,2025-01-18 07:36:17,,,,Stuff like this is cool There ways you can get involved if you want to Weve done a yearly charity event near us where we and our kids assemble stuff for charities catnip purses for shelter cats care packages and dog blankets for the homeless etc There are also Kynd Kits that you can assemble with our kids Some are also care packages for the homeless but some were more like this like a solar charging station for a phone My wifes work Adobe buy them and even pay for each kit we build in money she can donate to a charity or non profit,,0.0,1i2rgrk
