comment,m3vl7bk,runningoutofnames01,,191,2024-12-26 14:21:07,,,,Bingo IIRC there is a bridge in California that has temporary barricades which are moved throughout the day to control traffic and Teslas auto pilot really struggled to notice that the barricades had changed the lanes Proper self driving cars will have to be able to deal with all the random shit that happens on the road and it will have to choose the best solution more often than humans,m3vkoqa,1.0,1hmols3

comment,m3zy900,DigitalPriest,,2,2024-12-27 06:44:22,,,,Its ultimately why I think its a pointless exercise We need to be treating transportation more like package shipping What I mean by that is instead of having 200 million cars on the road your major routes get buses and for longer or more static routes trains Buses travel between fixed points in highdensity areas and receive preferential routing and roads avoiding the requirement for novel problem solving Cars are relegated to your lastmile service getting you to the boonies or off the beaten path Unfortunately 100 years of automotive industry have poisoned Americans against the idea of mass transit,m3wh9tl,4.0,1hmols3

comment,m3w9n45,CocodaMonkey,,-11,2024-12-26 16:51:29,,,,You have that backwards Waymos are in San Francisco because its one of the easiest cities in the world for self driving cars Once they have them working there for a few years youll see them slowly expand to harder cities but San Francisco is likely to be one of the first cities world wide to have viable self driving cars,m3w1igm,2.0,1hmols3
comment,m3wm0k6,AWalkingOrdeal,,6,2024-12-26 18:00:24,,,,Waymos are in San Francisco because its one of the easiest cities in the world for self driving cars There are multiple errors in this 1 sentence 1 SF is the North American AV mecca because of local regulations allowing for urban real world AV testing A few years ago it was the only citycounty allowing this We now have other cities like Seattle Los Angeles Phoenix and even Atlanta over on the East Coast Regulations are easing due to positive results and other municipalities are joining in 2 The geography and urban density of SF one of the densest cities in NA allows for a plethora of extreme edge case testing IE Hilly streets lined with parked cars heavy foot traffic and dense fog Source Im testing AVs in SF and the surrounding area on a dailyweekly basis,m3w9n45,3.0,1hmols3
comment,m3wniv2,CocodaMonkey,,-2,2024-12-26 18:08:43,,,,You didnt dispute anything I said If you think San Francisco is a plethora of edge cases you need to travel more Every example you listed is pretty basic and happens to almost all cities on earth I didnt say San Francisco isnt a good spot to work on self driving cars You want to start on the easy places and get it working there because everything San Francisco can throw at a self driving car is something other cities also have,m3wm0k6,4.0,1hmols3

comment,m3yap7y,CocodaMonkey,,1,2024-12-26 23:45:57,,,,Im not in disagreement with the industry leaders Those companies know they are in the easy cities and thats why they are there Nice climate lots of customers Its the perfect spot for them to be developing these cars Theres a reason theres very little testing in winter cities so far Id even be willing to bet places like San Francisco will see people depending on self driving cars as their main source of transportation decades before people in more northern cities Were a long ways away from a viable self driving car that works everywhere but that doesnt mean some people cant start using them sooner,m3y0w8g,6.0,1hmols3
comment,m3y305v,LibatiousLlama,,2,2024-12-26 22:58:21,,,,So close to being correct Waymo went driverless in Tempe Arizona first because it is one of the easiest operational domains They are driverless in SF because its a better profit opportunity Higher usage of taxis is where they want to deploy a fleet to make some money,m3w9n45,3.0,1hmols3
comment,m3ybod9,CocodaMonkey,,-2,2024-12-26 23:51:59,,,,Im not even sure what you think youre correcting Did you confuse me saying San Francisco is an easy city and think I said easiest Because those are different statements San Francisco is easy in that it has the population the money and the climate for SDC development Its not the only city though and theres tons of other places that could work just as well,m3y305v,4.0,1hmols3
comment,m3ykfqm,LibatiousLlama,,1,2024-12-27 00:46:18,,,,Youre using easiest in a vague sense The challenge behind self driving isnt the business case it is the software performance and reliability So when you refer to SF as the easiest everybody is assuming your talking about difficulty of driving no viability of the business itself Nobody questions the viability of the business at this point Uber and taxis exist You dont launch in the best city for money making when you go driverless you go for the easiest to drive in,m3ybod9,5.0,1hmols3
comment,m3yn6vr,CocodaMonkey,,0,2024-12-27 01:03:13,,,,Im speaking of both Making the car work is far easier in SF then in a northern city We are still many years Id bet decades away from having reliable SDC in winter cities Where as places like SF have taxis you can use today but are still being closely watched and developed SF is one of the easiest cities in the world to teach a self driving car to drive in,m3ykfqm,6.0,1hmols3

comment,m3w7tsm,ca2mt,,11,2024-12-26 16:41:19,,,,Im not arguing one way or another but none of the scenarios you presented would be solved by lidar or ultrasonic sensors would they Im sure there are scenarios where using lidar as a failsafe would make FSD better but red light detection speed control and lane selection would likely be camera based even if there were other sensors,m3w4bsd,1.0,1hmols3
comment,m3wp2oe,BreakerSoultaker,,4,2024-12-26 18:17:18,,,,I suspect the slowing to speeds incompatible with surrounding traffic is caused by the cameras not being sure of what is directly in front of the car so it slows You are correct LIDARsonar wouldnt help with red lights,m3w7tsm,2.0,1hmols3

comment,m3y55x5,InterestedEarholes,,6,2024-12-26 23:11:43,,,,I think youre confusing LIDAR spinning lasers with RADAR sensors Very few cars have LIDAR as its still an expensive sensor but most have RADAR which is not a moving part and uses radio waves and is relatively cheap RADAR has its own drawbacks though Teslas used to come with both RADAR and ultrasonic sensors with the cameras,m3w4bsd,1.0,1hmols3
comment,m400a2f,isobethehen,,2,2024-12-27 07:04:08,,,,One thing that never gets mentioned when people complain about Tesla only using camera based full self driving is the wireless traffic that other sensors create If in the future every car were to have multiple lidar sonar radar sensors there would be so much lightultrasonicradio traffic the systems and protocols that would have to be implemented would be VERY costly innovative and standardized which is hard to do across the entire industry There are currently some rudimentary solutions like frequency hopping and time division multiplexing but that only goes so far at certain amounts of traffic Yes it would be great if Tesla added back a simple ultrasonic sensor for park assist but for autonomous driving I think it made a good forward looking decision Well see if it was the correct decision in the future,m3w4bsd,1.0,1hmols3

comment,m3vgmkw,chrisdh79,,-1,2024-12-26 13:47:07,,,,From the article Selfdriving vehicles are typically loaded up with expensive sensor arrays such as lidar radar and highres cameras But one DIY builder has shown that for certain closed environments you can ditch all the fancy gear and still get autonomous driving with just one camera YouTuber Austin Blake is one of those people who just happens to have a selfbuilt gokart lying around at home After christening it Crazy Cart he decided to convert it into his very own selfdriving test platform For this he first designed a makeshift track laid out on the floor of his workshop using contrasting tape markers As you can see in the image below the space is pretty tight but so is the carts turning radius Then came the hard part actually giving Crazy Cart its selfdriving skills For this Blake employed a technique called behavioral cloning via a trained neural network model First he recorded around 15000 images while manually driving the kart around the track using the steering angles at each point as training labels He then fed this data into a convolutional neural network which learned to associate the image inputs with the corresponding steering directions Getting a wellperforming model took quite a bit of trial and error Initial tests failed as the network had trouble distinguishing the track edges and navigating sharp turns Blake tried data augmentation tricks tweaking hyperparameters using multiple cameras and even adding wideangle lenses to enhance the field of view However the real breakthrough came when he added bright blue tape as an outer border increasing contrast With the track clearly defined his creation could autonomously zip around the floor track using just monocular vision no expensive sensors required What it did take though was a total of three Arduinos One relayed the steering predictions from the computer to the second Arduino which combined that data with positional feedback to operate a motor controlling the steering angle The third Arduino handled the throttle by feeding control signals to the karts speed controller,,0.0,1hmols3
