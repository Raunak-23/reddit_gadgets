comment,mu3619q,nycdiveshack,,7,2025-05-24 23:25:47,,,,The folks behind all this are people like Russ Vought primary author of project 2025 and Howard Lutnick Cantor Fitzgerald which is the biggest supporter of the heritage foundation They want an era of isolationism for the US because they think this country can prosper with the right access to raw materials and straight labor Its why they are working on shutting down access to proper education having Trump go on and on about acquiring Canada and Greenland which is partly for resources and accessibility but also as a buffer zone to the rest of the world They have been convinced into thinking AI is figure out all the problems but Elon Musk and Peter ThielPalantir Palantir who is now the biggest defense contractor for the CIANSA based on publicly available data on DOD contracts Palantir for years has been a major defense contractor for the UK and recently got done shifting through all the data over at NHS England which Kier announced will be shutdown Palantir which has contracts with Norway giving them full access to all the data coming out of their government and public surveillance programs Palantir who works very closely with the IDF on their war in Gaza,mu2z38b,3.0,1ku7hib

comment,mu1sct3,qazxdrwes,,4,2025-05-24 18:33:48,,,,No because the underlying logistics network will change to optimize for this new reality and changing logistics to optimize for a different reality costs money Lets say that youre an American manufacturer that uses some imported parts Even if tariffs were dropped maybe your former foreign supplier went out of business and youre stuck with the new supplier And maybe your new supplier now has no competition and they decide they can increase their prices by 10 Maybe your old supplier still exists but shipping has lost some efficiency and now costs more Obviously there is a fuck ton of nuance but prices will remain higher until the market has years of stability to reach an equilibrium again,mu0ncbb,2.0,1ku7hib

comment,mu3qjnn,LineRex,,1,2025-05-25 01:38:12,,,,Here is another question Assuming the next admin reduces Tarrifswill they follow suit and drop prices accordingly it depends on if the market will bear the higher prices Price is determined by cost markup and if they can make more money by lowering prices then theyll lower the markup,mu0ncbb,2.0,1ku7hib
