comment,mp7sso2,SpeedflyChris,,87,2025-04-26 21:58:22,,,,The market is still mostly working on the assumption misguided or not that nobody is actually stupid enough to do the things Trump has said hes going to do and that hell back down soon Problem is once youve forced the entire world to prioritise nonUS supply chains and demonstrated that its not possible to make long term plans in the US market theyre not going to come rushing back,mp7h74m,5.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp8flx7,ohiotechie,,48,2025-04-27 00:11:17,,,,Exactly and inside the US once 1k is the accepted price for something that used to be 500 just because the tariffs go away doesnt mean it will go back to 500 guarangoddamntee it stays 1k if not more just because thats what people have gotten used to paying,mp7sso2,6.0,1k89zfo

comment,mpab2hr,NorysStorys,,25,2025-04-27 09:11:53,,,,If you think the US economy works on honest competition capitalism you are grossly na√Øve The US has some of the weakest antitrust and competition regulation as well as a track record of being very protectionist The treasury typically acts based on who lobbys bribes the most and you can bet your bottom dollar that everyones going to want keep everything at tariff prices and not reduce down to actual supply demand prices it happened duringafter covid itll happen again,mp9me51,8.0,1k89zfo
comment,mpce10m,Curious-Ebb-8451,,-3,2025-04-27 17:25:35,,,,Well the consumer market was very strong duringafter Covid due to stimulus and wage growth Things are not going to play the same way this time so companies cant take advantage of price hikes because consumers will just stop buying Thats when competitors emerge Its already noticeable right now when a lot of Target shoppers opt to go to Walmart instead,mpab2hr,9.0,1k89zfo
comment,mpawreh,ohiotechie,,8,2025-04-27 12:30:07,,,,Airline companies started charging 50 for luggage in the early 2000s when jet fuel prices spiked It was supposed to be because of the higher prices but 20 years later after fuel prices came down have they removed the fee,mp9me51,8.0,1k89zfo
comment,mpa40h5,Jirekianu,,9,2025-04-27 07:57:49,,,,The other problem is that we havent seen the actual ramifications of the tariffs disrupting logistics yet Basically may is when shit is truly going to hit the fan and be thoroughly fucked Even if the tariffs get completely cancelled and china doesnt do anything retaliatory Thats another 6070 days of disruption to supply chains as the lack of materials takes that long to filter through Its like cutting off the flow of water upstream and it takes days for it to show at a town down the river Even if you turn it on the second you see the flow taper off at the town it still has to travel that distance,mp7sso2,6.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp8pwya,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,10,2025-04-27 01:16:35,,,,Nobody president has benefitted China more than Trump Theres great irony that he accused Democrats of being soft on China when through sheer stupidity he accelerated everything theyve wanted Exports to the US only make up 3 of China GDP Theyd trade that for closer relations with the rest of the world and knowing they could attack Taiwan without reprisal from the US,mp7sso2,6.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp8f8ki,DrDerpberg,,5,2025-04-27 00:08:57,,,,The upside but also the reason nobodys actually gonna commit to changing their supply chains in any meaningful way is Trump could wake up tomorrow and make it all go away Then again he could also make the tariffs one billion percent for the stuff youve already got on a boat from China and then youre better off dumping it into the sea,mp7g924,4.0,1k89zfo
comment,mpa1ava,akeean,,6,2025-04-27 07:30:13,,,,Even if hed make it all go away lasting damage to the USs position has been dealt since the rest of the world is now more likely to seek more stable trade partnerships at least while malicious ineptitude has the wheel,mp8f8ki,5.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp8l98q,feudalle,,2,2025-04-27 00:46:58,,,,I think the last stat i saw was america buys around 15 of Chinese goods Physical products have more value than paper money The real thing is worfy about us if China cuts off rare earth metals We only have one company that mines for it in the us and they send it to China for processing Plus side my used s21 Samsung might be worth 1000 when the average new smart phone hits 5k,mp8k053,5.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp9uleh,MadBullBen,,2,2025-04-27 06:23:02,,,,SO MANY products are made in china unless the companies have factories in other countries its so difficult to move quickly and almost impossible if youre a small business without a huge amount in the bank,mp8mjty,6.0,1k89zfo
comment,mpdgqbu,LordOverThis,,3,2025-04-27 20:43:24,,,,They say they wont but absolutely will there were RX 6400 systems selling for north of 800 during the COVID and crypto shortage Itll work out for me I cached a whole pile of shit right after the election and whatever didnt sell for Christmas is now looking like itll fetch a premium in short order And to get political about it I voted for the woman who maybe laughed a bit too much at times but didnt have a weird fixation on an antiquated and selfdefeating economic policy but once the outcome was decided I opted to make the most of what was almost certain impending stupidity,mp4jec6,2.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp54au1,blazze_eternal,,46,2025-04-26 13:19:53,,,,I wont get too political but theyre having the exact effect this administration wants which is why there are no exemptions for parts or even raw materials Lets take a coffee shop for instance There is absolutely no way move all operations for growing the plants to the US due to climate and no exemptions have been put in place for coffee beans Tariffs are meant to be a precision tool to bolster a specific industry not a blanket sales tax,mp50c35,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp6z6py,daCampa,,32,2025-04-26 19:15:29,,,,Your last line says it all Theyre meant to be a precision tool and not a blanket sales tax And theyre being applied as a blanket sales tax depending only on country of origin,mp54au1,3.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp81fc3,Programmdude,,28,2025-04-26 22:47:48,,,,And americans who buy things that cant be grownproduced there coffee cpusetc and americans who build things produced from raw material the US doesnt have pretty much everything including your cars The tariffs arent targeting anything theyre hitting every part of your economy at once except for the very rare thing that is wholly 100 US based Not even your agriculture is like that since both fertiliser and farm equipment would be hit by tariffs Its essentially just a tax on every good that the US people pay for,mp7ptbb,2.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp4jhlf,sithelephant,,835,2025-04-26 10:46:16,,,,I strongly recommend the Gamers Nexus two hour video interviewing various people in the supply chain including Hyte This goes into the details including remarkable access from some vendors and why just build in america isnt a practical option To keep the price the same some vendors would have to basically go from making a 5 margin on sales to a 60 loss on each unit An especially fun fact is that companies who do not manufacture much in the US and have limited exposure in the US may be better able to maintain prices in the US by crosssubsidising from unaffected markets whereas assemblers in the US have no option to do this The one vendor who had substantially moved production to UScanada began doing this _12_ years ago,,0.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp5lyxm,flatroundworm,,104,2025-04-26 14:59:58,,,,Imagine being a US manufacturer trying to sell your product outside the USA now you are paying massive tariffs on all your inputs and then trying to sell to Canadians that can buy from your nonAmerican competition tariff free plus your finished product may get hit by retaliatory tariffs upon entering Canada,mp4jhlf,1.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp6qoph,Lusankya,,94,2025-04-26 18:30:09,,,,As a Canadian Im not sure you appreciate how hostile a lot of our consumer base has become to American goods I cant paint the entire country with a single brush but a lot of us are buying more expensive options to avoid sending any of our hardearned money over the 49th Theres definitely a buy Canada sentiment but the primary motivation is buy anything but American Your goods are becoming radioactive in our market Were not yet trariffing computer cases specifically but we are trariffing assembled conputers and powered computer components at the same 25 the US hit us with,mp5lyxm,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp7ocs7,CommodoreAxis,,18,2025-04-26 21:33:22,,,,I noticed something pretty telling when they restocked the Proudly Made in Michigan USA pretzels at the store The store had received a shipment that was clearly for Canadian export because it had the whole English label repeated in an unintelligible language on the front Normally things are only in English or maybe Spanish where Im at Id bet they saw the writing on the wall that selling something with Proudly Made in Michigan USA on the front of the package wouldnt fly with the Canadians right now,mp6qoph,3.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp7xdhl,Lusankya,,7,2025-04-26 22:24:30,,,,Personally its not a big impact to me either Apples are apples flour is flour toilet paper is toilet paper Im fortunate that I can pay an extra dollar for the package with the maple leaf on itl without a second thought But professionally these tariffs are maddening Some of your industrial goods are topshelf shit that I love working with Its frustrating that I have to settle for poor solutions using substandard gear from nonAmerican vendors as my clients wont let me use American parts any more,mp773qy,4.0,1k89zfo

comment,mpaj117,SteveHeist,,3,2025-04-27 10:35:21,,,,The video goes over Hytes pricing structure in great detail down to their margins kudos to them for opening up that piece of info Theyre getting hit with all these tariffs and they physically cannot afford to sell them in the US for a 100 case theyre down something like 200 Moving shipments to Canada is likely 2 parts we can sell them at a 5 profit versus a 200 loss to 1 part well if and its a big IF the Trump White House gets its head out of its ass regarding tariffs we can bring them into the US from Canada more easily than basically anywhere else,mp5lyxm,2.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp6tkye,DokMabuseIsIn,,17,2025-04-26 18:45:09,,,,We try to reroute them to different countries different regions one Hyte director says Currently we are focusing on the EMEA region because were not bringing any product into the United States because of these tariffs This point is underappreciated China still has large excess production capacity across multiple industries If the rich US market remains closed China will need to dump the excess production in other markets including developing countries thus pushing them towards deindustrialization,mp4kgbp,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp4lsrq,ChoMar05,,50,2025-04-26 11:07:07,,,,Why would a company that isnt deep in the US market crosssubsidy its US business Maybe to gain market share and increase its US Marketpenetration But if you were leading a business would you do that When you can only plan until the president has the next bad game of golf More likely everyone that can afford to leave the US Market will do so if its no longer profitable,mp4jhlf,1.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp4zcnt,ArchusKanzaki,,47,2025-04-26 12:48:13,,,,The thing that Trump is betting is that every business want access to US consumers and US market which is sorta true US consumers have propensity to be able to both afford and willing to pay for more highquality expensive stuffs Especially for PC customers not many countries able to have as many enthusiasts with deep pockets as US market If you go down the list of countries with big populations see how many countries that both have the same income level and similar population size However it is also true that companies may just up and go away from US especially if those enthusiasts are driven outofmarket and no longer buying stuffs anyway As much as US have lots of deeppocket enthusiasts I dont think any US customers are prepared to pay 700 for what used to be 300 case The thing is nobody can forecast what will happen when the president does not have ironclad plan or even ironclad will so the best option is to literally just stand still until things happen which like others have been saying will cause another COVIDlevel shortages with companies stop shipping stuffs to US driving local prices up increasing inflation,mp4lsrq,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp5fwpi,Durzel,,42,2025-04-26 14:27:28,,,,Problem is his bet is simplistic They will want US market access but not if it means losing money for the foreseeable future If they dont have the means to eat the tariffs burden for the next 15 years or so while companies try and replicate what exists in Shenzhen end to end supply chain then they have no choice Its either that or go out of business Trump shouldve looked into subsidising these industries moving to the US which would still be a decade long process but hes all stick no carrot In the GN Hyte were remarkably candid about their razor thin margins The way it was presented theyd have to increase the price of some of their stuff by 100 just to make the same amount of single digit dollar margin post tariffs They correctly realised that consumers arent going to tolerate that,mp4zcnt,3.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp5rozb,Serialtoon,,31,2025-04-26 15:30:02,,,,I think Hyte showed all their cards because they are done with the US market and no longer care about that exposure They seem very much ready to abandon it in favor of the rest of the world not run by a god damn toddler,mp5fwpi,4.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp7vw3n,Curious-Ebb-8451,,10,2025-04-26 22:15:48,,,,Probably the opposite I think they DO care about the exposure and want to get more people informed that these tariffs are hurting US businesses So that it doesnt stay in place,mp5rozb,5.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp50qac,qtx,,17,2025-04-26 12:57:19,,,,US consumers have propensity to be able to both afford and willing to pay for more highquality expensive stuffs Especially for PC customers not many countries able to have as many enthusiasts with deep pockets as US market Thats not really true though Electronics are a lot cheaper in the US by default thats why it may appear to be true that they buy more but if it were on the same level as other countries there wouldnt be much of a difference,mp4zcnt,3.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp4osmh,sithelephant,,24,2025-04-26 11:32:02,,,,As you say to gain market share or at least be around in the US once the tarrifs get cancelled and your competitors have died The US is a large market Maintaining access to this market is worth a fair bit Especially if as a global corporation you can say fuckit and ship the products made in china to europe instead of the US and ship all your other factories products to the US attracting only mild tarriff Buut your US based competitors who are largely reliant on china and have no existing relationship with other countries factories face extreme problems starting production in say India versus someone who is already there and has relationships with factories,mp4lsrq,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp5gv7o,NextWhiteDeath,,-1,2025-04-26 14:32:44,,,,It is a low risk way of growing market share If you make a 1000 case but only sell 30 in the US then not increasing prices doesnt cost you a lot At the same time you are now the price competative option in the market because you didnt raise prices while more exposed companies had to Not raising prices only becomes expensive when you have grown your market share by which point you can increase prices like everyone else and stll be bigger then before,mp4lsrq,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp65zy9,Spara-Extreme,,11,2025-04-26 16:45:09,,,,There was a fascinating video by Silca where they basically stated that they had to stop building bicycle pumps in the US from the tariffs of the 1st administration because it was just cheaper to import from Asia then build in the US at the time aluminum imports were tariffed Now they just stopped importing stuff altogether,mp4jhlf,1.0,1k89zfo

comment,mp50vdq,ArchusKanzaki,,49,2025-04-26 12:58:14,,,,Oh the thing is that it WILL suck already Every company that cannot afford express shipping like how Apple chartered airplanes to bring in 600 tons of iphone is already stopping further order and stopping further shipping because they cannot afford to suddenly needing to pay few tens of thousands when the goods arriving to port Thats the stock of goods that is supposed to come 36 months later based on each stores projection on when they will need goods Think of COVID shortage except selfinflicted now And the worst thing is that nobody knows how to price things right now because the rates might change again but if its preorder then you will need to honor the prices you set or else you are just cheating customers The brilliant tactic is just killing everyone right now,mp4rnfc,1.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp76c6c,guisar,,6,2025-04-26 19:55:04,,,,Can confirm Our distributors and suppliers are doing the same I have no idea minimum 90 days how soon wells be able to get our stuff even if the tariffs are moved back to 10,mp50vdq,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp5vlqd,Ajreil,,8,2025-04-26 15:50:23,,,,If companies believe that prices will double in a few months they have a strong incentive to keep as much unsold inventory as possible Just the threat of tariffs will send prices through the roof,mp50vdq,2.0,1k89zfo
comment,mp60f3d,ArchusKanzaki,,12,2025-04-26 16:15:41,,,,Nah if the problem is just that price will double but they can still sell the products companies will still ship products to US They will just double the price and expect customer to just deal with it The bigger problem is that Companies do not expect that customers will even be willing to buy and pay for the product even if they ship it to US and pay the tariff cost Nobody will pay 700 for something like Hyte Y70 Customers will just not spend instead so Hyte will be losing money on those cases they have paid upfront to import to US and also needing to pay the warehousing cost Stockpiling is not free And the problem with the current tariff implementation is that nobody really knows what the end goal is If its bringing manufacturing back then it will need to stay for long while because nobody setup factory and supply chain in a year or 2 If its punishing countries and extracting favorable deals so maybe just wanting China or other countries to buy more stuffs then tariff might not be in place for long If the goal is to crash the US economy intentionally to refinance debts as I recently heard some ppl were saying then the tariff might be in place for long time too Each reasoning will make companies move in different way and since nobody knows the only option for company is to just stand still hoard as much cashflow as possible to sustain business sold the remaining inventory and hope that they do not need to close shops 36 months later when they have nothing to sell,mp5vlqd,3.0,1k89zfo
