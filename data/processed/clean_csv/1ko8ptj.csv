comment,mso9e1n,treehumper83,,318,2025-05-16 19:00:25,,,,The dock only has HDMI 20 which does not support VRR Could a third party dock that has HDMI 21 work Someone will make one,,0.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoclmm,HopelessRespawner,,165,2025-05-16 19:16:49,,,,Someone else said it might have more to do with converting the display port signal to hdmi so it may still be an issue on v21 Something about it losing the VRR Info in the process,mso9e1n,1.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msomxvt,Fire_Lord_Cinder,,81,2025-05-16 20:09:54,,,,In all likelihood most USB C ports utilize DP Altmode to transfer the video I havent seen an adapter that can translate DP to HDMI while keeping VRR,msoclmm,2.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msq5e2c,AkraticAntiAscetic,,14,2025-05-17 01:36:48,,,,The original V1 switch at least used MyDP thats why most non specific docks dont work with them Could be worse could be Analogue who did a custom video protocol for the Analogue Pocket USB C because their dock costs 129,msomxvt,3.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msooizc,fvck_u_spez,,21,2025-05-16 20:17:58,,,,I think it is specifically the converter that Nintendo is using presumably in the dock to convert DisplayPort to HDMI VRR can persist with a DisplayPort to HDMI conversion IIRC the PS5 uses an internal DisplayPort to HDMI converter chip that takes the DisplayPort signal from the GPU and connects it to the HDMI out and the PS5 supports VRR,msoclmm,2.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msp53np,AdeptFelix,,13,2025-05-16 21:44:01,,,,I dont think the PS5 implementation can be compared to the use of a modified DP Alt mode that Nintendo uses Regular DisplayPort connections are capable of running full HDMI signals over their pinouts so long as the controller can create the correct signals This is how DP works which runs a native HDMI signal over a DisplayPort connectorcable to an HDMI device Now I dont know much about the PS5s implementation and Im having trouble finding a good source to learn about it but I imagine this is how the PS5 is implementing HDMI despite the initial gpu output of DisplayPort The final converter chip would be the implementation point for HDMI VRR and can communicate accordingly with the GPU directly DisplayPort Alt or a similiar implementation of it sorta messes with things Its an actual DisplayPort signal thats being passed and cant operate in a DP mode so it has to be converted For regular video thats not difficult as its mostly how the signals are wrapped for transport so it can be done in realtime For VRR HDMI and DisplayPort use different standards that arent just rewraps of something standard so it would need to be converted or maninthemiddled While I think its possible to convert the VRR calls between the two formats Im not sure if the additional latency would make it that functional Think of it like an emulation layer for VRR API calls The other method I can think of would involve a device in the middle acting as both a receiver for the DisplayPort VRR spec and acting as a host for an HDMI spec I also dont like it because now the middle device needs to have multiple video buffers so it can receive and output on each buffer which is a lot more complex,msooizc,3.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoy6yj,virginiarph,,11,2025-05-16 21:07:01,,,,you cannot convert DP to HDMI 21 this is the same reason why my steam deck cant run 4k vrr on my lg c1 but can just fine via anything that has a DP signal,msoclmm,2.0,1ko8ptj

comment,mst65p8,Eruannster,,2,2025-05-17 15:53:12,,,,I dont think DisplayPort intially supported audio signals whereas HDMI has always been a video audio port which is kind of essential for TV use And I think HDMI had DRM handshakes and stuff that DisplayPort didnt have initially either Though I may be misremembering the exact timeline here And probably a healthy dose of the HDMI consortium being like hey TV makers look at our cool port whereas DisplayPort is an open standard that didnt get as much of a corporate push And now every TV is using HDMI so now they cant be arsed to swap,msrmhfk,3.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msoah24,OnlyNeedJuan,,482,2025-05-16 19:05:58,,,,variable refresh rate it allows the used monitorscreen to change how quickly it updates to be in sync with the actual framerate the console is producing this can help prevent screen tearing and generally helps with making unstable framerates feel a bit better So if your screen is say 60Hz and the console occasionally dips to 40fps when playing games the screen will also drop down to 40Hz at the same time,mso9ms6,1.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msobig9,TotemRiolu,,131,2025-05-16 19:11:16,,,,I appreciate your explanation a ton thanks for keeping it simple,msoah24,2.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoqehq,qa3rfqwef,,23,2025-05-16 20:27:27,,,,It was the tech that honestly saved gaming for me I was getting more and more frustrated and disillusioned with games because I always had to choose between super distracting screen tearing or input latency with vsync Back then my tolerance for frame rate in most games was a minimum of 60 fps before VRR came along After I started using it that threshold dropped to about 50 since it felt roughly the same in comparison These days my tolerance is more in the 90100 fps range lol DLSSand in some cases Frame Generationare really helping solve that problem,msobig9,3.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msp62a4,slobstr,,44,2025-05-16 21:49:20,,,,You have issues with input latency but are ok with frame gen Something doesnt add up here,msoqehq,4.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspef4v,CallMeBigPapaya,,20,2025-05-16 22:39:16,,,,going from 30 to 60 with frame gen is a lot different than 60 to 90 The higher your base framerate the less input lag youll get,msp62a4,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msqeoei,Standard-Potential-6,,2,2025-05-17 02:36:33,,,,True Just keep in mind if you start at 60fps then add framegen the cost of performing framegen will take you to perhaps 50fps ballpark Youll then experience 100fps with half of those frames being generated but will experience similar input lag as at 50fps Games with the new version of NVIDIA Reflex 2 frame warp that came out year will try to adjust the generated frame at the last moment to account for new data from the game but Ive not seen a detailed rundown of the effect yet and wouldnt bet on miracles It is pretty nice if you can get the base rate over 7080fps especially for slower singleplayer games where immersion matters more than fast action,mspef4v,6.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msrr80w,DynamicMangos,,3,2025-05-17 10:03:07,,,,This is what makes Frame Gen fantastic for games that dont actually support 60fps because then the FameGen doesnt actually make your performance drop Im playing all 60fps locked games with adaptive frame gen to get up to 165fps and it feels pretty great,msqeoei,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msqzo63,Danger_Mysterious,,-3,2025-05-17 05:20:27,,,,Really I tried x2 on 120 I think and it felt fucking awful It WAS on GeForce now but my connection is great like 15ms ping peak so usually pretty much identical experience to playing locally for me,mspef4v,6.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msrref3,DynamicMangos,,1,2025-05-17 10:04:59,,,,LMAO yeah no If you use 2x so get to 120fps you lag a whole frame 16ms behind So then with the ping youre adding YET ANOTHER 15ms Of course that feels fucking awful,msqzo63,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msuwbkt,Danger_Mysterious,,0,2025-05-17 21:34:18,,,,Eh I mean Ive played online games for like almost 20 years at this point so Ive experienced far far worse than 30 ping For some reason this felt way way worse but maybe I will admit I didnt fiddle that much with settings to see if I could make it better,msrref3,8.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msxf0k5,DynamicMangos,,2,2025-05-18 09:13:36,,,,That is not a logical comparison though Playing an Online Game with high ping and STREAMING a game with high ping are completely different Online games use Client Side Prediction so even if you have a ping of 100 your PC wont wait for 100ms to display the results of your actions making it still feel smooth to play except for sometimes glitching around because the prediction your pc made was off from what the server actually calculated and has to be resynchronized Streaming a game means that everything you do will have a delay of AT LEAST the reported ping But usually more Ping just means how quick a single Ping test package can be transmitted But when youre streaming a game you have to make an input which then gets encoded sent to the server that server passes that input to the game the game has to render the next frame which at 60fps means it takes 166ms then ENCODE the frame which takes about another 1020ms send it to you which takes longer die to the large file compared to a single pingtestpacket and then your PC still has to deencode it and display it which adds another 1020ms So overall if youre Streaming with 30ms ping your actual inputlatency is somewhere around 7090ms And now adding framegen to it which not only means the local input latency will be doubled so from 16ms per frame to 32ms per frame it also doubles the amount of data thats encoded sent and decoded So your actual latency will be almost doubled which is not that bad for local play there you go from 20ms to 40ms if you started at 60fps but for game streaming youll go from 80ms to 160ms So yeah no wonder frame gen feels terrible on game streaming Try it out locally It still ads some latency that can be felt but its absolutely not unplayable especially for noncompetetive games,msuwbkt,9.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msqu4d7,qa3rfqwef,,1,2025-05-17 04:32:19,,,,I said that in some cases Frame Gen can work If you already have a reasonable frame rate a wellimplemented NVIDIA Reflex and use 2x in certain games the latency is minimal and nowhere near vsync levels The technology will only improve from here so Im expecting it to be more useable as it progresses,msp62a4,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msphpyi,jetstobrazil,,2,2025-05-16 23:07:57,,,,So does this mean were going to get that distracting screen tearing docked Or are the performance upgrades docked going to take care of that,msoqehq,4.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msq25jb,Gloriathewitch,,1,2025-05-17 01:15:54,,,,it should still have vertical sync,msphpyi,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msquoaq,qa3rfqwef,,1,2025-05-17 04:36:56,,,,My guess is theyll opt for the old fashioned way of some kind of triplebuffered vsync when docked However how well that gets implemented will be on a pergame basis so you might find some games with tearing,msphpyi,5.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msrvnkm,drunktriviaguy,,3,2025-05-17 10:47:44,,,,Im not OP but thats not an unrealistic number for PC gaming and the entire point of his comment was to highlight how VRR makes playing games at framerates that fall between standard monitor refreshrates bearable Tons of people intentionally sacrifice clarity for frame rates above 60 fps because it makes the game look and feel more responsive If youre playing something like Counter Strike 2 you can easily hit frame rates in the 200s with 20 series Nvida cards,msp5sef,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspx8jb,ayyyyycrisp,,0,2025-05-17 00:44:33,,,,I think it totally depends on the game Ill gladly play a good looking single player rpg at 30fps with a controller Id prefer 60 but 30 I can still have a fine experience with mousekeyboard I need at least 60fps for the same game but you wont catch me playing Rocket League at any less than 240fps and I feel the game is unplayable for me below 120fps,msp5sef,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspmre3,orsikbattlehammer,,-5,2025-05-16 23:38:58,,,,So what They arent telling anyone else what they should or shouldnt do literally who cares what this persons tolerance is They arent asking anyone for anything and they arent giving anyone any grief with this comment,msp5sef,7.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msob7mn,CarlosFer2201,,25,2025-05-16 19:09:44,,,,It also allows for custom frame rate targets If a game can run smoothly at like 35fps then why not Without VRR youd be stuck at 30 even if there was headroom,msoah24,2.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoiq0h,Small_Editor_3693,,10,2025-05-16 19:48:20,,,,VRR doesnt allow 35fps It allows 35fps without screen tearing,msob7mn,3.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msosdzd,ManlySyrup,,-1,2025-05-16 20:37:32,,,,VRR does allow for 35fps if the VRR range is 1120 for example Most monitors only go as low as 48 though so when games go down to 35fps the monitor changes to 70hz as a workaround method and it works great,msoiq0h,4.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspmhkq,dtwhitecp,,1,2025-05-16 23:37:18,,,,I think they intended to say you can do 35fps without VRR but VRR might be necessary to prevent tearing,msosdzd,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspn55z,ManlySyrup,,1,2025-05-16 23:41:21,,,,Yeah in retrospect I noticed it mightve been a language thing especially with the subsequent responses,mspmhkq,6.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msreicr,pseudopad,,1,2025-05-17 07:46:26,,,,You can easily render at 35 fps without VRR and still avoid screen tearing You will get frame jutter though as frames will be displayed on screen at an uneven pace,mspmhkq,6.0,1ko8ptj

comment,mspb7uy,Small_Editor_3693,,-2,2025-05-16 22:18:46,,,,None of what you said is correct Monitors will not auto adjust their refresh rate before VRR was a thing A monitor thats 60 hz wont jump up the 70 hz to avoid screen tearing Thats what VRR does,mspagoz,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspbysb,ManlySyrup,,4,2025-05-16 22:23:09,,,,When did I say monitors that are not Freesynccompatible do that I am specifically talking about VRR so its implied Im talking about VRR monitors where is your reading comprehension You said VRR doesnt allow 35fps when it factually does do that with VRR monitors that have 35hz or lower as their lowest range or with Freesync Premium on AMD cards with monitors that only go as low at 48hz For fucks sake dont take my word for it just google the damn information yourself,mspb7uy,8.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspdkn0,Small_Editor_3693,,1,2025-05-16 22:32:32,,,,It doesnt allow it because being a monitor allows it to run 35 fps Not having VRR doesnt prevent 35fps If you were saying that about VRR monitors no shit Youre just repeating what everyone else in this thread said,mspbysb,9.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msoln6o,CarlosFer2201,,-3,2025-05-16 20:03:17,,,,Variable refresh rate allows a screen to refresh at any rate within its capabilities If the game targets a custom rate the screen will follow Without VRR youre stuck either stuck at a lower rate usually because of Vsync or you get duplicate frames with artifacts such as tearing indeed,msokbik,4.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msomv9f,phrunk7,,2,2025-05-16 20:09:32,,,,That is not accurate Any TV capable of 60hz can display 35fps Its just that without VRR youll get frametearing Exactly as I stated,msoln6o,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoteio,ManlySyrup,,2,2025-05-16 20:42:36,,,,What the other guy said is 100 accurate VRR dynamically switches the screens refresh rate to the games frame rate Running a game at 35fps on a locked 60hz screen causes stutters and screen tearing for reasons he explained already which you can google as well,msomv9f,6.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msppb1h,dreadcain,,2,2025-05-16 23:54:39,,,,Its most visible with fast motion like spinning the camera quickly Part of the screen would remain unchanged from the last frame and part of the screen will have the data from a new frame So youll see a tear through the screen somewhere usually a horizontal line where the new data stops and the previous frames data picks up Basically without vrr the screen is requesting frames on a 60hz or whatever timer It doesnt know or care if the gpu has had time to finish drawing that frame yet It will just display whatever the gpu has ready every time that timer fires With vrr rather than have a clock on the screen it waits for the gpu to say a new frame is ready and only then copies it over to display it ETA The main alternate solution before VRR was to simply have an extra buffer on the GPU so it could hold 2 or more frames at once If a new frame wasnt ready when the screen asked it would simply show the entire previous frame,msoluah,3.0,1ko8ptj

comment,mspkwfg,dreadcain,,1,2025-05-16 23:27:34,,,,Calling it just a bit better is a massive understatement The alternative solution is basically to just drop frames resulting in essentially halving the framerate at least for even the mildest unstable frame rate That or simply showing the screen tears,msoah24,2.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msriim9,OnlyNeedJuan,,2,2025-05-17 08:28:52,,,,So a game effectively generates a series of pictures very rapidly for a monitor to display This framerate or FPS is not always constant however sometimes framerate lowers because things are hard for the computer to generate A monitor by default tries to display a picture at a set rate There is effectively no computing so this can just be set to a given number say 60 pictures a second or 60Hz Thats a monitors refresh rate Screen tearing happens when the framerate of your game and the refresh rate of your monitor arent in sync this causes the monitor to sometimes have to display the information of multiple frames in 1 frame and that creates tears with old and new frames trying to display at the same time this creates the horizontal line breaks you notice mostly while stuff is moving on screen Think of a picture taking longer to send while the monitor is already expecting the next picture that creates such an issue Variable refresh rate ensures that the monitor refreshes ie displays a frame at the same time the game does The monitor will now wait for the next picture before it tries to update the display rather than always trying to brute force the next picture If theyre in sync the situation where multiple frames might try to display at once cannot occur as any changes in the amount of frames per second made by the game will be reflected by the monitor adjusting when it displays the next picture to be the same Ill admit its a thing thats much easier to understand with a nice visual representation but thats tricky on reddit at times so if its not clear Id recommend looking up some videos on youtube on how variable refresh rate works and how it helps with screen tearing,msqhzdd,3.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msse4mi,nebber3,,1,2025-05-17 13:11:29,,,,Mario kart 8 on the Wii U ran at exactly 59FPS That means every second the game would stutter for exactly one frame because the TV was running at 60Hz With proper implementation of VRR that could be resolved by dropping the TVs refresh rate to 59Hz which would perfectly sync with the game and look basically as smooth as 60FPS,msoah24,2.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msp762c,None,,-8,2025-05-16 21:55:28,,,,If you had a 40fps game youd want to avoid a flickery headache inducing 40hz refresh rate and instead go for a multiple of 40hz 80hz for example Id be surprised if any display had a refresh rate lower than 50hz EU or 60hz US,msp4bh4,6.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspmiiz,dreadcain,,3,2025-05-16 23:37:27,,,,This sounds like some pseudo science bullshit VRR displays can often go down to like 12 hz Considering the vast majority of content you watch is shot at 24 25 or 30 hz that is a pretty useful feature Also not all screens flicker For me the ones that do eventually give me headaches at any refresh rate,msp762c,7.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msrixm1,OnlyNeedJuan,,1,2025-05-17 08:33:25,,,,If youre referring to VRR flickering Yeah thats a thing its gotten much better over time Im not entirely sure how that relates to refresh rate itself but the issue is minimized on most modern monitors That said I know less about VRR flickering just that its an issue and that Im glad that my monitor doesnt have it Its a very specific issue and I and seemingly a lot of other folks werent sure what you were talking about in your initial comment lacked some details Have a good one,msp762c,7.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msrgpr9,alidan,,2,2025-05-17 08:09:29,,,,effectively it has a range from 1 to xwhatever max frame rate for monitor is anything in between there it will show the frame that is made when its made and not switch in between frames this is what tearing is and is usually a line but can be other shapes as well in rare cases vrr has two side benefits that no one talks about 1 it makes low frame rates feel far FAR more responsive my little brother got a monitor capable of it and was showing it off the game would go between 90 and 130fps monitor was 144 this was cool but the gpu glitched for some reason and wouldnt clock up when he restarted the game we both played a bit but something was off and I noticed the fire was kinda low frame rate thats when we brought up the hardware monitoring tools and found out the game was running at 17 frames a second let me be very clear we both are the kind of people who complain when crap goes sub 60fps because it feels like hell but vrr makes inputs feel perfect even at lower frame rates because of this 2 the need to always max out frame rate is gone sure it may not feel as smooth but as far as inputs go the need is gone,mso9ms6,1.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspuvo9,Neo_Techni,,1,2025-05-17 00:29:42,,,,people have only been giving you a partial explanation back when we used Cathode Ray Tubebased TVs they didnt have complex computers driving them but simple electronics that used the frequency of the power grid itself as the clock signal clock signals are the heartbeat of any electronic driving when actions take place This meant in North AmericaJapan they were limited to 60 HZ and 50 HZ in Europe When we switched to more complex electronics in the displays we could separate the clock signal from the power grid So that we could run at frame rates that were not a multiple of 60 or 50 Games send their frames out in 1 of 2 ways Vertical synced in that they are synchronized with the vertical blanking interval which happens at the end of a HZclock cycle This means 1 frame is sent out for each HZ Nonsynced which means if a frame isnt done rendering the time it has 160 or 150 of a second its sent out anyway resulting in an image that is half the new frame half the previous frame looking like an ugly puzzle Some weirdos chose this willingly cause of the faster response time Now VRR has the advantage of both modes No jarring puzzle effect faster response time A frame is sent to the TV when its done and the TV doesnt care about how many frames per second there are,mso9ms6,1.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msou18g,rnnd,,2,2025-05-16 20:45:48,,,,Lemme explain it to you While the switch 2 dock accepts HDMI input The switch itself accepts DP input via USBC So its not HDMI to HDMI Its HDMI to HDMI to DP Getting VRR from HDMI to DP is very tricky,msotk4y,5.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msoz5pb,beefjerky9,,-4,2025-05-16 21:12:02,,,,So Nintendo has chosen to use 9 year old technology DPv14 32016 when they could have instead gone with 8 year old technology HDMIv21 12017 and not limited their devices ability Thats certainlya choice However that totally tracks with the way Nintendo has been going They used to be a very innovative company,msou18g,6.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msp89b2,defeater-,,8,2025-05-16 22:01:35,,,,Its irrelevant as USBC to HDMI with VRR is currently not possible and the alternative would be adding an HDMI port or proprietary port to the switch itself It docks and charges with USBC so it has to send its signal with that connection and in that case is subject to the limitations of that connection,msobx1w,3.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msoc1r9,Racxie,,-1,2025-05-16 19:14:01,,,,I saw someone mention elsewhere that Nintendo is using HDMI 20 for Switch 2 which doesnt support VRR in Switch 2s case as it uses an Nvidiabased GPU and VRR support over HDMI 20 is exclusive to AMD and even then is very limited So if thats the case which would make sense based in the above sources Ive linked above when having a quick look into it it wouldnt be possible to fix it with a software update It also makes sense as to why they can do it on the device as they can ensure whatever connection the GPU has to the onboard display is compatible without having to pay the higher HDMI licensing fees,mso8ueu,1.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msrdolo,SiroccoDream,,3,2025-05-17 07:37:47,,,,I freely admit that I only want a Nintendo handheld for happy little games of the types that kept my kids happy on long car rides when they were little I have an original Switch mostly used for Pokémon and Animal Crossing and some other cozy games I was thinking about the Switch 2 but the more of these articles that come out the less enthusiastic I get Trying to make a handheld perform like a console but adding caveat after caveat oh that feature will only work in this mode or oh youll need a 300 aftermarket piece to get that feature it really spoils the whole experience for me Lol I realize I am NOT the target demographic but man my kids faces LIT UP when they realized they had FINALLY each saved up half the money to get their own Nintendo Gameboys which meant we Mom and Dad were going to contribute the other half AND A GAME They worked really hard doing chores at home and odd jobs for our elderly neighbors and it was a blast taking them to Gamestop for the big purchase I feel bad for todays parents trying to teach their kids to work towards what they want when a freaking HANDHELD costs as much as a console back in the day,,0.0,1ko8ptj

comment,mspdl9w,kushpeshin,,4,2025-05-16 22:32:38,,,,Thats actually pretty stupid for a 2025 gaming console and can be an instant write off for using this system docked VRR is a crucial feature to help with hiding frame rate dips between 48 to 60fps And also with no VRRdoes that mean wed have to set the console to 1440p,,0.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mssl37l,music_crawler,,2,2025-05-17 13:56:01,,,,It definitely is necessary for a console that is so limited on power They really needed VRR in docked to cover up those dips that the devs basically cant do anything about because its frankly not that powerful,mspdl9w,1.0,1ko8ptj
comment,msomhsa,explosiv_skull,,4,2025-05-16 20:07:37,,,,While this might disappoint those hoping for variable refresh rate on the Switch 2s TV settings at launch it might not mean all hope is lost Sony issued an update rolling VRR support out to PS5 consoles postlaunch so it stands to reason we could see something similar happen here Thats some cope right there Unless proof exists otherwise Im guessing Nintendo opted to save a few pennies by going HDMI 20 or less and thus the dock hardware cant do VRR If they were planning to roll it out theyd say that,,0.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msops43,chiefmackdaddypuff,,4,2025-05-16 20:24:19,,,,This is such a weird decision The GPU supposedly should support it the Switch 2 is already under powered compared to its competitors and could definitely use it as a platform It just seems like a backward thing to not include particularly if its due to the dock being only HDMI20 capable Im sure its going to help with cost but the experiential loss particularly down the line when games are going to get more complex and will need VRR to help with frame rates is a pretty big miss They should have eaten the cost of a HDMI21 capable dock in service of the longevity experience,,0.0,1ko8ptj
comment,mspnfzx,Steelfenix,,2,2025-05-16 23:43:09,,,,The problem itself is the dock concept To have a docked VRR it will require that the switch to have the hdmi port not the dock Currently there is no way to support VRR using a USBC to HDMI conversion,msops43,1.0,1ko8ptj

comment,msopawn,DavidinCT,,0,2025-05-16 20:21:53,,,,and charge 8090 for each game Ok justify it by calling it exclusives Nintendo has always been the value console Now they are trying to go against the big boys Like said this will sell pretty good on release due to fanboys but after that its going to not sell very well and wont even sell 12 of what the Switch 1 did unless it gets a huge price cut in less than a year INCLUDING GAMES,msoop7k,6.0,1ko8ptj
