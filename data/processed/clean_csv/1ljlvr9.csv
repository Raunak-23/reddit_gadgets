comment,mzopa3w,Shabbypenguin,,5,2025-06-25 12:27:30,,,,The issue is they took preorders for a case that is more than 3 times their competition I had to go caseless on my switch 2 for several weeks Now that I have it I have to wait until middlelate July in order to get a fix right joycon cover Meanwhile they make statements belittling peoples experiences and a video showing a gross exaggeration of how silly you have to hold it in order for it to fall off which it doesnt need to be,mzmeqsy,2.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzl6hva,Kekeripo,,256,2025-06-24 21:37:48,,,,So the case itself becomes a big leaver if you hold the console just by one joycon not supporting the tablet with your fingers I do get that one would not hold it like that when in use but picking it up is another thing Without some form of physical latching or making the case a one piece design I dont see how one could prevent this leaver action from happening,,0.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlbcz0,PhantomWang,,306,2025-06-24 22:02:12,,,,The tldr is that Nintendo purposefully left a small gap between the display and joycons so that holding it this way wouldnt create leverage that allows the joycon to separate Dbrands grip fills this gap so it has the leverage necessary to disconnect unintentionally,mzl6hva,1.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlevre,Kekeripo,,118,2025-06-24 22:20:49,,,,I just tested my naked switch 2 and no wiggling or shaking causes the console to detach Definitly a oversight in the design on their end Ive had many dbrand products over the years and when i had trouble with a faulty killswitch ROG Ally and screenprotector dbrand replaced them both for free Im sure theyll make this right like they have done in the past But damn the killswitch line of product seems to be a bit of a sore spot for them considering delays and issues with earlier devices,mzlbcz0,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlglxu,RobertdBanks,,88,2025-06-24 22:30:07,,,,They already issued a response saying theyre redesigning the joycon grips and sending them for free to everyone who ordered the case regardless if they had the issue or not So yes theyre taking care of it after their initial response of youre holding it wrong,mzlevre,3.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzpv1tb,Confused-Raccoon,,1,2025-06-25 16:00:06,,,,This is how I expected them to handle it Send out a big post explaining how the end user is wrongweird how theyve tested it and their findings but actually just sort it out at their expense Like when their phone grip cases kept peeling apart They explained the hows and whys and just fixed it for everyone at their expense,mzlglxu,4.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzljrei,stilusmobilus,,1,2025-06-24 22:47:33,,,,Yeah one thing Ive waited for is a detach complaint and aside from this here I havent seen one Id imagine thats been rigorously tested by now by accident as well,mzlevre,3.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzm9vqw,Kindness_of_cats,,5,2025-06-25 01:13:55,,,,It was basically the thing everyone tested back in March when they started letting people get handson with it You can really tell that they spent 8 years perfecting the design and how to make a magnetic connection work,mzljrei,4.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzln62b,SuperCat76,,3,2025-06-24 23:06:04,,,,An additional thing I think is going on as well is that the thickness varies So if it is a thicker one it may push the Joycons out just a little bit Increasing the distance to the magnets decreasing the pull they have on the controller and this making them even easier to have fall off,mzlbcz0,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzljhzw,stilusmobilus,,1,2025-06-24 22:46:06,,,,Without further research beyond this post I suspected it had something to do with interfering with this gap,mzlbcz0,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzptftb,Confused-Raccoon,,0,2025-06-25 15:52:40,,,,Why didnt Nintendo see fit to put a physical mechanical lock in place to begin with They know a huge portion of there user base is children I thought thats what the detach button was but apparently you can just pull them off,mzlbcz0,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlazhr,your_evil_ex,,11,2025-06-24 22:00:16,,,,It doesnt happen if you have no case on the Switch 2 because they intentionally leave a gap between the joycon and system,mzl6hva,1.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlrgjt,Fett32,,8,2025-06-24 23:29:00,,,,Its actually common to hold it like that just not for everyone A lot of my time on switch and the steam deck Im just holding it with my left hand Games like vampire survivors some of the Pokémon etc can be played onehanded,mzl6hva,1.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mznyzfn,Kekeripo,,2,2025-06-25 08:54:17,,,,What i meant by holding it like that was holding it with one hand by only one joycon Its damn heavy on the hand and not much to at least me hold left if you dont move your fingers to the tablet part,mzlrgjt,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzr0380,Fett32,,1,2025-06-25 19:09:51,,,,Yeah I tend to hold it by the joycon If you angle it up a bit you can pinch the joycon between the bottom of your index finger and the pad below your thumb Ends up surprising light with the leverage working in your favor and reducing finger strain I usually play for at least an hour before switching positions Tho I do tend to have a finger on the console but not always,mznyzfn,3.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzm4ydf,shewy92,,9,2025-06-25 00:45:39,,,,I mean just grabbing a drink or a snack you can hold it with one hand I bet a lot of people do that It shouldnt break just because of that,mzl6hva,1.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzoc6h1,shewy92,,3,2025-06-25 10:55:08,,,,Doesnt mean no one tries to do so I can hold my Steamdeck with one hand and its bigger than a Switch The dbrand Killzone case gives you a big handle to hold from so it would be easier to try and do so,mznz32e,3.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzpcuuc,Kekeripo,,2,2025-06-25 14:34:56,,,,Youre missunderstanding me a tiny bit I mean holding the entire switch by the joycon alone no fingers touching the tablet That is hard I can one hand my ally x no problems but if I had to claw it no chance,mzoc6h1,4.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlawyj,RobertdBanks,,6,2025-06-24 21:59:54,,,,The same way a bunch of other cases avoid it dont have the material slightly push the joycon out further Thats the issue here I have a clear plastic case on mine with separate holders for the screen and joycons and it works like normal,mzl6hva,1.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzmyqpo,realityfooledme,,9,2025-06-25 03:42:23,,,,I tried to get a case from dbrand for a steamdeck and I have to say their customer service is exactly inline with this stance After they messed up the shipping and then refused to even communicate with me until they received the package back I canceled it and went with a different brand It was a birthday present time was a factor and if they had just responded to an email I would have happily paid for a second one to get a case on the way if they would give me a refund when the other case came back Nope sarcastic emails were all I got back And whether its real or supposed to be a joke as a customer my take away was that they are undeservedly cocky Its a very you should be grateful were even doing this stupid shit attitude and Ill never shop with them again,mzksxgr,1.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzlg72d,LOAARR,,-38,2025-06-24 22:27:52,,,,Classic reddit upvoting someone implying maybe you shouldcould die in response to someone making a slightly snarky criticism of someone criticising a big bad corporation Yes Reddit corporation bad But you need to be better than this Upvoting legitimate hatred and thinlyveiled maybe you could die comments because theyre in agreeance with you is how we get cyberbullying so bad that people legitimately do hurt themselves like the fox rescue girl that we just lost largely because of online bullying from sources like snark subreddits Grow up Youre talking to other humans like at least half the time Act like it EDIT And in classic reddit fashion youve all doubleddown and are downvoting me en masse as I predicted you would Well unlike all of you Im not a spineless coward who deletes their post once they have 5 points because I know that these downvotes mean that Ive upset you And when you say something critical of someone that upsets them you know that youve struck them at their core Hopefully youve all learned something and can grow up and stop bullying in the name of being right Even if 1 person in 100 thinks something you dont have to aggressively tell them theyre an idiot or imply that they could maybe try dying you can just have a good faith argument with them and try to understand where theyre coming from After all just because half of an entire country thinks something is right doesnt make it right as weve learned from the United States of America where most of you reading this are from Be better,mzl5dd6,3.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzmxqfh,Secret_Caterpillar,,11,2025-06-25 03:35:40,,,,The downvotes are because your comment is idiotic The heart attack comment was an analogy pointing out that using a what if scenario is not a valid argument because you can come up with any ridiculous situation that could technically happen it was never wishing for them to have a heart attack Everyone understood that except you and yet instead of realizing that you misunderstood you chose to double down on self righteousness,mzlg72d,4.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mznqlrx,Secret_Caterpillar,,6,2025-06-25 07:30:34,,,,But thats not what they said which is why you cant quote what actually happened and you have to resort to using an example of your own interpretation because the literal text does not support your argument In fact not only did they not tell them to have a heart attack they never even implied that they should at all They only commented that its within the realm of possibilities an analogy to point out the fallacy of whatif arguments a fact that has already been explained to you This is a gradeschool level literary device and your inability to understand that when everyone else was capable is indicative of your poor reasoning not a moral failing of everyone else The reason everybody downvoted you without comment is because your little rant was so incredibly ignorant that it didnt warrant the effort to explain why because everyone knew that you would do exactly what you are doing now you refuse any responsibility for being wrong and instead double down on what is clearly a lack of reading comprehension on your part And your weak attempts at ad homs just further illustrates that you know youre wrong but youre too intellectual dishonest and fragile of ego to accept it You remind me of a flat earther so confident that everyone else is wrong because you cant understand elementary concepts I cant wait for you to reply with the same fallacious argument that you already tried twice and close it out with another pathetic attempt to insult me that will surely make you right on the third try,mzne8wb,6.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlk6oa,lugerd,,9,2025-06-24 22:49:56,,,,The problem is that the case INCREASES the chance of the switch dropping from your hands It negates the reason why people would buy the protective case in the first place I know all devices can break on their own but why would you buy a protective case that would cause it to break more easily,mzl3do7,2.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzlkoo7,GlossyGecko,,-3,2025-06-24 22:52:39,,,,I mean to be honest with you unless youre letting kids use your switch all the time I dont really even understand why youd want a case anyway They build those things so fucking sturdy I mean my little nephew owns his own switch and that thing is basically mint and hes not exactly gentle with his toys so even then I dont really get why youd want a case on your switch My own original switch has never been in a case and is pretty much perfect I really dont get what you MFs are doing with your consoles that you feel like you need to strap a case to the thing at all,mzlk6oa,3.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzm967a,Kindness_of_cats,,3,2025-06-25 01:09:52,,,,Because some people know theyre naturally clumsy or they use it in environments where its more likely to be damaged or theyre just plain cautious about their devices Regardless the grips specifically arent really for protection so much as to address the nonexistent ergonomics of the device Theyve even discussed that theyre likely going to be selling them individually,mzlkoo7,4.0,1ljlvr9
comment,mzn4wns,Jaerba,,1,2025-06-25 04:25:32,,,,The main value of this specific case is the joycon grips themselves The default Joycons dont feel great to hold There are other cases with grips but those tend to be even bulkier across the rest of the unit You buy this to get very ergonomic grips that are fairly easy to attachdetach The extra case features are just a bonus that you can ignore,mzlkoo7,4.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzo35ur,Maxamus53,,3,2025-06-25 09:35:34,,,,This was a big concern of mine and it stopped me from buying one until I actually tried holding my naked Switch 2 by a single joycon 1 The joycon is physically too small for me to hold without touching the back of the switch 2 It feels like Im going to snap something so I by default try and brace the switch I think this issue is made worse by the grip case having nice handles which allows people to actually swing it by the single joycon I dont really think this is a case defect its just limitations of magnetic connection along with a heavy hand held console,,0.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzl84yr,GlossyGecko,,-16,2025-06-24 21:45:56,,,,Look at the video in the link Theyre right nobody holds the switch like that lol The fuck are these people doing Trying to bend the switch Reminds me of people who complain about stick drift but then you find out that they fucking throw their controller at the wall whenever they lose in a game Like yeah no shit you have stick drift bro,mzl67eb,1.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzn5ta8,Jaerba,,2,2025-06-25 04:32:11,,,,You just have to hold it that way for a second for it to fail So the example is you put the Switch on a side table and then when you pick it up again youre initially only holding it with one hand Thats when it would fail and its a pretty realistic common scenario Or youre playing a game and you scratch your nose or take a drink It doesnt take any force beyond gravity for it to fail,mzl84yr,2.0,1ljlvr9

comment,mzl3zse,LDC1234,,21,2025-06-24 21:25:21,,,,This isnt a Nintendo issue This is a Dbrand Killswitch issue The way the killswitch wraps around the Joycon prevents it from fully securing to the console,mzkzmar,1.0,1ljlvr9
