comment,m5wb2e8,sithelephant,,75,2025-01-07 16:53:50,,,,Yes but also no Reduced battery life for a set of devices whos batteries either are or are likely to become unreliable shortly to help preserve the battery a bit and stop stuff like random crashes at 20 battery happening as it can with very old or degraded batteries that cant cope with the draw of the phone in peaks However if your device is one of those limited Its not all pixel 4as its by IMEI you can get various restitutions from a free battery replacement service on through cash or credit in the google hardware store For a phone which is at least three years old,,0.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5zdbiq,stempoweredu,,33,2025-01-08 02:12:40,,,,For a phone which is at least three years old People need to stop treating this like a geriatric age for technology,m5wb2e8,1.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5zed3s,sithelephant,,5,2025-01-08 02:18:47,,,,I do not disagree and yet here we are Only one of my android devices bought semirecently has a user replaceable battery The galaxy tab active 3 If it doesnt have a user replaceable battery then in many cases if things havent gone just right 3 years old damn near is geriatric,m5zdbiq,2.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5xir8k,count023,,13,2025-01-07 20:25:01,,,,My 4as battery burns out after about 9 hours of light use these days its already one foot in the grave before I saw the Google notice If this shortens the battery any further I may as well just get a new phone,m5wb2e8,1.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5xnc6t,sithelephant,,10,2025-01-07 20:46:52,,,,It _nearly_ goes so far as saying if it shortens your battery life you can get a free battery replacement Depending on how skeptically you read it We will see My first reading at least is that they dont quite say explicitly that the group of phones it will negatively impact is completely covered by the replacement,m5xir8k,2.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5xok3y,count023,,3,2025-01-07 20:52:35,,,,I just went through the listing they had in the notification i am not elligable for a replacement but they wanna send me 50USD though that seems weird,m5xnc6t,3.0,1hvvngn
comment,m60tp2o,TotallyNormalSquid,,1,2025-01-08 09:01:53,,,,I replaced my 4a when I checked the price of a battery replacement and it was 95 the price of a new phone with similar specs Dont think 50 bucks is gonna cover it,m5xok3y,4.0,1hvvngn

comment,m5yr7ab,sithelephant,,2,2025-01-08 00:09:36,,,,Right As I read it the statement is slightly ambiguous on if any phones that will have performance worsened by the update that are perhaps not on their IMEI list will not be eligible,m5yoyyv,4.0,1hvvngn

comment,m5xgn19,Sure-Temperature,,30,2025-01-07 20:14:44,,,,If I remember correctly the fuss wasnt that Apple put the battery safeguards in place but the fact that theu did so without telling anyone denied it through their teeth and then finally admitted it when they had no other option,m5x1lqv,1.0,1hvvngn

comment,m61rb0p,Virreinatos,,1,2025-01-08 13:54:13,,,,I got the same options Given Id assume Px4 are at the end of their lives for most this seems fair enough Im prolly taking the battery myself because I like using my phones till they literally die,m5yezuz,1.0,1hvvngn
comment,m67hn61,bugmush,,1,2025-01-09 11:13:04,,,,The 4a iswas a great phone Makes sense to keep using it as long as you can Its somehow the first phone I bought that was over 60 and it served me well for many years I think it was originally 350 retail at launch when I bought it I ended up getting someones handmedown Galaxy S21 FE for free not too long ago and I have not been a big fan of Samsungs setupfeatures could just be because I was very used to the Pixel setup Not that they are vastly different both being androids but Samsung has definitely been more frustrating to use at times I do like the larger screen as the pixel 4a was on the small side and I have large hands still terrible at phone typing after all these years though but barely being able to get your phone to fit in your pocket is kind of annoying too,m61rb0p,2.0,1hvvngn
comment,md2daih,Excitable_Grackle,,1,2025-02-16 12:56:57,,,,Im frankly amazed that anyone still has an operating Pixel 4a Mine died at the end of its assumed builtin three year lifetime The 5a5g I replaced it with was great but did not even last three years before it just gave up and went black Now Im on a Pixel 7 which is OK except they swapped out the very reliable fingerprint sensor for a shitty softwarebased one which works about 70 percent of the time,,0.0,1hvvngn
comment,m5wkong,SandiaRaptor,,-36,2025-01-07 17:40:45,,,,Pixel phones only get three years of security updates last I heard Planned obsolescence Why I switched to Apple after owning Pixel and other Android phone Edit I stand corrected Now they get SEVEN years of updates Too bad they didnt offer that when I bought mine,,0.0,1hvvngn

comment,m5wpabo,Enough-Meaning1514,,0,2025-01-07 18:02:49,,,,They got caught redhanded and had to replace shit ton of batteries due to the result of classactionlawsuit They slowed certain 23 year old phones without even checking the status of their batteries In fact battery status test is added AFTER they lost the case In addition they mentioned in their earnings that year that the sales were low because they had to replace a lot of batteries for free of charge which resulted in less sales So yes AppleSamsungGoogle they all do the same shit Planned obsolescence became a business model now,m5wnfis,5.0,1hvvngn

comment,m5zwbqi,Imperialbucket,,0,2025-01-08 04:08:12,,,,Setting the standard for craven moneygrubbing tech companies posing significant national security risks being so reliant on Chinese sweat labor lazily erasing features from their products which other tech companies take as carte blanche to do the same thing Are they that much worse than Google A little bit but not by much But my point is really that its hilarious this guy is essentially saying man this Viktor Frankenstein guy is a real asshole Im gonna go hang out with Dracula instead thatll show him,m5zux7v,3.0,1hvvngn
