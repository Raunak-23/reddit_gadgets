comment,mv0c3ds,Ellyemem,,2,2025-05-30 03:48:00,,,,Youd start by repairing a stable civil service that can maintain a level of policy consistency for decades beyond any one administration because in turbo mode its going to be a 15 year push Its also not going to be short term linegoesup American capital profitable to build so private equity and companies wont help pony up to build it hence offshoring So youd need to vote for taxation so that the government can fund it although if we can hold focus we could also then have some of the profits go back into government coffers to defray future taxes if we dont let some administration give it away for pennies once the hard part of building it is done Youll also need an incredibly technical and well trained workforce that would require a further investment in education not just more money but in targeting that spending toward schools that adopt useful curricula On the upside could save some money by getting rid of pointless elementary school standardized testing mandates that have done effectively nothing to improve education despite trying them in different forms for 30 years In a nutshell thats what China did for over 40 years while starve the beast conservatives and their expensive military adventures abroad have bankrupted the government and they were asleep at the wheel with respect to Chinas focused internal investments and growth We could begin to catch up no problem but not if we lose our minds every couple of elections and let in some maniacs who want to rip it all down fast Theres absurd private wealth here already so if the rich were going to invest in modernizing the US theyd have done it decades ago,musgzj7,3.0,1kxexgh
comment,mv4m8in,PancAshAsh,,1,2025-05-30 20:01:48,,,,Start with an enormous poorly educated population you can justify paying 5day and educate them to the bare minimum level needed to assemble electronic components Also have absolutely no environmental or labor laws so the workforce is being literally worked to death for extremely low wages in unsafe and dirty conditions Or you can do what the US did in the 1940s and 1950s and just take advantage of the fact that a world war just destroyed most of the rest of the worlds factories,musgzj7,3.0,1kxexgh

comment,mup2yai,Nielsly,,102,2025-05-28 13:29:03,,,,Not only exploitation Chinese wages are quite high nowadays compared to other countries in the region The main thing nowadays is that the supply chain is already there moving the entire supply chain would be extremely expensive and not moving it and only moving final product assembly would involve transport of dozens of individual parts and managing the supply rates rather than just one completed device,muoyc8j,2.0,1kxexgh

comment,mupvd43,SpaceGoonie,,1,2025-05-28 15:48:00,,,,This is the crux Yes China has the supply chain The reason goes back to times past when Chinese labor was extremely cheap In other words Apple created the conditions that exist and that it now uses as an excuse to avoid making phones where labor is more costly,mup2yai,3.0,1kxexgh
comment,muqbmk1,Nielsly,,6,2025-05-28 17:07:08,,,,Part of the supply chain was always in China and has only gotten more advanced Moving it currently does not only involve labor costs for each step in the chain but also the economy of scale in the supply chain every brand produces in China or adjacent countries bringing the supply to the US would involve massive investments for a less efficiënt system also increasing costs,mupvd43,4.0,1kxexgh

comment,muu93dr,mten12,,1,2025-05-29 06:33:00,,,,I saw a video where a large bicycle creator in the USA used to do everything US based and made most bikes by hand Well after Walmart and other huge orders they had to ramp up facilities and over a decade moved some parts to china to be made then shipped here to be assembled because for example handle bars would cost 19cents or so each made to their custom spec and order After tariffs announced he found a USA metal producer add sent the plans and asked for a quote on a large order And was given like 9 per handlebar as an example Which would never happen for his company Almost the whole price of the bike or whatever he was saying This is a small example of why a complicated device like the iPhone will never be made on US Soil Not to mention the amount of workers needed to ramp production and such You could maybe maybe assemble them in America with the right tax incentives but that would still take 510 years to strike a deal and build and shift the supply chain,,0.0,1kxexgh
