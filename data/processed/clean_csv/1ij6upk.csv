comment,mbbpvxj,Fulcrous,,6,2025-02-06 17:27:02,,,,iCloud is not as reliable as you think either You are at the whims of another organizations policies If something goes down you cannot fix it yourself You are entirely dependent on an internet connection Cloud also has security and privacy risks recall Apple keeping nudes despite being deleted by the user You have slower access to larger filesfolders If theres downtime or service outages you have no way to access said data You still need physical backups Cloud can and will lose data as a result of human error accidental deletion or provider issues Theres a good reason no org with an IT team worth their salt only runs cloud for storage At least with physical storage you have choice I can back up everything on cloud based storage ie google driveor physical storage by storing files in my ssd a redundancy hdd or device or my own home server if I choose I only go as far as redundant drives and google drive for important photosvideosmusic which is is also set up to be done automatically when I plug my device to my computer but at least I have choice,mbbnhyk,3.0,1ij6upk

comment,mbcewba,SunsetCarcass,,0,2025-02-06 19:21:43,,,,I know its coloqually called the cloud but the data isnt being stored in thin air its still physical storage just on apples servers Might as well buy a 5TB external HDD for 100 and back up to that or buy 2 1TB HDD and back up on both Not sure how well Apple treats their consumers but you get like 5GB free cloud storage right So you could backup new photos there and move them to the HDD at your leisure then delete your cloud storage for more recently taken photos,mbbnhyk,3.0,1ij6upk
comment,mbcniyt,Redeem123,,2,2025-02-06 20:01:30,,,,Im aware that the cloud isnt literally a cloud But drives in data centers are treated WAY better than your typical household external drive For starters theyre better drives from the get go Theyre stored in a temperature controlled environment Theyre given maintenance They arent regularly plugged and unplugged They get steady power And most importantly they have built in redundancies Its not perfect but its a lot less likely to fail than a 100 Seagate drive and has nearzero chance of being spilled on dropped or otherwise lost due to human error Yes thats all stuff that you can do at home with relatively minimal technical skill But were talking about average users here and thats not something most people want to deal with,mbcewba,4.0,1ij6upk

comment,mbcr3r6,Nail_Biterr,,1,2025-02-06 20:18:03,,,,Phones really shouldnt be anything under 512 or even 1TB its crazy Storage is so cheap nowadays that I dont understand why phone companies are still being so cheap on this its like a 20 difference for 1TB to 2TB to buy an external hard drive I understand that its not apples to apples but still shouldnt be a 100 difference each upgrade to storage,,0.0,1ij6upk
comment,mbde4be,SolidOshawott,,3,2025-02-06 22:03:14,,,,I dont think 1TB of ultra compact low powered high speed storage is that cheap if you multiply by the number of phones sold That said the MacBook Airs recent RAM bump to 16GB indicated that the 8GB difference cost next to nothing despite previously being a 200 upgrade,mbcr3r6,1.0,1ij6upk

comment,mbdk2i7,None,,1,2025-02-06 22:31:51,,,,No You dont need to house that much media on your phone or pay for a cloud service subscription Its just ridiculous to pay for that stuff when a multi TB hard drive can be bought for very cheap and used as your storage You dont need ALL of your media accessible at once You also dont need to shoot video in 4k 60fps Some people need that storage but normal people at most just need a computer at home that can be used to store media and backup copies I consume a lot of media and Im barely pushing 6070 gb on my base model I think most people need to realize theyre buying shit hey dont need for reasons they dont understand,,0.0,1ij6upk
