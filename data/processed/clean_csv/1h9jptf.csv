comment,m11am3k,AshIsGroovy,,93,2024-12-08 14:44:55,,,,Right At a point Microsoft having a long history of not supporting their products or discontinuing them shortly after launch keeps people from buying the products from the get go Microsoft can and does make good stuff but the fact they dont believe in their own products isnt a great way to sell things I keep hoping that one day we get an android version of the ipad mini That tablet is a great size perfect for reading but even Google cant seem to make a decent tablet instead they do a weird hybrid home system with a base Jesus just give me a moderately priced tablet that has access to the google play store,m1171o4,1.0,1h9jptf

comment,m12lrit,Askymojo,,-4,2024-12-08 19:00:10,,,,Considering how unusably slow Android updates have made Pixel phones after just 3 years or so in the past I have a hard time believing people will still be able to use their 7 year old Pixel phone if they are still pushing new Android versions onto it Hopefully they just mean security updates and thats it,m11gyc0,5.0,1h9jptf
comment,m16a2tp,rolfraikou,,8,2024-12-09 10:20:46,,,,As someone who still owns a functioning pixel 1 that I used the crap out of as a phone until I finally upgraded the phone but have kept using the pixel 1 as a dedicated emulation device and passed down my pixel 3a to a room mate that had no issue using it I gotta say thats for some reason not the experience that everyone has with these devices,m12lrit,6.0,1h9jptf
comment,m11vyte,kidno,,-8,2024-12-08 16:46:17,,,,Honestly at this point its more lip service because phones are matured now and Google wants to do things in the cloud anyway So supporting multiple years of OS updates now doesnt mean what it did 3 years ago,m11gyc0,5.0,1h9jptf

comment,m13hyb7,AshIsGroovy,,5,2024-12-08 21:49:03,,,,The Band only lived for two years Lumia Smartphones made it three years and Zune and Groove made it the longest with six years However with all these examples of hardware Microsoft had very little support backing them out the gate or in some cases released them halfbaked and by the time they were fully cooked they were cut Even Xbox has been on the chopping block as recently as the current gen as with the Xbox One underperforming there was talk of exiting the market It was talked about after the Xbox and if the 360 hadnt been the hit it was Microsoft would have killed it then They have the money resources and talent but never want to give the products time to grow or be found by the consumer Ive been a big pixel fan since the OG and Google took its time and learned from each generation Imagine if they had just given up after the first or second gen,m13dlsy,3.0,1h9jptf

comment,m14r3vq,ElusiveGuy,,1,2024-12-09 02:18:41,,,,tldr Windows lifecycle support is historically longer than macOS Win11 requirements change things a bit M1 might change things but still in the same ballpark for now M1 was only released in 2020 Remains to be seen how long the support for it will be since they do own more of the hardware stack than previously Historically were looking at maybe 810 years support for macOS on older hardware As in right now in 2024 the oldest supported hardware is from 2017 Anything older is unsupported And even the 2017 hardware is only supported on previous versions of macOS that will EoL in 2025 or 2026 its already been dropped from latest Windows well Windows 1011 is a bit of an outlier since historically youve been able to upgrade just the OS side for well over a decade but the upgrade also wasnt free Win10 made the upgrade free but then Win11 introduced the first recentish processor limits in forever The support for a single OS version is 10 years from OS release date which is not tied to hardware so support for specific hardware ends up varying What does that look like Win11 supports processors from 2018 onwards so those will be good through at least 2031 10 years from Win11 release Win10 is EoL in 2025 and the last supported version for 2017 and older processors So also 8 years for Win10 with 20162017 CPUs 13 years minimum expected for Win11 with 2018 CPUs and easily over 20 years if you look back at the oldest CPUs Win10 supported All over the shop but lets go with 8 as a minimum about the same as current macOS plus or minus a year In all cases Im considering latest supported version of the OS for that hardware upgrades included Because if were talking about excluding supported upgrades like people who insist on staying on Win10 despite Win11 being supported on their hardware well you kinda have to apply the same idea to macOS which is only supported for 3 years per version So say you insist on staying on macOS 14 despite knowing itll EoL in 2 years and refuse to install macOS 15 thats kinda selfinflicted no,m1183a8,1.0,1h9jptf

comment,m11alnt,NeverComments,,-1,2024-12-08 14:44:50,,,,Apple will just as easily cut a product loose if the sales dont justify further investment they dropped support for that little 12 MacBook after just five years for example and their long term support is noncommittal Google promises a minimum of ten years for ChromeOS devices in contrast Well get what we get on Apples timeline whatever they decide that looks like A real concern for me with my M1 MacBook is how Apple will treat these devices once they reach EOL its not like you can easily replace macOS with an actively updated alternative given the lack of Bootcamp and limitations with Asahi Linux,m1183a8,1.0,1h9jptf

comment,m11b3qr,TheModeratorWrangler,,2,2024-12-08 14:48:04,,,,I guess thats good Its just that after multiple Surface products still have a Surface Book 2 I realized I was spending more time tinkering with OS hiccups and a lack of ease of use compared to a MBP iPad Pro combo Throw in AirDrop and its painfully obvious that Microsoft only now cares about profits over the customers like me who wanted anything BUT Apple until I finally caved Ive never been happier with a PC like my MacBook M2 Pro and its just mind blowing how Microsoft never learned Dont even get me started on trying to fix a Surface product while I can just walk into an Apple Store and be done with any hardware issues within the day,m11anbc,2.0,1h9jptf
