comment,m7321hv,just4browse,,5,2025-01-14 11:59:21,,,,It depends on the game and what issues arise during development Unless Im misremembering Metroid Prime 4 had to be restarted from scratch with another developer taking over which basically reset the clock,m72zgyq,5.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m73ohlb,sendymcsendersonboi,,1,2025-01-14 14:31:48,,,,I would actually imagine longer because more of the game hinges on immersion for the one singular player In multi player the replay able aspect makes up a more proportional ratio of the game development Im not a developer this is just my guess,m72zgyq,5.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m6zfsri,AuroraFinem,,16,2025-01-13 20:57:39,,,,I mean the switch is the only console I have specifically because of it being portable and the games on it like Pokémon If I just wanted to focus on graphics fidelity Id never use an Xbox or PlayStation in the first place Id use my computer Nintendo knows how to make their console stand out as something anyone could use regardless of what else they have Very few people nowadays have both an Xbox and a PlayStation but many many people have one of them and a switch Same with PC gamers if they have a PC to play games most people dont also have an Xbox or PlayStation but they likely have a switch Sometimes people will still get both for console exclusives but nowadays thats mostly only PlayStation who still refuses to release on PC but I doubt thats a high percentage,m6zcrpz,3.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m72algl,deSuspect,,2,2025-01-14 07:15:12,,,,The only reason switch is so popular is becouse of their exclusives If they allowed you to go play those game on other handhelds they would get absolutely dominated by steam deck,m6zfsri,4.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m703pmh,mattmaster68,,-2,2025-01-13 22:56:55,,,,Me with a Series X and a PS4 Im like 90 Bloodborne spoilerfree but not for long while my wife got a switch for Christmas lol Now all I need are 2 PCs looking at 4070 super Im looking to do software development Elden Ring modding try my hand at custom Mario Kart Wii tracks Blender modeling and animation and just all sorts of random miscellaneous things I mean paired with the right CPUfor CPUintensive things like Minecraft or Photoshop it would just dominate at 1440p across the board yeah,m6zfsri,4.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m7084e3,AuroraFinem,,0,2025-01-13 23:20:54,,,,Yeah you can almost always get better performance across the board for the same price if you build your own pc Even buying a prebuilt one you can like 90 of the same but depending on where you buy the upcharge for branded pcs like Alienware or using a gaming laptop will bump the price up Consoles are just PCs with a paired down OS The only time youd get better performance is when developers are too lazy to properly port their games over which has been a consistent issue for some game studios,m703pmh,5.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m6zyeom,ye_olde_green_eyes,,10,2025-01-13 22:29:09,,,,I can handle the 1080p in handheld If its not 60fps Im not buying it I get that the Switch was made from greymarket tablet parts from 2014 or whatever and I dont need their games to have photorealistic graphics but the framerate drop on games like the last 25d Zelda is ridiculous Just give me that 60fps,m6zcrpz,3.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m70ewnp,Stupidstuff1001,,1,2025-01-13 23:59:03,,,,Eh there are more nes success snes success game boy success virtual boy failure n64 success game cube failure Wii success Wii U failure switch success If you count gameboy color and the 3ds those would also be successes But Nintendo has done 3 big flops I personally think the switch 2 will be a failure as part of the switch hype was it being hard to get so everyone wanted it but Nintendo is going to over produce the switch 2 and ruin all that free hype Also if the rumors are true if only Mario kart being the new big game it might not be enough to entice people,m6zjn2c,3.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m70htnx,ninjapro98,,2,2025-01-14 00:15:21,,,,Well they said bad console not flop sales wise I dont think GameCube fits the criteria of bad console But is that the rumor I thought rumors were 3d Mario plus Mario kart and a few ports of 3rd party games at or near launch,m70ewnp,4.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m731rt4,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,1,2025-01-14 11:57:04,,,,I think the S2s success or failure as with other Nintendo consoles will rely entirely on the game catalog This is especially true with the advent of Steam handhelds If the new S2 games are playable on S1 itll likely fail as everyone keeps their S1 If the new gamesfirst party which is the only thing that matters on Nintendo consoles for S2 are bad itll likely fail,m70ewnp,4.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m6zgpo5,AuroraFinem,,2,2025-01-13 21:02:03,,,,If you look at their handheld line this doesnt really track though Most of their handhelds were all good upgrades even if not always necessary Like the advanced to advanced sp Theyve also said the switch 2 is backwards compatible with the switch so I mostly just view it as an overall spec upgrade standard so that new games dont have to keep supporting the old specs which might drag down their options for features Their oled switch had a speed bump for performance but games cant design specifically around that since they have to also be compatible on the base switch The switch 2 would give them the ability to set a new baseline,m6zdre4,2.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m6zm21a,stellvia2016,,-1,2025-01-13 21:27:51,,,,Yeah I noticed that in the spec sheet when it went to the smaller process node I had never seen anyone bring that up though as it would still be a decent little fps boost in games like TotK,m6zgpo5,3.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m757ww8,gatsby712,,1,2025-01-14 19:09:07,,,,The more accurate way of describing the Nintendo console cycle is that their mainline consoles are a revolutionary console enhanced console revolutionary console enhanced console NES revolutionary for Nintendo console and consumer products SNES Enhanced version of NES n64 revolutionary 3d Nintendo GameCube enhanced 3d graphics improved weird controller Wii revolutionary controller movement and controller accessories Wii U enhanced controllers with screens Switch revolutionary combination of mobile and console gaming Super Switch evolutionary combination of mobile and console gaming revolution of something profit You ended up getting people arguing about whether the consoles were good or bad or failures or successes which really isnt accurate Although the evolutionary consoles tend to not sell as well like the GameCube and Wii U,m6zdre4,2.0,1i0nkuw
comment,m70jlq7,RangedTopConnoisseur,,0,2025-01-14 00:25:11,,,,The Wii U wasnt a bad product just bad marketing Although I guess Nintendo could double down and eat shit again calling this the Switch U or something The only bad Nintendo console was the GameCube the last time they put out a nongimmick console that just could not compare to the PS2 and Xbox,m6zdre4,2.0,1i0nkuw

comment,m6zvjee,FlarblesGarbles,,0,2025-01-13 22:14:31,,,,Well that makes more sense However Id say that theyre targeting different segments Far more people are interested in what the Switch 2 has than what RDNA4 will have because youre getting down into the nerdy technical stuff with graphics architectures versus a complete all in one console,m6zurg1,5.0,1i0nkuw
