comment,n28czpa,Yalkim,,46,2025-07-09 19:27:36,,,,Oh yes that is what was wrong with AVP An uncomfortable strap and a chip that is not upgraded I am sure these changes will do wonders for the sales,,0.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28fg7k,LITTLE-GUNTER,,21,2025-07-09 19:38:51,,,,is there even a use case for this thing or is it still just for setting timers and putting browser windows in front of your toilet,,0.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28kalm,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-07-09 20:01:14,,,,I think the best usecase at the moment is 180360 video and volumetric photos Anyone who has experienced this in a Vision Pro knows that this is going to be a major part of how humans view videophotos in the future but would I spend 3500 just for that No chance I would say that the best usecase is Apples Persona avatars since its worlds better than a videocall but you need another person to have a Vision Pro so unlikely This is really just a lot of setup for a future where Apple can provide a consistent stream of immersive experiences solo or communal in a more affordable sleeker form factor Whoever cracks shared viewing of live volumetric sports is going to open themselves to a multibillion dollar submarket,n28fg7k,1.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28g3q5,superduperburger81,,8,2025-07-09 19:41:54,,,,I use mine very regularlymostly for a portable large screen to workgame off of Its a great companion for the Apple eco system That said I dont generally recommend to people unless they have disposable income and wont miss the money The comfort is one of the most complained about issues for a lot of people Mine is pretty comfortable but maybe because Im just used to it Im curious to see what benefits the spec bump adds I love using it when I travel fly to watch movies,n28fg7k,1.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28jahk,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,2,2025-07-09 19:56:37,,,,Seems like something like the Big screen beyond would be a much more affordable option that could perform most of the same functions,n28g3q5,2.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28lgii,tiptuppington,,10,2025-07-09 20:06:39,,,,By the time you have all the equipment needed to run the Bigscreen it ends up being about the same price And thats outside of the fact that theres a BOATLOAD of functionalities that youre getting with the Vision Pro that youre not getting with the Bigscreen Handtracking mixed reality eye tracking foveated rendering standalone functionality etc theres not really any proper comparison between these two,n28jahk,3.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28qt56,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,-1,2025-07-09 20:31:04,,,,A lot of people interested in VR already own the hardware that you connect to it anyway so most of them wouldnt consider that an extra cost,n28lgii,4.0,1lvrpuj
comment,n28lc05,superduperburger81,,10,2025-07-09 20:06:03,,,,BSB isnt compatible with Mac Also requires a base station and being tethered to a PC which means its not portable as a standalone device So no it does not do most of what I wanted,n28jahk,3.0,1lvrpuj

comment,n28odxp,narwhal_breeder,,3,2025-07-09 20:20:07,,,,If it cant run Mac apps whats the point Apple is infuriating because they put some of their most exciting professional hardware behind artificial software limitations so the only people who can work with it professionally dont actually need the extra horsepower The AVP would make an incredible software development device but apple doesnt allow it for whatever reason Instead all of Apples marketing material shows their 3499 standalone megadevice being used for email and typesetting,,0.0,1lvrpuj

comment,n28l07m,led76,,2,2025-07-09 20:04:33,,,,The outer screen should be the first thing they remove in a new version right I get that they arent able to redesign it for this release My question really is is it universally agreed that the screen is a flop and clearly not worth it,,0.0,1lvrpuj

comment,n2a36lw,BergaDev,,1,2025-07-10 00:42:04,,,,I hope the new strap will work on the old one I find the solo strap quite good for long days but do wish it was a bit better,,0.0,1lvrpuj

comment,n28iliy,Mastoraz,,0,2025-07-09 19:53:24,,,,Use it everyday love this device But releasing new version with just a chipset upgrade and new strap seems like a complete waste of time and effort I dont know why a lighter cheaper version isnt their priority first,,0.0,1lvrpuj
