comment,m99l13m,cntmpltvno,,57,2025-01-26 14:00:45,,,,Im one of these people The PS4 got me at a time when I didnt currently have a game system I got the PS4 because I had a buddy who had AC Black Flag and I was dying to play it through Fast forward a few years and I was once again without a console I tried going back to Xbox because thats what I grew up on and just couldnt fall back in love with it My friends games everything were all on PlayStation So I sold my Xbox Series X three weeks after buying it and bought my PS5 the same day Honestly when I bought the Xbox it seemed like a massive downgrade from even the PS4 Mostly shooters while games like the Last of Us Metro Horizon Zero Dawn etc were all PlayStation exclusives Sonys got me lock stock and barrel,m98vng8,1.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9d2san,skrimpbizkit,,4,2025-01-27 00:08:46,,,,I went the other way Grabbed a Ps5 and played it at launch but with news of Starfield and Call of Duty being a part of Game Pass I decided to get a Series X Fast forward a year and I havent turned my PS5 on since What I get I get with Xbox is simplicity I can play some of the simpler Game Pass games on my old laptop or cloud stream newer ones on my phone Ultimate is under 10 a month if you dont buy directly from Microsoft and and the catalogue rotates enough to have me checking back for new things Microsoft got me with their subscription model because it just works better for my lifestyle I dont really have time to deep dive into game reviews to buy the latest and greatest for 70 The last real Playstation game I bought at release was Final Fantasy XVI and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth,m99l13m,2.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9lmgt2,SolidOshawott,,1,2025-01-28 07:10:23,,,,I know But youre being a bit reductive either way since Xbox has many firstparty games that are not shooters and PlayStation also has a specific style for their firstparty games that I personally find a bit repetitive as well Ultimately you want real variety youre not getting it from those two companies One big advantage Xbox has is that Game Pass has a betterwider selection of indies than PS,m9iow6x,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9c6yxo,Dracogame,,13,2025-01-26 21:36:30,,,,Theres actually a really cool video analyzing that that I cant find Point is Sony did a lot of good things and learned a lot from the initial failure of the PS3 they bounced back really well Microsoft did the opposite it did some things well at the beginning but managed to fuck it all up later on and never recovered The Xbox One was pathetic compared to the PS4 Comparable online infrastructure worst and less exclusives 100 more expensive consistently worse on multiplatform games,m9aaw77,4.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9c8qwc,Abba_Fiskbullar,,6,2025-01-26 21:44:30,,,,Xbox put all of their eggs in the motion control and media player basket You could feel from their E3 presentation how secondary actually playing games was to being an all in one set top box and all the sweet sweet user telemetry they could grab from that using the Kinects ability to see who was watching what and when,m9c6yxo,5.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9cnd2r,DigitalSchism96,,2,2025-01-26 22:52:48,,,,And The fact the 360 sold only a few million less than the PS3 shows it was a very real competitor in the US market As you said it never had popularity elsewhere But it didnt need it It was doing better in the domestic market which was their main focus They lost that market with the Xbox One and never recovered The console war was very real for the 10s of millions of US gamers,m9aaw77,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9alibm,Dank-Drebin,,7,2025-01-26 17:10:39,,,,The Xbox didnt get close The 360 was ahead for most of the console life cycle There were webcomics about the low sales of the PS3 There were memes on Digg and Fark It wasnt until the slim release after they removed PS2 backwardscompatibility and lowered the price that they started to make up the difference I owned a PS3 and I own a PS5 btw in case you think Im arguing because of bias,m9ad6t7,6.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9asrz3,sometipsygnostalgic,,1,2025-01-26 17:45:10,,,,its not millions its one million lol ps3 had a much better end of life cycle than xbox what with Last of Us coming out so late it was also a more popular console in japan like you say and the japanese are power gamers so it made a difference,m9ad6t7,6.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9avntv,latunza,,2,2025-01-26 17:58:37,,,,Thats because MSFT practically gave up around 2010 2011 I remember they shot their load with the last Halo game and around 2012 came out with Gears Judgement That was it Meanwhile Sony kept pumping out game after game even if they werent the highest of quality to the point that between 20112012 it seemed like an exclusive via 1st or 2nd party was coming out every other week Games like God of War Ascension Sly Cooper Killzone 3 The last of Us Journey Ni No Kuni Motorsport Apocalypse etc and I could keep going There was a game for every type of gamer on top of that PSN was free and because of their data breach fiasco they were giving away real games or if you signed up for PS you were getting better games then gold I remember getting BioShock Infinite on PS a couple of months after it released The PS3 launched a year later that Xbox and Wii struggled between 0609 but by the end of 09 with the slim PS3 games like uncharted 2 and a more friendly advertising campaign that thing gave a MSFT a wallop in one of the most ball drop moves Ive ever seen a company do It might just be 2 million sales difference in the end but had Sony launched a year later then it wouldve probably been the winner by even larger margins The install base on the 360 was dominant and they just rested on their laurels like if gamers didnt get bored shifted priorities to the Xbox one with almost minor reasons for us to upgrade,m9asrz3,7.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9a2545,zefiax,,10,2025-01-26 15:36:39,,,,This is a bs excuse The Nintendo also has the WiiU launched at that time and recovered The reason they lost is because they did not have good enough exclusives and they continued to not have them And by the time they got them their execs had already given up and gone multiplatform,m98vng8,1.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9atdoa,sometipsygnostalgic,,14,2025-01-26 17:47:59,,,,nintendo did not recover until they made the nintendo switch which did a much better job captivating players than the xbox one sx or the series sx in some ways its not comparable because people simply dont choose to get games on switch instead of console they get the switch for switch exclusives or former pc exclusive indie games and then they use their console for everything else there is a symbiotic relationship rather than people choosing switch over the other two which is why ps4ps5 sales can be so high when the switch sales are this high whereas ps5 and xbox eat into each others sales,m9a2545,2.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9b57f8,i_need_a_moment,,2,2025-01-26 18:42:48,,,,Nintendo has no or at least didnt have any before 2020 competition People dont realize this has actual ramifications in that they can more easily bounce back,m9atdoa,3.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9bs1h4,sometipsygnostalgic,,3,2025-01-26 20:29:27,,,,thats right their only competition is themselves thats why they had to get rid of the 3ds after the switch came out,m9b57f8,4.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9cgwqy,Maktesh,,2,2025-01-26 22:22:44,,,,Its always why theyve done a poor job of remastering porting and making their games continuously available I was born and raised on Nintendo Then I was given a 360 and free Xbox Live Gold The amount of free or nearly free digital titles that quickly populated my account was insane I still have all of those games available on my Series X and I still plan to play several of them that I have yet to get to nearly 20 years later I enjoy my Switch But the fact that I cant boot up old titles of yesteryear is a major strike,m9bs1h4,5.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9a5y71,GoldenRamoth,,6,2025-01-26 15:55:29,,,,Nintendo is a bit different Its the family and kids console So it has a different market than PS and Microsoft though theyre starting to overlap again as they get more 3rd parties,m9a2545,2.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9a6dge,zefiax,,5,2025-01-26 15:57:33,,,,Similar recoveries have happened in the past PS3 was a disaster at launch yet they focused on good games and exclusives and ultimately ended up surpassing the 360 Ultimately its games that sell no matter how much Phil tries to claim otherwise,m9a5y71,3.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9bqh7n,i0pj,,1,2025-01-26 20:22:21,,,,What is Phil claiming My understanding is that Phil always understood this and was quite open about it Thats the reason why Microsoft went all in on buying gaming studios it however hasnt produced the games they want,m9a6dge,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9hs57x,i0pj,,1,2025-01-27 18:22:37,,,,Welp that explains a lot then I honestly thought he had the right intentions with purchasing better studios but I cant believe he thinks games wont win people over,m9gbrjw,6.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9abrbh,RealCrusader,,-3,2025-01-26 16:23:51,,,,Of course it did Of the 3 people i knew who had an Xbox they all had to send it back multiple times due to red ringing Xbox has never had a chance globally Did well in north America but nobody really wanted one in proper parts of the world,m9a6dge,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9cr8ud,Remy0507,,3,2025-01-26 23:11:23,,,,Theyre own model of pushing GamePass also makes it easier to not get fully invested in their ecosystem because you dont own any of it anyway As soon as you cancel your subscription its all gone Its like cancelling Netflix or Spotify If a different service offers something better theres really nothing holding you back from switching,m98vng8,1.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9fyycn,kizzgizz,,1,2025-01-27 12:46:23,,,,Tbh though from now on the way theyre building consoles it wouldnt be a problem alternating which console you pick up as theyre fully embracing backwards compatibility I skipped the ps4 but bought a ps5 Any games I missed on the 4 I can now play at a cheaper cost if picking up a 2nd hand disc I use my series x more as thats where my friends are but I could easily skip the next xbox and pick up the one after depending on what the console market looks like then Or I could skip the ps6 and get the 7 Same principle But this gen i ended up getting both and imo having both gamepass and ps has had me covered game wise for the last 8 months,m98vng8,1.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9cw79l,Remy0507,,8,2025-01-26 23:35:49,,,,Where are you getting that number from According to this list there are about 130 previous gen games that got boosted to 60 or 120 fps on the Series X Edit I cant post the link because links to the site I found it on Tech Radar are banned on this sub But if you Google it youll find it Im sure the number of PS4 games that were updated or had unlocked framerates for 60fps on PS5 is pretty similar in size,m9c7g0t,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9cwx4z,VoidMageZero,,1,2025-01-26 23:39:27,,,,Microsoft did an ad recently where they said basically any gaming device is an Xbox which kinda reminded me of Intels Im a gamer ad from a decade ago I think Microsoft is gonna basically rebrand gaming PCs andor do a deal with Steam to make dockable handheld Steam Deck clones into Xbox and then eventually kill the Xbox console itself Thats why theyre willing to port games to Nintendo Switch 2 the dedicated Xbox console market itself will get squeezed out and Xbox will just become Microsofts gaming brand,m9aikqi,2.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9dqt6d,Peteostro,,1,2025-01-27 02:09:31,,,,They wont do a deal with steam they will probably make their own version of windows optimized for gaming pcs hand helds It will have instant resume and joystick friendly interface Work with XboxPC game pass games can be installed and played without internet but also steam client and others can be installed All of Microsoft exclusive games will be on game pass 3rd parties will make the hardware but I wouldnt be surprised is MS made their own hand held to be the base system which 3rd parties will build upon,m9cwx4z,3.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9dtokz,VoidMageZero,,1,2025-01-27 02:23:16,,,,I dont think so because last year Valve seems to have decided against making a full console and just sticking with the Steam library and the Steam Deck They dont want to compete directly better for Microsoft Valve Nintendo etc to work together and grow the overall pie instead of fighting over their pie slices It will be Valves Steam library OEM hardware eg Lenovo Dell etc AMDNvidia GPU Microsoft facilitating the whole ecosystem and calling it Xbox to get a cut without having to do much work just like they are backing OpenAI to do the work in artificial intelligence They can run Game Pass like you said but competing directly with Steam is a hard and uphill battle for Microsoft,m9dqt6d,4.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9durno,Peteostro,,1,2025-01-27 02:29:00,,,,Thats why I said Microsoft will do this Valve will have nothing to do with it Steam will just work because its windows Microsoft will make money off the windows licensing and game pass Its not hard to see There are already windows handhelds MS just need to optimize windows for gaming and controller UI I wouldnt count MS out of the handheld hardware either,m9dtokz,5.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9dvqrj,VoidMageZero,,1,2025-01-27 02:33:56,,,,Microsoft can do the custom gaming version of Windows like you said the deal can simply be to preload the Steam app on the Xbox handheld console That way Valves OS and Steam Deck market share is reduced in exchange for using the Steam library and Microsofts OS benefits in exchange for the game library Microsoft OS Valve game library OEM hardware Otherwise I dont see why Microsoft would open up their games to porting for Nintendo on the Switch 2 I think Microsoft is moving away from hardware and focusing more on pure software which is their area of expertise Sure Microsoft can do their own hardware too like Google makes the Pixel in the smartphone market but were not talking about big money here It would be like the Surface lineup kind of a niche product just to stay in the game,m9durno,6.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9dz1pc,VoidMageZero,,0,2025-01-27 02:50:53,,,,Yeah and thats redundant Which customer is going to buy a Windows handheld Steam handheld Nintendo handheld If everyone competes on everything like both Microsoft and Valve both go for handheld console hardware OS games library theyre going to be fighting on every segment which is going to fragment the market and hurt profits If Microsoft focuses on winning the OS and Valve specializes on the library they both win at the same time without having to compete directly,m9dy3ez,10.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9b02z8,VanillaSoftArtist,,3,2025-01-26 18:19:11,,,,Honestly it seems most consoles that focused on media features as a major selling point did poorly PS2 didnt but I dont know if the DVD movie aspect was marketed so heavily by Sony itself I feel it was more word of mouth with Sony focusing on benefits of DVD for games more space With the other ones it seems when they focused on media stuff they forgot about other things PS3 marketed itself as a media centre The XMB interface was built around it the shit has printer support The hardware justified the price especially with the builtin PS2 but it clearly failed until the 2009 rebranding Wii U focused on some TV connection It failed Xbox One basically repeated the PS3 fiasco only much worse as it actively seemed to screw gamers over with things like DRM It failed For what its worth I personally am nostalgic for how the seventh generation placed great emphasis on media functions I love the PS3 and Xbox 360 But it was something that like you say made a touch less sense going into the 2010s,m9auap8,5.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9a1qq3,wingspantt,,2,2025-01-26 15:34:39,,,,Sure but Wii U was a commercial flop and clearly meant to be a 15 successor to the Wii regardless The Wii is one of the most successful consoles of all time but due to its controls and the discs a lot of its best games cant be played as they were meant to play on any other system The Switch is so unique even the Switch 2 wont be able to play some of the games that use the Joy Cons in specific ways Dont get me started on the DS3DS But all this isnt just negative It means the systems also come with no baggage You dont feel like youre losing your old games when you buy a Nintendo system because you really would have never had them either way,m9a0qy9,6.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9a499m,VanillaSoftArtist,,2,2025-01-26 15:47:05,,,,I see what you mean Yeah Nintendos sheer control methods make playing some of these games a nightmare if you dont own the original hardware Like how with Mario 64 DS youre forced to use the mouse to properly turn the camera or tiptoe if youre emulating it Or how you have to emulate so many Wii motion controls that youve run out of sticks,m9a1qq3,7.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m98lbkx,SomeBoxofSpoons,,11,2025-01-26 08:45:01,,,,Theres obviously pretty industrywide issues happening right now but in the console space you have to be reaching pretty hard to look at the gap between PS5 and Xbox sales estimates were 5 to 1 for November and not think that console exclusives matter I dont even have either console the writings just on the wall that Xbox as a hardware brand is on its last legs and its not hard to see why,m98kkia,5.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m98ooew,SomeBoxofSpoons,,6,2025-01-26 09:19:07,,,,Well when its two options trying to compete for the same experience why wouldnt they Obviously both companies are putting their games on PC at least postlaunch now but as much as some people on sites like this try and pretend otherwise PC is the enthusiast option and not really what Sony or Microsoft are actually trying to compete with Even with several features that a lot of people seem to prefer from what I can tell on the outside Xbox hasnt been able to get anywhere to close to Sonys quantity and quality of games for nearly 15 years which is why the Wii U was the only thing keeping the Xbox One out of third place by the end of that generation Again by the end of the last generation PS4 was pretty much the nextgen console so when the next generation started and it took Xbox a year to get anything to really have a marquee Series X game the options basically ended up being default console and default console but with less games And of course thats just continued until the current state of things Obviously the nature of exclusives for consoles has changed but I dont know if weve ever had a generation better demonstrate that they matter,m98lyrx,7.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m98qit4,SomeBoxofSpoons,,3,2025-01-26 09:37:56,,,,Sonys biggest issue this generation is not being able to get people excited about the PS5 and a lot of that is because they know theyre on top now and theyre acting like they dont need to try The PS5 has no games joke came back because they havent been putting out that many games exclusive to the platform which we now know is partially because they tried to put most of their devs on live service forever games hoping theyll catch on Just compare the way people talk about it to the amount of buzz Nintendo just got when they announced the Switch 2 People get more excited for something when they know theres stuff to get excited about instead of it just being something they have to buy if they want to play modern games,m98plrq,9.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9a57jq,demonsta500,,1,2025-01-26 15:51:48,,,,since Microsoft sales figure are ultimately more reliable than any other estimate Do they even provide actual sales figures anymore Last I heard they just say sales grewfell by a certain from last year And even they say Xbox sales are cratering every year by dropping 3040 YoY,m99jjga,3.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m98s0tf,MultiMarcus,,-3,2025-01-26 09:53:09,,,,The interesting part would be if there are going to be fewer PS5 Series consoles owners than PS4 and Xbox One owners How many people will be dropping the consoles in favour of PC and how many in favour of the Switch and Switch 2 and even mobile,,0.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m99joak,VanillaSoftArtist,,2,2025-01-26 13:52:09,,,,I dont see PC gaming becoming mainstream unless its simplified like with what theyve attempted with those handheld units One thing to remember the average person is not technologically intelligent They can use an iPhone no problem but put them in front of a laptop and they will have problems Even in the present PC games need more tinkering than one would be comfortable with I can see people continuing to buy a PlayStation and Nintendo together or one of the two Nintendo has the exclusives but Sony has the power and still has exclusives if you treat PC like a completely different market which Id argue it is,m98s0tf,1.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m99me4p,MultiMarcus,,-1,2025-01-26 14:09:13,,,,Yeah but the thing is the PC market is growing in a country like Japan Unless were supposed to believe that the PC market grew without at all affecting the console market then that would be to some degree fewer console players unless the console market grew more at the same time obviously but the point is the same I think a lot of PC gamers are far too dramatic about how hard a PC is to use A 12yearold family friend is buying a PC instead of a console because thats what is cool with his generation Yeah PCs need more work but at the same time almost everyone has a laptop for work so theyve probably already used a PC operating system though it is quite possible that they would be using Mac and not Windows but the differences arent that major Yeah most people would probably be buying prebuilts but I dont necessarily think everyone whos a PC gamer has to be a PC builder I think theres a sense of elitist superiority from PC gamers a lot of the time but that isnt really reflected in reality If you buy a prebuilt PC you dont really have to do that much finicking anymore Nvidia even has their app which just optimises games for you Not to mention how consoles have got far more confusing in settings menus with options like upscaling frame generation and even more granular options than any period of gaming in the past PC also has a lot more games too You get basically every single game thats not a Sony title or a rockstar title but theyll usually arrive about a year or two after launch Treating PC gamers as a completely separate market from consoles is just outdated because we know without any real discussion that people are buying gaming PCs and at a shocking rate The 36 million concurrent steam users arent just playing on their MacBooks Discreet graphics cards have become common Steam has 132 million users which is more than twice the amount of PS5s sold I think nerds are desperate to keep their hobby nerdy but lets be honest PC gaming isnt a nerd hobby anymore its for everyone Here is an interesting article from PC gamer talking about how the gaming market isnt just consoles anymore Also I think the people who are that technologically illiterate that they think PC is scary They might just be buying the Nintendo switch which is the console for the technologically illiterate people not the PS5 thats being sold based on ray tracing and teraflops,m99joak,2.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9b4rfg,VanillaSoftArtist,,1,2025-01-26 18:40:45,,,,Im not desperate to keep PC gaming some nerd hobby I acknowledge it has many players That said many still prefer simplicity and view computers as something more complicated A lot of younger people dont even have computers now instead being raised through phones and tablets Hence why I mentioned the confusion PC gaming is growing but its a fundamentally different market because those users dont expect the ease you get with a console interface Consoles are limited but theyre also far simpler I could get my mother into a PS5 if she were interested but itd be hell introducing her to Steam or the various other PC launchers,m99me4p,3.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9b596y,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-01-26 18:43:01,,,,Except clearly PC gaming is growing from somewhere I postulated that it is from a lot of former console players who maybe had a console when younger and once they got more disposable income they might have switched to PC,m9b4rfg,4.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9b6a6s,VanillaSoftArtist,,1,2025-01-26 18:47:44,,,,Yes its growing but its still a more highend market Consoles have a 500 entry fee for tons of games while a decent PC can go into the thousands If you need a laptop with smaller space prepare to pay higher While console prices are getting concerning they still have an appeal to the people not trying to spend a fortune on a device for playing games,m9b596y,5.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m99mrmm,JM062696,,5,2025-01-26 14:11:31,,,,PC is way too expensive to just jump into The obvious choice is PlayStation for someone jumping in Otherwise you need to spend at the VERY LEAST 1000 to build a decent gaming PC spend 200 on a monitor buy all your peripherals like mouse and keyboard have a table and space to set it all up on etc once you have all the stuff PC just seems like the best option but to jump into it from scratch is a large undertaking when you could just run to Best Buy and get a very decent gaming experience through a ps5 for half the price,m98s0tf,1.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m99oy2d,MultiMarcus,,-3,2025-01-26 14:24:41,,,,No the obvious choice is the Nintendo Switch Also lets stop pretending like gaming is an expensive hobby There are enough people doing horse riding or ballet dancing or skiing that you can be a PC gamer no problem Not to mention how a PC can actually be used for other stuff too A console is a dedicated gaming device a gaming PC can act as your at home workstation and as a gaming platform I understand that consoles are definitely cheaper but the numbers arent far enough away from one another that someone picking up gaming as a hobby or who has played games for a very long time will just discount PC So many console gamers get tired of the inflexible prices and weird arbitrary restrictions on game availability undecided that instead of buying the PS5 after their PS4 theyll just get a PC which might cost a bit more upfront but they wont have to pay for online Theyll be able to get games discounted theyll be able to emulate theyll be able to use old games and theyll even be able to use it for work,m99mrmm,2.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m99u4oi,JM062696,,0,2025-01-26 14:54:38,,,,The obvious choice is Switch if youre a child or you dont care about frame rates or graphics or you just wanna play Nintendo exclusives Gaming most certainly is an expensive hobby if you dont have a console or any games Anyone can go to a used game store and buy used stuff Many people dont use windows anymore anyways they prefer MacOS I dont have a Mac Im just saying what I see,m99oy2d,3.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9a4mf4,zefiax,,1,2025-01-26 15:48:54,,,,No ultimately it doesnt If you can sell your console then you not only make money on your own games but you get a cut of every game sold for your console Ultimately that is much more profitable than just being a third party developer Microsoft is just hosting that fact by buying up studios like Activision and then claiming their revenue is up It is but only because you just added a whole bunch of existing studios revenue to it,m99nd2f,2.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9gc3jx,zefiax,,1,2025-01-27 14:09:25,,,,34 million people are not gonna give you 20 a month every month in practice What most will do is wait for a great game they actually want to play release get gamepass for that month finish it then cancel Thats why this whole gamepass model has not lived up to expectations,m9b3uri,4.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9gi78f,zefiax,,0,2025-01-27 14:43:35,,,,The number you are quoting is from a year ago What is it now I have had active gamepass subscriptions plenty of times but I cancelled last year because I wasnt using it consistently Most of my friends did the same Can you point to me where microsoft has released current numbers and not numbers from a year ago EDIT Also to clarify on bias I am 12 years old Ive owned an OG xbox xbox 360 and xbox one and I passed on the XSX because microsoft claimed that you can play all the games day 1 on PC which is exactly what I have taken advantage of Yes I also have a PS5 and a switch but I am too old for console wars I did that back in the genesis and snes days and then grew up,m9ggp3t,6.0,1i9v5s5

comment,m9im2ql,MobileVortex,,0,2025-01-27 20:42:20,,,,what exactly are you saying then Of course I dont have numbers are you trying to say that because the price rose and you and 2 of your freinds dont pay for it that the number is down below 10mil or something even if it was cut in half that is still 200 million a month recurring revenue is all any company cares about and its why Sony is now offering their own version If any company knows how to print its microsoft What even if your point here,m9gvgf6,11.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9ior9y,zefiax,,0,2025-01-27 20:54:52,,,,My point is if this was really successful they would be reporting and publishing the numbers The fact that they dont indicates that this is not panning out to how they expected it to go We do not know if their subscriptions have increased or decreased We do not know what their revenue is specifically for gamepass We do not know if the revenue and profit they make from gamepass is equivalent to what they would be making from game sales on their console Is the money from gamepass equal to how much they would have made selling the game directly to the consumer We dont even know if it truly is recurring revenue because we dont know how many people are keeping an active subscription and how many are like me and subscribe when a game they want to play is released and then unsubscribe as soon as they finish the game Ultimately we dont know any of this because Microsoft stopped reporting these figures The fact that they stopped reporting usually implies it is not going as impacted All we have is that data indicates premium sales drop 80 when the game is on gamepass Which to me makes perfect sense Gamepass has basically allowed me to play games that I would have paid full price for for 20 sub or 40 at best if the game takes me two months to finish Great for me save me 60 but I dont see how that is financial viable in the long term My point is we dont actually know if gamepass is still successful,m9im2ql,12.0,1i9v5s5
comment,m9k3mm9,MobileVortex,,0,2025-01-28 01:10:39,,,,How do you define successful What value do you place on the games that I would have never played if game pass didnt exist Game pass has led to me discovering and buying other games there is more too successful than did X game make as much as it possibly could How do you value Game Pass as a community branding tool Recurring revenue is not only valued higher because generally it means you make more but also because its more stable You buying game pass a few times a year is recurring I think you and thegamercom are missing a large part of the picture here but I cant say Im surprised,m9ior9y,13.0,1i9v5s5
