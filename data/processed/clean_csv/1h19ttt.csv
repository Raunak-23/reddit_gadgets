comment,lzafpy6,TheRealBobbyJones,,171,2024-11-27 19:25:48,,,,Yeah but its a pretty simple device If you want the ability to open the garage door using your phone you will either need a bridge or a smart garage door opener The problem is that software and hardware standards update regularly Throw in security updates and you can see why products end up being outdated quite rapidly Also your garage door opener probably has poor security that wouldnt be tolerated in a modern iot product For all of the old garage door openers I can create a copy of their remote effectively granting me access to most garages in America If a iot product had that sort of vulnerability consumers would be upset Its the security updates and WiFi standards that messes with things I had a wireless camera installed that only worked on 24ghz or whatever it was Somehow we had a WiFi router installed that only supported 5 GHz or whatever That essentially forced the installed camera to be useless,lz9wzrw,1.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzctzyn,notfork,,23,2024-11-28 04:01:27,,,,This but also a lot of the higher end read expensive not better routers are shifting to a single band or forcing smart steering or just making it be on by default it causes so many issues I bought a 25gb router and its default config wanted to keep smart steering on,lzaw68n,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzagipb,None,,15,2024-11-27 19:29:57,,,,Right Wouldnt they sell a modern radio box that adapts to older openers It would be stupid not to Because sheesh I think the opener my Grandma uses in her barn garage is almost 40 years old if not FIFTY and it has the exact same remote Yes its the same brand as my opener EDIT Its a 1988 Allister Type IIa EDIT Allister is Allstar The company changed their name,lzafpy6,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzahuih,TheRealBobbyJones,,19,2024-11-27 19:36:53,,,,I was googling how insecure old garage door openers are After 97 they started to use rolling codes Of course I doubt most of them switched instantly and if you have a remote where you can set the code then you are definitely not using a rolling code version For the older style that dont have rolling codes you can definitely create a bridge using a radio box Assuming you mean to have phone control of your door Although honestly I bet most garage door openers have a hardwired input meant to be connected to a switch on the inside You can connect that to a smart switch which could then be connected to your router,lzagipb,3.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzavvm8,JukePlz,,9,2024-11-27 20:50:48,,,,Even with rolling codes a lot of the earlier ones are bound to bel using the KeeLoq blockcipher that is subject to several attacks Its really hard to harden security against jamming and replay attacks,lzahuih,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzctqnq,ptoki,,1,2024-11-28 03:59:35,,,,Sure but in practice a can opener can successfully defeat garage doors Not to mention such things No really reason to make locks better if you can circumvent them Especially in places where homes are built with plywood plaster board and paper And in places where concrete and bricks are the way to go you need to put metal bars in windows first and then it makes sense to improve the lockscodes But if you want to improve things on lock side then kust make the transmitter and receiver modular so the users can improve the encryption No matter which one they use it should be easily modifiable Like lock rekeying,lzavvm8,5.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzb8k8b,Leafy0,,4,2024-11-27 21:57:14,,,,Why use the radio to control it Just use a smart relay in parallel with the hard wired wall switch,lzahuih,4.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzaibtj,None,,5,2024-11-27 19:39:21,,,,2001 the remote is programmed via DIP switches I wonder if it could be modified to use a rolling code system I doubt the opener was first introduced in 2001,lzahuih,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzar8c5,TheRealBobbyJones,,3,2024-11-27 20:26:20,,,,Yeah that style can definitely be controlled using third party radios I think I had a car with a built garage door opener that would literally just copy and replay the signal your remote makes I think it might have been an 09 Corolla Edit I also think rolling code door openers can be programmed to new remotes but honestly idk how that would work,lzaibtj,5.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzcc1fn,Lotronex,,2,2024-11-28 02:00:00,,,,I got this controller that does exactly this for my 15 year old garage door openers Was easy to wire the doors up just had to remove the old doorbell style button that was on there Also install a sensor on the door that tells the controller if the door is open or closed You can control it from the app or Alexa and even program the doors to open or close at certain times like if you want to make sure it doesnt stay open all night if you forget You can also get alerts sent whenever the door is openedclosed Even made a nice wood panel to mount the control box onto,lzagipb,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzikhf4,Tom-Dibble,,1,2024-11-29 04:44:16,,,,Controllers like the Meross ones just essentially act like the hardwired wall button ie they wire into your opener on the same wires that go to the big wall button when you tell it to open the door it just presses the button closes the circuit going through the button It also has a separate wired sensor so it knows when the door is opened vs closed although unlike a firstparty integrated solution it has no idea if the door is opening or closing or stuck halfway open etc just that it is or is not fully closed With those you can either disable the builtin radio or on newer openers with rotating keys have it forget all remotes,lzagipb,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzgrhor,ptoki,,-1,2024-11-28 21:11:30,,,,Sort of I will spare you long post so in short Homes dont need much automation Literally a handful of things HVAC already done mostly garage doors lights also done or simple to do Maybe a window blind or two garden watering presence detection Thats it The non obvious automations are already there since ages Microwaves fridgesfreezers are automated since always The really non obvious automations has been outsourced Remember jetsons and the robot cleaning dishes or cooking meals Yup frozen pizza bags of buns and bread blocks of cheese canned and jared food That is all that robot But not at home its in the factory That is home automation outsourced Pretty obvious right My point is There is not much to automate at home now Literally few classes of things most of that is onoffstatus plus very simple if this then that usually less than 34 conditions each That means building it is very very simple and opensource can do that And there are projects which does that The issue is Vendors are scared of that and they put a ton of money to convince you that their cloud is needed They make things which have literally just one reset button and very obscure ways to hook up the device to their cloud That is intentional But I think soon we will popularize the open source alternatives The required element is PeoplesCustomers awareness Education about how to manage your own stuff Willingness to learn and take care of your stuff,lze7qn6,4.0,1h19ttt

comment,lze6gej,OneBigBug,,2,2024-11-28 11:44:47,,,,you can do a lot more with smart devices I think a big problem with most smart devices is thatyou cant actually because almost all appliances are almost useless unless youre physically in front of them anyway Like Id rather not have some random bullshit connected to my network when the alternate solution is have a spare remote which is probably a good idea anyway,lzcr7ln,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzegqo6,Macabre215,,2,2024-11-28 13:12:18,,,,If you want the ability to open the garage door using your phone This has always sounded like an insanely insecure thing to set up Why the hell anyone would want this is kind of perplexing,lzafpy6,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzex661,TheRealBobbyJones,,1,2024-11-28 15:02:15,,,,As discussed garage door openers are already insanely insecure A WiFi based door opener could probably be made much more secure than what most people already have,lzegqo6,3.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzzt3em,Macabre215,,1,2024-12-02 05:27:21,,,,Having anything connected to the Internet makes it far more insecure than using a system thats air gapped I have zero need for opening my garage door over the Internet If youre talking about a system that has zero access to the web then Im all for it,lzex661,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzih8wx,gwicksted,,1,2024-11-29 04:18:50,,,,Hmm We need a standard bus wire protocol between the micro controllers that host sensors and motors so we only need to swap out or flash an MCU for security updates without replacing every component Something rugged and battle tested that we can interface with easily I know Well call it the Controller Area Network Crap I just described CAN BUS And its a mess Good thing we have USB and Bluetooth Those are simple protocols right s,lzafpy6,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzantm9,Pauly_Amorous,,-6,2024-11-27 20:08:17,,,,The problem is that software and hardware standards update regularly Throw in security updates and you can see why products end up being outdated quite rapidly Outside of gaping security holes that cant be patched due to a fundamental flaw in the protocol maybe standards shouldnt update quite so regularly to the point where they break existing products Imagine if you had to tear your house down and rebuild it every 1020 years because you needed a new roof and the standards changed to the point where new roofs werent compatible with your existing house,lzafpy6,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzbqcye,achillies665,,3,2024-11-27 23:41:38,,,,To use your example imagine there was a storm directed at your house that your roof would not stop To be a bit more accurate think of it like a road that many people need to drive on It needs to be constantly updated to resist the storms thrown at it by malicious actors Not updating the road would expose many drivers to risk and harm,lzantm9,3.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzc1ve6,Pauly_Amorous,,1,2024-11-28 00:54:43,,,,Not updating the road would expose many drivers to risk and harm Ideally you could update the road without changing it such that people have to buy new cars in order to drive on it,lzbqcye,4.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzbd6mk,BellsBot,,7,2024-11-27 22:22:32,,,,As the other poster said security updates Old garage openers work well but theyre incredibly insecure also power hungry I resolved the issue on mine by making my own add on unit that hooks into it with bluetooth and LoRa support which vastly updates the security but the vast majority of people do not have the know how time or ability to do that nor to maintain doing firmware updates to such a system,lz9wzrw,1.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzbf6kz,None,,3,2024-11-27 22:33:51,,,,This is what I kind of mentioned in a few follow up comments Something in relation to modules and addons that can be hooked up to existing units and you also took the words right out of my mouth Most people dont have the time or knowledge to modify their units on a way to better the security Not only that I dont think many would shell out the cash for a feature packed opener very fast Sure Theyll sell but its almost always the cheaper less featurepacked model that sells Almost,lzbd6mk,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzdi5uo,nagi603,,3,2024-11-28 07:25:29,,,,Yeah many if not most old radiocontrolled stuff can be defeated by replaying the signals Which takes what 15 Not really important for window blinds but for an egress into the house,lzbd6mk,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzeqc4g,ItzWarty,,1,2024-11-28 14:19:22,,,,Old garage openers are more secure than modern garage openers for typical laypeople What are you more concerned about 1 Some random stalker painstakingly bruteforcing or replaying your garage door which would require custom hardware and reasonable expertise 2 Some random hacking group dumping your cloudbased garage door accounts personal information onto the dark web and maybe remotely triggering your garage door for fun accessing your garage door openers camera feed and maybe mining bitcoin or running a botnet on that device For example yeah a 12bit pin used by an analog remote is insecure as is keeping your front door unlocked but thats far more OK if youre not internetconnected,lzbd6mk,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzf9lwk,BebopFlow,,1,2024-11-28 16:13:06,,,,Youre absolutely right Yes someone could spoof the radio signal and get in Someone could also justbreak a window If someone is determined enough to do the former theyll probably just resort to the latter first since its easier The IoT device opens up a lot more vulnerability because it can be used to remotely track your activity which can let people know when to rob you which is far more valuable than the ability to enter the home in the first place and since its on your network its vulnerabilities also make your other devices more vulnerable,lzeqc4g,3.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzh82lb,BellsBot,,0,2024-11-28 22:54:17,,,,No if there is a flaw which is easy to use that will be used like with recent car thefts due to some flaw that allowed the security to be bypassed You really have no idea what youre talking about neither bluetooth which is just a constant advert or LoRa do any sort of tracking,lzf9lwk,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzh7oik,BellsBot,,1,2024-11-28 22:51:41,,,,Old remotes generally have a key with DIP switches to set the code so no you dont need expensive equipment to break into them Some random hacking group dumping your cloudbased garage door accounts personal information onto the dark web Account Its literally a bluetoothLoRa module with code I made there is no account there is nothing to steal accessing your garage door openers camera feed Why would a garage door have a camera and maybe mining bitcoin or running a botnet on that device Its a cortex m0 youre taking a tonne of tripe here,lzeqc4g,3.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzh8kal,ItzWarty,,1,2024-11-28 22:57:37,,,,Old remotes generally have a key with DIP switches to set the code so no you dont need expensive equipment to break into them The custom hardware is that there are a variety of remotes varying from trivial everyone in the neighborhood gets their door opened because I sent some pulse on some frequency vs I send a sequence of pulses vs I use a rolling code Why would a garage door have a camera Many many smart garage doors are nowadays internet connected w cameras This allows them to make subscription money for services like MyQ or security feeds Account Its literally a bluetoothLoRa module with code I made there is no account there is nothing to steal If youre DIYing your own garage door thats a pretty different situation from buying some random massproduced garage door opener If youre a new homeowner theres a good chance you didnt pick your garage door and your builder picked the cheapest option possible,lzh7oik,4.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzb32hl,FarhadTowfiq,,132,2024-11-27 21:28:22,,,,The FTC is basically saying Hey if youre selling smart gadgets let people know how long theyll actually work Think about something like a smart thermostat if it still controls the temperature but stops getting updates it could become a security risk or lose features The FTC wants companies to be upfront about how long theyll support stuff so people dont get stuck with expensive tech thats halffunctional after a few years,,0.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzbgub8,nerdy_volcano,,13,2024-11-27 22:43:24,,,,Great in theory difficult in practice Products are sold over multiple years and while at the start of their sale time period the manufacturer knows what security standards need to be met 5 years later those have evolved a lot and the hardware may no longer be capable of doing the new requirements These new regulations develop quicker than the hwsw product lifecycle On top of that if manufacturers need to legally say what they can support and they dont know all the variables the companys legal team is going to be conservative as possible and only guarantee support over the stated warranty period unless they have invented a crystal ball Just look at how everyone responded to the UK PSTI act last year On top of those consumer hardware products are often in market for much longer than a company can control due to distribution pipelines ie you buy something on Amazon and not direct from the manufacturer So while it would be ideal to do this you need a lot of folks working together law makers regulatory bodies and manufacturers in tight conjunction Its hard to get everyone rowing in the same direction quickly as different countries have different laws and the same exact product is sold in many countries and needs to meet all of those individual country regulations Tldr buy IoT products from established companies that have historically offered long support and when youre in the market buy the latest and greatest not the cheaper last years model itll save you money and headaches in the long term,lzb32hl,1.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzffiz6,FarhadTowfiq,,3,2024-11-28 16:45:25,,,,Youre spot on about the challenges especially with security standards evolving faster than product lifecycles and the whole distribution pipeline issue But thats why the FTCs push feels importantits less about manufacturers predicting the future perfectly and more about setting realistic expectations upfront Even if companies can only promise support for a conservative time frame at least consumers will have a clearer idea of what theyre buying into Totally agree with your TLDR though sticking to reputable brands and newer models is the safest bet right now while all these pieces hopefully come together,lzbgub8,2.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzfhra4,nerdy_volcano,,2,2024-11-28 16:57:28,,,,Thats what Im trying to communicate if Im setting those expectations up front theyre going to only be the length of the product warranty Not any longer Consumers expect software to last forever despite manufacturers communicating their warranty,lzffiz6,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzfh66v,nerdy_volcano,,1,2024-11-28 16:54:18,,,,Mechanical engineering requirements dont change over time Software has living breathing requirements If my SOCs OS has a security vulnerability that cant be changed without changing the processor theres no way to fix once its in someones home Many things can be changed and supported over time just not everything Its the equivalent of saying that you need to add a new button to a product that is already in someones living room Its possible but at some point its not practical to ask for all the products to come back to the factory for rework And while sw engineers can give you a timeline its going to be way shorter than what anyone is happy with Its going to be the warranty length typically only 12 years,lzfeoj4,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzbiq0t,CatWeekends,,15,2024-11-27 22:54:28,,,,I like the idea at a surface level but I dunno how youd ever get it to work in practice Ive handed products off from team to team within a company and thats almost always a mess To hand it off to the public would require a pretty monumental effort on both ends Youd need bare minimum for a supportable product a team of dedicated volunteers willing to take ownership of the code product weeks to months time spent learning the code base write tools to let people update things locally rewrite their server software to work outside their stack and spend money hosting it or write custom firmware that works outside their cloud figure out how to get that info to the customers existing device retool the software build process to work outside their stack write up lots of docs telling people how to do things the new way Some of that may not even be possible from a technical standpoint due to things like ancient software not having any modern installable counterpart or even realistic because of licensing and patents,lzajef5,1.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzbuqd0,swolfington,,15,2024-11-28 00:09:27,,,,one othe biggest hurdles I imagine will be from the fact that a lot of the source code for these devices probably leverage codelibraries that are not owned by the widgetmaker themselves and if were talking about a bankruptcy situation there might not be anyone left in the organization who has the technical knowhow to separate the stuff they own vs the stuff they dont not even to mention i can only imagine how many GPL violations are happening behind the scenes i suspect a huge amount the of pushback wed see from an effort like this would be from organizations who dont want us to know theyre pirating code,lzbiq0t,2.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzg3lqh,sayn3ver,,1,2024-11-28 18:56:31,,,,Why are so many companies now running Linux on their servers with open source software Open source doesnt inherently mean vulnerability If anything vulnerabilities are seen by any active development member of the community The issue imho is proprietary closed source software only relying on a small team or a privately hired security firm being paid and attempting to look for vulnerabilities Look at some of the larger open source software projects in the world Lots of robust software out there Outside of the big playersdont really believe they care either I dont trust small iot companies to even care about security from day 1 Its a get rich quick scam combined with an environmental disaster Just as I dont assume anything being drop shipped sold from the Chinese Ali expresstemuamazonebay reseller to have any real warranty or expected lifespan These values of no accountability lack of quality and disposable nature are a key component driving capitalist economies and consumer spending Its also demanded by the average consumer I understand the majority have limited budgets and poor wages but its really a disservice always shopping the cheapest price Although even that cannot fully be blamed because unregulated businesses have shown time and time again they value maximizing profit over everything else so why pay more for a possibly better product if the consumer assumes the company is offering the same junk with just extra branding marketing or additional profit over the cheaper product No profits in durable goods effective medical treatments or secure software,lzbhd45,3.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzb9un3,icefire555,,11,2024-11-27 22:04:04,,,,You might be right on some things but there are some pretty big changes that happened in the last few years like 1 click subscription cancelations to stop hostile subscription services that pray on making canceling hard the google antitrust which is about to split them up and separate their ad business from chrome which will likely save ad blockers launching anti trust cases against amazon microsoft meta And Im likely forgetting a lot of other things,lzay0ba,2.0,1h19ttt

comment,lza8oms,thegooddoktorjones,,16,2024-11-27 18:49:15,,,,I work on IoT devices and one thing I did not think of in the past is every one of these things has a yearly per user cost for cloud services When you buy something connected you either are paying a significant premium to cover a decade of support or you are selling your user data to them to cover that cost I can see why manufacturers just pull the plug especially when something is not a hit or not pulling in valuable user data like they hoped You cant just abandon it you have to turn off the servers and either send an update that makes them limp along disconnected or more likely just leave people with a broken thing,,0.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzb90vg,Mygixer,,10,2024-11-27 21:59:39,,,,These devices could be made backward compatible but its not as profitable as making us buy new devices The companies have learned that most just accept the need to upgrade and take advantage of that Items are designed to last past the warranty and anything else is pure luck Until its profitable or regulated otherwise that is how things will stay,,0.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzez74w,TheRealBobbyJones,,1,2024-11-28 15:14:16,,,,Backward capability is expensive though I mean an easy example are wireless standards They update frequently but phones are expected to support old standards You need to include hardware and software for that,lzb90vg,1.0,1h19ttt
comment,lzfen3f,Mygixer,,1,2024-11-28 16:40:45,,,,That is my point profits over longevity Make things disposable and make more money Google just did this with drop cam the hardware was rock solid still functioning like a champ But the claim was they could no longer support the streams anymore because it cost too much They were supporting them just fine and all the infrastructure was there until they decided to make everyone buy new cameras,lzez74w,2.0,1h19ttt

comment,lzffulh,Vo_Mimbre,,2,2024-11-28 16:47:08,,,,As others have said this is unlikely to have any teeth nor last passed Jan 20 And the only answer is regulation Force companies to commit to a minimum period of time for support after the final unit of a model is sold That wont mean companies would do that Instead theyd pull back on server stuff which may lead to less reliance on OTA updates which may lead to less buggy launches Or most likely a bunch of fly by night companies that exist for just one shopping season go chase quick money some other way,,0.0,1h19ttt
