comment,mh567ag,BiNumber3,,81,2025-03-11 03:10:10,,,,Last Epson I had ran into similar issues as these HPs Bought it about 5 years ago since before I didnt have any issues with Epson It wouldnt scan because my ink was low and it wouldnt accept 3rd party cartridges Nowadays the only brand I have faith in for printers is Brother or ancient laserprinters people sell on local markets lol Edit seems even Brother is starting to give in though sigh,mh4u8e5,2.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh7bvo0,NRMusicProject,,16,2025-03-11 13:56:21,,,,Yep Right now the consensus is if you have a Brother firewall it from the internet ASAP so it doesnt update the firmware and lock out unofficial printer cartridges E Looks like Brother reached out to Louis Rossman to straighten this out Luis originally reported it said he was told on the phone that his printer was bricked because it wasnt using an official cartridge Hes said hell make a followup video once its all straightened out and what his takeaway is Its mentioned in other places that the report was from a clickbaity YouTuber Louis is very big on consumer rights and righttorepair and hes all about pushing products that dont pull HP bullshit He may have been mistaken or been accidentally locked out but theres no reason to believe that hes making clickbait videos Hes worked extremely hard for consumer rights and hes doing what he thinks is the right thing,mh5tory,4.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh8txs2,bubbafatok,,-5,2025-03-11 18:17:46,,,,Eh he can blow things out of proportion Like Disney plus is integrating live sporting events and such in their all and those live events have ads due to contracts and hes cutting videos telling people to go back to pirating because certain content on Disney Plus has ads even with ad free tiers,mh7bvo0,5.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh94nyu,AintNobody-,,7,2025-03-11 19:07:50,,,,So when I buy something called ad free and there are ads I should be okay with that because contracts Thats a no from me dawg,mh8txs2,6.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh95aip,NRMusicProject,,4,2025-03-11 19:10:48,,,,Thats a no from me dawg Its a no from everyone who doesnt want companies pushing them around I havent watched anything with ads in years and my life is very much better for it Piracy is more convenient than moral and until that changes moral will continue to lose,mh94nyu,7.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh96fke,bubbafatok,,-2,2025-03-11 19:16:10,,,,Then you have unrealistic expectation When I buy ad free Disney I dont expect to watch a live sporting event that is from a televised source without ads Theyre not inserting ads into on demand content Its live stuff theyre ADDING to Disney Shit that wasnt included in the app before Im thrilled that I can watch content from ESPN on Disney but Im either going to get an ad or 3 minutes of blank because that actual feed has ads When I watch their live ABC News Live channel its the feed from ABC This is content Id rather have than not have and Im glad theyre having it but because people lose their shit at every perceived injustice they have to put out a statement saying that yes sometimes you might see an ad on certain content Netflix has the exact same issue with the WWE Raw event feed and Max with their live sport feeds Youre literally watching the TNT feed FOR FREE on Max without having to have cable Its fucking awesome I can deal with having the same ads Id have it I had cable or paid for youtube tv for those events,mh94nyu,7.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh6r2sy,draxula16,,8,2025-03-11 11:45:37,,,,I thought thats for their new printers Nothing wrong with just picking up an older Brother Mine is over 5 years old and Ive changed the toner 23 times This is with heavy printing too,mh5tory,4.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh6kag0,Aimhere2k,,16,2025-03-11 10:49:46,,,,Theres a link at the end of that HP article on Ars to their analysis of the Brother controversy Tldr the Youtuber making the claim that Brother is degrading print quality with third party supplies It was never locking them is known for misleading clickbait And the other people claiming Brother malfeasance are posting anonymously Some of the claims are years old Brother has vehemently denied intentionally degrading or blocking the use of thirdparty supplies It seems to me that any thirdparty supplier could suddenly have qualitycontrol problems or switch manufacturers and no one would be the wiser until the cartridges fail,mh5udra,4.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh7ev93,NRMusicProject,,8,2025-03-11 14:12:10,,,,Youtuber making the claim is Louis Rossman a huge proponent and leader in consumer rights and righttorepair There might have been a mistake in his lockout but he didnt do it with any sort of attempt at misinformation He stickied his top comment on his video that Brother has reached out so that they can figure out what happened and hell share a video update as soon as its all figured out IIRC the cartridge that bricked his computer was working fine until a firmware update at which point the printer locked him out for unsupported cartridge even though it was the same cartridge before the firmware update Further if the firmwaredrivers are faulty youre kinda SOL because Brother removes previous versions from their site In short it can very well be a mistake with an update but I doubt there was any malicious intent by Louis and I look forward to his update in this matter,mh6kag0,5.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh7gyvy,unibrow4o9,,6,2025-03-11 14:23:09,,,,Dont give a shit what Brother said they did it to me 4 years ago or so Had a Brother ink jet updated the firmware then all of a sudden my 3rd party ink I already had installed no longer worked Theyre as shitty as the rest of them,mh6kag0,5.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh53mfd,MikeAWBD,,2,2025-03-11 02:54:06,,,,Just bought an Epson XP5200 only had it a couple days so I cant say much on how well it works One plus about the Epson though is there are separate cartridges for each of the 3 colors The cheaper HPs and Cannons had all the colors as a single cartridge It does feel sturdier then my old HP as well,mh4u8e5,2.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh6a0s8,kris-sigur,,2,2025-03-11 09:09:37,,,,I bought an Epson EcoTank printer about 4 years ago I am still going through the color ink that came with it and have only had to top off the black Even buying the Epson branded refills the ink is way cheaper than the usual ink cartridges Would recommend if you are looking for an inkjet Really the only issue with it has been if you dont use it for awhile the print heads can become a bit clogged requiring you to run the nozzle clean procedure,mh4u8e5,2.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh7fzc4,In-Between-Days,,2,2025-03-11 14:18:01,,,,I finally bought a Brother laser printer and it has been a sooooo much better experience I had an Epson printer for a few years and it was absolute trash Had to do a print head cleaning sometimes multiple before I printed anything or else there would be vertical stripes where nolow ink would be printed making whatever I printed unreadable We were constantly going through ink even though we printed maybe a page a week I think the constant cleaning contributed to this The Brother printer just works and has been oddly joyful to print something and have it come out as youd expect each time EDIT I forgot about the fact that if you are out of color ink but have full black ink and want to print in BW the Epson printer would not let you print We never printed in color but somehow always used color so wed just randomly not be able to print anything until we bought colored ink,mh4u8e5,2.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh6c0zn,caelenvasius,,1,2025-03-11 09:30:44,,,,I like my EcoTank 2800 for basic print jobs even if they need colorbut I kinda regret it for things which need high quality art on them like tabletop gaming tokens It tends to oversaturate the colors and can sometimes leave lines in the print and while bringing on the highest quality can often fix the latter I have never found a fix for the former Luckily the ink is cheap and really does last forever,mh61gcc,3.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh74siy,alidan,,1,2025-03-11 13:16:56,,,,brother laser if you dont print often laser is the best option and i think brother is the cheapest one for that,mh4u8e5,2.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh6k0no,None,,1,2025-03-11 10:47:25,,,,Their low end stuff is offensively bad with the subscription pushing and the account hoops but almost every printer company Brother included is going to periodically whackamole generic cartridges Some of it is preventing the worst of the generics from ruining your printer but its more likely greed HPs Enterprise line of printers standardize on a previous cartridge they promise in the marketing to allow generics and they last every bit of 10 ten years and fusers are 100 and easy to replace if they dont No inkjets no you dont need color,mh4na37,1.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh8d1b0,None,,1,2025-03-11 16:58:35,,,,Because theyre cheap and companies and people are also cheap The issue with IT equipment is you can have cheap or you can have good but not often both So it often falls into this is the best that we are willing to pay for and as long as it does what we want it to right now thats all were gonna put into it The key part of that being right now Cant tell you how many times Ive recommended upgrading a piece of equipment because I know for a fact its going out or is about to be at its end of life and the powers that be refuse to replace or upgrade because its working at the moment Then six months later I get a panicked call that it isnt working and the exact thing I said is what happened Only now theyre out of productivity because they waited for it to prove me right rather than just take my advice to begin with The problem with companies in particular is that they dont see IT as an investment they see it as an operating cost To them IT expenditure is just a money hole that they dont see a return from despite that that equipment and the staff to run it are absolutely essential for them to operate competitively As an IT professional I just keep a nice big glass of Toldyaso on my desk to sip out of on a near daily basis,mh4na37,1.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh7uqr3,None,,1,2025-03-11 15:31:45,,,,I purposefully chose an older model printerscanner that I had once before that worked well but didnt come with instant ink etc I dont see the point of regular firmwear updates for a printer I make sure that if Im printing Im off the internet and the connection is turned off Afterwards I disconnect the printer entirely again If I need to print web documents I save them to pdf and print them completely offline I dont want them updating my printer at all Right now I can still probably use off brand ink but I usually just pick some HP ones up whenever they are on sale once a year I bought my unit mostly for the flatbed scanner and printing the odd thing its just a bonus These days I can send pdf docs or jpegs of anything I might need to share If I want photo prints I dont bother with that here There are several places in the neighborhood where I can do that better than this printer can Maybe half a dozen times a year Im actually printing out documents Most of the time Im scanning docs I receive to pdf to keep them I dont like a lot of paper around This particular printerscanner is a decent one and it does what I need it to I actually liked HP before they decided to start messing things all up Ive had a couple of other brands of printers None of them lasted too long really,,0.0,1j8dr7o

comment,mh8arad,SharkSmiles1,,1,2025-03-11 16:48:01,,,,I stupidly throughout the box when I bought my HP printer a month ago It will not connect to my computer in order to print It will get on the network but its always offline when I try to print I dont know what Im gonna do since I dont have the box And this printer was replacing my Canon printer that wouldnt work with my fairly new computer because it needed a firmware update and driver update that Cannon no longer made That printer works great in my old computer but of course is obsolete for my new one,,0.0,1j8dr7o
comment,mh8by90,arthurdentstowels,,1,2025-03-11 16:53:34,,,,After almost 2 decades of buying cheap and shitty inkjets I took the plunge and got a 200 Brother Laser monochrome printer and I will never buy an inkjet again The free cartridge that came with it lasted 18 months and a generic replacement cost me 17 which is nothing I think that people dont realise saving money on the printers upfront cost does not save you money after the initial purchase Its worth making a small investment to ensure it is cheap to run Its like buying a massive truck thats half price but the fuel costs 4 x as much Whereas you could buy a full price sedan that has a much lower fuel consumption that would save you thousands,,0.0,1j8dr7o
