comment,n61ue2v,Fuckspez42,,5,2025-07-30 21:10:19,,,,Back in the Stone Age when broadcast networks actually gave a shit about ice hockey Fox introduced a technology called FoxTrax that put a chip in the puck that could be tracked They used it to put a halo around a puck and red lines followed a hard shot or pass It was thought that this would help people follow the game better and it did at least for new fans Older existing fans had already learned to track the puck this was way before HD by looking for the guy with both hands on his stick and his stick on the ice so they thought it was unnecessary and gimmicky The players absolutely hated it because the chip wouldnt function correctly if the puck was frozen which it usually is in ice hockey which led to a much bouncier puck that the players had a very hard time adjusting to It only lasted a few years but fun fact a variant of the FoxTrax technology is still used to track cars and show interactive labels on them in racing events like NASCAR broadcasts,,0.0,1md6i1m
comment,n6429lc,inbox-disabled,,2,2025-07-31 05:02:29,,,,Worth noting the puck today has a chip in it thats used for tracking Player jerseys the same and the nhl site has a goal visualizer that shows every players movement on the ice during goals Using this tech some broadcasts have gone back to doing FoxTrax style puck trails during powerplays Its pretty brutal to watch,n61ue2v,1.0,1md6i1m

comment,n6ey9az,ShenAnCalhar92,,1,2025-08-01 20:37:14,,,,Well I came up short on finding any hard figures on the allowable sizeweight deviation official balls but I did find that they are required to be inflated between 75 and 85 PSI Thats an incredibly large range 8 05 means it can vary by 625 in either direction and leads one to the reasonable assumption that a deviation of less than a gram in a ball thats supposed to weigh 600 grams would be within the tolerance for a regulation ball A 016 difference in weight is not going to affect anything when one regulation ball could have 133 more pressure than another If the ball absorbs a milliliter of water its weight will increase by more than it did from the sensor In other words if about 20 droplets of sweat are absorbed into the ball that will impact the weight more than the sensor Is that enough info to defend a general statement about the sensor probably not impacting the balls physics,n6dn5hu,3.0,1md6i1m
