comment,m32rly2,redcatmanfoo,,378,2024-12-21 02:11:43,,,,Its cute But Im not surprised it is going to fail to be sustainable Good on them for open sourcing If they make something new thats the difference maker for if Id buy it or not Knowing I can trust them not to brick my purchase is huge,,0.0,1hiyo90

comment,m32qro6,Aleyla,,295,2024-12-21 02:05:43,,,,I wouldnt expect them to finish this People like to get paid and if the company is going under then no one is getting paid Probably best if they just open source all their code and internal documentation Then if some kind soul happens to own one of these things AND has oodles of spare time AND the technical know how then maybe some people might get a little extra life out of it But frankly,,0.0,1hiyo90
comment,m33v7na,HittingSmoke,,181,2024-12-21 07:44:15,,,,Probably best if they just open source all their code and internal documentation The problem is you dont just open source all your code Thats a legal minefield and you may not have the right to redistribute some dependencies The path of least resistance would just be releasing a detailed description of their API so someone can reverse engineer a server for it That would make the work of building a community maintained open source server far less daunting,m32qro6,1.0,1hiyo90
comment,m35chsg,NickCharlesYT,,43,2024-12-21 15:40:46,,,,This is why licensing as a whole needs to be overhauled If something gets licensed it should apply in perpetuity to anything that is then part of a product sold to an end user Music licenses code libraries all of it That is what the user paid for in the first place This is the same reason things like video games and TV shows get pulled from sale or have music replaced and its a small in the face to society as a whole she things to just disappear as a result of licensingproblems,m33v7na,2.0,1hiyo90
comment,m35hwqh,HittingSmoke,,15,2024-12-21 16:12:52,,,,I dont disagree but that doesnt really apply to this scenario The problem is the live service side of things The serverside software is engineered to be run by experienced devops likely on a big cloud platform Its not designed to be distributed to end users What we need is some sort of precedent for liability when a company releases a product with an upfront cost that relies on a live service that the product is useless without What is the expected reasonable legal minimum amount of time the service should be maintained to protect consumers There are a lot of approaches that could be taken for this but a good law would make companies think very hard about whether they want to tie expensive products to a live service so tightly that they can be considered useless without it with no backup plan for when the live service shuts down,m35chsg,3.0,1hiyo90
comment,m35l1ka,NickCharlesYT,,6,2024-12-21 16:30:54,,,,If licensing is overhauled then open sourcing live service code becomes much simpler It also solves issues with abandonware,m35hwqh,4.0,1hiyo90
comment,m381t67,bizzaro321,,1,2024-12-22 01:37:25,,,,People would just charge more for whatever the new version of licensing is Our entire economy needs to be restructured for consumers to see any benefit,m35chsg,3.0,1hiyo90
comment,m37y8hs,hotlavatube,,3,2024-12-22 01:12:39,,,,Mmm Ive dealt with a little of that Ive developed code that used to use algorithms from certain numerical algorithm books that distributed the source code for free We were fine to use code closed source but when we were pushed open source we had to replace all those algorithms with open source alternatives like Apache Math Some of the other libraries we used had licenses or license keys Either we couldnt redistribute the library or the library might be worthless without a paid license key to unlock features,m33v7na,2.0,1hiyo90
comment,m354q7e,Aleyla,,8,2024-12-21 14:51:43,,,,Whatever external dependencies exist just document then upload their own code to github,m33v7na,2.0,1hiyo90
comment,m35dry1,HittingSmoke,,14,2024-12-21 15:48:30,,,,Sorry but thats really just not how this works Everyone likes to say Just open source it when a company shuts down when they clearly have no idea how much work that entails The entire code base needs to be audited with a microscope for licensing issues Its a massive amount of work with an extremely high risk to reward ratio Even using open source code in other open source projects can have endless questions about the legality See ZFS in the Linux kernel Releasing API documentation for reverse engineering is much less work and is completely legally safe as it will likely be reimplemented with the equivalent of clean room development Theres a reason you basically never see this happen Because it can very easily go like this,m354q7e,3.0,1hiyo90
comment,m35fit2,Aleyla,,-18,2024-12-21 15:58:52,,,,The entire code base needs to be audited with a microscope for licensing issues No it really doesnt The company is gone No longer exists There is no entity to sue if there is a licensing problem Anyone who grab the code will need to make their own judgement You are seriously over thinking this,m35dry1,4.0,1hiyo90

comment,m35g2tm,Kichigai,,3,2024-12-21 16:02:11,,,,Chances are a decent number of them are open source already just under different licenses Like libjpeg libvorbis libpng Like seriously go to your PlayStation or Xbox or any smart gizmo and go into the About page and open up licenses None of these companies want to reinvent the wheel especially when they can easily legally and without malice get the wheel for free,m354q7e,3.0,1hiyo90

comment,m35nerw,HittingSmoke,,8,2024-12-21 16:44:21,,,,Corporate veils are not impenetrable It would be unlikely though not totally impossible for someone to be held personally liable in a particularly egregious case of releasing something that could be considered another companys trade secrets That said thats not the only issue Lets say theres a scenario where this happens they dump their code to GitHub and its found to contain valuable code that is not licensed for distribution and the company who owns the copyright on that code is particularly litigious It will get uploaded to a public repo get quickly removed cause a massive media shit storm and anyone working on their own version of the software will be under intense scrutiny for spoilage When reverse engineering software that has some dodgy licensing implication you do whats called clean room development Everyone contributing code to the project must be beyond reproach when the question arises of whether theyve ever seen or been remotely adjacent to the restrictive code By releasing legally questionable code youve actually made it more difficult to safely reverse engineer software This has happened in live service game development before where there were server emulators reverse engineered in a clean room environment then source code leaked and from then on all projects were tainted by questions of whether leaked source was even referenced when developing updates This is why the path of least resistance is just releasing API documentation A developer wanting to take it on can just look at what the the endpoints consume and return Decoding that is the most difficult part of reverse engineering After thats its straightforward software engineering,m35j8pa,3.0,1hiyo90
comment,m4pd17g,livevicarious,,1,2024-12-31 15:35:15,,,,This is why they are going to release a standalone app that runs on Windows They wont be open sourcing anything but the downfall is they release the app and if it doesnt work or has bugs youre stuck with that for life of the product,m33v7na,2.0,1hiyo90

comment,m4pcorv,livevicarious,,1,2024-12-31 15:33:20,,,,They should have released the PC app they are working on to begin with Most PCs can handle the workload required for the AI to function its more secure and allows parents more control over the device as a whole They put all their eggs in the subscription based model to begin with and thats what screwed them They couldnt keep up with the costs to run the servers for all the units This is why subscription based services for things that DONT need it are a terrible idea I purchased Moxie for my child and I got lucky that mine was under warranty still and my bank allowed me to do a chargeback Also poor planning on the companies part they should have allocated funds properly Sell x amount of units until x date and have x amount of funds to run servers for x amount of time This company had poor money management probably zero accounting department,,0.0,1hiyo90
