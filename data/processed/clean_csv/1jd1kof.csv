comment,mi6yo2c,black_bass,,187,2025-03-17 01:58:39,,,,Not very surprising now that there is a push for marketing smartphone to people over 60 for few years now And that is talking without other gadgets to translate on the fly and such,,0.0,1jd1kof

comment,mi7m44q,LiGuangMing1981,,98,2025-03-17 04:44:06,,,,Not totally surprised that theyre still alive in Japan at all The market for these in China completely disappeared years ago When I started teaching in China in 2007 almost every student had one but I dont remember the last time I saw one for sale let alone someone actually using one,,0.0,1jd1kof
comment,mi7vp1v,sherlockham,,45,2025-03-17 06:13:00,,,,Not sure if its still a thing but iirc part of the reason for these electronic dictionariesapproved models was so they could use them during language exams for reference This did replace actual physical dictionaries before which was what i used when I was in school Granted this was in Singapore not China I did still see them on sale for the same purpose either last year or the year before though They were basically the language version of a TI graphingfinancial calculator Not really sure how they could work a mobile phone with internet access into exam conditions,mi7m44q,1.0,1jd1kof
comment,mi8v7mv,cmasontaylor,,6,2025-03-17 12:04:57,,,,Yeah I suspect policy changes like this are responsible for the market lasting even this long and for the subsequent decline I work IT support for education in the US and although phone apps are more flexible and convenient students have been explicitly allowed to use materials like dictionaries and calculators in some exams but smartphones are simply never allowed I have to imagine this significantly propped up these industries Now that more districts are moving to issuing Chromebooks to every student theyre gradually moving towards apps instead More and more exam suites simply build their own apps into the same software students test in,mi7vp1v,2.0,1jd1kof
comment,mibmu26,mehum,,6,2025-03-17 20:36:15,,,,Certain models of calculators TI nSpire CAS and an equivalent model by Casio are permitted in exams in some places keeping an otherwise exhausted market alive,mi8v7mv,3.0,1jd1kof

comment,mj2saes,None,,1,2025-03-22 01:22:47,,,,The most studious ones know that a smartphone is just too much temptation and a distraction machine at the tap of a button Specialist hardware is much healthier and more productive Writing in a smartphone,mi7slpr,1.0,1jd1kof
