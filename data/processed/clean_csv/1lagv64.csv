comment,mxkmfqj,CRAYONSEED,,693,2025-06-13 14:52:09,,,,Yeah it still feels like a relatively new console for me Ive been gaming for 40 years since the Commodore 64 and this is the first time Ive ever said this I dont know what a next generation would offer that would be dramatic enough for me to want to spend 500600 on a new console The improvements to graphics now seem pretty incremental and there havent been any huge gameplay breakthroughs enabled by new tech that I can think of in quite a long time was going open world the last one Maybe Ill feel differently by the time the PS6 launches in 34 years,mxkfp9z,1.0,1lagv64

comment,mxl3svw,Vismal1,,55,2025-06-13 16:13:57,,,,Thats always been my pitch to friends about my preference of consoles When I get home and want to play i want to turn it on and jump in Not spend a hour tweaking settings and looking up issues on message boards Generally have some things i play on console and others i stay on PS5 TLOU2 was an outlier because I had gotten this 9070 and thats my favorite series,mxl36yn,5.0,1lagv64

comment,mxm2fpj,King-Dionysus,,2,2025-06-13 18:58:20,,,,Ive never really played games on the computer too much except for maybe runescape when it first came out However then I bought a laptop with a 1060 And thought Id struggle to play anything with how people talk But Ive been very pleasantly suprised Sure most things have to be fairly low But I really dont mind I abhore keyboard and mouse so I still have my ps5 controller and its been VERY nice to mod and edit some settings But there have been some issues with things needing a little tweaking and when I play games I usually only play for like 20 or 30 min tops So i still prefer consoles But pc has a lot of pros too The console vs PC war is such a foreign concept to me,mxllj1o,7.0,1lagv64

comment,mxmp8ww,KongUnleashed,,1,2025-06-13 20:51:03,,,,Thats very true but in my case it was not just updating games it was updating mods figuring out which ones were broken with the new version of the game tweaking the game because it was suddenly running like ass trouble shooting which mod was bogging it down that kind of thing Took ages,mxml3aq,8.0,1lagv64

comment,mxmyy31,Dizzy_Pop,,2,2025-06-13 21:40:49,,,,43 year old husband and father with a full time job I picked up a ps5 two years ago to prepare for the release of FF16 and have since been back into gaming in a big way Theres a lot of fantastic content out there now and Im so glad I made it a priority for mu free time again Once I cut out other time wasters scrolling for 10 minutes here and there really adds up its amazing how fast you can put together an hour a day for gaming More to your point though Im also an advocate for console over PC gaming for the simple reason that it just works Sure youre not getting absolute maximum cutting edge resolution and FPS but its a minor sacrifice Console is less expensive by far games are intentionally optimized for that standard equipment and I dont have to spend hours and hours fine tuning everything downloading driver updates etc Im really looking forward to ps6 Rediscovering my love for gaming has been unbelievably rewarding,mxmadba,7.0,1lagv64

comment,mxlh44g,PeeB4uGoToBed,,1,2025-06-13 17:16:43,,,,I think a lot can be said with how much easier it is to build a pc these with very minimal troubleshooting mainly connected to very first booting it up when you need to tweak a couple bios settings and driver updates Yearrrs ago you could absolutely spend hours troubleshooting but after rebuilding a pc from scratch this month it was practically seamless and smooth with no issues I do agree with the ease of multiplayer and connecting 4 controllers with no issues Consoles are still very much easier and plug and play but PCs have come a long way,mxl3svw,6.0,1lagv64
comment,mxlhk79,Vismal1,,0,2025-06-13 17:18:47,,,,I was talking more about troubleshooting a game Meaning changing settings and dealing with poor optimizations etc,mxlh44g,7.0,1lagv64
comment,mxli494,PeeB4uGoToBed,,2,2025-06-13 17:21:20,,,,Eh Thats easy For those that dont want to mess with everything you can just use the slider that changes all the settings at once and pick low medium high or ultra Theres not really much else to and its very easy to learn and go deeper into it but they make it as easy as possible,mxlhk79,8.0,1lagv64
comment,mxlmrz5,Vismal1,,0,2025-06-13 17:42:51,,,,I guess Im talking about my inherit worries that Im not getting the most out of the system while also not pushing things too far and coming out with it performing worse With console its all built for the same hardware and optimized as best it can For example things like FSR and the like are new to me and until FSR 4 on Last of us part 2 it all looked like horrible ghosting blurry garbage When i was using my 6750 XT on Clar Obscur ray tracing and such was forced on and all FSR resulted in like 3 copies of my character similar on the Indiana Jones game Both games required a good amount of playing with settings and in the case of Clar Obscur downloading a mod and a program to fix that Thats all stuff you dont have to worry about when turning on a console,mxli494,9.0,1lagv64
comment,mxlsadl,PeeB4uGoToBed,,2,2025-06-13 18:09:06,,,,I had to mess with Indiana Jones settings quite a lot too but if I remember right that game automatically detects hardware and changes settings accordingly so any issues were my fault trying to push things Its nice when games automatically detect hardware and changes settings for you so you dont even have to mess with anything,mxlmrz5,10.0,1lagv64

comment,mxlt8l9,PeeB4uGoToBed,,1,2025-06-13 18:13:38,,,,That was a VERY demanding game with baked in ray tracing I had a 2070 super when it came out and 8gb of vram was enough to get it running on a mix of low and medium settings now with my 5070ti with 16gb I dont have to worry about that anymore hopefully for quite a long time too,mxlsjjn,12.0,1lagv64
comment,mxltoco,Vismal1,,1,2025-06-13 18:15:45,,,,Right and thats been the issue the baked in Ray Tracing With The Great Circle Clar Obscur and Oblivion I had to find ways to patch that up using the 6750 XT,mxlt8l9,13.0,1lagv64

comment,mxm64xs,Eurynom0s,,2,2025-06-13 19:16:25,,,,Yeah 99 of actively spending time on why the fuck isnt this working that I can remember is from getting things set up right after building The only real WTF one was trying to use Windows 7 RC1 to save money on paying for Windowsburned a disc tried to install a ton of times would fail partway through Next day redownloaded the ISO and burned to a new DVD same shit Out of frustration and desperation I stuck the original disc Id burned back in and somehow that worked on the first try on the second round But thats the only really memorable one like that and to be fair it was explicitly called the release candidate and not that the actual final OS Usually just not a major timesink,mxm2aia,6.0,1lagv64

comment,mxnqitb,Bilboswaggins21,,8,2025-06-14 00:18:29,,,,If you have thousands of hours of issues with PCs Im fairly certain thats just user error on your part Or you like to tinker too much Ive been pc gaming for 15 years have built three towers and opened two laptops in that time and Ive maybe spent a combined 20 hours in that time dealing with issues and that includes build time And Im no wizard,mxm7rqs,9.0,1lagv64

comment,mxl6hb7,Irapotato,,20,2025-06-13 16:26:44,,,,I guess the real issue is that 4k 60FPS is a moving target If they claim our console runs games at 4k 60 there will need to be like 10 asterixes A PC that runs new games at 4k 60 on high or better costs about 1500 give or take right now and it will only run new games at these levels for a few years before something else comes along requiring more power Consoles are becoming a legit victim of GPU and graphics tech power creep at the moment and it doesnt help that I think the PC market in general has become extremely graphics fatigued I have a 4070 TS it runs every game I want to play at 1440 165fps on ultra and I dont really care for anything new enough to push it past that at the moment The value per dollar of a GPU is at an all time low and consoles because of their rigid architectures have to pick a performance point and stay there for 5 years You cant really be cutting edge for 5 years if youre not spending thousands on a GPU alone,mxktfow,3.0,1lagv64

comment,mxouhnw,MrLuaan,,1,2025-06-14 04:31:53,,,,Interesting I just looked up the 4080S and tbh at that prince range wouldnt a 5070ti be overall fasterbetter I feel like Im finding info telling me that older cards are better but on the other hand someone people have said otherwise I feel like if the price difference is only a couple hundred more for much better performance wouldnt the newer card always be best Or is it for optimization purposes like lets say the other components of the PC are a little outdated and cant keep up with card Sorry for the influx of questions this is just a bit overwhelming who knew picking all the right parts for your dream build could be like this Not me,mxooxes,6.0,1lagv64
comment,mxox55x,Irapotato,,1,2025-06-14 04:52:47,,,,50 series is more power draw and worse drivers Id just go 4080S tbh but the 5070ti is probably fine The 40 series is the last series that is built to generate frames the hard way and the 50 series is the first to lean super heavily on DLSS IE generating frames using AI for nonkey frames The 40 is great and the additional VRAM is nice as well,mxouhnw,7.0,1lagv64

comment,myd8sze,Alenicia,,1,2025-06-18 00:58:28,,,,I would argue the returns are diminishing if only because resolutions and frame rates arent the endallbeall when it comes to what a video game or a console should be capable of What were seeing is essentially that throwing more millions and millions of dollars into a game getting more developers into an office and even giving developers a generous amount of time for development isnt really pushing the video game experience to the next level AAA games are becoming too big and unsustainable to players who are already burned out on the next corridorexploring openworld action game Stronger specs to hit 4K and 120 FPS on ultra settings could be cool but personally to me thats not what makes a game good,mxnjvds,5.0,1lagv64

comment,mxtpte7,Memester999,,1,2025-06-14 23:45:33,,,,They essentially asked all of their firstparty studios to drop whatever they were doing and start making live service games set in their respective IPs This just isnt true the money spent on live service games went into mostly new teams some of which were additions to their existing studios Bend and Bluepoint were the only studios that were formerly not GaaS studios working on them Even with that said Bluepoint was the remake studio not an original IP studio and has spent time as a support studio during all this Bend was the only true original IP studio put into GaaS exclusively The reality is the PS5 is going to have essentially the same output as the PS4 by the end of its life cycle when it comes to SP games PS4 had an insane last 34 years where every 6 months there was a new 910 but before that it was in a worse spot than the PS5 with them relying on basically 1 game a year I think the fact that their first few big titles this generation were cross gen sequels or 3rd party exclusives messes with the perception people have 4 of their biggest exclusives last gen have already had their sequels come out Horizon GoW Spiderman FF Remake and a 5th is this year with Ghosts There is a larger gap as it was more front loaded and then COVID happened setting everything back a year or two But PS5 will probably have a similar library to the PS4 when all is said and done Which is a pretty good floor for a generation to have tbh Now if the argument someone wants to make is that they should have instead invested the GaaS money into even more single player games that weve come to expect from them then I agree completely But all Im saying is they didnt just abandon what they were doing and were known for to chase GaaS It was a bad additional investment strategy to try something new when they could have doubled down on what they know works,mxkjzds,3.0,1lagv64

comment,mxkmshh,blackrock55,,1,2025-06-13 14:53:49,,,,Xbox is such a weird one I feel like its totally lost its identity as a console and is effectively a Controller based PC experience and with the handheld announcement feels like theyre trying to go into the steam deck environment of gaming moreso over a dedicated home console Just my take but idk not a scooby doo tbh,mxkmayi,4.0,1lagv64

comment,mxkqqcm,raidensnakeezio,,3,2025-06-13 15:12:30,,,,PS5 is really just a PS4 Proer Which would make the PS5 Pro the PS4 Proest Really though 9th gen consoles STRUGGLE to have a distinct identity from 8th gen This is not necessarily a good or bad thing but a notable observation to make nonetheless The only PS5 exclusives I can think of that are unique and contribute best to making the PS5 distinct is Ratchet and Clank then Astro Bot Silent Hill 2 is kind of a hit or miss Honorary mention to Returnal The following is a list of absolute critical blockbusters but I feel are still strongly rooted in the PS4 idiom GOWRagnarok is not really groundbreaking imo its more of what weve seen in GOW4 PS4 without changing too much of the formula or having a massive upgrade in style In this sense GOW4 is ahead of its time TLOU2 is cross platform Spider Man 2 is a continuation of what we saw in Spider Man 1 and Miles Morales As much as I love Gran Turismo 7 and its investment from Sony as a flagship Playstation title with great heritage the jump from GT Sport to 7 isnt really that amazing I would liken it to the jump from Gran Turismo 3 to Gran Turismo 4 both belonging to the PS2 Honorary mention to Death Stranding I feel this list more so highlights the craftsmanship and artistry in design when it comes to the release of these games Not only did the developers create their games with a mature understanding of the PS4 platform but they also did so with confidence and SDK in hand in likelihood that the PS5 was going to have similar hardware and therefore could be ported to look even better In some sense its like looking at the visual jump between Perfect Dark on the N64 to GTA3 or the early MoHCoD games on PS2 Heres looking to Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei Expecting more of the aforementioned jumps of Perfect Dark to GTA 3 and not necessarily the jump from FF8 to FF10,mxkhaxj,2.0,1lagv64

comment,mxn1npy,Kn7ght,,3,2025-06-13 21:55:12,,,,Sorry for the long winded answer but from my understanding its mainly the actual work which makes the corporate world stuff have more of an impact Due to modern graphical fidelity and resolutions every single element needs significantly more time and manpower devoted to it Kratos facial polygons went from 1200 on PS2 to 32000 on PS4 Meanwhile Crash Bandicoots entire character model on PS1 was 512 polygons The PS5s hardware can support 11 billion polygons on screen a second which is amazing but shows the kind of visual detail thats expected Plus character textures in PS3 games were usually only 256x256 or 512x512 Environment textures in older games could be as small as 128x128 With 4K being the standard so many textures have to be a much higher resolution as well usually making each from scratch That means when corporate goes Hey we need this in the game right now or You need to make this work in this other game engine that isnt compatible with anything youve made so far thats a ton of new elements to make or do over I feel like this is a major part of why the Switch was able to get so many games on it and had quick sequels for certain IPs Only needing 1080P and leaning heavily on stylization instead of realism means everything can be made much quicker and cheaper Its also why the Yakuza games still come out pretty much once a year they reuse sooooo many elements and animations from game to game Many games have the exact same map and alot of animations have been carried over from the first game on PS2 Meanwhile you have people who were mad Marvels SpiderMan 2 had the same New York map as the first game and figured Insomniac would completely redo it,mxma0af,4.0,1lagv64

comment,mxnivsy,theAssumptionFucker,,1,2025-06-13 23:32:58,,,,this there is a concept that explains exactly what you just said ngl asked gpt since i cant remember it The concept youre referring to is often explained by the proportional theory of time perception the idea that each new year becomes a smaller fraction of your total lived experience so it feels shorter in comparison Why Time Feels Faster as You Age 1 Proportionality aka Ratio Theory At age 5 one year is 20 of your life At 50 one year is just 2 So each year feels shorter relative to your full memory bank 2 Routine vs Novelty New experiences feel longer and more memorable As you age routines dominate making time feel like its speeding by because fewer distinct events are being encoded 3 Memory Compression Our brains compress familiar events when recalling the past If your days are similar your brain stores them in shorthand making years feel shorter in hindsight 4 Temporal Landmarks Decline Childhood and early adulthood are full of firsts school graduation jobs relationships Later in life those landmarks are less frequent Bonus The Stride Metaphor You Mentioned Its a poetic way to describe how your mental pace increases more responsibilities longerterm goals and less present focus Youre in a stride so the miles blur behind you This ties in with how momenttomoment awareness shrinks as youre pulled into longterm momentum Would you like a visual metaphor or diagram to help make this concept more tangible,mxkg6sq,1.0,1lagv64
comment,mxnyf82,Dje4321,,1,2025-06-14 01:06:36,,,,Consoles have actually been on the slowest release cycles compared to historical data I feel like its a couple of major things that makes each release feel more underwhelming 1 The advancement of tech has slowed down a ton Sure Moores law is still a thing but to double the quality you need to quadruple the performance The difference between the PS4 and PS5 is very minimal compared to the jump between the N64 and GameCube 2 Games are on a much longer release cycle At the tip of the pumping days you could expect a new COD game every 912 months Now your lucky for a franchise to release twice in a decade So now instead of trying to get in 2030 games during a 5 year release cycle your stuck with 10 games across an 8 year cycle,mxkg6sq,1.0,1lagv64

comment,mxkxgac,Ttmode,,0,2025-06-13 15:43:52,,,,Nobody is forcing you to buy it The article suggests early stages which likely means at least another 23 years before a release date The PS3 was released in 2006 the PS4 in 2013 PS5 in 2020 Theyve literally been on the same 67 year release schedule since the literal PS1 in 1994 If you werent expecting the PS6 by 20272028 Im not sure what to tell you,mxkw35t,5.0,1lagv64
comment,mxqlu24,Deserana12,,1,2025-06-14 13:36:05,,,,Yes but as you just mentioned the first 3 years of this console was basically redundant because of COVID Thats not nothing Thats almost half of the life cycle My PS5 was pretty much redundant until maybe 2 years ago I could have comfortably continued on the PS4 for a few years and it would have barely made a difference I can only speak for myself but due to the area I work in we all use consoles but all of us have felt absolutely suckered by this generation and will not be buying a PS6 on release when we have for the last 3 generations I cant imagine we are the only ones,mxkxgac,6.0,1lagv64
