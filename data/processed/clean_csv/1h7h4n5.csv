comment,m0lhera,designisagoodidea,,11,2024-12-05 20:34:33,,,,Forebode is the wrong word here because it suggests a negative or ominous sign To forebode something means to give a warning or indication of impending trouble doom or misfortune In other words it implies that what is being predicted is bad news In the context of a headline about a new Apple device theres no indication that the 18inch foldable device is something negative The sentence is simply trying to indicate that the display roadmap predicts or foreshadows the launch of the device in 2028 Foretell on the other hand is the correct choice because it means to predict or announce something before it happenswithout the negative connotation By using foretell the headline would convey that Apples display plans are indicating or forecasting the future release of this product which is a more neutral and appropriate meaning for the situation,,0.0,1h7h4n5
