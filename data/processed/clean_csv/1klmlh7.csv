comment,ms3wboz,Emperor-Commodus,,3,2025-05-13 15:39:31,,,,sure Jan They were pretty dishonest with their AVPv marketing specifically thinking of the Eye Sight feature I dont trust them to be honest with the marketing of this one either Not to mention some basic competency questions Certain parts of AVP were engineered excellently to be expected on a 3500 product but other parts showed some boneheaded decisionmaking The default skigoggle strap was a travesty especially for such a heavy headset and the lack of controllers was a misstep that any VR user saw coming a mile away,,0.0,1klmlh7
