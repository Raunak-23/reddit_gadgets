comment,lyfe0jv,merlotbarbie,,633,2024-11-22 15:28:14,,,,Probably because of the manpower required to get it done You dont realize how hard it can be to bathe a full grown adult who cant provide much assistance to you Needing 3 people means that it probably was a very coordinated effort with a small margin for error,lyfa809,3.0,1gx8258
comment,lyfo2up,kc_______,,207,2024-11-22 16:21:43,,,,Maybe also because if they were not hiring additional help it would mean that maybe the wife that could about the same age 80s maybe younger maybe some relatives like offspring around 60s or 70s yo maybe some younger at times its harder at those ages,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258

comment,lyji7x2,green_chapstick,,5,2024-11-23 06:21:34,,,,Depends on your state I think I know in NY there are agencies that get paid by insurances to do in home care Usually minimum wage or just above for NY anyway but min is pretty high here I was paid to care for my mom this way Its nice because you can set your schedule to fit yours as long as it also work for the one youre caring for The tasks can be as easy as house keeping because they arent able to My mom is went blind but is still able to do hygiene by herself So cleaningorganizing shopping and a ride to appointments she needs help with Look into home health aid work in your area Its a high need for sure ETA I had ZERO training to do such work All I needed was a physical and a TB test done for the agencies I worked with,lyie9rg,7.0,1gx8258

comment,lymsnbr,peanutneedsexercise,,1,2024-11-23 20:33:59,,,,Usually as a volunteer youre not gonna be allowed to do stuff like that its too much liability youre gonna need to be a cna and pick up shifts Especially in healthcare theres a ton of liability What if they fall or you sprain your back trying to get them to the bathroom Etc the most we let volunteers do is stock blankets and supplies and maybe feed the patients if even that,lylv6zl,9.0,1gx8258
comment,lymye86,ProvenceNatural65,,1,2024-11-23 21:05:48,,,,Yeah thats true Maybe meals on wheels is a better option than something that involves so much patient care,lymsnbr,10.0,1gx8258
comment,lyn1oya,peanutneedsexercise,,1,2024-11-23 21:24:25,,,,Yah unfortunately while the intentions are good many people are injured caring for loved ones that are bed bound Thats why specific training is required also turning people and bathing them especially when theyre bedbound requires trained medical professionals especially when many of these patients have sacral wounds and ulcers at various stages They wont let a volunteer do any of those things Thats why I said just be a CNA At the wage they pay CNAs its basically volunteering which is super sad You dont need extra schooling to be a CNA most places will train you on the job but they just cant have a well meaning volunteer helping a patient to the bath room and both of them falling or something thats a huge liability as most senior falls result in broken hips brain bleeds etc and will drastically decrease quality of life or even shorten it tremendously,lymye86,11.0,1gx8258

comment,lygva2g,Edythir,,-6,2024-11-22 20:03:50,,,,I dont know how long the hired help stays there but 100 for 8 hours a guess is only 125 per hour So while its expensive for you to pay the wage isnt great for them,lygg6dn,6.0,1gx8258
comment,lygx11k,No-Reach-9173,,6,2024-11-22 20:13:15,,,,I live in a super low cost of living area and it starts at 25 an hour for in home help So 100 only gets you 4 hours and the person helping is only getting 15,lygva2g,7.0,1gx8258
comment,lyh2p8v,A-Wolf-Like-Me,,3,2024-11-22 20:43:47,,,,Depends on who is looking after you but that 100 is probably going to last an hour or two tops unless the service has been heavily subsidised As an example to see a district nurse where I am is about 90 patient pays 5 the rest subsidised by the government and they only complete specific treatments if they are seeing you for wound redressing and all of a sudden your incontinent and need a shower they wont help Other specialist services go up to 200 an hour to see a physiotherapist or occupational therapist Basically outpatient care gets really fricken expensive especially if you are needing constant supervision due to impulsive behaviours,lygva2g,7.0,1gx8258

comment,lyfqb4z,smollwonder,,28,2024-11-22 16:33:24,,,,My grandma is in the same situation She needs help because even tho my grandpa can walk to the bathroom and sit on the shower seat she still needs to be handed stuff and if anything were to happen she needs people there What if she or my grandpa slipped and fell down You cant expect and almost 80yo woman to lift a 90yo full grown man At the very least I need to be there and she prefers if Im there with either a neighbor or the cleaning lady so that we can help and be on call in case of an emergency,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyfr5ia,merlotbarbie,,14,2024-11-22 16:37:44,,,,Yes thats the main thing You dont just have to worry about lifting you also have to make sure that you have enough help in case theres a fall so that both people dont end up on the floor Falls can be fatal at that age or at the very least decrease your quality of life to the point that your lifespan is shortened,lyfqb4z,5.0,1gx8258

comment,lygugjg,kogan_usan,,7,2024-11-22 19:59:28,,,,when my grandma became a fall risk they taught us to never attempt to lift her ourselves no matter how strong we are if you dont have the right technique you could injure the person or yourself always call the paramedics of course where i live it costs nothing to call an ambulance,lyfqb4z,5.0,1gx8258
comment,lyfsd7v,sharpshooter999,,25,2024-11-22 16:43:54,,,,My wife works at a nursing home and their protocol is 4 people to bathe one person Granted they do it in under 10 minutes They rotate bath duty every week but youll have a week where youll spend the majority of your shift bathing people,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyh18sx,lil_dovie,,14,2024-11-22 20:36:00,,,,Did a CNA course a few years back and our rotations were at nursing homes It took at least 2 but usually 3 of us to bathe mostly mobile seniors and it was an ordeal for sure You have to be real careful with their skin as you can inadvertently cause skin breakage and lesions I can tell you getting them from a wheelchair to the seat in the shower was back breaking work and many of them hated being bathed because wed have to wash their private areas and because they got cold really easy when we dried them off and dressed them Some of them would bat at us to leave them alone or just fight us off Bed baths only required 2 of us and youd be surprised how heavy 100 pounds of dead weight can be when youre washing down a patient and rolling them on each side,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyg2spk,_Dreamer_Deceiver_,,13,2024-11-22 17:36:40,,,,It takes more people than you think to lift someone out of a wheelchair and into a bath Even to lift them and clean them in the wheelchair needs people Thats of course if you like the person If you dont then its only one person to push them out of the chair,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyfzms0,waistingtoomuchtime,,12,2024-11-22 17:20:40,,,,Yup we have a 185lb woman it takes 2 of us and it feels like you went to the gym after you are done She has no control of her muscles to help the process so it is like a 185lb bag of sand,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyj6ra7,Grigorie,,3,2024-11-23 04:42:24,,,,With extremely inconsistent ergonomics Some people dont quite realize how hard it can be to move around even a 150lb person with their weight shifting and limbs slipping and stuff Its hard People are heavy,lyfzms0,5.0,1gx8258
comment,lygwk65,hanks_panky_emporium,,10,2024-11-22 20:10:43,,,,And sometimes patients really dont want to be bathed If you want to see someone on deaths door nearly break a nurses wrist visit a nursing home Theyre often confused and violent Which is hard but not getting cleaned ever isnt a solution A pod that did it would be helpful assuming its safe enough to not drown or burn an elderly person,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258

comment,lyjnbj7,TorpedoSandwich,,1,2024-11-23 07:11:04,,,,One person can do it if theyre strong The issue is likely just that his wife was in her 80s90s herself so she couldnt do it alone and she could only manage to gather 3 physically capable and willing people once ever 3 weeks,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyk7h2a,Vistaus,,1,2024-11-23 10:48:08,,,,I mean sure But it all depends on the help you can get My dad couldnt bath himself anymore either in the last few months before he passed away and it was really taking a toll on my mum However we arranged help so that he could get showered twice a week So it all depends on the help you can get but I do agree that it takes effort to arrange all of that,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyknrgb,TwoBionicknees,,1,2024-11-23 13:15:33,,,,But theyd need the same people to get them into the pod and its harder to get someone out of a bed and into that pod than it is to roll a person in the bed onto one side then the other as with a sponge bath,lyfe0jv,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lygi3ox,A-Game-Of-Fate,,13,2024-11-22 18:54:59,,,,Because bed baths are exhausting difficult work even when the patient is able to help by holding themselves in position once youve turned them onto their side to wash their backs and whatnot which is rare as fuck When they cant you need another person simply to hold them on their side And thats all assuming they dont have various issues or accidents during the bath requiring you to start over which often includes changing the sheets again,lyfa809,3.0,1gx8258
comment,lyh06lr,Alpacas_,,6,2024-11-22 20:30:16,,,,Taking care of someone like that is a massive amount of work Help usually costs money people have dementia and forget how to do basically everything and are rather fragile,lyfa809,3.0,1gx8258

comment,lyf982p,Deranged_Kitsune,,101,2024-11-22 15:01:44,,,,Absolutely hospitals would get these if they work as well as intended Staff generally have other things some more important some more desirable that theyd rather do than bathe patients If these things reliably get people clean inside 15 min and staff is only needed for the inout process that would be such a massive boost to efficiency and moral its a nobrainer to get them This also has the advantage of getting the female nurses away from some of the skeevier patients who insist that a female nurse be the one that takes care of them Handling patients for tasks like this are why male nurses are always in demand and can command higher salaries their upper body strength and strength in general is needed for moving patients around,lyeyub5,1.0,1gx8258
comment,lyfmb5d,DocPhilMcGraw,,20,2024-11-22 16:12:24,,,,Hospitals would not be using this for a number of reasons For starters the patients that require bed baths are usually the ones unable to get up to use the shower or bathe themselves They are either obese completely bedridden or are super sick and hooked up to multiple IVs and monitoring equipment that they cannot get up out of bed Second you are talking about transporting a patient from the bed into this machine which in most cases would mean more work than just giving the patient a bed bath There are also patients with certain wounds or extremities that may not be able to be submerged or washed ortho patients that could not go in this machine It may be possible that you could see these being used in certain nursing homes but if something goes wrong in the machine like a person injured themselves or somehow drowned that would be a lawsuit waiting to happen,lyf982p,2.0,1gx8258
comment,lyg2xcu,smallbean-,,10,2024-11-22 17:37:19,,,,There is no way this would be used in a nursing home The actual bath tubs they have are rarely used fearful patients hard to actually reach every nook and cranny takes forever to fill and they lose patience before the bath is even full of water Shower chair and a shower stall is so much easier for everyone Also a good portion of a nursing home population has either dementia or anxiety and there is no way you would be able to convince them to get in this thing they already fight enough when it comes to a regular shower or bath,lyfmb5d,3.0,1gx8258
comment,lyhibk4,Cessily,,5,2024-11-22 22:07:58,,,,This is basically a shower chair and automated shower that also dries and reduces the need for the staff to do the manual washing and controls the temperature of the water and interior to keep patients comfortable as getting cold during bathing is often a problem Getting confused patients in is a legit concern but I would not compare it to an existing bath tub,lyg2xcu,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lygcd8y,Tryknj99,,3,2024-11-22 18:25:20,,,,It doesnt seem much different than what we already do when a patient needs a CT scan or something but on the same token a single nurse and tech together or two techs can wash most patients in 15 minutes even if theyre a little confused or aggressive I could see myself saying just get the wipes and a towel Im not bringing her down the hall and transferring her There is a frequent flier in our ED who is over 500 pounds and it literally just an awful person They treat staff horribly It takes 5 of us to turn him and clean him This bath would be nice for those patients but most of the time a regular bath seems easier Plus its probably a nightmare for confused patients Theyll think theyre drowning it something,lyfmb5d,3.0,1gx8258
comment,lyhxclc,DocPhilMcGraw,,1,2024-11-22 23:36:37,,,,Right but when it comes to a CT scan its an open system where IV lines and everything can still be present or attached when they go into the scanner This looks like a closed system instead Also usually when you take a patient to a CT scan you generally have more help than usual to get the patient to the scanner Its usually like 3 or 4 people there to help get you situated And you would still need the 5 people you just mentioned to get that obese patient into this machine every time you needed a bath Nobody is going to want to throw out their back transferring a patient to and from this machine when its easier to just turn them over on their side to do a simple bath,lygcd8y,4.0,1gx8258
comment,lyko971,TwoBionicknees,,1,2024-11-23 13:19:10,,,,Second you are talking about transporting a patient from the bed into this machine which in most cases would mean more work than just giving the patient a bed bath its staggering how people people are like it takes x people to do a sponge bath this will be better when it will obviously take at least the same number of peopel to life the person into the pod Also when it comes to things like bed sores injuries open wounds stitched wounds that dont want to be soaked in water and you know butt crack all the places that you cant clean while someone is sitting down this thing looks practically useless to me A wet room and a shower chair is infinitely easier more space easier to manouvre easier to have multiple people able to help wash wounds carefully or keep areas dry etc,lyfmb5d,3.0,1gx8258
