comment,m5psvg5,None,,2,2025-01-06 16:23:43,,,,but the higher refresh rates monitors are here now Doesnt matter if display port gets their shit together 5 yrs from now Gpu manufacturers will just start offering more hdmi ports eventually when theres more hdmi 22 monitors on the market The Display port consortium got complacent and now theyre 7 yrs behind,m5przj4,7.0,1hv1c21
comment,m5ptb1t,get_homebrewed,,-3,2025-01-06 16:25:54,,,,It doesnt matter if the higher refresh rate monitors are here now None of them have HDMI 22 and none of the GPUs have HDMI 22 Displayport is not 7 years behind Just because they didnt jump the gun to report bigger number on the market Especially since HDMI is already so incredibly flaky this is probably even worse,m5psvg5,8.0,1hv1c21
comment,m5puekm,None,,1,2025-01-06 16:31:24,,,,Yes display port is 7 years behind And will be 35 years more behind by the time they release a competitor to hdmi 22 And guess what well probably see hdmi 22 compatible gpus before the end of this year with the RTX 5000 series if the leaks are to be believed HDMI is about as flakey as DP none of them are analog So they either work perfectly or not at all,m5ptb1t,9.0,1hv1c21

comment,m5qn3dk,physeK,,2,2025-01-06 18:54:16,,,,Yep really makes using TVs like the LG C4 for instance a pain You can get a janky cable that kinda works to do DisplayPort to HDMI which kinda gets you 4K120 in the full 444 colorspace but its not without its faults On Windows with the same GPU TV and HDMI cable I can have 4K144hz without any issues,m5qmnx6,4.0,1hv1c21
comment,m5s4z8m,fedexmess,,2,2025-01-06 23:20:19,,,,Is it not possible to reduce the diameter of the cables so I dont feel like a pipe fitter while doing cable management It would also reduce the stress on the delicate flower of a port since the cable wouldnt be putting as much leverage on it should it be moved while plugged in,,0.0,1hv1c21

comment,m5ppofn,junktrunk909,,4,2025-01-06 16:07:27,,,,What I find interesting and confusing is that home builders near me have apparently decided nobody uses HDMI or Ethernet anymore and dont even run lines in the walls not even for access points,,0.0,1hv1c21

comment,m5rq05u,JMGurgeh,,2,2025-01-06 22:01:53,,,,Sometimes people do it so you can hide all the equipment away in a utility roomcloset so you just need a power outlet and HDMI port for each display device in the house Looks very clean and with custom equipmentcontrollers it can work pretty well for a generation anyway then there are inevitably incompatibilities and the builtin stuff either gets abandoned or you spend a fortune redoing it,m5remri,2.0,1hv1c21
