comment,lw4wxgo,None,,17,2024-11-08 20:09:37,,,,Rockstar is generally pretty good at optimization hopefully thats still the case Ive got an X so S performance doesnt matter much to me either way,,0.0,1gml1bs

comment,lw3cn00,resil_update_bad,,16,2024-11-08 15:34:11,,,,But I thought the series s was the scapegoat for everything,,0.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw3exdz,NuPNua,,-23,2024-11-08 15:45:30,,,,Only because people who spent 500 quid on a console or 700 on a graphics card are insecure about their purchase when the same games run on a 250 machine so create a narrative that if it wasnt for that pesky Series X holding gaming back theyd be getting cutting edge experiences that transcend what we thought games could be When the truth is wed be getting largely the same stuff with one less SKU,lw3cn00,1.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw44tr6,None,,13,2024-11-08 17:50:50,,,,TBH the S is great for people who mainly play indie games and dont care about high resolutions like me I LOVE small form factor tech I would definitely buy one if I didnt already have a Nintendo console,lw3exdz,2.0,1gml1bs

comment,lw3edp5,wicktus,,11,2024-11-08 15:42:48,,,,I am on PS5 but frankly in this economy and outlook a 250300 console with a gamepass subscription makes 10801440p modern gaming accessible to many potential people especially people who just want to chill on FIFA EA sports college football etc I just wish theyd added 2 more GB of gamingdedicated RAM because my limited understanding is that it was the root cause of some issues for Baldurs Gate 3 and things like that If T2 says the game is set for 2025 and no problem for the serie S its good I hope theyll keep saying it next year,,0.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw5ins0,brokenmessiah,,4,2024-11-08 22:00:56,,,,This economy is probably the reason why subscriptions left and right are nose diving People are looking at their bank statements and trimming the fat and paying 20 a month for Game Pass is absolutely not making the cut for people same with PS Plus and Netflix,lw3edp5,1.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw5hsho,brokenmessiah,,5,2024-11-08 21:56:22,,,,Even if he had a reason to be concerned hed never admit itdoing so would only draw unnecessary attention and spark the wrong kind of debate around the game I know Series S defenders may not want to hear this but Ill say it anyway if you own a Series S you shouldnt even be questioning how games will perform on it The Series S simply isnt meant for those focused on high performance,,0.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw6qfqc,andDevW,,0,2024-11-09 02:13:58,,,,If you start thinking down that road youll end up spending more money and buying a PS Xbox isnt for users who want the best of anything its the least expensive console,lw5hsho,1.0,1gml1bs

comment,lw7vlqc,kaydeejay1995,,0,2024-11-09 07:41:15,,,,Im 99 sure itll run just fine Think of what a fantastic experience GTA5 was on the 360PS3 6 will be fine on SX and base PS5,,0.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw6xnkn,andDevW,,-3,2024-11-09 02:59:36,,,,The reality is that without a PS5 exclusivity deal in place GTA6 needs to drop on both PS4 and PS5 Fact is that Rockstar could make a game titled GTA6 and sell that game for 60 on PS2 PS3 PS4 or PS5 Until Sony kills off the PS4 theres no reason for Rockstar to voluntarily make less money when its clear that the focus is on sales rather than delivering a standardized GTA6 experience,,0.0,1gml1bs
comment,lw7g018,ChelseaG12,,2,2024-11-09 05:12:20,,,,PlayStation secured marketing exclusivity for GTA 5 Sony and R gave GTA online players 1 million a month until the PS5 version was released Im sure theres something in the pipeline PlayStation has always gotten exclusive content or timed exclusives They used to get CoD exclusive content Rockstar wants a streamlined experience Having GTA 6 on old hardware wouldnt make sense Everything they are working on wouldnt be possible on old consoles If you look at TTs investor relations you will see that theyre doing just fine GTA is keeping them profitable They can afford to lose money on other franchises Sony will definitely phase out first party titles for PS4 but third parties are still making games The last game for PS2 was released in 2013 PES 2014 PlayStation 3 is online to this day They have no real reason to end support for PS4 Theyll still push updates and keep the store up It has millions of active users GTA 6 will probably be the game to make people upgrade their consoles,lw6xnkn,1.0,1gml1bs
