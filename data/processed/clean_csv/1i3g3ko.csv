comment,m7mui17,Environmental_Job278,,23,2025-01-17 14:43:33,,,,Unless its an intermittent or ephemeral stream how exactly is it intermittent outside or maintenance downtime which affects all power generation sources None of our systems are intermittent considering water flows 247 and doesnt stop to rest at night Most of these systems are able to divert a constant water source that is then routed back to the main body of water just using elevation changes so low flow damns arent necessary If we want to actually make progress with weaning off of fossil fuels we have to stop fighting things that work but just arent the things we want,m7mo1hb,1.0,1i3g3ko

comment,m7mxdvn,rabbitaim,,70,2025-01-17 14:58:52,,,,Been watching hydroelectric content on YouTube and its a difficult challenge to get it dialed in right Usually they dont produce much power but since they make power at night they can store the additional power into batteries Usually its supplemental their solar array And power generated is subject to seasonal conditions,,0.0,1i3g3ko
comment,m7oge28,crasspy,,21,2025-01-17 19:25:22,,,,Maybe at smaller scalebut at larger scale maybe not Over half of my countrys electricity generation is hydroelectric Thats 20 30 thousand gigawatts per annum Hydroelectric is pretty solid technologyat the large scale,m7mxdvn,1.0,1i3g3ko
comment,m7ozn4j,BloodMists,,17,2025-01-17 21:00:29,,,,Large scale hydroelectric power usually requires devistating natural ecosystems because of dams Without a dam large scale hydro would be just as if not more inconsistent than on smaller scales Also even large scale plants are subject to seasonal changes they are just much less impactful due to the ability to plan and prepare for those changes through the use of dams This isnt to downplay the tech just to point out the downsides of large scale hydroelectric plants There are huge advancements that have been made over the years that significantly lessen the eco impact as well as reduce the foot print that is needed but dams are still an unfortunate requirement if you want consistency,m7oge28,2.0,1i3g3ko

comment,m8784xr,crasspy,,1,2025-01-20 18:13:02,,,,Theyre not unique in impacting the environment Sure theres a scale issue A dam damages a largish area But any piece of infrastructure or extraction damages the environment You kinda have to balance the damage I would have thought the biggest concern with hydro is the climate impact of concrete,m7ozn4j,3.0,1i3g3ko
comment,m7rzpi5,OptimisticSkeleton,,2,2025-01-18 09:20:01,,,,Thats why people are getting into arrays of collectors in other areas I know arrays of vertical wind turbines and tidal turbines are a thing Maybe what residential and small scale hydro needs are arrays of collectors instead of just one,m7mxdvn,1.0,1i3g3ko
comment,m7ov8l9,Celtictussle,,1,2025-01-17 20:38:42,,,,And at peak they still make the power of a couple of new solar panels Small scale hydro is cool but impractical,m7mxdvn,1.0,1i3g3ko

comment,m7nf2bh,Cleanbriefs,,-12,2025-01-17 16:26:36,,,,Not sure how this is even remotely gonna replace fossil fuels To keep making waterwheels using steel you need raw materials mined with the help of fossil fuels to power up digging equipment and transportation of ores to foundries more fossil fuels to get it to the consumer because trucks and rails use gas and diesel Also those parts for the water wheels like the steel bearings Those are not cheap to make and require extensive manufacturing and metallurgy using fossil fuels Reminds me of celebrities who build sustainable mansions but all the construction equipment used burns more fossil fuels than the house is ever gonna save All those solar panels wind turbines The carbon footprint is thru the roof and the hazardous waste they create cant be recycled or repurposed so disposal costs involve the use of fossil fuels to power up all the equipment to deal with literally trash Just dont forget the real costs involved in making these devices and you are barely making a dent in the use of fossil fuels from a manufacturing point of view that needs to be considered in this entire equation,,0.0,1i3g3ko

comment,m7nrhbq,xamthe3rd,,3,2025-01-17 17:26:03,,,,Heres the thing hes not entirely wrong but hes missing the core of the issue The core of the issue is overconsumption Waterwheels renewable energy solutions its all a bandaid on a gunshot wound The only way we get out of this is with degrowth slashing energy consumption across the board ceasing production of plastic garbage that gets thrown out five minutes after purchase finding ways to live sustainably outside of the endless cycle of commodity production But thats close to impossible and anyway not profitable so slap another bandaid on it Surely this one will make a difference,m7njfjw,2.0,1i3g3ko
comment,m7nmgn5,ShinyRayquazaEUW,,5,2025-01-17 17:01:44,,,,Everything needs to be considered in the equation you are correct Just as an example lets say the wheels are usable for 10 years before replacement and they produce X amount of energy with Y amount it total emissions manufacturing included transportation etc If X energy is equal between fossil fuels and the spinning wheel and Y total emissions over 10 years is lower for the wheel how is that a bad thing The talk should be had about total emissions and total energy output per unit not the nonsense you typed The world is not ready yet for a complete change in the energy industry but step by step hopefully we head in the right direction,m7nf2bh,1.0,1i3g3ko
