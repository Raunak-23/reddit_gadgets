comment,mv99hiv,thisischemistry,,9,2025-05-31 15:16:37,,,,They work just fine They arent extremely accurate but they are good enough to give you a general idea and see if you need further testing If they indicate that you might have a higher level of lead then collect a sample and send it to a lab for accurate testing,mv8oaa2,2.0,1kztums
comment,mva0dr1,Dougaldikin,,9,2025-05-31 17:36:24,,,,Cool thank you for the response mine showed zero lead and a ton of carbonate which makes sense due to the water clearly being very hard due to the abundance of limestone in our area and it being well water Central PA,mv99hiv,3.0,1kztums

comment,mvhs9ya,shitposts_over_9000,,3,2025-06-01 22:37:21,,,,municipal water is typically tested far more frequently than that in my state at least quarterly for items like lead and weekly or even multiple times a day in some cases for the conditions that would result in lead leaching my city claims they average a test every 10 minutes from somewhere in the system if your municipal water authority is incompetent you would need to test every few months if your water authority is competent then the conditions for raiding lead levels are going to be caught by them far before a 10 year testing cycle is going to catch them,mvf9vtq,2.0,1kztums
comment,mvdbmju,GooseSongComics,,1,2025-06-01 05:37:41,,,,Isnt it the friction due to hardness or minerals of the water removing lead particles which then go into your glass Regardless of the lead being reactive or not,mv8asfz,1.0,1kztums
comment,mvecqfz,shitposts_over_9000,,3,2025-06-01 11:31:58,,,,kind of the opposite the US banned lead in drinking water plumbing in the safe drinking water amendments of 1986 most locations stopped using pure lead pipes far far before that and this ban only made the tiny trace amounts in brass fittings illegal pretty much all water in the US has dissolved mineral content and those minerals will deposit very solidly on fresh metal surfaces like lead or copper if your water is particularly hard this can be in as little as a month water gets lead leached into it primarily through corrosion and the mineral lining prevents that corrosion The prime risk is the lack of flowing water combined with the water being too soft and too acidic is the highest risk for that happening That is why most states have the EPA andor health department advising that it you have 80s plumbing or earlier that you should flush your tap for 35 minutes before you first use the water for drinking or cooking for the day Flint and Pittsburg made their water acidic when water that is acidic sits in the pipe unmoving it very slowly dissolves whatever it is in contact with for the first weeks or months this is the mineral deposits after that it is the lead when you wake up in the morning and have your first glass of water eventually the trace amounts of lead rise above the level present in the water naturally You cannot completely avoid lead even without manmade sources it is present in the natural environment but it has significant and long lasting effects in relatively low levels so minimizing unnecessary exposure where practical is important to consider but in most cases there is not all that much more risk with normal water if nothing is being worked on in the system,mvdbmju,2.0,1kztums
comment,mv9bkwn,Agreeable_Sound_7724,,-14,2025-05-31 15:27:28,,,,Everyone on municipal water should get their intake tested Putting aside canal or well water sources which have the potential to be worse Depending on where you live in the US municipal water can obtain many contaminants Arsenic chlorine and mercury are used to kill bacteria at large scale for some water districts but you dont want to drink those Fluoride is also common in municipal water which is great for tooth enamel support but like mouth wash you dont want to drink that outright either And this is before we even mention lead or hexavalent chromium levels Dont trust the bare minimum by local governments to make municipal water a slow poison Food for thought you not only drink tap water but when you shower or bathe your largest organ skin absorbs it then if its a hot shower like some enjoy or you have a mist setting on your shower head you are also breathing it in Bottled water is also an OK workaround but never forget microplastic leeching happens to EVERY plastic bottle Get your water comprehensively tested Eco Water is one company that will do it for free I do not work for Eco Water Dont do this for me do it for YOU and your loved ones,mv8asfz,1.0,1kztums

comment,mv861jl,lidelle,,28,2025-05-31 11:06:34,,,,Is that list longer than 10 countries Do they regularly update the pipes delivering water to residential homes Im curious not trying to be an ass One of the issues with lead in our system has to do with the pipes that deliver the water to homes We can replace the pipes all the way to the street but the citycountystate maintains the lines to and from the water facilities,mv8495v,1.0,1kztums
comment,mv8kvd7,cafk,,9,2025-05-31 12:56:51,,,,Replacing them with modern pipes has been mandatory since 19701980 for the UK Germany from what i managed to quickly look up So if an old broken mains line was lead based it has to be replaced for the past 4050 years instead of fixing the broken pipe assuming segment And drinking water Directives in place since late 90s required mitigations if lead levels were above 25ugL since 2010 10umL and since 2020 its been reduced to 5ugL Based on an older study from 2009 around 25 of households back then still had lead pipes somewhere in the whole chain,mv861jl,2.0,1kztums

comment,mv9uq2s,lidelle,,2,2025-05-31 17:07:39,,,,Bro Its not even safe to drink the water here anywhere and that is controlled by state government So the states lack the funding and initiative to fix anything for our citizens Water quality isnt a fed responsibility I called to get a water report from the state monopoly on water and they started questioning me about why I wanted to know and who I worked for This place is abysmal The fed does very little to protect our water rights Btw my ONE cause I donate to is the state water conservation group The EPA continues to roll back protections allowing statescompanies to poison our water We are large nation but the size isnt the issue Its the corruption,mv98hxx,5.0,1kztums
comment,mv8jvx8,Lopsided_Speaker_553,,-2,2025-05-31 12:50:28,,,,Yes That list is surely longer than 10 Lead pipes are known to be hazardous since about 2 millenia now My country phased them out around 50 years ago At every level The only reason countries still have them today is lack of money or lack of morals imo Its expensive to replace them and when your government has no health standards that would cost big corps extra money it will take another century before they have been replaced,mv861jl,2.0,1kztums
