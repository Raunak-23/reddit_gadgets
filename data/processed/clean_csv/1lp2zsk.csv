comment,n0rhxjr,chrisdh79,,75,2025-07-01 14:24:33,,,,From the article A new technology developed at the University of California Davis is offering hope to people who have lost their ability to speak due to neurological conditions In a recent clinical trial a man with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis was able to communicate with his family in real time using a braincomputer interface BCI that translates his neural activity into spoken words complete with intonation and even simple melodies Unlike previous systems that convert brain signals into text this BCI synthesizes actual speech almost instantaneously The effect is a digital recreation of the vocal tract enabling natural conversation with the ability to interrupt ask questions and express emotions through changes in pitch and emphasis The systems speed translating brain activity into speech in about onefortieth of a second means the user experiences little to no conversational delay a significant improvement over older textbased approaches that often felt more like sending text messages than having a voice call The technology works by implanting four microelectrode arrays into the region of the brain responsible for speech production These arrays record the electrical activity of hundreds of individual neurons as the participant attempts to speak The neural data is then transmitted to external computers equipped with advanced artificial intelligence algorithms These algorithms have been trained using data collected while the participant tried to say specific sentences displayed on a screen By matching patterns of neural firing to the intended speech sounds at each moment the system learns to reconstruct the users voice from brain signals alone One of the remarkable features of the UC Davis system is its expressiveness The participant was not only able to generate new words that the system had not encountered before but also to modulate the tone of his synthesized voice to indicate questions or emphasize specific words The technology could even detect when he was trying to sing allowing him to produce short melodies In tests listeners could understand nearly 60 percent of the synthesized words a dramatic improvement over the 4 percent intelligibility when the participant attempted to speak unaided,,0.0,1lp2zsk

comment,n0u4wnj,hotlavatube,,3,2025-07-01 21:52:34,,,,A decade or so back I read about some research into using brain scanningimaging for interrogation They had hoped to recreate what images and words the person was thinking about If I recall they had limited success with massive caveats If I recall correctly the process required extensive training with willing subjects and was not generalizable There was a Ted Talk on a similar subject,n0sk7cb,2.0,1lp2zsk

comment,n0s8b42,cbessette,,1,2025-07-01 16:28:47,,,,I guess jet packs first appeared in the 1960s so while impressive they still dont blow my mind like interfacing the human brain to machines That still seems like magic to me I can see that this technology could evolve into so many boons for humanity Imagine if paralyzation could be cured The blind to see again the lame to walk Maybe even one day transfer consciousness,n0s40fw,2.0,1lp2zsk
