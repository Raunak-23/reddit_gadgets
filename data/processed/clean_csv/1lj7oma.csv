comment,mzirb05,Tripleberst,,1,2025-06-24 14:43:43,,,,I was asking more along the lines of does any nonChinese manufacturer have the ability to integrate their knowledge of ICE production processes for everything except the power packdrivetrain and scale up their accessproduction of power packs and drive trains that costs will go down to being somewhat comparable to prices for higher end Chinese models I think I understand your question now I think my example still stands which is that if the legacy US automakers have demonstrated that transitioning to EV production wouldnt just be difficult but for awhile felt like an existential problem to them They worried that if they needed to move their production lines to making EVs that they would suffer and possibly die off This could be an artifact of dealing with strong unions like UAW or it could be more deeply ingrained with their existing business model Either way theyve been dragged kicking and screaming into making EVs and havent done a good job with it Its hard to attribute it to any one thing but their history with making ICE cars seems to have more or less slowed them down The way that applies to China is that I dont think you have a long storied track record of making ICE vehicles or dealing with frothing strong unions to slow down progress To me Chinas progress has been extremely fast but glossing over their manufacturers shortcomings I think is just cope for a lot of people Theyre still making an inferior product to Tesla safety and performancewise but at an extremely low cost That in itself is an insane achievement and shouldnt be overlooked but again I care about understanding this space and that means not handwaving those shortcomings but since you mentioned that Tesla needs to basically straight up outsource to be price competitive my presumption is that none of the current players have it together Well theyre not price competitive with Chinese EVs but they dominate over US EVs and other imported EVs They still outsell every other US EV combined When you include imported EVs they still account for more than 13rd of the EV sales in the US and they make more profit on each car sold than any other mass producer This is a huge reason why the stock price is what it is Theyre doing something that the others arent yet which is making EVs and massive profit at the same time Thats where Tesla has it together that no one else does And frankly I expect a number of these companies to go out of business trying to compete with Tesla and theres no telling the bloodbath that will ensue once Chinas EVs start selling in the US without tariffs I dont know if that will ever happen because of security concerns but it could,mzimi5n,9.0,1lj7oma
comment,mzjf9w4,karamisterbuttdance,,3,2025-06-24 16:37:03,,,,I think I understand your question now I think my example still stands which is that if the legacy US automakers have demonstrated that transitioning to EV production wouldnt just be difficult but for awhile felt like an existential problem to them They worried that if they needed to move their production lines to making EVs that they would suffer and possibly die off This could be an artifact of dealing with strong unions like UAW or it could be more deeply ingrained with their existing business model Either way theyve been dragged kicking and screaming into making EVs and havent done a good job with it Its hard to attribute it to any one thing but their history with making ICE cars seems to have more or less slowed them down My assumption here is that theres always going to be a netloss of jobs involved because of the difference in engine and drive train supply chain and of course unions wont stand for that The US is at a major cost disadvantage when it comes to battery production as it just doesnt have the capacity and the cost difference on both raw materials and labor cost is substantial The way that applies to China is that I dont think you have a long storied track record of making ICE vehicles or dealing with frothing strong unions to slow down progress To me Chinas progress has been extremely fast but glossing over their manufacturers shortcomings I think is just cope for a lot of people Theyre still making an inferior product to Tesla safety and performancewise but at an extremely low cost That in itself is an insane achievement and shouldnt be overlooked but again I care about understanding this space and that means not handwaving those shortcomings Well theyre not price competitive with Chinese EVs but they dominate over US EVs and other imported EVs They still outsell every other US EV combined When you include imported EVs they still account for more than 13rd of the EV sales in the US and they make more profit on each car sold than any other mass producer This is a huge reason why the stock price is what it is Theyre doing something that the others arent yet which is making EVs and massive profit at the same time Thats where Tesla has it together that no one else does Also by US manufacturing it reads to me that youre comparing specifically to CONUSbased manufacturing regardless of badge And frankly I expect a number of these companies to go out of business trying to compete with Tesla and theres no telling the bloodbath that will ensue once Chinas EVs start selling in the US without tariffs I dont know if that will ever happen because of security concerns but it could I personally do expect USbased EV manufacturing to have razorthin margins until the required battery and motor capacity gets built out which given the current infatuation with light trucks just isnt happening Thanks for the talk,mzirb05,10.0,1lj7oma
comment,mzjxwxi,Tripleberst,,2,2025-06-24 18:01:38,,,,My assumption here is that theres always going to be a netloss of jobs involved because of the difference in engine and drive train supply chain and of course unions wont stand for that The US is at a major cost disadvantage when it comes to battery production as it just doesnt have the capacity and the cost difference on both raw materials and labor cost is substantial Yes firmly agree on all points here The US had an opportunity to secure materials in a futureforward posture but leaned into what would benefit the unions and status quo Also by US manufacturing it reads to me that youre comparing specifically to CONUSbased manufacturing regardless of badge Yes but that line gets blurred often because assembly vs manufacturing is a grey area for most of the automakers these days Tesla is the most vertically integrated and make a ton of their own components I personally do expect USbased EV manufacturing to have razorthin margins until the required battery and motor capacity gets built out which given the current infatuation with light trucks just isnt happening Thats exactly right and its why Tesla stands out from that crowd because some of the legacymade US EVs still sell at a loss whereas Tesla makes a fat profit from every car that they deliver Those margins are tighter now given the current economy but the picture is much worse for the legacy automakers Ford was losing so much money on Lightnings that they halted production in Q4 last year A headline about that has limited traction here on Reddit but stagnating Cybertruck sales get everyone excited The CT is a piece of shit btw I had resd two of them years ago and when I saw the final product I canceled Edit I went to go look up how much money Ford was losing on their EVs and found an article addressing Q1 last year New York CNN Fords electric vehicle unit reported that losses soared in the first quarter to 13 billion or 132000 for each of the 10000 vehicles it sold in the first three months of the year helping to drag down earnings for the company overall And that was before Trump canceled the EV tax credits,mzjf9w4,11.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzu4i0t,Tripleberst,,1,2025-06-26 05:56:39,,,,I dont think you understand what Im saying when I said that Teslas dont have the same problems They do have issues with fit and finish quality which is what youre talking about but they dont just randomly catch fire Theyre also more likely to remain safe in the event of an accident The interior of a nice byd or zeekr is going to be nicer than a Tesla in terms of luxury features and other flourishes They may not have the same quality consistency problems on fit and finish that Teslas do I just havent seen enough reporting on that to know for sure Part of that is because China just doesnt have the same social media situation that the rest of the world does Again what Im talking about is the quality and performance of the battery BMS motor controller infotainment package and safety systems around all that Its reasonable to care about fit and finish but if your car has a battery fire randomly start when its just sitting idle for a few days again like what just sank the Morning Midas youre probably going to care more about that than panel gaps and USB ports,mztwkaz,7.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzjxazu,gay_manta_ray,,0,2025-06-24 17:58:48,,,,youre wrong but you dont see how because you understand china the first thing anyone needs to understand about china is that its 1 priority is china itself how would invading taiwan lead to a better outcome for china than a continuation of the status quo people point at TSMC as some kind of grand prize but maintaining amicable relations with the rest of the world while the USA and western powers in general make fools of themselves on the global stage will benefit china more in the long run than an invasion in the meantime theyre pulling ahead of the west in many important sectors and are making good progress in chip fabrication in the coming decades when chinas rise continues or even accelerates and the west continues its decline both strategically and economically due to its inherent dysfunction why would taiwan continue to ally itself with the west what benefit is it to them chinas consumer market will definitely be even larger then and the life of someone in shanghai is not any different than someone in taipei today add in the general influence of the sinosphere and taiwans increasing economic reliance on china itself and its very easy to see how taiwan is peacefully absorbed back into china by 2050 or so china really doesnt have to do anything other than wait,mzjv2cp,8.0,1lj7oma

comment,mziamgg,yvrelna,,2,2025-06-24 13:18:54,,,,Generally the second time a technology is developed it wont take as long or as much effort as the first one China could hire some engineers that used to work on those systems and clean room engineer their own version There are perfectly legal way to do that that would not be a copyrightpatent violation Even former users of these systems that dont actually know how the machine internal itself works but have general knowledge on how to use them can be a massive help in redevelopment of a technology China have the ability to hire smart engineers that knows the fundamental physics behind these technologies The reason most other commercial companies failed to redevelop these technology is generally because it wont be commercially competitive against the incumbent but since China is being blockaded anyway this actually creates the perfect environment to redevelop the technology The blockade is what creates the market opportunity as China have a really big vested interest in making this work the company that is trying to get this work done will get the full support of China Sure there might be missing bits and pieces that they would have to redevelop and lots of it But once you know that something is possible and a general direction to go to it wouldnt take as much time as the original invention to reinvent them from scratch Really the only thing that can prevent this rise and sabotage Chinas attempt would be to lift the trade blockade just at the right time so the company dissolve itself before they reach their goal That will kill the Chinese market for their sub par hardware and makes the company unviable But that will only do so much,mzi3xqi,4.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzkm5gb,Buttersaucewac,,1,2025-06-24 19:59:15,,,,Hardware wise nothing Rootkit in the driver package or the associated desktop app which get installed with admin permissions That wouldnt be hard The Nvidia desktop app already scans a bunch of folders like Program Files to try and locate games and reports telemetry to Nvidia if you allow it which is a toggle in the Nvidia app you trust it to respect not an OS enforced permission There wouldnt be anything stopping an equivalent app from scanning other folders reading files in your Documents folder and sending that data This wouldnt even read as malicious by an automated scanner or anything if the app has an upload my screenshots to Imageshack type feature then its expected to be reading files from the users home folders and sending them over the Internet And Windows permissions arent as accessible clear and fine grained as AndroidiOS permissions most people will never know how to check or control what files an app is touching,mzhsrcj,4.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzk0c1c,SoSKatan,,1,2025-06-24 18:12:53,,,,Not sure why the Rica 128 was faster and cheaper than the 3dfx offering at the time It made NVidia an easy buy 3dfx had a bit more branding and they also had a proprietary API glide So the argument was a 3dfx supported more games At the time that was kind of a big deal given there were only a few dozen pc games that supported 3d accelerated cards I dont agree that NVidia cards were a joke I still recall showing off my the performance of my Riva 128 Keep in mind that Nvidias model then is still the same as it is now a 3rd party integrator made and sold the actual card not NVidia It took a while for the market to catch on as there wasnt trust or name brand recognition with NVidia but their cards were actually really good compared to 3dfx at the time It wasnt until GeForce 256 only 3 years later that everyone realized that 3dfx isnt going to be able to keep up I dont agree that nvidias first chips were mid It was only the NV1 that didnt take off as the chip was weird as it handled geometry very differently than everyone else it used quadratic texture mapping instead of triangles etc Its mostly a chip few people are aware of in fact I only first learned of it in the last decade,mzjxwyw,3.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzkp8x6,SoSKatan,,1,2025-06-24 20:15:15,,,,They added a OpenGL driver later on but it was mostly designed around D3D You nailed the key point glide support that mattered at the time as so few games had hardware 3d support But glide was made by 3dfx and no other companies could make a driver for it The post above that said NVidia was slow at the start is wrong The hardware was good it was just there was already some competitor lock in at that point I personally saw glide as anti competitive and bad for the PC industry so i purposefully got a superior NVidia card,mzkm1l0,3.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzl9jki,TenderfootGungi,,1,2025-06-24 21:52:59,,,,Today Chinas chip manufacturing capabilities are unmatched globally Most of its chip factories were constructed in the past three years and they boast far superior design management and process standards compared to factories built years or even decades earlier These new facilities also leverage higher levels of intelligent management leading to greater efficiency higher production output and lower production costs China has already established a complete chip supply chain including design software production equipment chip design wafer manufacturing chip packaging testing materials and industrial gases Additionally the competition among dozens of chip factories within China is driving prices lower and improving quality This intense internal competition is a key factor behind the rapid growth of Chinese chip products in global markets By 2026 competition in chip manufacturing is expected to extend into advanced manufacturing technologies By 2028 China is highly likely to account for roughly half of the worlds output in advanced chip production Source But you are somewhat correct Right now China is at 7nm trying to get decent 5nm yields While TSMC is at 3nm rolling out 2nm But they are throwing billions at catching up Source,mzhoz7w,3.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzihl3e,watduhdamhell,,-4,2025-06-24 13:56:27,,,,It 100 is the architecture of the chips as well as producing them What an ignorant statement Nvidias bleeding edge designs are why its worth 2 trillion US dollars and TSMC is closer to 500B Manufacturing is tough and TSMC is notoriously the leader here But at the end of the day its a system integration job think ASML machines combined with some proprietary technology and methods Meanwhile the Nvidia GPUs are completely proprietary and 100 a design job meaning its far more theoretically complicated It should be clear to anyone that designmanufacturing always RD is always academically harder and thus more advanced than production and Im saying this as a plant engineer Design and RD always precede production because duh How else would it even work China is behind on the design of the chips more than anything else not production That is the NEXT hurdle It doesnt matter if you have competitive chip designs if you cant make them or make them fast enough,mzhoz7w,3.0,1lj7oma

comment,mzixe7v,SemiSymmetry,,1,2025-06-24 15:12:24,,,,Thanks for your reply 1 The issue is that Chinese GPUs are currently far behind and their cost is also high Most supporters purchase them to show goodwill rather than actual gaming In addition the government focuses more on subsidizing nongaming specific chips So I dont think the market will change as quickly as some posts suggest Since you mentioned BYD Id also like to point out that BYD has been working extremely hard for almost 30 years to become a gamechanger in the automobile industry I would expect a similar timeline for Chinese GPUs to reach dominance 2 I believe this is not just a GPU issue but also a game development issue Ingame performance depends heavily on developers optimization I consider this to be the biggest challenge since I have tasted strong negative sentiment toward China during my stay in the US The good news is that once the broken window effect takes place the situation could improve quickly 3 I agree with your first and second points However each has some minor issues The first one relates more to common production problems which can be improved through continuous manufacturing over 12 years I am 100 sure the second approach is the main focus Ive seen many professionals return to China for semiconductorrelated research including my former PhD supervisor I have no doubt that the US sanctions will eventually fail However even after EUV is developed it will still take time to shift into mass production phase of both the machines and the chips Regarding the last point manufacturing facilities require regular maintenance which makes the demand similar to that of developing the entire system Therefore I expect 35 years for EUV and chip production an addition 23 years for GPUs to catch up and another 23 years for global game developers to adapt Anyway credit to Trump川建国 and Biden拜振华 for ending the debate over selfsufficiency in China,mzig64a,2.0,1lj7oma
