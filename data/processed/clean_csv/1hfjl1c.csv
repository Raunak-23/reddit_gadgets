comment,m2c01nb,TheW83,,415,2024-12-16 14:32:18,,,,I dont understand why they put the 822 Dolby Atmos system in there If this were a cheap product then I can understand it but most people able to afford this would be spending a lot more on a proper sound system,,0.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2cfae8,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,,127,2024-12-16 16:00:31,,,,i dont have time for an atmos rant but basically dolby has completely borked the ATMOS meaning it means one or some of the following ATMOS codec support dolbys ATMOS processing features multichannel playback beyond stereo in some loose compliance with the ATMOS multichannel spec,m2cccx3,2.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2cgph0,cat_prophecy,,85,2024-12-16 16:08:13,,,,I could not even tell you what Atmos does It seems like Dolby has like 400 versions of the same thing that they call slightly different names,m2cfae8,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2cqqk1,LongBeakedSnipe,,29,2024-12-16 17:01:34,,,,I mean the actual thing is just ceiling speakers right or speakers that are pointed to bounce off the ceiling Anything else is presumably just using the brand name to sell shit,m2cgph0,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2dpcgr,nope_nic_tesla,,61,2024-12-16 20:00:56,,,,Its locationbased sound objects defined in 3D space rather than defined by specific channels including height information which does not exist in older standards paired with a high quality codec I have a surround sound setup with proper Atmos support and Atmos mixes sound noticeably superior to traditional 51 or 71 mixes The fact that sound is all defined by location instead of channels also allows for different setups with an arbitrary number of speakers You arent limited by 51 or 71 or whatever,m2cqqk1,5.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2diord,Stingray88,,5,2024-12-16 19:26:44,,,,Its not that up firing speakers arent doing anything they just dont really achieve the goal of Atmos or surround sound for that matter Youll certainly notice a difference with extra channels Compare a stereo vs surround sound capable soundbar for instance theres absolutely a difference Speaker systems with more channelsdrivers will sound fuller which a lot of people may appreciate personally I find it to be a bit of a mess But these systems are no replacement for a proper surround sound or Atmos system with speakers placed in their proper locations around your room Thats the only way you can actually get the directional atmospheric sound as these mixes are intended to be delivering Theres no way around this its just physics,m2d66uf,7.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2eubry,Call_Me_ZG,,1,2024-12-16 23:44:24,,,,Depends on whay youre comparing with tbh Keeping price consistent the upward firing definitely create better surround sound They cant compete with dedicated ceiling mounted speakers of course but for an average user its much easier to come close to ideal conditions for upward firing sound bar than to setup a sound system that will perform better Esp at a similar price point Ive noticed the bigger problem is content A series would have like 1 episode with 10 seconds where sound is properly mixed to take advantage of it but would be advertised as dolby atmos Edit im my example im considering a soundbar like samsung 990 So dedicated rear speakers placed in the correct position I think part of your argument was that speakers need to be in the correct place so we might be in agreement,m2ctvk6,6.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2dipnt,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,,2,2024-12-16 19:26:52,,,,as i said it can be one or some of those three things so the ATMOS file codec is ATMOS the dolby atmos processing that is done to normal stereo files can be called ATMOS and finally the multichannel speaker setup with an emphasis on height channels can be called ATMOS all of which should be called something different but i digress,m2cgph0,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m4pf36o,livevicarious,,1,2024-12-31 15:46:43,,,,ATMOS is just different version of already implemented surround sound The only real difference is the added height channel So its 51 with an added channel of height Thats really it The mixes are also a bit different you have location based sound instead of standard channels so when sound team creates audio they can play with the audio a bit more and give it locations instead of this sound plays from this channel speaker Think of a halo around you Traditional 51 has the center left right and rear left right 5 and a bass if you have one 1 When sound mixing for this you would say these sounds go to this speaker at this level of volume Imagine these FIXED to a certain position on the halo around you They can put sounds here or there only and at certain levels Atmos allows them to pick locations on the halo around you to give more precise sound With the added bonus of a height channel vertical halo above you This helps the precision a bit more because if for example something flies overhead and to the left right or behind you tricks your brain better in the perceived surround sound depth It really does make a huge difference when I finally splurged and got my Bose 900 with surround speakers I had family over and we watched a few movies with great Atmos support and there were times people kept pausing the movie thinking something fell or dropped in the kitchen behind us There was one movie I loved to put on for people because it had a knock on door scene that the direction was where my front door is and it gets them EVERY time It literally sounds like someone is at my door Last scene was I believe in The Sandman show there is a rain scene that gives you the effect of rain actually falling down on you You can hear the rain move from ceiling to floor Its VERY good when done right Problem is not all moviesshows have it and those that do only a few really take the time to utilize it properly,m2cgph0,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2d7c8v,MrOaiki,,13,2024-12-16 18:28:25,,,,Atmos is a way or placing sound in a three dimensional space without specifying which speaker is to play it When we mix say Dolby 51 for a feature film we need to say which speaker is to play what sound But with Atmos we say it should play from over here in a 3D space And then that is converted into physical speakers on the other end If you have a hundred speakers that position in space will be perfect and exact If you only have four speakers not so much And if you only have two like AirPods it wont be precise at all but it will try to simulate 3D space,m2cfae8,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2djlgm,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,,2,2024-12-16 19:31:23,,,,the object based codec is one part of ATMOS yes but it is hardly the first object based codec and dolbys marketing of it has only added extreme confusion as a set of speakers by themselves should not be considered ATMOS yet the marketing has really pushed all kinds of things to have the name slapped on it,m2d7c8v,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2dq3sj,MrOaiki,,2,2024-12-16 20:04:54,,,,What codecs Any wide spread ones And what things If they natively support the codec they are per definition Atmos products,m2djlgm,5.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2dtgv9,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,,1,2024-12-16 20:22:35,,,,DTSX MPEGH 3D are two a passive speaker doesnt natively support any codec its an analogue device but ATMOS is being used to refer to all 3 points that i mentioned not just codec support,m2dq3sj,6.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2lcjr2,gomurifle,,1,2024-12-18 01:51:28,,,,So basically the name means atmospheric sound then,m2d7c8v,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2scq6v,MrOaiki,,1,2024-12-19 06:35:21,,,,Maybe the name derives from that but its rather a widespread standard from mixing to pressing play I say I want the sound to play right above the audiences head and it will play right above the audiences head as long as its Atmos all the way,m2lcjr2,5.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2d0szs,Fredasa,,5,2024-12-16 17:54:31,,,,Its basically the same philosophy behind Samsung calling their hopelessly hamstrung LCD standard QLED It carries the potential of tricking some consumers into making a bad assumption and purchasing a product based on said assumption,m2cfae8,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2db3a8,throwawaybottlecaps,,6,2024-12-16 18:47:47,,,,I think QLED is Samsungs name for LCD televisions with a Quantum dot coating The coating more or less allows the blue led backlight to project a strong white light Im sure Samsung is leaned into making it sound like OLED to increase marketability but its still a legit improvement and new technology over older LCD TVs which cant produce a pure white backlight,m2d0szs,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2e3vub,Fredasa,,4,2024-12-16 21:16:55,,,,You have to know what youre buying into when you get a Samsung They saddle the user with a bevy of nondefeatable quirks many of which are exclusive to the brand Quick example Every QLED uses dithering which effectively lowers the resolution and perpixel color reproduction below the panels 4K The only way to disable it is to label your input as PC But it still comes right back if you stray from 2997 30 5994 or 60 Hz such as when watching a movie at its native framerate There isnt a service menu option to wrestle with this,m2db3a8,5.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2dj20z,MYNAMEISNOTSTEVE,,1,2024-12-16 19:28:37,,,,both ATMOS and QLED have markedly new technologies in them QLED specifically is a way for significantly better performance LCD panels with a much smaller price hike than OLED,m2d0szs,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2eia4g,jjayzx,,2,2024-12-16 22:34:13,,,,QLED is LCD panels not LED They are backlit by LEDs like any modern LCD TV,m2dj20z,5.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2iujn5,JeffCrossSF,,2,2024-12-17 17:30:30,,,,Not the same at all And yes I agree with you to a limited extent Ive even had CTC stereo speakers which extreme separation between speakers Atmos is not a wide stereo gimmick it is a completely new way to mix and place sounds in 3D space Binaural sound has been around for a long time but the tools available now are far more sophisticated,m2d27bd,4.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2hmpc8,None,,3,2024-12-17 13:16:07,,,,Half joking And Im sure they do for the theater but yall suck ass at stereo tv mixing Ask literally anyone Might as well let AI do it I cant think of a single movie that didnt have over the top loud audio at some point and vocals that are buried Why do you think subtitles have become more popular,m2foh4d,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2l9tjw,LowOnPaint,,2,2024-12-18 01:34:46,,,,Maybe thats because its not mixed for stereo its mixed for a full system and all you have access to is LR channels,m2hmpc8,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2ld2p5,None,,3,2024-12-18 01:54:41,,,,Youre making my point If most peoples TVs are stereo then thats the format they should be mixing it for once the movie comes out to the public But they wont do that because its more money and will cut into their profits,m2l9tjw,5.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2lhwqz,LowOnPaint,,1,2024-12-18 02:25:00,,,,So according to you it should be mastered specifically for the people who give so little thought or care to audio that they cant even bother to invest in a basic 31 audio system through something as cheap as a soundbar Yes lets screw over all the people who actually enjoy cinema enough to do the bare minimum to have a somewhat decent audio experience so that you can hear stuff better through the shit speakers in the back of your TV I forgot the world revolves around you my apologies,m2ld2p5,6.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2ln1wd,None,,2,2024-12-18 02:57:45,,,,Ah a poor tax You only get to experience the movie how it was meant to sound if you can buy the right sound equipment Forget the tv you just dropped good money on those speakers are useless Also pretty sure you can have multiple audio setting for media so it wouldnt cause people who have actual sound systems any problems Its more of a quality of life feature but the working class am I right Maybe you should consider thinking before you talk or write anymore Because your argument does not hold up in the slightest,m2lhwqz,7.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2cxw3i,ObviouslyTriggered,,4,2024-12-16 17:39:23,,,,A proper sound system requires a lot of space if space is not an issue a short throw projector isnt something youll be looking at Also expensive is relative this will be considerably cheaper than proper projectors and inline with high end large screen OLEDs like the G series from LG Youll be looking at circa 45000 for this the JVCNZ900 which is an 8K cinema projector on the other hand costs about 30000,m2c01nb,1.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2c2y5l,anethma,,1,2024-12-16 14:50:07,,,,Ya Ive always found that a weird decision Im also curious about the native resolution of the projector It certainly wont be 8k MAYBE 4k with pixel shift but it would be Samsungs first actual 4k projector Maybe smaller res and even more pixel shift,m2c01nb,1.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2c3o9x,TheW83,,13,2024-12-16 14:54:28,,,,I think the 8k Certification requires a native 8k resolution but Im seeing some sources say native and some just say 8k,m2c2y5l,2.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2cx73b,anethma,,3,2024-12-16 17:35:42,,,,Ok dug quite a bit deeper It is listed as a DLP projector and I checked TIs parts catalog and the largest DLP they list is a new 08 4k DMD part So this 8k projector will be native 4k pixel shifted up to 8k guaranteed Which is still pretty exciting Native 4k projectors used to be in the realm of very expensive JVC and Sony projectors There are no normal consumer 4k native projectors before this,m2c3o9x,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2cutcc,anethma,,1,2024-12-16 17:23:14,,,,Considering Samsung has never even made a native 4k projector Id be kind of surprised if they just came out with a native 8k one but maybe they did Be interesting to see deeper but not able to find much technical info yet,m2c3o9x,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2c8o4x,thehighshibe,,5,2024-12-16 15:23:43,,,,article says it projects at 7680 x 4320 so 8K natively,m2c2y5l,2.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2cue6u,anethma,,3,2024-12-16 17:21:00,,,,I understand that but that doesnt mean its a native 8k projector It will most likely use pixel shift For example Samsung has a bunch of 4k projectors out there not a single one being native 4k,m2c8o4x,3.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2q70kd,thehighshibe,,1,2024-12-18 21:58:16,,,,did some research and youre right they havent said if its pixel shift or not but I feel like them saying that actual pixel count x pixel count points towards it being true 8K on a single chipset like how pixel shift 4K projectors are 4K marketed as 4K and by all accounts 4K clarity but theyre not actually throwing 38404096x2160 pixels Them going out of their way to say itll be 7680x4320 I would think its an 8K chipset,m2cue6u,4.0,1hfjl1c
comment,m2rspb6,anethma,,1,2024-12-19 03:50:59,,,,I looked into it some more and its a 4k chip with pixel shift I dug into TIs DLP parts and they only now have a new 4k DLP 08 chip No 8k chip So ya 4k with 2 way pixel shift would give us 8K apparent On the plus side this will also mean this year coming up we should see some actual 4k native ultra short throw projector hit the market which is actually kind of exciting,m2q70kd,5.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2cllop,Gimpknee,,16,2024-12-16 16:34:31,,,,If youre asking if a person can tell the difference between 8k 4k or 1080 the answer is yes but it depends on the size of the screen and the viewers distance from it Given a normal viewing distance for a television or projector size that would be normal or reasonable for an average room a viewer is unlikely to notice a difference,m2cbepa,1.0,1hfjl1c

comment,m2di4uh,daVinci0293,,2,2024-12-16 19:23:55,,,,A really interesting cursory glance down that rabbit hole gives me the following If we equated the density of photoreceptors in our eyes to a modern digital camera sensor it would have a resolution of about 576 megapixels However our visual processing is way more complicated than a digital camera Our eyes do not have a frame rate per se they are constantly picking up huge quantities of dynamic information Between our central vision the area with the most acuity and detail and the amount of processing our brain does to produce a cohesive experience the estimate is closer to 7 15 megapixels 4k is 8 Mp and 8k is 33 Mp and given that our eyes effective resolution is much higher than that its reasonable to say we havent quite reached that limit yet And as a previous poster mentioned the ability to perceive the difference has many factors Id say between the nuance that is the human visual experience and the vagueness that is the 4k and 8k standards how big is a pixel its reasonable to assume that we can tell the difference And it will be a while before we fully stop being able to tell the difference but will the cost of price and complexity continue to be worth it,m2cbepa,1.0,1hfjl1c
