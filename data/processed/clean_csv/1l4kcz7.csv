comment,mwboh8i,AggressiveChemist249,,71,2025-06-06 14:40:58,,,,The AirPods have better iPhone integration My Sony ear buds last years longer than my Apple ones,,0.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwchleu,brett1081,,59,2025-06-06 17:00:49,,,,Sony is just a straight up better electronics manufacturer than most This doesnt surprise me in the least,mwboh8i,1.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwclll5,AggressiveChemist249,,35,2025-06-06 17:19:49,,,,Its relatability VS features The apple might rank higher in reviews but man My Sonys are still working many years after the same Beats quit Sony is the Better VALUE,mwchleu,2.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwd19yk,astro_plane,,11,2025-06-06 18:35:29,,,,Beats have always been crap Ive never had one pair that has lasted or even sound good Sony all the way Ive been using my Slinkbuds for three years now with zero issues,mwclll5,3.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwdzeyh,Wilson-theVolleyball,,4,2025-06-06 21:29:59,,,,Dunno about their other products but Ive had the Beats Fit Pro for a couple years now and I think its pretty good Comfortable secure fit and sounds solid Only thing I dont like about it is the cheap quality case,mwd19yk,4.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwf1cge,CamiloArturo,,3,2025-06-07 01:13:36,,,,There is a huge difference between Beats and Apple Beats are a low quality brand with a lot of marketing and makes a lot of money for Apple The AirPods though are a very high end line of earphones Still I agree Sony outlived them in quality 100 of the times,mwclll5,3.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mx8j1lb,GrayDaysGoAway,,2,2025-06-11 17:39:46,,,,The AirPods though are a very high end line of earphones Not even close to true They are very much mid range in terms of pricing sound and build quality The true high end of IEMs are on an entirely different level,mwf1cge,4.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mx8jkrc,CamiloArturo,,1,2025-06-11 17:42:13,,,,AirPods Pro are a magnificent piece of tech They are indeed highend tech devices I dont use them but that doesnt mean they arent,mx8j1lb,5.0,1l4kcz7

comment,mwalo7z,mattapotato,,32,2025-06-06 10:45:45,,,,Had the old version of these and thought they were remarkable for the price now I have overpriced AirPod pros latest gen and regretting the switch,,0.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwd3bj5,QuestGiver,,9,2025-06-06 18:45:41,,,,I use android for everything but still buy airpod pros for noise cancellation I just got off a flight with them and they are just such a game changer I never pack my Sony xm3 anymore to save space At least in my experience they do last well I still have the originals which are still kicking as well as the 2nd generation,mwalo7z,1.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwi3vu6,NaBrO-Barium,,5,2025-06-07 15:24:57,,,,Not sure why the downvotes Talk of the town is noise cancellation but pass through is the bees knees too Not having to take them out to have a conversation is nice,mwd3bj5,2.0,1l4kcz7

comment,mx1a5my,GrayDaysGoAway,,3,2025-06-10 15:48:36,,,,Not having to take them out to have a conversation is nice Virtually every single mid to high range pair of wireless buds do this exact same thing,mwi3vu6,3.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mxwcfs8,RapNVideoGames,,1,2025-06-15 12:20:26,,,,Im assuming because theyre comparing headphones from 3 generations ago to anc in AirPods Im sure the new gens are more comparable,mwi3vu6,3.0,1l4kcz7

comment,mwhtzw3,dctrhu,,10,2025-06-07 14:31:52,,,,Ive had WFC500s for a couple of years now and I use them for genuinely about 6 hours a day The batteries are great they fit my ears better than most the controls are welltuned and theyve always sounded great I spent 30 on them from HMV and it might be the best value for money Ive ever got When or if they ever need replacing it will be Sony WFCs I replace them with so Im glad to see that the newer models are just as good value,,0.0,1l4kcz7
comment,mwkquyo,Glittering_Power6257,,4,2025-06-08 00:09:31,,,,Have the older C700n These fit and stay in my ears far better than the Airpod Pros While the Airpods have superior noise cancellation and iPhone integration it means jackall when the things cant seal and keep falling out,,0.0,1l4kcz7

comment,mwqbepl,Treats,,1,2025-06-08 22:10:29,,,,Curious how these compare to my 40 Soundcore Space A40s For me these things are too easy to lose to want to spend that much on the A40s sound pretty good to my ears,,0.0,1l4kcz7
comment,myqwzsy,Jeff9967Ok,,1,2025-06-20 03:00:17,,,,Had used Sony WFSP700N for 4 years love its noise cancelling Find its biggest problem is battery life It only lasts about one hour after taking out of the case,,0.0,1l4kcz7
