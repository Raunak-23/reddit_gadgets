comment,lw82w5t,madjohnvane,,24,2024-11-09 09:01:18,,,,Already happened last time with Apple when he demanded Tim Apple build stuff in America They already produced the 2013 Mac Pro in Texas and had so many issues Production at one stage was held up weeks because they couldnt get a certain size screw in the right quantities because the local makers and suppliers couldnt meet the demand or the time frames Meanwhile in China they could organise supply often within hours Its not just the case of building a factory and magically building the products they are complex combinations of hundreds or thousands of parts And even stuff like aluminium milling there was a time when Apple was using something like 90 of Chinas aluminium milling capacity And even if you bought a bunch of mills and slapped them in the USA I remember one pundit saying a lot of this equipment then wouldnt have the operational expertise and it could take ten years to build it up to the levels you can get in China because they do so much manufacturing Bottom line is you cant just rush production back to the USA and expect it to be better Itll possibly be worse slower lower yields worse quality until you build up that expertise You can see this is slowly happening as production moves out of China into other countries including the USA but its a slow and steady wins the race operation It just cant be picked up and plonked down and expected to continue like normal,lw81vjm,2.0,1gn4yrk

comment,lwb3w4y,madjohnvane,,5,2024-11-09 21:04:44,,,,Time and investment is the only solution And likely a necessary huge increase in the cost of goods But if massive tariffs drive prices up then manufacturing locally probably does make sense long term as consumers adjust to the new prices as then the higher cost of wages and possibly materials can be offset You need expertise and you need large scale manufacturing of the small worthless stuff springs screws brackets custom aluminum shrouds endless little bits of stuff that you need large capacity and a large workforce to produce for a large number of manufacturers Its a bit chicken and egg because you need local buyers to have local capacity but you need local capacity to make it viable for local buyersmanufacturers And all of this is well and good for low volume stuff but anyone making 100 million devices and needing a billion precise components makes it hard,lw8lbf0,4.0,1gn4yrk
comment,lw82py6,None,,10,2024-11-09 08:59:20,,,,Sure But if we accept the theory of comparative advantage even when you factor in the jobs created by the return of a domestic industry tariffs are still a tax on the consumer In this case US labour costs alone are likely to make domestically produced consoles and other electronic goods much more expensive than those produced in lowwage countries You we Trump whoever might decide that wed rather have domestic jobs and expensive goods But that doesnt stop the decision being a tax on consumers,lw81vjm,2.0,1gn4yrk
comment,lwbth0l,DominianQQ,,6,2024-11-09 23:29:57,,,,Your fucked short term as well because no one can meet the demand Like you say people under estimate the time it takes to build expertise and flexible production The US can with out a doubt do it but it is still people who need to learn in the process no matter how much money you throw at them Who wants to invest the money when you risk the next president removing the tariffs,lw82py6,3.0,1gn4yrk
comment,lwc09ca,devo_inc,,3,2024-11-10 00:10:05,,,,Electronics will never be cheaper to produce in the US Those jobs will never come back no matter how many tariffs they impose because the cost to pay Americans wont make it worth their time,lw81vjm,2.0,1gn4yrk
comment,lwcaglq,weasol12,,1,2024-11-10 01:11:24,,,,Dude you need to look up how Hoover exacerbated the Great Depression with his economic policy The idea to cut taxes and rely on tariffs might be the single dumbest economic policy in modern history As tariffs go into effect theres less trade and less trade means less revenue making the budget shortfall worse To add insult to injury the US simply doesnt have enough of the raw materials domestically to produce the goods we consume There is no way for it to make any sense at all outside of a DRASTICALLY cutting spending which they plan to gut any and all entitlement and education spending or b cut military spending which will literally never happen Spin it any way you want it screws over the domestic market every which way,lw81vjm,2.0,1gn4yrk

comment,lwcn4nk,YouLearnedNothing,,-1,2024-11-10 02:29:56,,,,Tariffs would never have just one effect there would be many And every time I hear people talk about them this is the only comment I ever hear consumer tax Heres another Corporations are highly sensitive to market forces and know they cant jack up prices like that or they will simply sell significantly less units So they might stock up prior to tariffs to avoid price hikes in the short term but for a long term approach they ABSOLUTELY WILL consider onshoring the manufacturing and supply chain for their products Example You know how cheap it is to make a light bulp None are made in the US with few exceptions Put a big tariff on them they will get made in the US Auto parts electronics food etc might become cheaper to manufacture in the US again The US can be pretty self sufficient if it really wanted to be The massive corporations may not like it much because their profits would shrink and the little guy would be better able to compete with them but in the end the consumer jobs unions might all benefit in various different way,lw7xl03,1.0,1gn4yrk

comment,lw85an9,None,,-12,2024-11-09 09:28:21,,,,Actually tariffs rarely are fully paid by the consumer What happens is the shipping costs are directly paid by the business But then the business will attempt to increase the price This doesnt always work The market decides the price of things and it always has decided If they jack up the price on a product that is a leisure item they will get shafted The market would respond by not purchasing the PS5s or the games or the controllers or whatever item they price hike They will be able to push the line a bit and still come out with good sales numbers But there isnt a world where things that are leisure items magically double in price because they wont sell any product Some of the tariff will be paid by the consumer Most will be paid by the company selling the device,lw7xl03,1.0,1gn4yrk

comment,lwdop76,XilenceBF,,14,2024-11-10 07:26:11,,,,Well thats the plan indeed To make producing products in the US more financially attractive so that more jobs will be created But the reason why production went overseas is because its a LOOOOT cheaper So left or right things will get more expensive for the consumer in the US Which is so antimaga I thought they were against everyone pays a little to help out the needy This is everyone handing in more of their income so that people who dont currently have a job will have a better chance to get a job Its kind of nice,lwbm850,1.0,1gn4yrk

comment,lw878gp,challengeaccepted9,,11,2024-11-09 09:50:16,,,,Its highly unlikely those 10 million voters change their vote to Republican or 3rdparty Its much more likely those voters didnt participate in 2024 1 Weve seen people explicitly say they dont want to vote Democrat because of Bidens soft touch on Israel I already know what youre going to say and I agree thats a fucking stupid reason not to vote Democrat given the other guy will be far worse on this issue Im mad about it too but a conscious decision not to vote Democrat it is 2 Yes I agree They likely didnt participate Now read what I said again the fact that they voted Democrat last time does not mean they wanted to vote Democrat this time As per above they may well have consciously decided they ARENT going to vote Democrat rather than your interpretation that they WOULD have voted Democrat but just couldnt be bothered going out We cant go track down every single registered Democratic voter or every Bifen voter from 2020 and create a polling report asking them why they didnt vote in 2024 and why they didnt vote for Harris Every single one No obviously not But you do realise polling exists Maybe itll actually give some more insight If it does I expect the general answers would be things like I refused to vote Democrat because of Bidens handling of Gaza rather than I would have voted Democrat but I chose to stay home instead We clearly disagree on this though not as much as you implied we do I thought I was relatively respectful in my disagreement If youre going to chuck strawmen at me and be rude Ill part ways here thanks,lw85iki,7.0,1gn4yrk
