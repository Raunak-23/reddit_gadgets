comment,m74rp3b,zxLFx2,,0,2025-01-14 17:51:18,,,,I know hurr hurr inflation but currently a banana is like 59 20 cents it will be a long ass time until bananas are 10 bucks As an example it took from 1994 until now for inflation to double Also sometimes things decrease in value relative to inflation I remember a plain gallon of milk was 3 in 1995ish and a gallon of nonorganic nongrassfed nonhippy milk is still around 350,m746pw2,4.0,1i178tz
comment,m780pyd,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-01-15 04:27:25,,,,Milk is a bit cheaper in relative dollars but not THAT much It was 250 in 1995 and 410 in 2022 according to BLS That 1995 price would be 480 in equivalent dollars Also bananas are like 065 a pound not per banana,m74rp3b,5.0,1i178tz

comment,m74qvm8,stellvia2016,,2,2025-01-14 17:47:22,,,,Which I think some people arent understanding even if the price is still outrageous The x90 cards that began with the 40 series are kinda a new segment Even the 3090 was only like 3035 faster than the 3080 The 4090 was something like 7075 better in raster performance Theyre basically making the AI cards available for consumer gaming now in a way So just ignore the 90 series at this point and the product lineup doesnt look quite so insane even if 1k is still a lot of money for a GPU,m73zhey,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m7phnnn,Token2077,,1,2025-01-17 22:32:00,,,,I can see and feel the fake frames and the upscaled resolution I dont know if thats because a 27 1440 high refresh makes it noticable though I assume 1080 and 60 hz would mitigate it Upscaled is blurry there is no way around it Native vs even an 80 upscale is atrocious Then add in the weird shimmer and increased latency and I could vomit I turn it on for about 30 minutes any time there is a driverfeature update just to check and while its better than it was it still looks like Vaseline,m768f08,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m74v989,ThePretzul,,4,2025-01-14 18:08:18,,,,My current GPU is a 1070 and Ive been casually looking for a couple years now and the sad truth is that this honestly is a better time than any other since 2020 to be buying a new GPU AMD isnt competitive with the best cards from NVIDIA like they used to but at least their flagship product currently next gen tbd is no longer comparable to a budget lastGen card from Nvidia anymore The 7900xtx is at least roughly comparable to a 4070ti The bigger thing is that GPUs other than XX50XX60 series cards are actually available Prices are still inflated from MSRP but inventory does exist because theyre no longer all being botpurchased for crypto mining You also can buy a used GPU again without it being more likely than not that its toast from running at 100 load 247 mining crypto and those burnt out mining cards were still selling for MSRP and above on the secondhand market in many cases Right now if you wantneed an upgrade because your card is very out of date you can either buy a used 40series that wasnt used for mining at a reasonable discount from someone anticipating the 5000 series release or you can have a better chance at scoring a 5000 series card because fewer people are trying to do a single generation upgrade There arent miners instantly buying up all the inventory and even if its still not perfect or even great there are at least some antibotscalper practices in place at most authorized retailers nowadays To be clear most people will still end up paying inflated prices over MSRP if they want a card now and that sucks Availability is also pretty limited for XX80 cards and above which motivates scalpers to keep buying up retail inventory as it hit the shelves This sucks and theres still a lot of progress to be made to get back to the before times when you could find aftermarket cards in stock within 100200 of MSRP Im just saying its at least a dramatic improvement from how things played out from 20202024 and hopefully the trend continues in a positive direction,m73y46u,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m74bfbg,DFrostedWangsAccount,,12,2025-01-14 16:32:06,,,,Yeah the reddit echo chamber is all aboard the fake frame train but Im staying at the station this generation Whats the point of extra frames if it doesnt help latency I dont want 120fps that feels like 30 I got my steam deck its all the computer I need right now 900 series was the power efficiency series 10 series was taking the gains from the new efficiency and making the cards work harder with the new headroom 20 series was RTX and huge gains in shadowlighting performance 30 series was more 20 series pretty much I think this was the gen with new temporal anti aliasing And the start of the AI rush 40 series has just been an absolute shitshow basically all the same features of the 30 series but more expensive and slightly faster in games All of the major gains have been in AI workloads 50 series is once again AI focused but theyre trying to throw a bone to gamers by giving them frame generation Its just not good enough for me If the new card gets 120fps in a game but feels like 30fps Id rather have the older cheaper card that runs the game at 30fps natively,m73uub5,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m7fxzvo,Alouitious,,1,2025-01-16 12:54:17,,,,The problem isnt the end result its that theyre being disingenuous in how they arrive at it A 5070 is not as performant as a 4090 UNLESS you use DLSS and frame gen and then its only technically If you just think about it framegen is adding extra fancy superspecialAIinterpolated frames They can literally just make it add 200 frames arbitrarily It doesnt equate 11 with raw horsepower With raytracing things get even murkier Bottom line at the end of the day the average joe gamer isnt going to notice a huge difference especially talking about singleplayer experiences but as soon as any level of competitive multiplayer comes into the conversation players will notice things like ghosting smearing and lack of clarity for certain features like text crosshairs grenades etc for example when moving their view quickly Not to mention consumer TVs have had their own version of framegen for over a decade those cheap 120fps 4k TVs all use smoothing and interpolation which is all framegen is just fancier and more advanced which most users that would fall into the latter category turn off immediately because for fastpaced games it looks like crap,m741v4i,9.0,1i178tz

comment,m7429u2,Ryno4ever16,,-2,2025-01-14 15:46:08,,,,I know exactly what Im talking about How about we settle on graphics we can achieve without relying on AI guesswork that screws up image quality instead of always reaching higher and higher Why not optimize our game engines instead of relying on sloppy toolkits that take twice the compute for sometimes worse graphics that could have been achieved for half that 10 years ago Why not hire better art directors to make stylized games that look better with the graphics we can achieve Youre the one who doesnt know what theyre talking about Its obvious with you vaguely gesturing at the difficulties of making better GPUs while not really saying anything Where in my comment did I suggest we should keep faking our way forward Thats your idea,m741bxn,7.0,1i178tz
comment,m78mqlc,TonyZotac,,1,2025-01-15 07:38:09,,,,Im not really sure I get your argument If your goal is that we settle on graphics we can achieve instead of aiming higher and higher Then isnt that already possible because you can just lower the graphical settings to a level that is achievable for your hardware currently Unless what you are wanting is for Devs to better take advantage of the current hardware by optimizing their code and not use buggy engines like UE4 I am assuming this is what you want However what exactly are you hoping to be achieved if theoretically devs made their code perfectly optimized I know you dont want to use AI trickery but are you hoping that this perfect dev code can uplift performance on all GPUs dramatically like taking a RTX 4090 that is performing only at 20FPS with path tracing on Cyberpunk to something like 60FPS or more if code is optimized This draws back to my point about what exactly your argument is about because if you dont think we should achieve more than why cant you be satisfied with 20FPS on Cyberpunk with full path tracing without DLSS Why cant you just turn down the settings to something even like 720p and get great performance But I bet the image wouldnt be great and you would feel like you would be leaving performance on the table and would feel that youre not experiencing the artists full creative vision How about devs just stick to 1080p 30fps targets for their games and make sure the textures are medium quality and maps are semi open world Then we wouldnt have to worry about upgrading hardware and we can let devs spend more time expressing themselves making great storiesgames than worrying about graphics or FPS All in all to me this is what you sound like Gah these incompetent devs If they actually knew how to optimize their games I would be getting better performance on my games along with retaining image quality without these stupid tricks,m7429u2,8.0,1i178tz
comment,m7a6rcm,Ryno4ever16,,1,2025-01-15 15:17:34,,,,Im definitely not calling the game devs incompetent There are a number of reasons these things dont happen from time and budget constraints to using an engine you are unfamiliar with and therefore not doing things optimally within that engine Additionally if theyre using something like Unreal the foundation of that engine is developed by Epic and has been iterated on for 27 years Even though developers can tweak the engine Epic is responsible for maintaining most of the core functionality In that case any performance optimization issues for the engine out of the box fall on them I wasnt JUST talking about optimization Sometimes an engine settles on a particular method for doing occlusion but that method is really bad and slow and theres a much more performant way of doing it that would require a rewrite This is just an example Either way I obviously dont have data on this in terms of how much performance could be gained and I could be completely wrong in thinking this issue could be optimized out of if the standards stayed where they are now Im definitely not blaming the devs I think its just a confluence of factors TLDR Yea maybe youre right,m78mqlc,9.0,1i178tz

comment,m7446fh,ymmvmia,,1,2025-01-14 15:55:41,,,,Visual frame data sure if were talking frame generation But a huge part of the reason people prefer higher framerates is input latency Games are more responsive to your inputs at higher framerates That all is completely gone with frame generation Now upscaling DLSS or FSR upscaling without frame generation That stuff is great Its making devs lazy tho but it is great tech It literally is FREE real frames as youre rendering the game at a lower resolution so the frame rate boost is REAL Frame generation beyond the artifacting and visual bugs with it is purely visual It is preferable to a lower perceived real frame rate sure its innovative too but it cant be counted as video game fps Like I for one hate playing any game with 30fps levels of input latency feels horrible 60fps minimum But ideally 90fps for most games for responsiveness Obviously higher the better for multiplayer but 6090 is a good range for single player titles imo especially difficult single player games,m73w0c4,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m746wot,kinga_forrester,,1,2025-01-14 16:09:31,,,,Sure but 4070 super to 5070 would be a bit of a weird upgrade path Most consumers buying 70 and 60 cards dont upgrade every year In general I feel that the 50 series pricing shows that Nvidia anticipates the gaming gpu market will continue to be soft In that case priceperformance will keep getting better That said this will be a good year to upgrade if you need it,m741z43,5.0,1i178tz

comment,m744zf4,Roseking,,112,2025-01-14 15:59:42,,,,Here is the question and answer from the interview Reporter I have a question regarding gamers and consumers We noticed a significant gap between the RTX 5090 and 5080 The number of CUDA cores in the 5090 is more than twice that of the 5080 and the price has doubled as well Why did you create such a large difference between the flagship and the nearflagship models Jensen Huang The reason is simple Once someone wants the best product they will always choose the best You know the market isnt so segmented And our enthusiasts if they want the best they wont settle for something slightly better or save 100 by choosing something a bit worse They just want the best Of course 2000 is not a small amount and its certainly a high value But keep in mind that this technology is being used in your home theaterlevel PC setup And that PCwhere youve probably already invested around 10000 in your monitor and sound systemwill definitely need the best GPU So many of our customers are simply after the absolute best He isnt talking about jumping down to a 5080 He is saying that people who are buying a 5090 want the best possible If you are spending this kind of money for the best possible you dont want NVIDIA to create a worse flagship so it can be a little cheaper That is what the nonflagships are for Now I do think there is a ton of stuff that can be argued is that really the lowest price they go without needed to drop performance Is that really the best care that they can make But in general I get what he is saying People buying flagship level products want the knowledge that they are buying the best possible,m73pmon,1.0,1i178tz

comment,m75a9dw,Roger-Just-Laughed,,43,2025-01-14 19:20:30,,,,Okay but his point is that the people who are willing to spend 1600 on the best possible GPU probably have a rig at home that already costs thousands of dollars They have money and are willing to spend it on the best they can get their hands on Therefore the 400 price increase is not going to make an impact on them If the 5070 was a 400 increase over the 4070 it would simply priceout most of its customer base They wouldnt be able to afford it and therefore just wouldnt buy one But it is unlikely that anyone who intended to buy a 5090 at 1600 is unwilling to do so at 2000 Its a particular clientele thats less sensitive to price Thats what hes saying,m746s2c,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m77i32l,Nirkky,,11,2025-01-15 02:29:30,,,,So hes basically saying These people would buy it no matter the price so we just put a higher price so we can have more easy money,m75a9dw,4.0,1i178tz
comment,m78776l,randompoe,,11,2025-01-15 05:15:20,,,,That is what they have ALWAYS done Its been like that for uhhh decades Its the smart thing to do Price your flagship as high as you can while keeping the people that buy the flagship happy Im not sure why people are surprised If you arent the targeted audience for a 1600 GPU then you werent the targeted audience for the 5090 to begin with so your opinion on the matter is irrelevant to Nvidia This isnt just the case with GPUs either it happens with cars tools hell even groceries Getting the best possible comes at a steep premium,m77i32l,5.0,1i178tz

comment,m79xxhf,massive_cock,,2,2025-01-15 14:28:53,,,,I hate that hes right and I hate that Im one of those people But yes I dont want to save 10 or 20 of the price I want to know that I have the absolute best thing I can get for my workloads I didnt build a 10000 setup it just came together over the last few years this piece and that piece out of necessity Now I have two beefy rigs under the desk six monitors etc and run over 4000 worth of Nvidia GPUs at original launch MSRP at least So even though Im a broke immigrant it doesnt make sense for me to budget my GPU the primary component of the whole stack and thus cut back on the potential in everything else on my desk I wont be getting a 5090 Not unless by some crazy situation my 4090 cant handle my work anymore But if that time comes I wont look at the 5070 or 5080 even if they turn out to be better than the 4090 Ill look for the best I can get once again And I hate that it is this way,m75a9dw,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m7604n9,Specialist-Rope-9760,,9,2025-01-14 21:34:55,,,,My point seems to have gone over your head People can buy what they want I dont care I bought a 4090 so its not my place to judge Im just saying the pricing gap on the product ladder from the 5080 to 5090 is very big But its priced to attract whales who will pay anything to get the top tier regardless of price,m75r82u,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m776hch,Semyonov,,2,2025-01-15 01:22:11,,,,For the record I do agree with you However I want to mention that at least since the 3090 its pretty easy to break even when selling the past GPU to get the new one Due to various reasons not least of which is inventory issues but also fear of things like tariffs I can sell my 3090 TI for more than I paid for it right now and from what I hear the situation is similar with the 4090 Im not saying its a sure bet that someone who pays 2000 for a 5090 is going to recoup all of that next year or the year after but it doesnt seem to me like GPUs are depreciating the same way they used to at least not on the upper end of the spectrum,m7604n9,4.0,1i178tz
comment,m77cch8,h4terade,,1,2025-01-15 01:55:55,,,,Ive known plenty of people that shop for the best I remember as a teen going into a car audio place with a friend who just walked up to each display found the most expensive amp subs cabinet speakers and said i want those Its weird how people hate on shit theyll never buy because they know better failing to at least to acknowledge there are people out there that just dont care Does it make them suckers maybe in my mind yes to a degree but they also dont worry they just buy good shit every time because they can afford it,m776hch,5.0,1i178tz
comment,m78j52w,TheScienceNerd100,,1,2025-01-15 07:01:45,,,,Pointing at the price gap means nothing if you dont look at the performance gap Anyone can point at a Ferrari and a Honda Civic and say Look at the 1 million price gap but they are both cars so why is the Ferrari so much more expensive when the Ferrari has a better engine more horsepower more RD investment more high quality material more race made tires and brakes higher grade suspension etc Looking at the price means literally nothing if you dont look at the reason its priced more If the 5090 had a 50 increase on performance over the 5080 who is going to say they should be priced at the same value If the 5090 costs 400 more then the only way you have an argument over the price is if the benchmarks show a sub 400 value of proformance over the 5080 But until then you cant just point at the prices and complain until there is a reason to show the price increase isnt justified The CEO has a point where the people who NEED a 5090 have the money for a 5090 If you cant even afford a 2560x1920 120Hz monitor then not only would you not be able to afford a 2k GPU but you wont NEED it anyways My monitor has those specs and the 4090 I have can easily handle it and I probably didnt need it But a 4080 probably would have done the job at a lower cost So unless you have the money for 4k high frame rate monitor to where a 5090 is needed then why complain about the price of a card you dont need Again with the Ferrari comparison if you dont need 700 horsepower race tires and competition suspension why even co sider buying one when a Civic is why cheaper and can do what you NEED it for,m7604n9,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m7458fd,fixminer,,-9,2025-01-14 16:00:59,,,,But that makes no sense Using that logic you could argue that the only cards that should exist are the 5090 and the 5050 You either get the cheapest or the best Its perfectly valid to want a card that costs say 50 more than a 5080 for 50 more performance instead of only having the option to spend 100 more to get 100 more performance,m741vcx,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m74fau8,integrate_2xdx_10_13,,14,2025-01-14 16:51:08,,,,You could its the same argument but taken to the extreme as to be reductive Hes saying that from a business perspective its not profitable to provide more discrete options as by frequency if someones going to pay through the nose someones gonna pay through the nose If tomorrow they brought out the 50885 theyd probably have a shit load left over as people would say whats the point get the 5090 So even if the pricing points are now linear rather than exponential it doesnt really do anyone any good I think rather than criticising this argument which is sound albeit in bad faith its better to point out that cheaper models with an option for configurable VRAM would be more favourable Or splitting the difference between the highest and the second highest,m7458fd,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m74t6fd,IamGimli_,,4,2025-01-14 17:58:18,,,,By his logic though they should have made a 5000 5090 with 40k CUDA cores and a gigabit memory bus width They know they have no competition at the high end and if the market theyre after is only the people thatll pay whatever just so they have the best then they get to dictate what that whatever is,m74fau8,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m74ez98,fixminer,,-7,2025-01-14 16:49:34,,,,How many people willing to spend 1000 arent willing to spend 2000 The answer to both questions is certainly more than zero How many more I dont know 1000 isnt some kind of magic threshold its all arbitrary And why stop at 2k If people will spend anything they should price the 5090 at 10k or something And why didnt they price the 4090 at 2k too Of course there are some people wholl spend anything but most people have limited budgets Some might be willing to spend 15k but not 2k its still a significant jump A 2x gap is the biggest we have ever seen In my opinion it would be foolish of Nvidia not to release a 5080ti that lands somewhere in the middle at some point,m74awtt,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m75woa0,StarbeamII,,2,2025-01-14 21:18:00,,,,I doubt that gap really exists much If youre in the market for a 1000 GPU your complete build is already at 2000 or more and it means youre willing to drop serious coin on your PC build Playing the latest PC games on maximum settings is a luxury hobby and I doubt theres many peoples whos willing to spend 2500 or 2750 on their PC but not 3000 So a 1000 gap makes sense at the high end Whereas at the lower end you have a lot more buyers who are poorer with stricter budgets who might be willing to spend 300 but not 400 on a GPU so you get a lot more product segmentation,m73we2u,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m74yphw,IamGimli_,,1,2025-01-14 18:24:50,,,,We can extrapolate from previous gens though Its the first time that theres an actual doubling of CUDA cores between the 80 line and the top 90Titan Since the 900 series its generally been about a 50 increase in CUDA cores 30 for the 3000 series 68 for the 4000 series which resulted in about 35 better performance in single precision processing power 62 for the 2000 series 20 for the 3000 series 70 for 4000 series I think combined with a much larger gap in memory bus width than usual between the 5080 and 5090 we can probably expect a doubling of the processing power between the two cards if not even a bit more than that Its difficult to say how that will translate to FPS differences but the 5090 really should be able to process twice as much data as the 5080,m749rv6,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m9ynnd5,penny_life,,2,2025-01-30 05:12:22,,,,The problem with simply not doing that is the absolute dearth of options currently I could not buy a 5080 or 5090 and instead buy a new 4080 or 4090 oh wait those have been discontinued by Nvidia so everybody has to get the 5000 series I guess I could just buy one from remaining inventor whoops nevermind not in stock anywhere or scalped for well over retail of even the new 50 series cards Bottom line those of us on much older generation cards 1000 series for me and looking to finally upgrade are getting reamed but we are being herded into having very few options and can do very little about it,m73uk6a,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m758peh,samelaaaa,,3,2025-01-14 19:12:58,,,,I am very interested to see benchmarks on that when it comes out The VRAM is awesome but Id heard its memory bandwidth might be a fraction of the 5090 which would be a bummer for finetuning workloads But yeah overall Im happy that Nvidia is coming out with a product for this use case and hopefully itll help with the weird pricing quandary they are in with the high end gaming cards,m757h0x,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m74tklt,samelaaaa,,3,2025-01-14 18:00:10,,,,I guess but I compare this to the tools that people in other trades have to buy A long time ago I worked as a carpenters assistant and the tools he had to buy or rent to run his business added up to hundreds of thousands Now here I am in ML engineering i run a small boutique AI consultancy and I can buy a literally top of the line GPU that satisfies all my local compute needs for less than 10 hours of billable time Thats insane IMO people buying a 5090 for gaming are like white collar workers who buy tricked out F350s No judgement I love fancy electronics AND trucks lol but these are serious work tools and their pricing is generous when looked at that way,m74s98o,6.0,1i178tz
comment,m74usir,blither86,,1,2025-01-14 18:06:04,,,,I really dont understand how youre only looking at this from one perspective though Here you are looking at it entirely from a business productivy standpoint whilst replying on a thread on a sub reddit for gamers Its honestly like youre simply trolling such is the lacking of self awareness Then theres the perspective that a top of the line gpu of a similar performance level relative to maximum performance capability at the time back during the 1000 series was available for 700 Now its 2000 What is harming gamers is the fact that companies like yours can generate income from these cards and are not being pushed towards their business products Instead buying their top of the line gamingenthusiast 3D modellingvideo editing cards,m74tklt,7.0,1i178tz
comment,m74vid7,samelaaaa,,2,2025-01-14 18:09:31,,,,Ok thats totally fair I didnt realize this was a gaming sub Nvidia tries to differentiate their gaming and professional lineup unfortunately by withholding VRAM from gamers except on their topoftheline cards that they price somewhere in between the core gaming and professional lineup Which ends up making the 90 cards simultaneously stupidly unaffordable for gamers and almost a giveaway to professional users compare the 5090 with the Ada 6000,m74usir,8.0,1i178tz
comment,m74wkxk,blither86,,1,2025-01-14 18:14:41,,,,Yep thats entirely fair I can see why its tough to price for nvidia because if they slapped 32GB of VRAM on a 5070 then no doubt it would become a better value proposition for people such as yourself and theyd cannabalise their higher end sales to businesses who may end up ordering 10 x 5070 instead of 8 x 5090 or something,m74vid7,9.0,1i178tz
comment,m74xi31,samelaaaa,,3,2025-01-14 18:19:07,,,,Yeah exactly And whats funny is the only reason thats true is because the current popular workload LLMs is so ridiculously VRAM bound And they have us by the balls because everything is built on CUDA so the purchasing decision is basically maximize NVIDIA VRAMdollar some weight cuda cores depending on your business Back when it was crypto miners distorting the market for gamers they didnt care about VRAM or CUDA So this situation more than that one singularly affects the 5090,m74wkxk,10.0,1i178tz

comment,m74729y,NTufnel11,,2,2025-01-14 16:10:18,,,,I dont have any particular insight into the inner workings of Nvidia as a business but your perspective of why wouldnt someone want to sell as many units as they can is highly reductive One such explanation is that theyre reducing manufacturing capacity for consumer gaming devices in order to allocate more for the explosive demand from corporations due to AI If theyre making fewer gaming cards especially ones at the high end that seem more for show than to fill a real demand in the market it makes sense to raise the price to the highest level they can to sell the specific number of cards they intend to manufacture This is basic demand curve stuff Or it might be simpler than that and theyd just rather sell half the number of cards at three times the profit This is very plausible for high end luxury products even if it means making you upset that you are personally priced out If you set aside your personal frustration for a moment there are actually a lot of interpretations that arent oh Nvidia must not want to make money,m73xd06,8.0,1i178tz

comment,m74ojgq,KingZarkon,,3,2025-01-14 17:36:09,,,,Most of Nvidias profits are from AI They sell for a lot more than even an RTX 5090 so they would make far more money by selling these chips as AI chips instead of consumer video cards That said as with Bitcoin ASICS are coming to eat GPUS AI lunch Theyre faster and require far less power than GPUS do for the same work Hopefully that will reduce demand for GPU chips and eventually reduce prices at least for future generations of hardware,m73wcmm,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m73wgab,Noteagro,,0,2025-01-14 15:15:51,,,,Well when Intel had the exploding CPUs in the last couple gens they tried to deny it and say it was the customers fault Then everyone started publicly saying they were having failures and Intel had to eat their shit at that point After doing that there was a mass exodus off Intel They literally decided to try to hide their issues and then when called out it burnt so many bridges It baffles my mind how many companies just cant be honest and upfront about their mistakes and will instead do every immoral trick in the book to try to bury it and the only way it seems they will be corrected is if another company or celebrity finally points it out Drives me up a wall,m73u427,4.0,1i178tz
comment,m73u3hs,LucubrateIsh,,1,2025-01-14 15:03:15,,,,In the realm of the cards most people buy the 7900 is about a 4080 The most sold cards are the 4060 and 4070 and their Ti and Super variants and AMD has cards that are certainly as good or better deals there But people buy the 4060 because the 4090 is way ahead,m73pxs9,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m778rnx,brosjd,,-3,2025-01-15 01:35:21,,,,The points that Im making The scalpers dont want the product they want to own the product as a form of capital They will buy it no matter what because they think they can make a profit whether or not that is the case And they cant exactly easily return units in bulk If Im Nvidia Im seeing that a good portion of my products sold at a premium price justifying that price It doesnt matter on the accounting that large quantities were bought by single individuals just that they sold Now over time market research is showing that my products are actually selling for up to double the price so the following release I double my prices Then the scalpers buy and increase again And it goes on and on and on And even if 7080 people stopped buying from scalpers the scalpers still bought from Nvidia,m76yn3d,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m7aulmd,tombolger,,1,2025-01-15 17:16:02,,,,I dont understand how youre getting this I have 2 different friends with liquid cooled 4090s and the latest Ryzen 9s with all the other specs of their builds to the moon and CoD still struggles at 4k to hit 120 fps They both have to use DLSS to run the game at upscaled 1080p to get decent performance which looks fine but it feels ridiculous that their multithousand dollar latest hardware builds still need to play at lower resolutions to get high frame rates and then people still say lower end hardware is fine for 4k gaming It isnt The trillion dollar company behind this racket has convinced us that artificially upscaling a nearly 20 year old resolution standard is better than buying hardware that can support current day resolutions at current day frame rates The marketing is really convincing but stop drinking their koolaid the 5090 is still going to be UNDERPOWERED given the astronomical price They cant support current gamer demands without cheating with software and marketing trickery and they still want to charge 2000 for their best effort and theyve got basically everyone fooled,m7895c0,5.0,1i178tz
comment,m7di1k1,soliozuz,,1,2025-01-16 01:10:42,,,,To be honest I have the ASUS liquid cooled 4090 too but Im running Intel specifically the 13900KS and to be fair the frame rates arent constant typically achieving higher frame rates with game modes like RebirthMultiplayer and achieving closer to the ones your friends are getting 120150 fps in BR But the remainder of the games I play overwatch rivals valorant fortnite seige Im typically in the 240s But this 13th gen is much better than most of the 14th gen counterparts Ive tested as well For instance the 14900KS was significantly more power hungry but it wasnt as OC friendly as 13900KS and the 14900K never once beat a single benchmark As for your second point I completely agree with you its a shame I do believe the 4090 is the last real hardware we got Even AMD was using similar software to upscale the lower resolution multiple times over Its a gimmick if you think about it eventually when hardware that can achieve that theyll downplay what we currently have ie fake frames fake performance and etc And coax the masses into immediately rushing for that Its gross Even for me I probably wont entertain the GPU trend this launch Ill wait until the refreshes come out and etc It seems all of these guys have something thats wrong each time around launch date,m7aulmd,6.0,1i178tz

comment,m748j99,paysen,,8,2025-01-14 16:17:44,,,,Its just impossible to have the same input lag as on real frames because you have much more updates on real frames Imagine a game where you have 30fps without frame generation and 120fps with you only see where the enemy is moving within those 30fps you can smoothen the framerate but the real data you get is only 30fps It wouldnt be much of an issue in many games probably but for multiplayer games I wouldnt recommend it And because multiplayer game nowadays lean towards the competitive side because people probably want it like that I would only recommend it for single player games And even there we have to see how much of an issue it will be In Valorant or CS2 I have like 56ms system latency My monitor is an oled If it will be around 5060ms system latency it will be a big deal and not usable for me But thats just me there will be scenarios and I guess that will be only single player games where it probably isnt an issue I have a 4090 now and probably upgrade to the 5090 when it releases I just dont care about frame generation or dlss For me nothing changes in that regard I will put the raw power to use,m73ru2c,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m76i5r5,paysen,,-1,2025-01-14 23:06:13,,,,No its an example I am telling you how good the input latency in these games is to compare it to demanding games that can be smoothened with mfg dlss You could compare it to the new Black Ops 6 or whatever where kids might think the 5070 will be as fast as a 4090 because of the marketing BS It might have the frame rate with mfg on but it wont be a the same experience as playing on a 4090,m75yx9v,6.0,1i178tz
comment,m74c9n0,CoreParad0x,,1,2025-01-14 16:36:17,,,,Yeah agreed Im skeptical about the input latency on even more AI generated frames I use a 4090 and have played Cyberpunk in 4k with DLSS and frame gen I personally dont notice any input latency issues on that But it seems impossible it wouldnt get exponentially worse with this DLSS4MFG If I upgraded to a 5090 which really depends on what the gamers nexus benchmarks show us I really dont see myself using MFG Single frame isnt bad on most of the games I care about I dont do any competitive multiplayer games but I cant see how MFG wouldnt just get kind of bad Especially turned up to 3 frames,m748j99,5.0,1i178tz
comment,m7595wv,GodDamnedShitTheBed,,-2,2025-01-14 19:15:11,,,,Its just impossible to have the same input lag as on real frames It is absolutely possible but you need to extrapolate the fake frames instead of interpolating This is a lot harder to predict correctly but the reduced latency is worth the lower image correctness if you ask me The application lossless scaling does FG with extrapolation Sure the images look a bit wonky around areas it cant extrapolate but the fluidity without the input lag is so good I use it for a lot of games I cant stand dlss FG for the latency impact it creates,m748j99,5.0,1i178tz
comment,m74vprs,Annonimbus,,1,2025-01-14 18:10:31,,,,Can you explain If I have 30fps and it gets doubled to 60fps then I would only have input in the 30 frames that are real anyway no Sure I dont have input in the 30 fake frames that have been added but if they werent added I wouldnt have input in the missing frames anyway Or am I missing something,m73r1df,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m759oia,Ecmelt,,1,2025-01-14 19:17:41,,,,Because to insert fake frames the real frames get delayed fake frames requires 2 real frames as reference otherwise they could be way off the mark The gpu has to render two frames then wait and generate the fake frame then insert this frame after first real frame in a good time so frame times are consistent This creates a delay between real frames if they were to be shown without any frame generation,m74vprs,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m73vhgt,kalirion,,0,2025-01-14 15:10:44,,,,All frames are generated The question is whether or not they are generated by the game or faked by AI And the AI fakes them by interpolating existing frames it cant actually know what the image should look like So for example and object quickly moving around in a circle can wind up moving in a square because the algorithm would just interpolate it moving directly between the 4 points it sees in the native frames not knowing about any intended curvature in its path If it moves fast enough and the native framerate low enough itll just be shown moving in a line back and forth And Reflex 20 is even worse as its doing the opposite looking at previous frames to guess whats going to be on the edges of the screen If a new object shows up or an enemy changes direction its going to guess wrong and display the wrong information In worst cases it may end up like an online game with bad lag where network code makes everything appear smooth until youre shot by an enemy whom you didnt even see round the corner,m73trsw,7.0,1i178tz

comment,m756t2y,Ecmelt,,1,2025-01-14 19:03:38,,,,Input lag cannot be same because fake frames take information from the real frame before them AND after them and fill the gap between Frames cannot look the same because of same reason it is guesswork they can be very close but never the same right now Important thing to pay attention to is not just similarity but also artifact ratio So what you should hope to see from x4 mode Input lag not going much worse vs x2 mode artifacts being better and easier on the eye because youll only see artifactless frames every 4 frames in x4 mode realfakefakefakereal vs every other frame in x2 realfakereal I am saying all this as information i think upscaling and frame gen are both very useful in a lot of scenarios personally while they DO NOT change the need for real performance so that need is still there too,m73quqg,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m73pwxj,Paul_Langton,,-1,2025-01-14 14:40:05,,,,I mean sure but thats not how it has always been A GTX 1080 Ti was 700 All I see is a greedy NVIDIA telling people that they have a captured market here of people they know will buy their product at no matter the price they set Top of the line used to be attainable,m73p2do,1.0,1i178tz
comment,m73tgem,FLHCv2,,58,2025-01-14 14:59:45,,,,Sorry correct me if Im wrong but isnt the 90 series supposed to be the titan series but now marketed towards gamers If so then GTX 1080 TI was not top of the line at the time it was the Titan XP released in April 2017 for 1199 which is 1546 when accounting for inflation 700 for the 1080TI is now 905 when accounting for inflation meaning if you believed the 1080TI was attainable at the time then so would be the direct comparison of the 5080 at todays 1000 price point The numbers are a bit more aligned when you compare it like that and obviously the top of the line card has runaway from the competition so the price has been inflated a bit but NVIDIAs marketing definitely worked if were considering the 5090 to be the top of the line card for the everyday person now if we never considered the Titan to be the top of the line before They successfully made us subconsciously think we needed the 90 when we never thought that about the Titan Not defending NVIDIA here at all btw,m73pwxj,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m73u3hv,BGFalcon85,,20,2025-01-14 15:03:15,,,,That is also my understanding The price has gone up for sure but comparing it to 1080ti is not a onetoone comparison,m73tgem,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m73smb0,Spartan-104,,3,2025-01-14 14:55:12,,,,True but I remember thinking 700800ish in the UK at the time was far far too much for the 1080 TI and got a 1080 for about half that I agree its less obtainable than it was previously but those who had a price cap were never the ones who continually upgraded to the best each gen anyway,m73pwxj,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m74c6er,Paul_Langton,,0,2025-01-14 16:35:51,,,,As pointed out elsewhere the Titan cards werent designed for the same set of customers and werent really meant for improved gaming performance Even if we want to say that the 5090 is just a higher tier version the performance of the different cards hasnt been consistent based on their naming convention The 90 cards are de facto the 80s Its arbitrary whether they bumped up the top or added more steps between levels,m741ufg,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m74d0h7,StarsMine,,3,2025-01-14 16:39:57,,,,The 1080ti was not the flagship and never was the titan Xpascal and Titan Xp were the flagships of that generation Look at how much those cost Nvidia is not raising the price of the flagship The titan V titan RTX and 3090ti all cost more to the consumer then the 5090 does,m73pwxj,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m74eet5,Paul_Langton,,0,2025-01-14 16:46:50,,,,Silly me youre right all the complaints weve had over the last several generations of cards have been erroneous Theres no stable footing for anything claiming that NVIDIA has been increasing their top line pricing as much as they can s While I appreciate the fact that the other cards in the lineup are affordable when compared to the last generation I dont think its ridiculous for people to call bullshit on the 5090 pricing Lets all realize that we can be Nvidia fanboys and still not be happy with 100 of everything they do,m74d0h7,3.0,1i178tz
comment,m74fwo5,StarsMine,,4,2025-01-14 16:54:05,,,,Outside of the 4090 the 5090 is cheaper then the last few generation flagship Titan V was 3000 usd Titan RTX was 2500 USD 3090 ti was 2000 usd The 5090 lives in a post inflation world at 2000 usd Im not a nvidia fanboy I just know how the sausage is made The 5090 is also the most expensive to manufacture flagship nvidia has ever made Tscm N5 is close to 20k a wafer now as they keep increasing the price The 3090ti had a smaller die and a wafer that was 5k Samsung 8nm,m74eet5,4.0,1i178tz

comment,m74do9u,Paul_Langton,,0,2025-01-14 16:43:12,,,,Care to provide insights as to what about printing a bigger chip for a 5090 leads to a thousand dollar increase compared to a 5080 Im absolytely sure it costs more to product I sincerely doubt that the price tag was determined by them going oh lets just make this the same profit margin as the other cards in this lineup rather than these cash cows will spend whatever we tell them to if they want bragging rights Especially considering at the announcement thats exactly what theyre justifying,m74cr8u,5.0,1i178tz
comment,m74ktm0,ChaseballBat,,3,2025-01-14 17:18:07,,,,Your mistake is comparing a 1080ti to a 5090 it is closer to a 5070 in specs 700 in 2017 is 900 in 2024 The 5070 is being sold for 550 This tracks with manufacturing process for almost all electronics The 5070 is probably made on existing equipment that made the high end cards of yester year Similarly the 5080 would be made on refined equipment that made 4090 and the 5090 would be brand new factory equipment to handle the new specs,m74do9u,6.0,1i178tz
comment,m74amhv,Rektw,,2,2025-01-14 16:28:05,,,,The prices suck but youre comparing 2 different classes of cards Top of the line then was the Titan XP If you adjust for inflation the 1080ti is pretty close to what the 5080 is going to cost,m73pwxj,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m746fit,Nosnibor1020,,1,2025-01-14 16:07:05,,,,I wanted to buy a 5090 It was going to be the first time I even could potentially afford the best but Im semiconfused by all the AI generated stuff Is the brute force not there anymore Is it all AI improvements and nothing physically Ive seen that its only getting like 6 frames more without DLSS compared to a 4090 Also havent seen very much about creation and rendering Not sure what Im going to try to do now,m73p2do,1.0,1i178tz
comment,m74i9aw,jovis_astrum,,2,2025-01-14 17:05:33,,,,Its the biggest leap in cores in the stack for rasterization and raytracing compared with its predecessor You wont really know the performance until its reviewed For non ai stuff Nvidia has only released numbers for Cyberpunk raytracing without dlss which no one is likely going to play because the fps are so bad Basically the card still sucks at raytracing in that game without dlss imo Raytracing performance on all video cards has been meh for years Comparatively if the game goes from 21 to 28 fps you are technically getting a huge percentage increase in performance 30 so from that perspective it is decent but no one is likely going to care because its fps is so low Nvidia is just focusing on ai stuff because the traditional performance improvements are going to be much smaller in comparison,m746fit,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m7511d5,jsting,,1,2025-01-14 18:36:02,,,,Nvidia even knows it A 5070 is equivalent to a 4090 and a 4090 is already more than youll ever need for the next 8 years I can play most all modern games with my 3070 at ultra with ray tracing off Home use people get the 5090 for status not need,m73p2do,1.0,1i178tz

comment,m76nkho,youpeoplesucc,,1,2025-01-14 23:36:08,,,,Thats not entirely true tbh People definitely can save around that much for a bit less performance depending on which version of the flagship gpu they get For example scalpers will probably have the true best version for sale for some absurd price but not everyone buys those when they can wait a little for a slightly worse one at a reasonable price,m73p2do,1.0,1i178tz
comment,m76o2tq,No-Marionberry-772,,1,2025-01-14 23:38:55,,,,I think youre missing the point I was making There is out there a segment of people who arent thinking about cost when it comes to hardware The only thing they are looking at is what the most power available is not bang for buck,m76nkho,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m771hfg,youpeoplesucc,,1,2025-01-15 00:53:20,,,,I get your point All Im trying to say is that not everyone buying 4090s and 5090s are within that segment Lots of them would rather buy a 4090 FE or another lower end one for 1600 over a watercooled 2000 one for example despite slightly lower performance When they were in high demand not everyone was shelling out several thousand more to the scalpers just because thats what the most power available was either In fact Id wager those are probably the minority of 4090 owners,m76o2tq,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m74pn3n,Tahj42,,1,2025-01-14 17:41:28,,,,If people refused to pay these prices they would just drop the prices No thats not true It takes a while for companies to admit defeat on their price gouging strategies even after they stop working The best example I can give you is AAA games They all decided to raise their prices to follow inflation and now Ubisoft is going bankrupt and a bunch of other companies are seeing failures but the prices arent coming down yet Instead they think they can refocus on quality or some bullshit When the reason theyre failing is because indies beat them on quality sometimes but above all they beat them on pricing by a landslide And yet theyre not willing to give up on that Thats not limited to games Price gouging is going on in a bunch of markets and in some cases its definitely impacting sales But companies have capital to burn so they keep trying until they have to give up And maybe a little bit of hubris or pride in there too Having to admit you were wrong as a capitalist must be tough when youre used to bending everything to your will,m74nbx1,3.0,1i178tz

comment,m76olmf,alman12345,,2,2025-01-14 23:41:47,,,,Intels performance per dollar actually greatly exceeds AMDs top offerings now the 13600k can be had for around 200 and trounces both the 7800x3d and 9800x3d in performance per dollar because neither of them gets close to 2 or 25 times the performance overall performance despite costing double or more Also AMDs inefficient GPUs are also in a very similar boat to Intels CPUs often drawing 50 more power for identical or marginally higher performance compared to Nvidias offerings I also went with an AMD GPU for the first part of this generation but the best thing I ever did was sell that garbage and switch to the 4080 instead I had so many annoyances and issues with the 7900 XTX that made it suck despite the 200 savings and the 4080 has just been bliss comparatively,m741r6k,2.0,1i178tz
comment,m775d8m,RoastCabose,,2,2025-01-15 01:15:44,,,,I mean its not just inflation but it is mostly physics and engineering These chips are more complex than ever harder to make than ever and cant be shrunk and optimized for double performance year over year The fact of the matter is that a 2080 can still play basically every triple AAA game at 1080p at reasonable framerates and that card is 6 years old A 3080 can play all AAA games at 1440p at reasonable framerates and its 3 years old And theyre both overkill for anything older than 2020 Cards did not used to be relevant this long 20 years ago You used to buy a card be able to play the latest and greatest for 3 years play the next 3 years with much lowered settings and then basically send it out to the pasture Now getting a 6 year old card and expecting it play everything is the norm Hell even a 1080 a card that came out nearly a decade ago is still respectable in most cases As far as Im concerned the top end is now luxury instead of simply cutting edge Its like complaining that you cant get a super car when in 90 of cases youre not going to even going to use half its performance I cant afford a 5090 and I dont care My 3080ti can play everything released today at 1440p my current monitor resolution at minimum 60fps if not more at at least high settings if not max And Ill likely be able to expect that for the next few years If I want more then maybe Ill swing for a 5080 which is the same price I paid for my 3080ti And then I wont have to worry about being able to play stuff at 1440p ever again 4K becomes a reasonable option for 90 of games native for the remaining 10 I have to use some upscaling which was expected anyway because theyre doing essentially ground truth light simulation for rendering anyway something that would have been thought impossible 10 years ago I just think people arent being looking at the reality of gaming which is easier to get into than ever It used to affordable to go for the top end but that top end was ephemeral at best Now its not but its gonna last you much longer Most people arent even interested in it,m741r6k,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m75kw3d,dsmiles,,1,2025-01-14 20:11:54,,,,I was referring to the 690 and chose it because it was literally two 680s stuck together and was exactly double the price of a 680 Similar to the gap between the 5080 and the 5090 My original comment has a typo that I see now its supposed to say from a little over a decade ago And Ill agree that the world is a very different place for consumers these days The wealth gap keeps rising companies keep raising prices and consumers have less buying power year after year I agree that this is the way things are going and have a basic understanding of the economics in play but that in no way means that consumers should just be silent and accept it,m75iehi,4.0,1i178tz
comment,m76kz6o,Spanky2k,,1,2025-01-14 23:21:44,,,,Thats what the 590 was two 580s stuck together I had one and it was pretty cool in games that supported SLI The thing is the writing has been on the wall for longer than people realise for top end consumer Nvidia products It started with the first Titan a 999 card released over a decade ago that cost the same as the 690 you mention and was released afterwards but was essentially just a full 680 They then experimented with different Titan models and price points ranging up to 2999 about 4k in today money for the Titan Z and later Titan V and the previously mentioned final Titan the RTX These are what the x090 models are now The regular consumer top end cards are the x080 models Nvidia seems to have found its groove with their model line that works for them now Theyve moved the Titan naming scheme to the mainstream consumer realm and priced it slightly lower than a true Titan would be so that they can disable some of the features that used to be enabled in Titan models are now only available in business cards Graphics cards now cost significantly more than they did a decade and a half ago across the board Theyre much more complicated now and unlike their CPU counterparts they still see significant performance growth with each generation Like some people say Moores Law is dead for CPUs but is alive and well for GPUs The most important component in a computer in terms of gaming performance is now the GPU Everything else is just an accessory for the GPU now and theyre priced accordingly However its not all doom and gloom If you look at the equivalent to the normal top end card from the generation youve referenced the 680 it was released for 499 which is about 950 in todays money The 5080 todays equivalent model is 999 Thats pretty decent pricing,m75kw3d,5.0,1i178tz

comment,m73wrnl,hyperforms9988,,5,2025-01-14 15:17:32,,,,I think the thing thats important is whether or not the price is actually justified If the position is well this is the best of the best and the components and things in the card actually justifies the price tag then what are we arguing here Dont make it just because that price is absurd and people dont want to see the price tag Well if youve got somebody that can afford it and wants to spend that much on the best then why cant they have that if someone will make it If the price is not justified for whats actually in the card then we have an argument Its like arguing well why are you selling a Lamborghini for a half a million dollars Because look at whats in that car and its performance Of course it costs that much Do we refuse to make them because the price tag is ugly to the average consumer Its not for the average consumer Is the argument that we shouldnt make or sell them just because you cant afford to buy them Why shouldnt we I want to hear why the price tag is what it is and whether or not the components and the RD for what Nvidia spends on its technology actually justifies it Thats the more valid argument to be had Why should the top of the line card gimp whats in it to be less than what it could be When they release so many SKUs for these fucking things something should be sitting at the very top and have ALL the things in it The only case to be made for why you cant or shouldnt do that is if you wont be able to sell enough of them to justify making them or if theres an actual safety issue or something with them like them catching fire or whatever,,0.0,1i178tz

comment,m741ykl,Enough-Poet4690,,1,2025-01-14 15:44:32,,,,I never understood why the GeForce RTXxx90 series was ever considered a consumer gaming card It seems more of a successor to the cancelled Titan series cards which were targeted towards professional workloads The GeForce RTXxx80 cards should be the topend gaming cards The gaming performance boost of a 90 series card over an 80 series card is negligible For gaming it literally does not make sense to go with a xx90 series card over a xx80 series card nearly 2x the cost for like 1520 better performance Did some more digging into the RTX 5000 series and I was badly out of date with my info RTX 3000 series only had a tiny difference between the 3080 and 3090 RTX 5000 has a 2x increase of CUDA cores RAM and VRAM bus width between the 5080 and 5090 The only time that the xx90 series cards make sense is for VRAM intensive GPU workloads 3D modeling AIML workloads etc Which is 100 inline with the target market for the old Titan series cards,,0.0,1i178tz

comment,m74lf8k,Enough-Poet4690,,2,2025-01-14 17:21:02,,,,That 20 figure applies to the RTX3080 vs RTX3090 And yes that meant that you got up to 20 more FPS out of the 3090 than the 3080 The situation with the 5080 and 5090 is very different 2x the VRAM bus width alone is huge for GPU compute workloads Im not sure how much of a gaming difference there will be between the 5080 and 5090 but its going to be significant However the difference in performance when it comes to nongaming workloads 3D modeling AIML etc is going to be huge Even though there will be a tangible advantage in gaming going with the 5090 I stand by my statement that these xx90 series cards are more professional workstation GPUs than gaming GPUs,m7446cw,2.0,1i178tz

comment,m75opcp,BritishAnimator,,1,2025-01-14 20:30:25,,,,If your work involves GPU rendering then 2k is not that much of a hit for the Cudacompute you get If AI is your business then the 5090s 32GB vram is a great option You can fit AI models onto the GPU that were possibly only available on their Ai Cards I assume this is the target audience However the 5080 with 16GB is a bit of a mixed bag Is it a 4K gaming card Would people get that over a 4090 24GB Vram for Ai use Not sure Will they hold off for a 5080 Ti or S version and hope for a VRam bump Scalpers will be scratching their heads at this line up thats for sure IMO the 4090 will become more popular and probably retain a high price as it hits a VRam and power sweet spot for a last gen card,,0.0,1i178tz

comment,m74bkmu,Zen_Shot,,3,2025-01-14 16:32:50,,,,Thats not what he meant He meant that they could have made the 5090 less powerful in order to reduce the price by 100 or so but they didnt because they know players want the best and will pay for the best so why not make the best,m740pok,1.0,1i178tz
comment,m741hor,czyzczyz,,-1,2025-01-14 15:42:08,,,,I think the general rule is if youre very very very tempted to spend 2k on a graphics card you can barely afford and are even considering spending more than MSRP thats a sign that demand is sillyhigh In that case you will have fewer regrets down the road if you put that exact same amount of money into Nvidia stock rather than buying the card Yeah that game you already played through wont look exactly as good or play at 240fps but youll own a tiny bit of the company whose chips will replace your job,,0.0,1i178tz

comment,m7bvcly,SiIverwolf,,1,2025-01-15 20:11:15,,,,lol the 2 competitors have less than a 20 market share across retail servers and discrete GPUs An 80 market share is absolutely a monopoly that gives Nvidia the idea they can charge whatever they want Especially when their real markets are AI data centres and crypto bros not gamers,m7bc0go,1.0,1i178tz
comment,m7d2edr,plasix,,1,2025-01-15 23:42:53,,,,Their 80 market share is because their product is the best product And this particular card is the best card,m7bvcly,2.0,1i178tz
