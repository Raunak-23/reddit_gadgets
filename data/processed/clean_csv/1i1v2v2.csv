comment,m7b8hyx,cp5184,,12,2025-01-15 18:22:21,,,,The important thing is that no drones were irresponsibly flying over wildfires and hit a canadian air tanker causing damage to a critical firefighting asset and setting back the efforts to fight the california fires Wait no The important thing is that drones are safe to operate because operators cant break the law and fly them in prohibited areas Wait no the important thing is that my thing is better than your thing,m7av0sb,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7bff58,TheDeadlySpaceman,,17,2025-01-15 18:55:09,,,,The FlySafe feature already didnt prevent people from violating FAA regs TFRs Temporary Flight Restrictions the thing the FAA issues for disasterspresidential traveletc were never part of them They didnt actually line up with the FAAs zoning they were just a best guess from a guy in China about maybe where it would be bad to fly You could always unlock it by going through a gate saying you were responsible for what you did As you can tell by the fact that it was a DJI Mini that collided with the plane it didnt prevent stupidity In my opinion as a rulefollowing drone pilot whos been doing this professionally for years the FlySafe feature gave casual drone pilots a false sense that they were flying legally when in fact they were not and getting rid of it is neutral to positive in terms of making things better But you are of course entitled to draw whatever conclusion you like,m7b8hyx,3.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m7b94v1,one_is_enough,,-2,2025-01-15 18:25:22,,,,They are just removing a feature that benefits the US government and not DJI The only reason that feature was there was to gather info about sensitive US locations If they are going to be banned anyway why do the extra work of geofencing for the US government,m79gfwq,1.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m796caj,chrisdh79,,476,2025-01-15 11:08:25,,,,From the article For over a decade you couldnt easily fly a DJI drone over restricted areas in the United States DJIs software would automatically stop you from flying over runways power plants public emergencies like wildfires and the White House But confusingly amidst the greatest US outpouring of drone distrust in years and an incident of a DJI drone operator hindering LA wildfire fighting efforts DJI is getting rid of its strong geofence DJI will no longer enforce NoFly Zones instead only offering a dismissible warning meaning only common sense empathy and the fear of getting caught by authorities will prevent people from flying where they shouldnt In a blog post DJI characterizes this as placing control back in the hands of the drone operators DJI suggests that technologies like Remote ID which publicly broadcasts the location of a drone and their operator during flight are providing authorities with the tools needed to enforce existing rules DJI global policy head Adam Welsh tells The Verge But it turns out the DJI drone that damaged a Super Scooper airplane fighting the Los Angeles wildfires was a sub250gram model that may not require Remote ID to operate and the FBI expects it will have to work backwards through investigative means to figure out who flew it there Edit Some are skeptical because its from The Verge DJIs statement if interested For many years DJI has led the drone industry in safety making several unprecedented commitments to integrating advanced safety systems into its drones including First to install altitude limits GPSbased geofencing to guide drone pilots away from unsafe locations First to deploy autonomous returntohome technology if drones lose connection to their controllers or have critically low batteries First to integrate sensors for nearby obstacles and approaching aircraft First to operate Remote Identification technology to help authorities identify and monitor airborne drones Since then global regulations and user awareness have evolved significantly with a greater focus on geoawareness and Remote ID solutions which makes detection and enforcement much easier National aviation authorities including the European Aviation Safety Authority EASA in the EU the UK Civil Aviation Authority CAA and the FAA in the US have established comprehensive geographical zones for unmanned aircraft systems UAS and enforce drone regulations This GEO update has been active in the UK and several EU countries since January 2024 starting with European countries that have implemented geographical maps compliant with existing technical standards such as Belgium Germany and France In June it expanded to Estonia Finland and Luxembourg The remaining EU countries under EASA jurisdiction will also receive the update this month DJI reminds pilots to always ensure flights are conducted safely and in accordance with all local laws and regulations For flights conducted in Enhanced Warning Zones drone operators must obtain airspace authorization directly from the FAA and consult the FAAs No Drone Zone resource for further information,,0.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m79tvr4,Extrarium,,353,2025-01-15 14:04:58,,,,In a blog post DJI characterizes this as placing control back in the hands of the drone operators We dont feel like doing all the work of maintainingupdating this feature so were just gonna save ourselves the effortmoney and call it a PR move,m796caj,1.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m79wlc2,Fordmister,,229,2025-01-15 14:21:06,,,,That or is it possible they are afraid of legal action coming back on them with whats just happened in the wildfires Like you can easily see the defense of the drone op in court being the DJI software is meant to stop me from flying places where I shouldnt so when the drone let me go there i assumed it was ok which if it holds up will result in the state coming after the company instead that or the fear of receiving substantial lawsuits from people facing custodial sentences for flying drone where they shouldnt if the software doesnt stop them By removing the ringfence and putting control back in the hands of the operator the actual motive might be to put responsibility and liability back in the hands of the operator as well,m79tvr4,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m79xw21,atbths,,118,2025-01-15 14:28:39,,,,Its definitely a liability thing Theyve already done the heavy lifting for the geofence feature but realized they dont want the responsibility of it,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7a0a2m,MrChip53,,8,2025-01-15 14:42:20,,,,So the company doesnt want liability for the feature What if the geofence data had to be supplied and updated by each regions governmental bodies only If its not updated its because someone in government messed up In the US the NWS FBI etc could have access to set restricted fly zones on demand If one pops up on your drone it goes home or something Other option is its privately sourced expensive data Idk,m79xw21,4.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m7b3eb0,lostinthought15,,3,2025-01-15 17:57:53,,,,What if the geofence data had to be supplied and updated by each regions governmental bodies only If its not updated its because someone in government messed up You must be new,m7a0a2m,5.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7afy2c,locketine,,8,2025-01-15 16:04:03,,,,What if there was a glitch in the update Internet connection goes down which is likely in a wildfire situation The fire breaks containment and the zone is out of date The liability would be on DJI I think theyre still open to liability with only warning people now,m7a0a2m,5.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7b45ed,MrChip53,,3,2025-01-15 18:01:29,,,,I guess thats true Firmware issues theyd still be liable Definitely easier to drop the feature and shift blame to non compliant users then,m7afy2c,6.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7aox40,cosmos7,,1,2025-01-15 16:48:20,,,,Doesnt sound like DJI is removing geofencing entirely just changing to a warning instead of hard nofly limitation That way its on the operator if they ignore it,m7a0a2m,5.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7b9wf8,FerretChrist,,4,2025-01-15 18:29:00,,,,So not so much geofencing as geopolitelysuggesting,m7aox40,6.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m79yi0o,Extrarium,,8,2025-01-15 14:32:09,,,,Maybe both could be that updating the nofly zone dynamically for a temporary time and then having to pull it later in the future is something their system isnt set up for but obv I dont know for sure Winwin of saving themselves liability headaches axing a feature that takes work to maintain and acts as a PR move,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7b3n36,lostinthought15,,3,2025-01-15 17:59:03,,,,Still sounds like a lot of workman hours for DJI for something they dont have to do and wont make them any money,m79yi0o,4.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7bohkk,jjayzx,,2,2025-01-15 19:38:27,,,,But that requires the person to constantly update their devices to have the latest restrictions Thats why you are supposed to check B4UFly for current restrictions before flying There are rules you need to learn to pass the drone test and get registered and so on These people are just selfentitled ignorant assholes,m79yi0o,4.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7ahygh,Dan_Felder,,3,2025-01-15 16:14:14,,,,I dont get it They should be able to attempt to both provide a warning AND attempt to stop the person Any law that makes even attempting this add a safety feature increase liability in the company is a really stupid law Maybe the law is that stupid but I have a hunch this is just lawyers or execs panic changing something,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7aoihw,cosmos7,,3,2025-01-15 16:46:23,,,,That or is it possible they are afraid of legal action coming back on them Bingo If youre enforcing geofencing then youre responsible for keeping those lists current and accurate and can potentially be liable ifwhen something gets missed If youre just providing advisories and leaving it up to the operator then its on them if they dont pay attention to NOTAMs,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7a29fx,diuturnal,,2,2025-01-15 14:53:25,,,,I mean sure but you cant retroactively get rid of something and expect none of the consequences to catch up to you And DJI doesnt have the money to make it all go away,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7bnpsu,jjayzx,,1,2025-01-15 19:34:44,,,,Geofencing works for static zones Youre supposed to check B4UFly for any restrictions before flying So its their own ignorant ass for flying where they shouldnt be,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7c9afl,throwaway1937911,,1,2025-01-15 21:16:06,,,,Congress also wants to ban DJI drones So it makes sense to stop supporting it if theyre going to be banned anyway,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7ciof3,iknighty,,1,2025-01-15 22:00:08,,,,Ignorance of the law is not a defense But a civil suit against DJI could be an option for the pilot,m79wlc2,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7a9r00,pimpeachment,,19,2025-01-15 15:32:58,,,,Dji has been getting shit on by thr government for years they are banned on app stores because of all the intense location tracking Sounds like they are just fucking done helping when all they get is criticism,m79tvr4,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7a6lc1,rhodytony,,7,2025-01-15 15:16:42,,,,I am sure its more of a liability issue They have the software capabilities but restrictions change and they dont have to keep up with them I am sure DJI is catching flack for not being perfect when in fact it should be the operator that makes the ultimate go no go decision,m79tvr4,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7flahy,killingtime1,,1,2025-01-16 11:10:48,,,,I dont think they care about liability when they are literally getting banned from the US Feels like theyve given up who can blame them,m7a6lc1,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7ap678,xXdiaboxXx,,4,2025-01-15 16:49:33,,,,They originally did it to stop from getting banned back then and to stay in good graces with the US government Since theres talk about banning them again DJI decided they wouldnt exert any more effort in placating They never started this as an altruistic safety measure,m79tvr4,2.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m79hn0q,AshTeriyaki,,81,2025-01-15 12:44:52,,,,If I recall in the UK theres a two tier system Soft you shouldnt fly here but you can with permission which is dismissible And hard no fly zones airports prisons etc FWIW a lot of places are really overzealous with the no fly zones so it can actually be quite difficult to find places to take a DJI drone sometimes,m796caj,1.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m79ehg3,ilfusionjeff,,25,2025-01-15 12:20:39,,,,For me who flys my drone property this is actually awesome Some places I fly and have permission to fly have unnecessary geofences and its kept me from shooting a few times Again all in places where its OK and I have permission Ive lost three or four shoots that were only going up 50ft because of unnecessary geofences,m796caj,1.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7bpkjx,jjayzx,,1,2025-01-15 19:43:38,,,,Whos giving permission It doesnt matter if land owner gives permission but area is in a restricted zone You complain about useless geofence but its there for a reason and I bet its cause its within the restriction of an airport most likely You need to check B4UFly before you fly and it can tell you the restrictions in that area and you can see where to go to fly,m79ehg3,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7cakv5,ilfusionjeff,,2,2025-01-15 21:22:04,,,,Im flying less than 50 feet up in the air near facilities that I have permission to shoot in The point that matters is that I have permission and its low altitude Sometimes the zone is so close that it wont take off Sometimes Im trying to fly indoors and its even locked,m7bpkjx,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7d0ra2,jjayzx,,-1,2025-01-15 23:33:43,,,,Sounds like youre using your drone commercially and should have a commercial license and should know the rules that go along with that You can then ask for permission from the FAA to unlock for the time,m7cakv5,4.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m7crae3,sethsez,,1,2025-01-15 22:43:06,,,,Getting proper LAANC clearance which is the clearance that actually legally matters is almost always faster and simpler than getting DJI to waive something in their geofencing which frequently doesnt line up with actual airspace restrictions If DJIs geofencing actually lined up with airspace and followed the proper laws I could see the argument for it and I still think it has the potential to be a useful safeguard for absolute novices but for anyone getting proper clearance which they should be doing anyway it just serves as an additional frequentlybuggy hurdle to jump and for people relying on it as the sole thing keeping them out of areas they shouldnt be it just isnt reliable enough and can still allow people to wander into dangerous areas,m7bpkjx,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7d1rnx,jjayzx,,1,2025-01-15 23:39:22,,,,Ive never used a DJI device I like building stuff myself for fun So I dont know how the software system works with them Like do you manually have to update such stuff or is it pulling this info from your phone,m7crae3,4.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7dt35m,sethsez,,1,2025-01-16 02:14:00,,,,It uses your GPS to determine where you are and then gives or restricts permissions accordingly There are ways around it but theyre usually an even bigger pain in the ass Its worth remembering that these things tend to go much higher and much further for much longer than a typical FPV drone and they use GPS among other systems to remain steady and do all their automated tricks so its significantly more fundamental to the system than it might seem coming from the FPV side of things,m7d1rnx,5.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m79xqsj,sarhoshamiral,,78,2025-01-15 14:27:48,,,,This article heading is misleading DJIs flysafe maps were very inaccurate before so there were many times drones couldnt be flown due to DJIs map while the area was good to fly Also they never included temporary bans like wildfires Now DJI is updating their maps to sync with actual FAA zones So they will be accurate All these zones will be marked as warning zones telling you that you need a waiver to fly there This is a good thing because more users will be aware of actual zones and DJI had no business in ensuring someone had a waiver or not This is essentially DJI saying they updated their maps with accurate speed limits but they will not ban you going faster I am sure people would hate the idea of car manufacturers being ones to enforce speed limits,,0.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m7df9qv,ThePretzul,,2,2025-01-16 00:55:04,,,,No it wouldnt It would cause injuries as cars misrecognize the speed limit already common on vehicles that track the current speed limit and slam on the brakes or otherwise create a slow moving traffic hazard A large speed differential between your vehicle and surrounding traffic is far more dangerous than the average speeding,m7aa7uv,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7di7ps,sarhoshamiral,,-1,2025-01-16 01:11:40,,,,Where does this idea of slamming on the break comes from My previous car had speed sign recognition my two current cars have it too and none of them slammed the breaks while adjusting They misread the signs for sure but they slowed down safely and most of the time I could override easily before it slowed down few miles an hour,m7df9qv,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7dmd5p,ThePretzul,,1,2025-01-16 01:35:23,,,,Because what is being proposed doesnt have an override Thats the entire point of it being a hard limit coded into the vehicles that you cant override it Driving 2545 on an interstate highway because the system had a glitch is FAR more dangerous than driving 85,m7di7ps,4.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7du6u6,sarhoshamiral,,1,2025-01-16 02:20:32,,,,I disagree on whats being proposed because it wouldnt let you override but still the system wouldnt slam the brake It would slow down to 45 safely but yes if you cant override it becomes more dangerous for reasons of going against the average speed not because it slammed the brakes,m7dmd5p,5.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7aaplq,sarhoshamiral,,3,2025-01-15 15:37:51,,,,It would save some lives maybe but speed limits are not properly set where I am Our interstate limit is 60 and state routes that have turns lights one lane each way without a divider has 55 limit which in practice is the same speed limit Road design is a lot more important imo,m7aa7uv,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7b3kn9,loljetfuel,,3,2025-01-15 17:58:43,,,,and probably should be that way It really shouldnt One of the problems with broad enforcement via a technical control is that such things tend to behave very poorly in situations they dont anticipate Even with a perfect implementation there are cases where exceeding a limit can be the safest or most sensible option I know that Ive had to do things like rush someone to a hospital from a rural area where no EMS was available in a reasonable time But the implementation is likely to be extremely fraught with problems My car is set to warn me if I exceed the speed limit by more than 2mph and that warning is sometimes triggered when Im on the freeway but the cars GPS thinks Im on a frontage road If the car actually slowed down in those cases it would be extremely unsafe and actually below the minimum speed for the highway,m7aa7uv,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7apior,nybble41,,1,2025-01-15 16:51:13,,,,Having seen what passes for speed limits reported by Google Maps in my area Im not so sure Besides a number of roads which were recorded as 55 MPH but are actually 50 MPH or less their mapping system seems to have issues with confusing road namesnumbers with speed limits Having the car automatically brake from 55 MPH to 25 MPH just because you passed a IN25 sign would tend to cause wrecks not stop them Particularly if the roads are icy,m7aa7uv,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7bphj9,parisidiot,,-2,2025-01-15 19:43:13,,,,why would this rely on google maps or even gps you could literally have speed limit signs readable by the car you could have RFID you could have low power radio transmission there are a lot of technical solutions your objection is primarily ideological entitlement you dont want to give up control of your car even if it would mean saving tens of thousands of lives,m7apior,3.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7c0ka5,nybble41,,2,2025-01-15 20:35:49,,,,Ignoring the hyperbolic ad hominim toward the end I cited Google Maps because its an existing wellfunded effort to obtain the data needed to implement your suggestion and realworld results show that its far from perfect Yeah there are lots of technological options to improve the accuracy if time and money are no object Come back when you have a viable plan to actually get one of those systems implemented reliably everywhere the data would be needed Personal ground vehicles could well be obsolete by the time you succeed,m7bphj9,4.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7dhxve,sarhoshamiral,,1,2025-01-16 01:10:07,,,,My car had sign recognition and frequently it gets things wrong There is a lot of details to be resolved before this can be done safely and in a forced way But many driver assistance systems do this already if you want to use full set of assistance features and part of it is adjusting cruise speed based on sign recognition and usually either there is no option or a slight 5mph offset,m7bphj9,4.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m79bine,chrisdh79,,9,2025-01-15 11:56:17,,,,DJIs statement if interested For many years DJI has led the drone industry in safety making several unprecedented commitments to integrating advanced safety systems into its drones including First to install altitude limits GPSbased geofencing to guide drone pilots away from unsafe locations First to deploy autonomous returntohome technology if drones lose connection to their controllers or have critically low batteries First to integrate sensors for nearby obstacles and approaching aircraft First to operate Remote Identification technology to help authorities identify and monitor airborne drones Since then global regulations and user awareness have evolved significantly with a greater focus on geoawareness and Remote ID solutions which makes detection and enforcement much easier National aviation authorities including the European Aviation Safety Authority EASA in the EU the UK Civil Aviation Authority CAA and the FAA in the US have established comprehensive geographical zones for unmanned aircraft systems UAS and enforce drone regulations This GEO update has been active in the UK and several EU countries since January 2024 starting with European countries that have implemented geographical maps compliant with existing technical standards such as Belgium Germany and France In June it expanded to Estonia Finland and Luxembourg The remaining EU countries under EASA jurisdiction will also receive the update this month DJI reminds pilots to always ensure flights are conducted safely and in accordance with all local laws and regulations For flights conducted in Enhanced Warning Zones drone operators must obtain airspace authorization directly from the FAA and consult the FAAs No Drone Zone resource for further information,m797uqa,1.0,1i1v2v2

comment,m7d9t5j,LivingDracula,,1,2025-01-16 00:24:30,,,,I can read But apparently you cant read between the lines Hundreds of unexplained drones start flying in sensitive areas across the country the chinese hacked thousands of US phones by compromising the mass surveillance programs A chinese fpv drone pilot is arrested The US bans tik tok applies tarrifs and sanctions An American drone crashes into a plane while observing the fire in LA Suddenly the single largest chinese drone company removes geofencing specifically within the US and specifically includes removing geofencing near the white house days before January 20th Im not a conspiracy theorist saying anything will happen Im just saying all this has happened in the last 6 months and its one hell of weird coincidence for all this and a lot more to happen and suddenly remove safeguards,m7d7uov,2.0,1i1v2v2
comment,m7dbgwt,anonymous9828,,2,2025-01-16 00:33:46,,,,compromising the mass surveillance programs perhaps the US should be reflecting more on why it allows its own government to create such risky vulnerabilities in the first place that anyone in the world can exploit this isnt even the first time the NSAs EternalBlue hacking tools got hacked and then reused to create ransomware against all Windows users around the world and suddenly remove safeguards well thats the law of unintended consequences when you ban DJI despite them voluntarily implementing more security features than American drone companies do you remove any incentive for them to waste any more timeeffort on it,m7d9t5j,3.0,1i1v2v2
