comment,mnfsozx,ene_due_rabe,,1,2025-04-16 17:02:12,,,,Well GeForce had that advantage of hardware TL acceleration and inclusion of it definitely changed graphic card market but I do still remember first widely available iteration of Voodoo chips as a bigger step ahead It literally felt like magic games that ran at 320x240 to achieve acceptable framerates on the very same hardware ran 640x480 and 60fps And with filtered textures Sure now it sounds funny but back then in 1997 it was a revolution It gave my Pentium 100133MHz a new life It didnt last long of course as things moved fast in that era but it was a game changer and there was no going back to 3d pixelation On a side note I miss those times when we had more competition in gfx chip segment There was Nvidia ATI S3 3dfx but also Rendition Matrox and Intel which is making a bit of a comeback lately with their GPUs,mn98yde,1.0,1jztz6j

comment,mncgpcd,Fredasa,,2,2025-04-16 02:44:00,,,,I remember randomly owning the best possible soundcard for _Everquest_ The Soundblaster Awe32 Had its own extremely welldesigned digital soundbank ROM for playing back MIDI and proper reverb support Even the Awe64 that came much later was literally unable to reproduce what the Awe32 could do,mn9fkh4,1.0,1jztz6j
comment,mnfi8bz,rechlin,,2,2025-04-16 16:10:54,,,,Yes I remember ADDING something like 4 MB of SIMMs to mine for storage of custom samples for MIDI,mncgpcd,2.0,1jztz6j
comment,mngruzr,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-16 19:55:33,,,,I was just investigating what it was about the Awe64 that didnt live up to its predecessor and finally got it They abandoned the hardwarebased support for MIDI and decided to do it all through software instead and this effectively gutted the entire system and made it so music in a game like _Everquest_ simply no longer correctly worked There may be good workarounds for that today but there was nothing that could be done in the early 00s I assume the reason I upgraded was my old card dying On the topic of adding RAM to the Awe32 there was a time about ten years ago when I briefly got back into _Everquest_ on an emulated server and I did the whole nine yards getting that Awe32 sound back Thats when I started rummaging around for MIDI soundbanks The sky was obviously the limit so I went nuts finding multihundred MB banks My startling conclusion was that you could get a richer sound from bigger soundbanks but you couldnt get a _better_ sound from them That 1MB ROM built into the Awe32 was just _so good_,mnfi8bz,3.0,1jztz6j

comment,mnd5d36,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-16 05:51:17,,,,I like the simple tones of _Desert of Ro_ Of course I have an emotional attachment to that tune partly because it was a big part of my leveling adventure and partly because they ignorantly revamped the zone and discarded that tune while they were at it In fact the entire MIDIbased musical landscape of classic EQ suffered a number of issues over the years which 99 of players never seemed to notice and which the devs were certainly indifferent to _Desert of Ro_ gone for good There used to be three different battle BGMs that the game would pick from randomly My theory is that they were intended to be chosen from depending on if it was an easy normal or dangerous fight since thats how they sound individually but that the devs decided it was too repetitive The code for the MIDI playback got somehow screwed up at some point so the randomizer no longer worked There were several different wizard spires BGMs with slight variations and different ones played at different spires Because of the aforementioned screwup not only do all wizard spires now play the same music but in fact the tune loops endlessly when it was actually intended to play just one variation about 15 seconds total before ending There were several individual tunes tucked away as multiple entries in a single given MIDI file The game at launch was able to handle this distinction but after the screwup most of those individual tunes could no longer play at all They got rid of the sneaking music probably sometime before Kunark,mncraog,3.0,1jztz6j
