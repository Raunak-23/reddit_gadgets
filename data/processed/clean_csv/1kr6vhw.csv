comment,mtb1tc8,raziel686,,53,2025-05-20 15:03:54,,,,In the US youd need either a 240 line which most people wont have in places PCs are typically located or youd need two separate 120 lines on different buses which is messy and causes potential problems that wouldnt be up to code Youd essentially be creating a very sloppy 240 line which any electrician would just tell you to do a proper 240 conversion to the PC room,mtb03ok,1.0,1kr6vhw

comment,mtbjkgv,ackermann,,9,2025-05-20 16:30:51,,,,The thing must be space heater when running at full power Actual 1500w space heaters and hair dryers run on a single 120v plug and this is double that The energy has to go somewhere a computer pulling 3000w is basically a 3000w space heater some ridiculously tiny amount of energy is perhaps stored in memory when setting a bit but not much,mtb03ok,1.0,1kr6vhw

comment,mtc6fm1,daCampa,,2,2025-05-20 18:20:05,,,,Yep usually below 80 But the upgrade from a 6700XT to a 6950XT made a noticeable difference as a space heater,mtbyjt7,4.0,1kr6vhw

comment,mtesmqi,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,2,2025-05-21 02:53:10,,,,My computer use to run a 1600 Watt power supply for the 3 Titan Xs I had plus all the other hardware I had to install a window unit in my office because it would increase the room temperature by nearly 20 degrees Also I had to run an extension cord down the hall to my bathroom because the window unit PC would trip the breaker,mtbjkgv,2.0,1kr6vhw
comment,mtcuk0m,tariandeath,,1,2025-05-20 20:19:02,,,,Thats not how PSUs work The energy is used on demand It is just capable of supplying 3000w in the form a PC needs,mtbjkgv,2.0,1kr6vhw
comment,mtcxhwv,ackermann,,2,2025-05-20 20:33:28,,,,Fair I should clarify its not the power supply itself thats a space heater unless its really inefficient Its all the components that it supplies power to If the computer is demanding 3000w total under heavy load that energy is going somewhere and will eventually end up as heat one way or another,mtcuk0m,3.0,1kr6vhw
