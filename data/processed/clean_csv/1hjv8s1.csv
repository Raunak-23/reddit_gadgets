comment,m4jqb1b,audigex,,1,2024-12-30 17:02:21,,,,I have an AI washing machine It claims to intelligently choose the correct cycle for the dryer based on what the washing machine learned 99 of the time it suggests the cycle Id have defaulted to anyway I do like the smart features notification to my phone when it finishes ability to fill it then remotestart once cheap power kicks in on our smart tariff etc and I like the way the washer weighs the load and adjusts the cycle length accordingly and the dryer measures the moisture levels to switch off early if the clothes are dry but none of those are AI features theyre just basic sensors and some preprogrammed logic More importantly they need to make the wifi more reliable if they want this shit to take off It being smart is all well and good but if it cant stay connected to my WiFi properly who gives a shit,m3d68bh,2.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m39tsrw,Less_Party,,112,2024-12-22 12:02:04,,,,Yeah I was like well I do a lot of tedious copypasting stuff for customs paperwork surely it can look at an email containing a clearly labeled shipping address sale price order reference and then paste that into the appropriate fields and it cant even do that yes I know this is the sort of thing you could easily automate without AI but I get these order confirmation emails through 7 different sales platforms and the info is structured differently for each Im also not a programmer or even an excel guy beyond knowing the bare minimum necessary to do my accounting Edit also Gmail itself completely misinterprets half these emails like Ill get an offer on an item and then the big blue box says Order confirmed when the email is actually asking for me to confirm whether I want to accept the offer Aaargh,m39kcuc,2.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3amuyi,pilgermann,,58,2024-12-22 15:47:00,,,,But the promise of AI is that someone who cant script or even really navigate a settings menu could ask the AI to do it for them Were seeing glimpses of this in copilot and ChatGPT can absolutely give you the script but you still need to be computer literate to do anything with it Whats been rolled out as assistants are glorified search engines,m39tsrw,3.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3at4wp,wbruce098,,29,2024-12-22 16:23:58,,,,This basically I use copilot a lot for basic knowledge stuff but I 100 have to know what Im talking about because it does hallucinate sometimes It can save some work sometimes And I use it because the other ones mostly suck Google has become much more difficult to navigate as a result of its shitty AI with half baked often flat out wrong responses And to get good responses you still have to prompt engineer which takes a lot of time and brainpower I could have used just looking it up myself The gold standard should be a reasonably high level of accuracy and a quick but methodical way to guide to the results you want We are a long way from that,m3amuyi,4.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3dcgd4,laxfool10,,8,2024-12-23 01:09:49,,,,Google AI is so bad Have had it give contradicting info like the first sentence says no and then the next follow up sentence says yes Ive heard people at work phds regurgitate Google AI answers and Ive had to correct themshow them how unreliable Google AI is I no longer even look at it,m3at4wp,5.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3cqevn,Ajreil,,6,2024-12-22 22:51:43,,,,Copilot uses ChatGPT under the hood but they have different features built on top of it For example Copilot can control Windows settings had web search before ChatGPT and has more features in the free version Meanwhile ChatGPT lets you make custom models and I think has a better API For 90 of use cases though theyre there same product with a different skin,m3c0n8s,6.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3dl5gi,wbruce098,,2,2024-12-23 02:08:04,,,,Basically this I started using Copilot for research papers in school because it was one of the first LLMs to cite sources and because its built in and is a Microsoft product its also just easier for asking about Office questions excel formulas and project management functions,m3cqevn,7.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3cbrws,GolemancerVekk,,5,2024-12-22 21:27:10,,,,Weekly reminder that weve been working on AI since the 70s What AI means is in a state of flux and depending on how you look at it it has either happened already or will never happen Were constantly moving the goalposts because as soon as it actually does something useful its deemed not impressive enough to be called AI anymore I guess its because on some level were all expecting something like JARVIS and it keeps being stuff like lets slightly improve the contrast on this pic youve taken,m3aukkj,6.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3bio7u,NoXion604,,17,2024-12-22 18:46:21,,,,Whats been rolled out as assistants are glorified search engines Theyre not even that A search engine will pull up results that can actually be found out there on the web even if theyre SEOpoisoned trash Whereas an LLM will just pull something out of its digital rectum hallucinate,m3amuyi,4.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3bsggm,King_Dead,,16,2024-12-22 19:39:10,,,,Its the reason Ive been very cynical on AI If it cant even tell you how it got its answer how could you ever trust that it didnt just make up some bullshit and hand it to you,m3bio7u,5.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3ghdt7,NoXion604,,2,2024-12-23 16:38:48,,,,Of course but that amounts to a bogstandard search engine with an additional layer of expense and obfuscation Im not convinced that LLMs are sufficiently discerning for anyone to rely on their interpretation of search engine results,m3f9jv3,6.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3ed57k,aksdb,,1,2024-12-23 05:41:10,,,,I believe the term assistant was already used before LLMs even though they are basically just voice controlled pattern matchers They never have and still do not help me in any way I would call assist Sure they can create a text message I dictate but then misunderstand the recipient or require me to specify which of the associated phone numbers to use A real assistant could deduct who my wife is and would know which number to use THEN its helpful and not just a verbal representation of a computer selection screen Also that these assistants need specific implementations for different apps makes them very useless Yes I understand the technical issues behind this And yes that is a complicated set of problems But then dont sell those things bigger than they are unless you were able to actually solve these problems,m3amuyi,4.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3cpbvg,Thellton,,7,2024-12-22 22:45:08,,,,Id recommend getting the AI to write the automation for the seven different sales platforms instead of having the AI be the automation after all why detonate a nuke every time you want tea when you know its possible to boil water for your tea with a campfire,m39tsrw,3.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3b6jhm,ryosen,,3,2024-12-22 17:40:29,,,,Those 7 different emails will be consistent in their formatting and placement of the information You can give hints in your prompt of how to find that information based on the sender eg if the email is from Salesforce find the address in the second paragraph following the phrase recipient address Write the prompt as if you are explaining to a middle schooler how to do the tasks You should see improved results,m39tsrw,3.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3anch9,pilgermann,,9,2024-12-22 15:49:53,,,,Agree on time though until AI is aware of your lived context as in could actually see your physical location posture etc or I guess peer into your brain issues like that will persist Humans can understand the context in which someone is speaking which lets us hear a totally broken question in our language and still respond oh I see youre at a restaurant ordering vs asking for directions vs having a conversation at a bar,m3aag11,3.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3d0vwy,MizarcDev,,1,2024-12-22 23:57:15,,,,I find that the general consensus for Apple Intelligences new Siri changes is overwhelmingly negative but for different reasons for different people Some people expect it to be able to do more after the new animation was implemented but realise that it doesnt actually do anything differently compared to old Siri People will generally reply that new Siri isnt actually a thing yet and that all they really changed was the animation Other people like you find it to be a downgrade compared to old Siri in that its less reliable As for my own personal experience since enabling Apple Intelligence it seems to work about as well as old Siri when it comes to its capabilities but I think its able to handle me fumbling sentences better when I tried testing it on and off I dont know if Im just the one person that is getting a good experience out of this but as of now my Siri seems to just handle mistakes better,m3a1om8,1.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3ah9c1,chochazel,,3,2024-12-22 15:12:44,,,,how do explain it scoring above the average human in an abstract reasoning benchmark for questions outside its training set Reasoning questions follow certain patterns They are created by people and they follow given archetypes You can definitely train yourself to better deal with reasoning problems just as you can lateral thinking problems etc You will therefore perform better but arguably someone reasoning their way through a problem cold is doing a better job at reasoning than someone who just recognises the type of problem and familiarity with IQ testing has been shown to influence results and given they are supposed to test peoples ability to deal with a novel problem clearly compromises their validity The AI is just the extreme version of this It recognises the kind of problem and predicts the answer Thats not reasoning Thats not how LLM works Clearly,m3ae9ln,7.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3aje15,GeneralMuffins,,-1,2024-12-22 15:26:01,,,,The prevailing belief was that LLMs should not be able to pass abstract reasoning tests that require generalisation when the answers are not explicitly in their training data Experts often asserted that such abilities were unique to humans and beyond the reach of deep learning models which were described as stochastic parrots The fact that an LLM has scored above the average human on ARCAGI suggests that we either need to move the goal posts and reassess whether we believe this test actually measure abstract reasoning or the assumptions about LLMs inability to generalise or reason was false,m3ah9c1,8.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3b4cvv,chochazel,,1,2024-12-22 17:28:01,,,,You dont believe the ARCAGI tests for abstract reasoning just say that Im saying that it does imperfectly though by training yourself in them you can to some extent undermine their validity and AI is an extreme example of that to the extent that they can pass without any reasoning whatsoever Im also saying that it does not follow that if a person solves a problem using a certain methodology then a computer solving the same problem must be using the same methodology This is blatantly untrue and a misunderstanding of the very basics of computing,m3avzti,13.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3bqz83,GeneralMuffins,,1,2024-12-22 19:31:00,,,,ARCAGI by design aims to assess abstract reasoning not by prescribing a specific methodology but by evaluating whether the system human or AI can arrive at correct solutions to out of distribution problems not within the training set novel problems If the AI passes the test that suggests it has demostrated the capacity the test is meant to measure regardless of how it arrives at the solution You seem to be arguing that because AI trains on patterns and archetypes its success undermines the validity of the test as though familiarity with certain problem types disqualifies the result But isnt that the point If humans can improve at these tests by recognising patterns why should we hold AI to a different standard The test doesnt care how the answer is derived it measures the outcome The notion that the AI achieves this without any reasoning whatsoever feels like circular reasoning in of itself If the test measures reasoning and the AI passes then by definition its demonstrating reasoning at least insofar as the test defines it If the benchmark isnt valid for AI Id argue it isnt valid for humans either,m3b4cvv,14.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3c6i4y,chochazel,,1,2024-12-22 20:57:44,,,,If the AI passes the test that suggests it has demostrated the capacity the test is meant to measure regardless of how it arrives at the solution That logic doesnt follow at all though By that logic a test for psychopathy autism or personality disorders performed by an AI or indeed by a crow randomly selecting multiple choice answers would if answered according to the criteria for a positive diagnosis demonstrate that the crow or the AI was a psychopath or a narcissist because thats the very thing the test was designed to measure I hope you can see this conclusion is absurd because the fundamental premise of the test is that it is going to be answered by humans answering in good faith not a crow randomly pecking at buttons If humans can improve at these tests by recognising patterns why should we hold AI to a different standard Youve missed my point completely Ive repeatedly said that people undermine the validity test by learning the patterns The standard is the same to that extent If the test measures reasoning and the AI passes then by definition its demonstrating reasoning Were back to the randomly pecking crow with autism I hope you can now see the logical fallacy in this claim Your reasoning is circular not mine You are literally begging the question Its like saying that if a seismograph gives a false positive for a 78 scale earthquake because your grandmother dropped it while dusting then your grandmother by definition is demonstrating that she is a magnitude 78 earthquake Thats not how anything works,m3bqz83,15.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m3cftaw,GeneralMuffins,,1,2024-12-22 21:49:34,,,,I think the analogies youre using here misrepresents the nature of ARCAGI and by extension the point Im making By that logic a test for psychopathy autism or personality disorders performed by an AI or indeed by a crow randomly selecting multiple choice answers would if answered according to the criteria for a positive diagnosis demonstrate that the crow or the AI was a psychopath or a narcissist because thats the very thing the test was designed to measure This comparison doesnt track ARCAGI isnt a subjective diagnostic tool like a psychopathy or autism test its an objective benchmark designed to evaluate abstract reasoning through measurable performance on novel outofdistribution tasks A crow randomly pecking at answers wouldnt pass because ARC problems require consistent and transferable problemsolving skills across diverse tasks Random selection would and does fail repeatedly o3 passing ARCAGI isnt a random event it reflects consistent success across a wide variety of abstract tasks Thats not a fluke its demonstrating the exact kind of generalisation and pattern recognition that humans rely on for abstract reasoning I hope you can see this conclusion is absurd because the fundamental premise of the test is that it is going to be answered by humans answering in good faith not a crow randomly pecking at buttons This assumes that ARCAGI relies on methodology rather than results The test doesnt care how the solution is reached it evaluates the ability to derive correct answers to unseen problems If humans can improve performance through familiarity and pattern recognition why should AI candidate systems be excluded for using similar strategies just at a higher scale Were back to the randomly pecking crow with autism I hope you can now see the logical fallacy in this claim Your reasoning is circular not mine You are literally begging the question Id argue the circular reasoning is in dismissing o3s success by asserting that pattern recognition reasoning which assumes a clear boundary between the two that doesnt exist Human reasoning is largely patternbased We dont reason from scratch every time we rely on heuristics analogies and learned patterns o3 succeeding through pattern recognition doesnt invalidate the test it challenges the assumption that pattern recognition and reasoning are fundamentally separate,m3c6i4y,16.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3b244l,Spanky2k,,2,2024-12-22 17:15:17,,,,The problem they will run into is that the open source models are too strong of a competitor to most of these offerings and so they cant just jack of prices 1000 one day since people will just switch to open source alternatives I just dont think this is true Theres a reason that open source software rarely achieves mainstream dominance Its just too much hassle Most users are not going out of their way to use an AI service theyre just using what is free to them or its being forced upon them the cost for it is their data Theyre not going to switch to an open source alternative because thats not whats being provided to them right now and theyre just not going to go out of their way to find one For the users that are specifically using an AI service eg paying for ChatGPT theyre using it to save money or time elsewhere and the services are dirt cheap in that regard Eg a company using an AI chatbot to be a first line of communication with users visiting their website This can save serious staff costs Or as another example my wife uses ChatGPT extensively to help her write emails Shell put in a rough draft ask for it to be more professional or say she wants to get a process documented and writes down a rough version of that and then gets it to write it up in a structured neat matter It saves her so much time its insane and the cost is nothing in business terms at 30 a month,m39iddb,1.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m39ogrg,mcdithers,,6,2024-12-22 11:00:42,,,,Oh its lucrative These AI offerings while not actually being AI or anything close to it give even more data points for targeted marketing The only artificial intelligence here are people who artificially think that an algorithm can solve human problems I havent found a single AI that can provide correct answers to relatively simple questions Microsoft CoPilot cant answer most AD questions nor does it have a clue on Microsofts own licensing models Googles AI cant correctly answer pretty much anything AI as it stands now is nothing more than a glorified search engine,m39iddb,1.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m39sf8x,agitatedprisoner,,6,2024-12-22 11:46:50,,,,An algorithm absolutely might solve human problems because most of the problems individual humans encounter have already been solved and have known answers An algorithm might recognize when a person is about to stumble into a known solved problem and make the necessary connection But for AI to do that it has to have detailed information about you and it also has to be deployed for your benefit instead of just to make money for some corporation If its about making money for corporations most of the useful advice it might offer wont even be on the radar and the advice it does give wont be trusted enough to be heeded,m39ogrg,2.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m39ovri,200brews2009,,12,2024-12-22 11:05:40,,,,I can agree if we say AI for personal use is a bust Alexa is joke siri is even less reliable and Gemini isnt much better Someone made the point earlier that these are just tracking and marking capabilities wrapped in a veneer add for us to easily accept into our lives I feel that in certain professional and scientific fields its very good at predicting and finding patterns and thats great We can discuss the merits of its use in the creative field but it appears to be somewhat useful and effective when given a specific prompt and further working the prompt into a product The problem for me is the AI for us Apple intelligence keeps wanting to summarize text messages and notifications which are already pretty succinct Alexa cant consistently tell me the weather or realize I only want updates on certain sports teams Our daily lives and activities are not so rote that they are predictable What we use the internet for isnt easily predictable and the auto fill search is pointless Today at least an ai personal assistant is not that it really is just an information scrapping tool to get more from us and no one wants or needs that No marketing wiz can seem to make the case for us to upgrade perfectly working tech for this,m39hyb2,1.0,1hjv8s1
comment,m39wzyi,NecroCannon,,6,2024-12-22 12:35:33,,,,Honestly it wasnt just the companies theres so many problems it brings to the table and then you have those people basically getting pissed off that people dont like the problems Like Im an artist I can definitely see how AI can help with my work but it isnt by generating entire pieces its by making legitimate tools I can use Take animation where big companies outsource inbetweening to Korean studios I dont have that luxury its a hurdle for animation startups maybe invest in inbetweening tools instead of diving right into generating Walk before running It doesnt even know the fundamentals but I KNOW by heart The bubbles gotta pop a ton of people need to be proven wrong and maybe then instead of creating programs that can do almost anything just almost terribly we can instead get specifically made tools in already existing software,m39hyb2,1.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3a5ou7,WelpSigh,,4,2024-12-22 13:50:30,,,,But people arent talking about what has previously been known as machine learning and has now been rebranded as AI There was a deliberate move to not call things like handwriting recognition AI because it isnt intelligent at least until the VC guys showed up after ChatGPT The question is really about computeheavy transformerbased architectures that we see with LLMs They are obscenely unprofitable companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are losing money on every query and while not useless by any means arent really useful for a lot of general tasks that justify the billions the tech industry is spending on new data centers Nor does it appear their capabilities will significantly improve in the near future to address markets beyond the current most common revenue sources overseas spammers on social media students trying to cheat on their homework and programmers generating boilerplate code So yeah its going to be a meltdown LLMs wont disappear but they will become a lot more expensive and the VC money spigot will turn off,m39m7nt,3.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3aab4m,WelpSigh,,-3,2024-12-22 14:25:14,,,,I didnt downvote you but ML branched off from AI into its own discipline It produced a lot of useful stuff but the effort to remerge it back into the AI umbrella by essentially erasing the distinction between the AIML approaches is one driven by marketing Its to create the impression that these algorithms are close to a general human intelligence they arent or will at least lead us there dubious More importantly it isnt really relevant to AI PCs and other AI tech When people are talking about AI they are almost always referring to transformerbased architecture that underlines OpenAI Anthropic etc It doesnt serve the conversation to point to things that arent what the poster is talking about and pretend theyre the same tech when they are not,m3a5twc,5.0,1hjv8s1

comment,m3dttxf,sesor33,,3,2024-12-23 03:08:09,,,,But youre missing the point you dont know if what youre learning is _correct_ or not It might _function_ but you dont know if its good code For example someone might say they want to write an authentication system for their companys files They write it as storing passwords in plain text and checking if a users entered password is the same as whats stored on a database Yes it works but its not correct The correct method being to hash the password then store that hash to compare to later What you get out of chatgpt might function but it also may not be correct Im pretty adept at programming and Ive seen chatgpt spit out functional yet completely incorrect code before And a lot of FOSS repos are seeing similar types of commits from brand new accounts that try to be helpful but end up trying to pull request garbage into the main branch that technically works but is written completely wrong Id highly recommend looking at places like code academy github and youtube to find examples of proper code for your use case then compare it to chatgpts output to see if theres room for improvement,m3ddh8p,3.0,1hjv8s1
