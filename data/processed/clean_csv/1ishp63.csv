comment,mdgwvfr,psychocopter,,21,2025-02-18 18:16:26,,,,This is part of the reason why Ive been able to recognize that I wont need fo upgrade for a long time I have a high end card from the previous generation but I only occasionally play games that push the card for high fps Outside of that I mostly play easier go run indie titles and esports titles so there isnt a point in upgrading I can always just lower some settings if I cant run something well and I have 24gb of vram so that shouldnt be an issue,mdgof4e,2.0,1ishp63

comment,mdjio8m,typeguyfiftytwix,,6,2025-02-19 01:57:51,,,,They always have been thats the secret Ill gladly buy from the company that pushes open source alternatives instead of paying off devs to use their exclusive BS Nvidia Gsync AMD freesync NVidia whatever the fuck it is AMD FSR That and AMD tends to have higher raw performance specifications especially per dollar but worse software performance because of those shenanigans which is worse in the short term on the biggest games that use those but in long term meant my AMD build kept up for longer It was never top of the line but I went a lot longer before feeling the need to upgrade,mdirrwu,2.0,1ishp63

comment,mdk60ko,soulsoda,,-10,2025-02-19 04:16:26,,,,The outrage generated by this is overblown were talking games older than 2013 that hardly anyone plays Heres the 30 day steam average for the top games that still use physX 32bit Borderlands 2 3000 players Assasins Creed Blackflag 1100 players Arkham city 700 players bioshock infinite 360 players Would you be pissed if consoles didnt have backwards compatibility for 12 year old games Like a PS4 playing PS2 games out of the box or a Wii playing N64 games or a Switch playing wii games Come on PhysX sucks There are better physic engines built into developer tools that are far more easy to implement and run far better on GPUs and CPUs Its like your asking for leaded gasoline when weve invented UNleaded gasoline that wont poison everyone This is a game dev issue not a hardware issue They should release a modern remastered version that doesnt need a crappy 13 year old physics engine thats dogshit Theres plenty of reasons to hate on Nvidias latest release of 50 series cards like their insistence of using the 12vHPWR cable again with 0 load balancing measures or the fact the 5080 is just a 4080 super super and doesnt have enough vram for the price point or the fact the 5090 doesnt exist when the 5080 shouldnt exist,mdglftu,1.0,1ishp63
comment,mdgp98z,internetlad,,265,2025-02-18 17:41:11,,,,Physx was so damn cool and Nvidia buying them absolutely set gaming on a separate and in my opinion lesser fork in the road Imagine if we had games that accentuated realistic physics on the scale that we demand graphical fidelity Thats what Physx cards did and I absolutely would pay for a separate card to do it Shame it was only used for shit like flags and hair,,0.0,1ishp63
comment,mdie2rq,No-Bother6856,,111,2025-02-18 22:21:42,,,,What I want is hardware accelerated ray traced audio Like a real time simulation of how sound waves propagate between a source in the game and the players character instead of just faking it Sound bouncing off walls sound being muffled because objects are between you and the source actual echoes etc Right now the game audio is sort of like being suspended in an anechoic chamber and sounds are being played from speakers floating around you They can move the speakers around the room to change the direction you are hearing things from or add various filters to the sound played over the speakers to simulate being in a room or a warehouse or being muffled by a closed door etc But it isnt real The sound cant reflect off things objects cant get in the way If you hear an echo its just a baked in reverb effect not a real calculated reflection off an object in the world etc,mdgp98z,1.0,1ishp63

comment,mdiqysu,mule_roany_mare,,14,2025-02-18 23:28:43,,,,You can definitely do it pretty cheap too The BVH trees that RT cores accelerate can also be used for collision proper sound simulation Only they are a lot cheaper than simulating light,mdie2rq,2.0,1ishp63
comment,mditmhn,No-Bother6856,,-2,2025-02-18 23:43:08,,,,If its cheap enough you probably dont need to use a dedicated coprocessor I figured it would be heavy enough to drop your fps too much if you used the RT cores on your primary GPU,mdiqysu,3.0,1ishp63
comment,mdjq3ey,kitsune223,,4,2025-02-19 02:39:36,,,,Isnt this what amd true audio and Radeon rays about Sadly devs didnt rush to those two as much as they did for ray tracing though the latest amd hardware still supports them,mdie2rq,2.0,1ishp63

comment,mdke5t3,Eevilyn_,,10,2025-02-19 05:13:28,,,,You wouldnt have The PhysX cards were expensiveAnd they were meant to operate in a PCI lane alongside your GPU But like no one bought those cards After NVIDIA bought them they made a feature were you could use your old GPU as a PhysX card but no one did that either,mdgp98z,1.0,1ishp63
comment,mdkxrj7,skateguy1234,,5,2025-02-19 08:03:47,,,,I had GTX 770s in SLI with a GT 640 as PhysX card back in the day Not enough games took advantage of it to be worth it if you didnt already have the extra GPU Honestly even with it it didnt matter as again not enough games made use of it IMO,mdke5t3,2.0,1ishp63

comment,mdk5w0g,Fredasa,,2,2025-02-19 04:15:36,,,,Huh Now Im wondering whether somebody clever could force older games to source their PhysX workload from a second GPU Kind of like how they recently finagled with FSR,mdgp98z,1.0,1ishp63

comment,mdks6v9,Curse3242,,2,2025-02-19 07:10:23,,,,Personally to me I would be way more onboard with my card having special stuff be expensive to improve physics of a game than the current Upscaling Reflections trend,mdgp98z,1.0,1ishp63
comment,mdltty8,Xeadriel,,1,2025-02-19 12:54:01,,,,What would that even look like in a game where you control characters You cant possibly make a control scheme of a character that would even make use of the realistic physics Other than that are there even any high budget games focused on physics simulation beyond simulators like flight simulator,mdgp98z,1.0,1ishp63
comment,mdmbdk2,internetlad,,2,2025-02-19 14:36:49,,,,You shoot a window Shards of glass realistically splay out and a large enough shard is created Its calculated to have enough mass and velocity to cause damage and hits them in the arm the face and the hand The enemy reacts accordingly Or Destructible environments Ever play teardown Imagine that running underneath every other game with no additional cost for CPU Or Hitmansniper elite games A truck is driving by The player releases some cloth out of a window above and it floats down in the breeze and gets pulled against the windshield with realistic slipstream modelling causing the truck to have to stop giving the player an opportunity to make a shot or it just straight up crashes Or Games with large animalsbeastenemies Dragons horses etc Skyrim whatever Ragdolls now have mass and dragons crash out of the sky when shot creating a new opportunity to create risk for the player to have to avoid it or an opportunity to crash into an enemy stronghold and cause destruction Shooting an enemys horse causes it to buckle forward with correctly calculated physics and the game not only behaves in a believable way but also applies damage realistically to the enemy rider Thats not even mentioning games that are made specifically with physics in mind Puzzle games simulators Realistic liquid behavior models It would be so cool Seriously Physics in games are what we have been missing and everyone just accepts video game logic which is fine Not every game needs to be BeamNG and this is what I mean that we could be in a completely different place with gaming if the industry didnt just say well itll make for a nice screenshot in a magazine and actually made innovative games,mdltty8,2.0,1ishp63
comment,mdmdbpn,Xeadriel,,1,2025-02-19 14:47:06,,,,okay yeah Im convinced but how to bring that up and how to really get that running because I feel like that would just blow up the prices of a pc even harder main boards usually only have one speedy pcie not two as it is a graphics card is just always needed and physics cards would just add on top of that just like VR still being a niche market despite being really cool tech,mdmbdk2,3.0,1ishp63
comment,mdmes1h,internetlad,,1,2025-02-19 14:54:43,,,,Yeah thats what killed it in the first place No game became the killer app to sell Physx It almost has to become selfsustaining There are enough cards sold to make it worthwhile to make games that requireheavily utilize a physx card and there are enough games utilizing it that makes it a necessary purchase Regarding the softwarehardware development i dont know enough to comment I believe the original physx card ran on a standard pci slot so I dont know what bandwidth is required to make it viable for modern gamesfunctions I guess I just have this dream in my head even if its not especially realistic at least in the short term A man can dream though Edit heres an old aegia Physx card listing on Newegg for reference,mdmdbpn,4.0,1ishp63
comment,mdmjgo4,Xeadriel,,1,2025-02-19 15:18:39,,,,I think its more realistic to hope for graphics cards to become more general purpose I mean they already do with AI so utilizing and spitting that power is probably our best bet right now Games just need to make those physics happen with graphics cards Then just like it happened from cpu to GPU another coprocessor the physics cards would spring up once that is exhausted because monolithic potential is limited when it comes to hardware and software and by that time one can hope all prices calm down as well just like VR headsets are a bit more affordable right now,mdmes1h,5.0,1ishp63
comment,mdgigwe,chrisdh79,,234,2025-02-18 17:09:40,,,,From the article Now here is something that caught me off guard It appears that NVIDIA has removed GPU PhysX support for all 32bit games in its latest RTX 50 series GPUs As such you will no longer be able to enjoy older GPU PhysX games at high framerates This means that the RTX 5090 and the RTX 5080 and all other RTX50 series GPUs cannot run games like Cryostasis Batman Arkham City Borderlands 2 GRAW 2 Mirrors Edge Assassins Creed IV Black Flag Bioshock Infinite with GPUaccelerated PhysX Instead youll have to rely on the CPU PhysX solution which is similar to what AMD GPUs have been offering all these years This is such a shame as one of the best things about PC gaming is returning to older titles The old PhysX games were quite demanding when they came out I dont know if Im the minority here but I really enjoyed most of them when they came out And yes when I got the RTX 4090 I tried Cryostasis tech demo so that I could finally see all those PhysX effects with high framerates NVIDIA claimed that the CUDA Driver will continue to support running 32bit application binaries on GeForce RTX 40 GeForce RTX 30 series GeForce RTX 20GTX 16 series GeForce GTX 10 series and GeForce GTX 9 series GPUs However it wont support them on the GeForce RTX 50 series and newer architectures I honestly dont know why NVIDIA has dropped support for them Its ironic because Mafia 2 with PhysX felt WAY BETTER than the ridiculous remaster we got in 2020 And now if you want to replay it youll have to stick with an older GPU We are going backward here,,0.0,1ishp63

comment,mdlbx9l,ValuableKill,,1,2025-02-19 10:25:43,,,,Idk how many games support just offloading PhysX but I dont think its many I think the game specifically needs an option for hardware dedicated PhysX to offload Long story short I think your library options that could benefit from that would be limited Now you could choose to have an older secondary GPU for running everything not just PhysX but then you run into the issue of how many lanes your extra 16 slot PCIe actually has An x4 lane likely wont cut it and an x8 lane might be good enough for your taste if you have a PCIe Gen 40 gpu but likely not a Gen 30 and either way you are taking a hit to graphics However if you do happen to have a second 16 slot PCIe that has the full x16 lanes then none of this is a problem Personally if you have an older GPU lying around you probably have several older parts lying around and I think at that point your best bet is to just build a second PC and use that when you want to play older PhysX games I used old components I had to build the pc for my arcade cabinet for example Sometimes having two PCs is better than trying to do it all on one,mdgjxe8,2.0,1ishp63

comment,mdk0grv,grumd,,1,2025-02-19 03:41:08,,,,I had a 3080 playing at 3440x1440 and upgraded to a 5080 The performance difference was massive Whereas before I had to play with settings and drop to a lower dlss setting or to mediumhigh to get 6070 fps with a 5080 I can once again just crank everything to max and enjoy solid smooth gameplay on any game My jaw dropped when I started Cyberpunk on my 4K tv turned on Path Tracing and got 180 fps Around 60 without framegen Replayed Phantom Liberty to get some new endings and it was gorgeous Unexpectedly framegen was better than I thought My main monitor is 3440x1440 240hz so running at 7080 fps for good latency and adding 4x framegen on top of that to get 240fps gives me super smooth gameplay while still being very responsive Its not the same as native 240fps but its definitely better than 80 fps But if you dont have a high refresh rate monitor then its not worth it 4x framegen was made for 240hz monitors imo Every reviewer shat on the 5080 but its a massive jump for 30series and price to performance its still better than even a used 4090 The prices are insane nowadays even on the used market If you can afford it without ruining your finances go buy a 5070ti You wont regret it its a huge upgrade over 3060 ti,mdjlhc2,3.0,1ishp63

comment,mdiaul5,lordraiden007,,1,2025-02-18 22:04:50,,,,False Even a 5800X 3D or 5950X cant run consistently above 30fps when PhysX is in CPU mode reportedly barely makes it into the mid20s and thats before you consider 1 lows and there hasnt been an increase in such performance in newer generations NVIDIA intentionally restricted it to a singlecore on CPUs so this will just be the way things are going forward unless we find a 3rd party compatibility solution or NVIDIA decides to graciously s give us a translation layer or add back support for these things,mdh1zzv,4.0,1ishp63

comment,mdjpqgn,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,3,2025-02-19 02:37:31,,,,Just PhysX stuff I think since AMD never had PhyX support it would run at least as well as it would on an equivalent AMD card So for games from the 360PS3 era probably just fine,mdj398s,5.0,1ishp63

comment,mdic86p,JoostinOnline,,2,2025-02-18 22:11:54,,,,Are you sure thats the PhysX I just played Arkham Origins and both that and Arkham City have max settings that are basically impossible over 1080p,mdi4i4a,2.0,1ishp63
comment,mdjrb9p,Don-Tan,,0,2025-02-19 02:46:41,,,,Resolution doesnt matter still only 40 fps standing in physx fog on 1080p,mdic86p,3.0,1ishp63

comment,mdr46x7,JoostinOnline,,1,2025-02-20 05:00:43,,,,Thats awesome and incredibly depressing thank you The more I think about it the more it makes sense I believe early PhysX titles were single threaded so theyd run exceptionally bad on modern CPUs nullifying a lot of the gains,mdq5zye,6.0,1ishp63
comment,mdgsylw,Sylanthra,,1,2025-02-18 17:58:16,,,,I wonder if this has any impact provided you pair your 50 series cart with an equally modern CPU PhysX load from 15 year old games isnt going to stress modern cpus much,,0.0,1ishp63
