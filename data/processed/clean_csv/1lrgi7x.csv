post,1lrgi7x,diacewrb,Nintendo is restricting the Switch 2's USB-C port — most third-party docks and accessories won't work thanks to proprietary protocols,6852,2025-07-04 11:32:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1lrgi7x/nintendo_is_restricting_the_switch_2s_usbc_port/,911.0,gadgets,,,,

comment,n1bjfhn,wolfgang784,,895,2025-07-04 15:22:56,,,,The EU website says the USBC thing is only for charging and the Switch 2 can indeed charge off of any old USBC It just cant do anything else at all besides charge with them,n1ajv77,1.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1byluw,trojanguy,,473,2025-07-04 16:39:26,,,,Yeah when I got my son a S2 for his birthday I figured that instead of climbing behind the TV and switching the original Switch cables for the S2 cables Id just unplug the Switch dock and use the same cables on the S2 dock Nope no output to the TV unless I used the cables that came with the S2 Laaaaame,n1bjfhn,2.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1c7187,Dashi-,,232,2025-07-04 17:21:39,,,,the hdmi is fine its just that the power adapter uses 20 more watts than the old one for docked use,n1byluw,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1fwv7u,eh_steve_420,,19,2025-07-05 08:43:33,,,,Nintendo actually recommends you use the new HDMI cable Its newer and supports more bandwidth than The one that came with the switch 1 The old one may not support all video resolutions and refresh rates I believe it maxes out at 30 FPS in 4K resolution More info here And,n1c7187,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d7o4j,pastelfemby,,52,2025-07-04 20:36:40,,,,20 more watts no Switch 2 dock also has a fan to keep things cool which is an important note Theres several 3rd party docks that work just fine This whole post is just nintendo bad though they could def be doing better Pretty sure though you dont want to be sticking a hot and toasty switch 2 into some fanless old switch1 dock that ends up letting it get cooked,n1c7187,4.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1dtrne,TristheHolyBlade,,18,2025-07-04 22:45:33,,,,The fans dont really cool the switch at all Too much plastic between them and no heatsink or anything to transfer heat They are for the dock itself plus the heat the switch adds to it Not sure if you thought that since the pronouns are a bit vague in your final sentence but just fyi,n1d7o4j,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1jr4zd,Puzzleheaded-Bar9577,,3,2025-07-05 23:11:17,,,,Switch 1 dock is incompatible due to its usbc to hdmi interface using MyDP which is some archaic protocol for mid 2010s android phones The switch 2 is incompatible as it implements some weird hand shake for the dock if you look at the chips it should eventually use a standard DP 14 video alt mode but there is an stm32 which I assume controls the proprietary component of the switch 2 usbc interface and likely also the fan,n1d7o4j,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1f7q49,Eurynom0s,,1,2025-07-05 04:43:39,,,,Does the new one use a standard USBC power profile now It was a massive pain in the ass with the OG that the dock required some specific power profile that only some chargers hadhave Got burned on this traveling across the country to visit a friend and he asked me to bring my Switch brought the dock but figured Id save space and just use my MacBook charger that I needed to also bring anyhow that had more than enough wattage but nope nogo with the dock because of the weird power profile thing,n1c7187,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1f9hjp,Dashi-,,3,2025-07-05 04:58:51,,,,Ye its standard now the only thing that aint standard is the docks video output,n1f7q49,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c1t74,who_is_with_me,,67,2025-07-04 16:55:39,,,,At least the HDMI of the original switch is working for me with no problems Maybe the old power supply doesnt have enough power,n1byluw,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1c61yw,primordialpickle,,50,2025-07-04 17:16:46,,,,Believe it requires 20V input Iirc the switch 1 has a 19V,n1c1t74,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d0ywv,theLuminescentlion,,22,2025-07-04 20:00:27,,,,As an EE 19V vs 20V normally wouldnt break anything the main voltage rarely gets used without a regulator and even when it is the device is fine within a range usually more than a volt They would have to go specifically out of their way to sense the voltage and disable at 19V which is insane,n1c61yw,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d2mrk,primordialpickle,,28,2025-07-04 20:09:24,,,,A slight correction but the switch power adapter nominally supplies 15v at 26A docked so roughly 39 watts The switch 2 adapter is 20v 3amps 60W,n1d0ywv,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d3f88,theLuminescentlion,,1,2025-07-04 20:13:40,,,,yeah a 15V vs 20V with an increase in draw could definitely do it without fuckery hell Id probably design a supply expecting 20V not to turn on under 18V without any Ill intent,n1d2mrk,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1cyba6,FlyingBishop,,-5,2025-07-04 19:46:16,,,,Switching from 19V to 20V seems pretty fucked up the only reason you would do that is to deliberately cause incompatability,n1cdr6i,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d3t90,whyizjay,,9,2025-07-04 20:15:46,,,,Its more than that The switch 1 power supply is 39 watt but the switch 2 one is 60 watt,n1cyba6,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1dt1w6,Buttersaucewac,,5,2025-07-04 22:41:02,,,,It didnt go from 19v to 20v it went from 15v to 20v and 26 amps to 3 amps The console uses more power and the dock also now includes a fan to cool it so it uses 35 more power in total and needs a bigger power supply,n1cyba6,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1cz8jw,ToYeetIsHuman,,1,2025-07-04 19:51:16,,,,Its worth noting that there are several different versions of HDMI with only the newer ones supporting 4K If you are trying to run 4K I cant imagine a 10 year old switch 1 hdmi would output at that resolution if not then nvm,n1c1t74,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1fade3,who_is_with_me,,1,2025-07-05 05:06:42,,,,Good point I am actually not sure if I am still using the original HDMI cable I got from the first switch the one that came with the OLED version or most likely just a random third part one I bought somewhere before or inbetween At least I can definitely say that it doesnt have to be the one that is in the box with the switch 2,n1cz8jw,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1egucb,Twitch84,,1,2025-07-05 01:19:06,,,,Is 4K60HDR working correctly You might hit a HDMI bottleneck when 120fps games release but maybe not My old TV was only HDMI 20 and I recall playing 120fps120hz but I believe it was at 1080p,n1c1t74,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1fwwos,eh_steve_420,,1,2025-07-05 08:43:59,,,,Nintendo actually recommends you use the new HDMI cable which is HDMI Its newer and supports more bandwidth than The one that came with the switch 1 The old one may not support all video resolutions and refresh rates I believe it maxes at 30fps in 4k More info And,n1c1t74,4.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c85n8,Varonth,,33,2025-07-04 17:27:17,,,,Because the original Switch did use a custom amount of voltage at that time chargers did not need to be universal So in your case the issue isnt that the Switch 2 is not complient with the requirement it is that the Switch 1 charger is not complient with the requirement and hadnt have to at the time of its release,n1byluw,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1chxvc,japzone,,10,2025-07-04 18:17:13,,,,Yeah the Switch 1 charger isnt powerful enough for the Switch 2,n1byluw,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1f3ebl,Banksov,,1,2025-07-05 04:07:30,,,,You can use 3rd party hdmi they just need to be good that can carry the appropriate signal Likewise with the power adapter it just needs to be able to deliver the power being demanded by the dock,n1byluw,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1fc90v,KazzieMono,,9,2025-07-05 05:23:24,,,,Ahhh They probably did that because launch switch 1s could be modded with an rcm jig and a usbc cord and nothing else Lord Nintendo I get it console modding is kind of a huge taboo but come on Its not hurting anybody Let people own the shit they buy,n1bjfhn,2.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bnbl6,MinecraftW06,,42,2025-07-04 15:42:19,,,,But its still anticompetitive behavior which is not allowed under the DMA,n1bjfhn,2.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1eq7aj,PSIwind,,6,2025-07-05 02:27:16,,,,This is a Gadgets subreddit so Im surprised people in here arent aware that the dock is using a DisplayPort to USBC to HDMI protocol Its not anticompetitive its a different protocol that USBC to HDMIs dont use but IS easily possible to replicate Its not patented,n1bnbl6,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c2oon,ItsAMeUsernamio,,-12,2025-07-04 16:59:58,,,,Only because its a commercial failure They wouldnt have brought support otherwise EU cant force Sony to support my USBC hall effect controller For all the downvotes PSVR2 launched 2023 They announced PC support in 2024 which requires an additional adapter to purchase They did not do it out of goodwill or EU pressure The Switch in comparison supports many third party controllers and Xbox gives out licenses for some of them PS5 pretty much only supports Dualsense and Dualsense Edge,n1buhq4,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1cz2lt,thelonesomeguy,,2,2025-07-04 19:50:23,,,,They literally announced that they were working on PC support when they released it,n1c2oon,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1fvq38,vgf89,,5,2025-07-05 08:31:46,,,,They did not There were a few people who were trying to figure out if they could get it to work given how similar it looked to the VirtualLink standard at first glance The farthest people got back then was display output with some custom hardware invetween the PC and PSVR2 and I think you needed a VirtualLink GPU to even get that far The official pc support box was practically a shadow drop,n1cz2lt,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1ixf2x,thelonesomeguy,,1,2025-07-05 20:20:15,,,,I didnt have the timeline right but they mentioned it around the 1 year anniversary around half a year or so before they released the support,n1fvq38,8.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d160r,ItsAMeUsernamio,,1,2025-07-04 20:01:31,,,,They absolutely did not do that Even today the PSVR2 page does not mention PC Even back in 2024 it was just rumours when I bought my Quest 3,n1cz2lt,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bwq67,CosmicCreeperz,,10,2025-07-04 16:29:45,,,,What does that even mean No one is required to write software to support any device Blocking someone else from making something that uses a standard USB port is different from supporting your device on some elses hardware or vice versa,n1bsozi,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bzjuv,suentendo,,7,2025-07-04 16:44:17,,,,PSVR2 uses a completely nonstandard USB protocol which is why it needs an adapter to work on PC The port it connects to on PS5 has proprietary hardware to make it work even though of course it still supports some USB standards Its a entirely similar situation,n1bwq67,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d33ec,CatProgrammer,,4,2025-07-04 20:11:53,,,,VirtualLink is an official standard A bunch of companies supported it while the PS5 was being designed but dropped support for later GPU releases,n1bzjuv,6.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1d6bnm,Melodic-Theme-6840,,4,2025-07-04 20:29:20,,,,No it does not It uses VIrtual Link which is a standard protocol and if you have a GPU that supports virtual link you can use psvr2 on PC without the adapter It is not Sonys fault that both GPU vendors decided to drop Virtual Link later on,n1bzjuv,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1c6w92,CosmicCreeperz,,-2,2025-07-04 17:20:57,,,,They didnt do it to intentionally make it harder for anyone or block use the connector is property because it contains some of the hardwarechips that the breakout box used to have and they wanted to simplify connectivity to the console Go look at some PCVR systems They are a mess of USB DP and power connections to plug in Sony literally planned a PC adapter from the start and released it to work with their HMD and its property cable filled with chips to support VR use They even allow by not encrypting connection messages 3rd party PCVR connectors What more do you want,n1bzjuv,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d2tsk,CatProgrammer,,1,2025-07-04 20:10:27,,,,VirtualLink is a standard protocol for USBC not Sonys problem other companies decided to drop it,n1bsozi,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1by3jj,kodman7,,-1,2025-07-04 16:36:49,,,,It is insanely different they are locking out a feature that should work by default whereas PS5 would require major effort to support other VR platforms,n1bsozi,4.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1cgjy2,Jonaldys,,0,2025-07-04 18:09:51,,,,I dont agree that something being the case from release is the same as patching out features after release but whatever you believe It would be more like PlayStation not allowing third party dongles for PC from release Not really egregious but annoying They are not removing any functionality unless you bought third party accessories that were developed pre release,n1cdyss,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1ckgaz,kodman7,,-2,2025-07-04 18:30:34,,,,If they are using universal protocols which is the default then yes it should work by defaultrelease They are creating their own protocols ie going out of their way to make sure their customers cant use 3rd party docks There is no other reason to do so Enabling it within their protocols would be a line switch They choose not to,n1cgjy2,8.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1cpv3s,Jonaldys,,0,2025-07-04 18:59:35,,,,Of course But it isnt take away an existing feature Not nearly as egregious as patching out third party capabilities You can move the goalposts but Im not going to change the point I actually argued,n1ckgaz,9.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1da4qr,KimNyar,,0,2025-07-04 20:50:02,,,,The point is not about charging ports its about nintendos anti competitiveness and the eu has measures in place to combat them but idk if it wouldcan apply to shutting out 3rd party manufacturers,n1bjfhn,2.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1eohti,Ok-Beautiful4821,,1,2025-07-05 02:14:46,,,,This isnt really the same at all but circlerjerk away I guess OG Gameboy is late 80s tech and we saw a ton of miniaturizing of electronics in the 90s that meant they could shrink the Gameboy into the pockets size and run it off 2 AAA batteries instead of the OGs 4 AAs which they literally could not have done in the late 80s They technically couldve done color with the OG Gameboy but certainly not twice the clockspeed the GBC had and certainly not with the battery life that the original GB had Thats not double triple dipping thats the natural progression of technology during a rapidly changing decade Whereas a nonOLED Switch is blatant attempt to doubledip because the technology for an OLD Switch 2 is here now and has been for years,n1cad0z,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ly5q2,seanl1991,,1,2025-07-06 09:37:18,,,,I didnt say I didnt want a mainline game I said I dont get why there needs to be 3 of them that cost the same and are almost identical I enjoyed Pokémon as a kidteenager I did play legends on the switch too Im glad that the series has survived and were now at the point where adults are showing their kids what Pokémon they grew up with etc Maybe its actually a good thing since you can get what you dont have in each game through trading I think instead of having to pay for some DLC to complete things At least you could in the Gameboy DS Versions not sure if they have all continued to work that way on the Switch,n1dzk3n,9.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c6yu4,nimbusnacho,,3,2025-07-04 17:21:19,,,,Yeah 50 bucks is an easy sell itd likely not just be 50 bucks tho if it was a launch variant so its a weird argument An OLED model would definitely be better I truly would find it shocking to find anyone making an argument that it wouldnt be aside from a simple costbenefit standpoint,n1c1m1g,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c9dyf,SeroWriter,,9,2025-07-04 17:33:27,,,,Youre downplaying it a lot It stops you from accessing anything you own digitally and most cartridge games also dont work because they dont actually contain the game they just give you authorisation to download it from the Nintendo servers So its actually worse than bricking the console because you cant play physical games and it also takes away the entire library of digital games you paid for,n1c1oj5,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ie895,SeroWriter,,0,2025-07-05 18:33:53,,,,The PS Vita getting bricked was because people fucked up when installing custom firmware and it could be reversed with a hard reset of the system Its basically impossible to brick a Vita absolute worst case you let the battery die and then restart in recovery mode Its not even slightly similar to the Switch 2 With Nintendo the consoles unique ID gets flagged as bad and the company permanently blocks it nothing you do to the console from that point on will ever fix it,n1f8xfy,9.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1chx3r,Jonaldys,,-5,2025-07-04 18:17:06,,,,Its the publishers choice All Nintendo games released so far are present on the cartridge Cyberpunk 2077 is on the cartridge But game key cards are cheaper and easier to develope for I figured it went without saying that hacking your console and having its online deactivated would restrict access to your digital library I wouldnt recommend hacking your primary console,n1c9dyf,8.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bn9zh,octopusforgood,,12,2025-07-04 15:42:06,,,,That actually is arguable since they DO restrict charging on the dock for certain things at least during setup The article also mentions that the Nintendos branded AC adapter is required to make the only known functional 3rd party dock work How could this be so if they were not actually implementing charging restrictions albeit selectively in certain circumstances,n1arwbz,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bnk64,N2-Ainz,,24,2025-07-04 15:43:31,,,,Nintendo restricts video output that is not the same as restricting charging The EU forces the to use PD for charging they do allow PD for charging That the dock only works with the original charger is irrelevant because its about video output and not charging input,n1bn9zh,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1boqxt,octopusforgood,,-7,2025-07-04 15:49:25,,,,Hey I appreciate your addition there that you think the law should be changed Im just saying if Nintendo isnt misusing their chargers functionality perhaps via some kind of authentication how would this be the case How would the device even be able to read information from the specific charger when the 3rd party dock employs it,n1bobso,10.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bp6k5,N2-Ainz,,3,2025-07-04 15:51:36,,,,The original charger very likely has a chip that also sends instruction to the Switch 2 and its very likely that they found a way to use these instructions from the charger to let the console think that the dock is an original or authorized one Thats at least the only explanation that I have for this,n1boqxt,11.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1br0q9,octopusforgood,,2,2025-07-04 16:00:48,,,,Anyway sorry for the accusation that you were supporting Nintendos call I just have the attitude that if theres a legal grey area which in my opinion this is its the responsibility of Nintendo itself to argue that building in the capability to detect the OEM charger doesnt violate the rule Corporations in general love to walk right up to the line when it suits them and push the boundaries and I think now and again showing them it isnt safe to do that would be a good thing maybe make them think twice about anticompetitive anticonsumer moves,n1bp6k5,12.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ar9sl,Ekyou,,4,2025-07-04 12:49:21,,,,I charged my Switch 2 with my tablet charger the other day no issue And supposedly any USB plug and play webcam will work with the video chat feature It honestly might make sense if they dont allow for 3rd party docks isnt some of the Switches processing power in the dock Like the Switch 2 can charge on a Switch 1 dock but not connect to the TV with it,n1aoc4x,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1avof4,JukePlz,,16,2025-07-04 13:16:13,,,,Only reason Switch 12 are more powerful when in dock mode is because of how power management is implemented in software When its pluggedin they dont have to care about battery use,n1ar9sl,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d1936,m0rogfar,,1,2025-07-04 20:01:58,,,,Switch 2 also has an active cooling solution in the dock allowing it to overclock far more than the Switch 1 did in docked mode,n1avof4,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bgc1x,RegurgitatedMincer,,8,2025-07-04 15:07:27,,,,Old switch charger also charges switch 2 just fine without the dock Its literally just the dock being restricted here,n1bcnbo,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1d1s98,m0rogfar,,0,2025-07-04 20:04:50,,,,The Switch overclocks itself when docked Youre probably not running into insufficient power delivery issues when its undocked because the power draw is literally just lower,n1bgc1x,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1aqlp6,cheesyvoetjes,,-14,2025-07-04 12:45:10,,,,No they wont The legal mandate is to reduce charger and cable waste How does Nintendo making it so you cant use your older cables and have to usebuy a specific Nintendo cable reduce waste This is literally the problem they tried to solve Im no expert or lawyer but the EU is 100 going after Nintendo for this and they will make damn sure they win Because if not Apple will do the same thing as Nintendo and the rest of industry will follow Theyll be right back to where they started and the EU looks badtoothless The EU has more to lose than Nintendo,n1ane3r,2.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1arr9j,ReallyRecon,,14,2025-07-04 12:52:22,,,,I think Nintendos intention is that you can still charge the device using any USBC cable but you cannot connect accessories or other devices that might interface with the port unless theyre compliant with Nintendos protocols That basically just means you can only connect Nintendo accessories or thirdparty compatible accessories from vendors that Nintendo has approved Previous poster was referring to the EU legal mandate to reduce charger and cable waste They were saying that this move by Nintendo doesnt conflict with that,n1aqlp6,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1aw3tg,cheesyvoetjes,,-11,2025-07-04 13:18:46,,,,Wouldnt that still conflict with trademark laws allowing third party products Different law but still against the law and something the EU would look at,n1arr9j,4.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1b9bjc,ladyatlanta,,-5,2025-07-04 14:31:55,,,,And its producing more waste because you cant use third party devices what if your cable breaks Now I cant use one of the thousands of other same cables I have lying around and I have to buy a Nintendo replacement,n1ane3r,2.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bfxrf,AmandasGameAccount,,4,2025-07-04 15:05:27,,,,Except you can I havent found a single thing that doesnt work I cant even tell if the article is even true because of it You can even use the switch 2 dock itself with other devices,n1b9bjc,3.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bgs0x,chronoswing,,-1,2025-07-04 15:09:41,,,,HDMI out doesnt work it is what the article is talking about Charging works fine So all those thirdparty usbc to hdmi will not work anymore like they did on switch 1,n1bfxrf,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bhyah,AmandasGameAccount,,3,2025-07-04 15:15:33,,,,Several docks have already claimed they updated to support switch 2 I dont know which but it was in the comments the last time this was posted the last time I saw this posted the article worded it that the switch 2 broke compatibility with 3rd party docks and docks needed to update to support it and the comments listed a few with updates that made it work again This time its posted the article feels like its trying to word it like Nintendo intentionally trying to screw you by banning all 3rd party accessories,n1bgs0x,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bmjro,chronoswing,,-1,2025-07-04 15:38:29,,,,I cant think of any docks that support software updates In fact I would wager to say 99 of them dont So yes Nintendo did lock a lot of people out of most 3rd party docks Now to be fair all of these are switch 1 accessories and there is no guarantee to work with switch 2 So if its as simple as protocal change for manufacturers then this will be a nonissue I think the main complaint is it doesnt work with any universal usb hubs that worked fine with the original switch,n1bhyah,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bop62,AmandasGameAccount,,3,2025-07-04 15:49:10,,,,No idea if any of these were updated but this is a list of docks that do work with it Edit ok after reading it more yes most these docks did update to support it,n1bmjro,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1c0i49,chronoswing,,-6,2025-07-04 16:49:07,,,,So 4 docks out of the 1000s of docks and hubs that exist on the market have the luxury of being able to have their software updated This isnt the win you think it is The point is Nintendo should be following USBC universal protocols just like the original did Thats the argument people are making Its walled garden bullshit and we shouldnt be defending it,n1bop62,8.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1b6ucr,pieter1234569,,-6,2025-07-04 14:18:57,,,,Which it clearly isnt here Its not compliant with the normal protocol with extra protection that blocks all others to protect Nintendos interest Thats the worst way in which you can violate this law and as they sold a lot of them already thats going to be a very fun billion dollar fine,n1ane3r,2.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bkwd8,DanTheMan827,,2,2025-07-04 15:30:18,,,,Any appropriate cable works here but it needs to be a suitable cable capable of fast charging as well as outputting video Standard power adapters work they just need to be the proper specs Proprietary protocols dont violate the EU law as long as the device supports standard USBPD without artificially limiting the charging speed beyond what is officially supported by a first party option,n1b6ucr,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c03qb,Rudy69,,1,2025-07-04 16:47:06,,,,They actually have a valid reason though When in docked mode it expects a dock with a fan to cool the Switch so it can boost higher to support the better resolution it offers in docked mode,n1ajv77,1.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1djcm9,LucifishEX,,1,2025-07-04 21:41:55,,,,I actually could be mistaken It seems like the proprietary PDstyle protocols are between the dock and the switch and as long as you have a USBC charger output 60w 20v it should work That said Nintendos docking systems are on the line between janky and selfdestructive engineering Not even sure its intentional its just a complex thing You assume the risk of frying your system like early days Switch 1 if trying to do video output with a different charger,n1din7a,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1hks1c,Jaws12,,4,2025-07-05 15:59:17,,,,Reviews are mixed probably because people tried it out before the most recent firmware update which resolved some issues With the most recent firmware the Antank dock I got has worked fine without issue for me thus far,n1e4l4o,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1cg1as,vidjagames72,,1,2025-07-04 18:07:08,,,,This is true but Ive also seen that this aftermarket dock does not have vent holes on the bottom going to the switch 2 air inlets like the factory dock You just get whatever makes it around the gaps in that U shaped cavity it sits in It might honestly be fine dont own a Switch 2 or the dock so I couldnt tell you If I did own one and got this dock Id see about adding some vent holes,n1bs6fu,4.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bus9a,epicjakman,,9,2025-07-04 16:19:51,,,,oh dang youre right though im still not sure why the s2 needs a fan on its dock while the s1 didnt edit i did some googling and someone said its likely because of the 4k output as well as faster usb connections those can run pretty hot that math checks out I think,n1btc09,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1bvanr,Jaron780,,6,2025-07-04 16:22:25,,,,Probably Nintendo just playing it safe because the Switch 2 does use higher voltage charging which passes through the dock Which is why you cant use the switch 1 power cord for the Switch 2 dock,n1bus9a,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1auboz,submerging,,0,2025-07-04 13:08:03,,,,Sorry misinterpreted the intent of your comment Yes megacorporations are generally bad Usually when theres someone who does a bad thing and someone else in response brings up an unrelated third party that also does a bad thing it tends to be done in defense of that original party If your goal was to just call out Sony and Microsoft without minimizing the anticonsumer decision that Nintendo did in this particular case thats fair,n1alogj,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ajys6,Joshawott27,,4,2025-07-04 12:00:56,,,,Yup Ill freely admit that Nintendo has been my preferred console manufacturer since I was a kid and their published games are basically why I know that since the GameCube theyve lagged in specs and thirdparty support and I also own other systems like a PS5 and Steam Deck However I play the Switch and now Switch 2 the most because they have Pokémon Fire Emblem etc the games that I personally want to play Similarly Apple has a great ecosystem that works within itself but doesnt play too well if you dare venture outside Ive typically zigzagged between iPhone and Android with subsequent upgrades but my current job has allowed me to go deeper into the ecosystem with AirTags a MacBook etc They all work so well together that it would take a lot for an android phone to convince me to move again At least Im in the UK and noone cares about the blue bubbles here lol It is worth noting that this kind of behaviour isnt exclusive to Nintendo though For example Sony doesnt allow bluetooth headphones to connect to PS5 and instead require you to buy their own ones,n1ahqfy,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1cu27i,Dt2_0,,9,2025-07-04 19:22:32,,,,Dude you are talking about when things work perfectly Im talking about when the TV doesnt detect a sound device and doesnt allow you to change that setting Im talking about when things are not working right I work in the AV industry The amount of times Ive seen receivers and soundbars hooked up to TVs CEC on on both the audio devices and the TV but the TV not allowing you to turn ARC on as in the setting you are talking about doesnt appear or is greyed out is countless You can try different cables you can try power cycling all the units sometimes it just doesnt work Also lots of new TVs DONT have an ARC setting to set They use a device connection detection and automatically decide if they want to output via ARC,n1c7gag,5.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1c11ho,sirbrambles,,7,2025-07-04 16:51:48,,,,HDMI standards are a mess When buying on line its really hard to know that the cable you are getting is capable of the outputting you need Manufacturers rarely tell you which of the many versions it supports and when they do they are lying half the time Theres also monitors and tvs that support 4K 120hz but dont include a modern enough HDMI port to support these features and do not warn consumers,n1bex6j,3.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bxb76,Jaron780,,1,2025-07-04 16:32:46,,,,Ah fair enough forgot they didnt introduce Dock firmware updates until the oled dock Still though The currently available 3rd party dock can update its firmware with a PC so as long as that company keeps providing updates anytime nintendo might change it then it should still work Also It would be tricky for Nintendo to change that key because you need the switch docked in order to update the dock firmware and if its not outputting display you cant even select in the menu to update the dock since the dock itself covers the handheld screen So they would have to continue supporting the old key until the dock has updated too but then that would open a world of issues with old unused docks that didnt update no longer working Basically they need to continue supporting launch switch 2 dock keys And changing key would break any dock that isnt updated Not sure nintendo would open that can of worms unless there was some major third party dock issue like with the Nyko dock for switch 1,n1bvd8w,4.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1e8rd7,mikebeatrice,,1,2025-07-05 00:22:01,,,,Pretty sure you can select the option to update the dock when in handheld mode and then it tells you to place it on the dock for the update itself to avoid the issue youre talking about,n1bxb76,5.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1ed2x7,Jaron780,,1,2025-07-05 00:52:11,,,,I guess they could do that as a way to deal with it but would still confuse a lot of people and not everyone would understand it just needs an update when it wouldnt show on the tv and would think its broken or something Dont really see nintendo going that route just to stop a few third party switches that can just update to fix it anyway and then deal with the backlash of quite alot of people for no real reason they really dont want the negative publicity i imagine but i guess this is nintendo so who knows i guess Since the third party docks can be updated it would just be a cat and mouse thing with nintendo and the third party dock companies constantly pushing updates in order to break and then fix it and i just dont see that happening when real docks would get caught in the middle forcing people to have to update in that way before docking,n1e8rd7,6.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ddmrq,Thejadedone_1,,1,2025-07-04 21:09:06,,,,Did you not read my comment These are thirdparty docs doing this not Nintendo lmao Edit they blocked me lmao Well I guess I might as well say what Im going to say You keep saying Nintendo didnt follow any common protocol or security measures but I wasnt able to find anything to support that online Ignore this Im wrong lmao I did find something that supports your claim but its a bit more complicated and nuanced than that To quote somebody from the famiboards The only 3rd party docks that exhibited problems were those that did not adhere to USBC and PD specifications It was not a Switch problem per se these docks could fry any USBC device phone etc that was connected The Switch console itself followed the specifications correctly That said the official Switch dock has a USBC connector that is slightly smaller than spec making it easier to connectdisconnect Third party manufacturers like Nyko attempted to do the same but botched it by not properly spacing the pins and cutting corners with safety circuitry Basically Nintendo had to make the pins a bit smaller than industry standard so that the switch could slide in and out of the dock easily Third parties try to replicate with their docks that but fucked it up because they were basically taking shots in the dark So ultimately it is on third parties for bricking the switch,n1dcryn,6.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1ddtqm,Dom1252,,1,2025-07-04 21:10:10,,,,Yeah exactly Nintendo didnt follow any specifications for USB and made their own so when you plugged something that works with every8else fine switch fries itself,n1ddmrq,7.0,1lrgi7x
comment,n1dnipn,urrpurr,,0,2025-07-04 22:06:37,,,,I do not think you understand what he is saying Nintendo implementing a USBC dock incorrectly according to standards And then designing the Switch around said faulty dock Therefore switch works with the nintendo dock even if it is incorrectly designed The third party dock that FOLLOWS industry standard of USBC is not the problem of switch being bricked using the third party dock The problem would be on Nintendos side for faulty design of their own Switch and dock not following industry standards in relations to USBC and charging,n1ddmrq,7.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1ajiol,jekpopulous2,,30,2025-07-04 11:57:45,,,,The issue with the OG Switch was that Nintendo designed their own faulty USBC charging implementation rather than using the reference design It wasnt a failure of the spec it was that Nintendo didnt adhere to the spec It wasnt even like cheap 3rd party docks were specifically the issue people were bricking their Switches with regular old phone laptop chargers and USB outlets that work just fine for any other device,n1ai9vq,1.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1el26s,Dom1252,,-1,2025-07-05 01:50:00,,,,yeah we do there wasnt a phone that exploded due to charging protocol it was usuallyy faulty batteries samsung was known for this faulty charger usually just fries itself because phones actually do have protective circuits unlike switch 1 nintendo is the only company incompetent enough to not be able to make USB port work or evil enough to knowingly make a device that kills itself I mean I can charge my lenovo laptop my iphone my macbook my xiaomi phone my sony cameras my sony headphones my jbl speaker my valve steamdeck my rollei LED light my godox lights with the same chargers but I cant plug it to switch because it could fry it and in your reality that somehow is the fault of the charger manufacturer just because nintendo couldnt be bothered to either follow already existing specs or at least put in some measures to prevent it from frying itself like a proper handshake for higher voltage instead of requesting higher voltage from the charger than it can handle like WTF those chargers wont supply more than 5V if you just plug in and there needs to be either specific circuit on data pins or handshake depending on protocol but no other device just kills itself,n1e7c1j,8.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1de1kd,EvadesBans4,,1,2025-07-04 21:11:24,,,,Reminder that Nintendo misimplemented the USBC spec on the Switch 1 to the degree that third party docks that follow the spec would burn out your Switch because it would essentially lie to the dock That was an intentional design decision A company the size of Nintendo does not have an excuse to know about the USBC spec and the fact that their custom design requests higher power than the Switch can handle because it lies to the dock must be considered an intentional design They clearly knew USBCs capabilities but they designed their console and dock to damage consoles if the spec was followed You are a sucker if you think nuh uh is a valid argument We have proof Nintendo is willing to do this and has done it so someone has to bring the proof that they didnt do it again Still trusting Nintendo to not fuck you over for doing something perfectly legal and moral that is to say there is neither a legal or moral argument against third party docks sorry fanboys is to simply be gullible,,0.0,1lrgi7x

comment,n1bvs4q,Edmundyoulittle,,4,2025-07-04 16:24:52,,,,Theyre completely different products for one thing To use a steam deck like a switch youd need to buy a dock separately and buy 2 controllers Not to mention that the switch 2 will actually be getting 1st party software support for the next 68 years while the steam deck wont Steam deck is a better purchase for anyone with an established steam library that would like to play handheld Outside of that not so much Edit One other thing Id add A steam deck doesnt get improved performance when docked When you dock your switch it changes its CPU and GPU output and changes the performance profiles of all the games its running Thats why a switch 2 game like Mario kart world can run at 1080p 60fps when handheld but then switches to 1440p 60fps when docked Thats not just a video output tweak thats the game itself being rendered at a higher resolution without any performance loss,n1bo6xm,1.0,1lrgi7x
