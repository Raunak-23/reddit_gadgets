post,1j3dcb3,diacewrb,Aluminum PP-1 turntable plays vinyl records without tonearm,145,2025-03-04 15:29:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1j3dcb3/aluminum_pp1_turntable_plays_vinyl_records/,32.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mfzes66,skriefal,,105,2025-03-04 16:26:19,,,,Initially I thought that this used a laser or other optical mechanism to read the grooves There are cartridges that attach to traditional tonearms that do this and which connect to an external box to convert the digitaloptical signals to an analog signal But the specs state that this uses a 04 x 07 mil elliptical stylus A pretty basic elliptical stylus that presumably lifts upwards from below the LP on a linear tonearm playing the bottom side of the LP This may be interesting for 1000 But not for 6000,,0.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg09scw,noblecloud,,42,2025-03-04 18:49:05,,,,So basically its like a CD player where it reads from underneath but with a styles instead of a laser,mfzes66,1.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg0ddz0,skriefal,,19,2025-03-04 19:05:45,,,,I suppose it is like that yes Both use a sensor laser stylus that moves along a linear track while playing the disc And this turntable probably also has a laser or optical sensor Which would be used to detect the gaps between the tracks on the LP for the next track previous track feature There were turntables in the 80s that did this and it worked fairly well iirc but could glitch when playing clear nonblack LPs,mg09scw,2.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg7xwxt,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,9,2025-03-05 21:34:03,,,,But not for 6000 The audiophile world is just that way You get people to buy into the idea that a vinyl record is somehow better than a digital file Then they need to get 3000 speakers then they need 5000 in treatment for the room Then they need 200 cables for reasons that defy physics Then they need to upgrade the player since theres no sense in pairing 3000 speakers with an 80 player Then for the 6000 player no reason to cheap out on the amplifier Meanwhile theyd have gotten better sound out of a file on their phone and 300 headphones Sound quality is inherently subjective and highly sensitive to placebo effect so you cant use data to convince people who shelled out 14200 to listen to a scratched up 50 year old record that it doesnt sound that good They know what they hear,mfzes66,1.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg8rti2,skriefal,,2,2025-03-06 00:05:25,,,,I used to be an audiophile and am still a sortafringe kindaaudiophile Never really cared about expensive cables though esp expensive power cables or the pseudoscience accessories like the magic crystalsstones and such I suspect that most audiophiles wouldnt buy this turntable Theyd prefer to spend the 6K on something from VPI Rega or similar and a nice phono cartridge,mg7xwxt,2.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mfzlnzj,dustofdeath,,24,2025-03-04 16:57:37,,,,So its a underside linear needle player So instead of light weight arm the entire disk presses on the needle,,0.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mfzvxt5,tampering,,14,2025-03-04 17:44:53,,,,LOL i was going to say the same thing The whole reason the arm floats over the disc is to minimize the possibility of a weight causing damage to the media as it plays Does the engineerof this record player have a future in making deep sea submarines out of carbon fiber reinforced PVC,mfzlnzj,1.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg6572u,Regular_Ram,,6,2025-03-05 16:34:27,,,,The vinyl rests on a turn table where the label is its not resting on the stylus The stylus coming from the bottom could theoretically exert 0 force,mfzlnzj,1.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg04j5j,skriefal,,2,2025-03-04 18:24:26,,,,So its a underside linear needle player It seems so,mfzlnzj,1.0,1j3dcb3

comment,mfz6nig,fuzzbox000,,21,2025-03-04 15:48:46,,,,So does it read by laser Is it horizontal tracking Article leaves a lot of information unknown for 6k,,0.0,1j3dcb3

comment,mg06uzg,skriefal,,4,2025-03-04 18:35:31,,,,Yes form over function If thats what someone is looking for and 6K isnt a problem for them then fine For most things I prefer function over form well maybe a little bit of form is okay,mfzmb1f,2.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg09aqv,_Administrator,,1,2025-03-04 18:46:50,,,,this player will be a dust magnet and yes it looks kool but it is soo impractical,mg06uzg,3.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg0akua,skriefal,,3,2025-03-04 18:52:45,,,,Yeah dust could be an issue Turntables without dust covers werent uncommon in the past and still exist in the high end space but that was usually fixed by placing a hanky or similar on top of the turntable when not in use Someone who lays out the coin for this turntable probably wont want a hanky bandana or towel detracting attention from their work of art,mg09aqv,4.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg0deks,_Administrator,,2,2025-03-04 19:05:49,,,,I use an old baby cloth and have a dust cover And it is stil dusty I have no money for decent hvac Will buy airpurifier next month though,mg0akua,5.0,1j3dcb3

comment,mfzx554,WMU_FTW,,4,2025-03-04 17:50:27,,,,Half the comments in here they lie it must have a tonearm The other half it uses laseroptical pickup The article uses a hidden tone arm and elliptical stylis These are hidden from view by a set of doors when not in use,,0.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg004dh,fuzzbox000,,5,2025-03-04 18:04:09,,,,Am I missing something I did a search on the word tone and elliptical and didnt find either And in case anyone is listening a hidden tonearm is different than no tonearm,mfzx554,1.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mg25jev,WMU_FTW,,2,2025-03-05 00:15:20,,,,Try searching as one word tonearm Elliptical will only be found in the article itself I think though maybe one commenter used the word,mg004dh,2.0,1j3dcb3
comment,mgahcio,fuzzbox000,,2,2025-03-06 06:49:32,,,,You must be reading a different article than me I see 8 instances of tonearm all referring to how it doesnt have one,mg25jev,3.0,1j3dcb3

comment,mgcuz2j,the_loneliest_noodle,,2,2025-03-06 16:57:42,,,,This isnt new tech Its been done a few times before and its always been a bad idea It makes the stylus much more difficult to upgradereplace and limits the stylus to a weird niche form factor so people who are about sound cant use their stylus of choice This has been done for a fraction of the price and wasnt successful even then,,0.0,1j3dcb3
