comment,m59eiqp,None,,183,2025-01-03 22:46:16,,,,Im a big fan of all this standardization and the EU actually regulating things I still foresee tough times ahead though in the transition from USBA to USBC in most peripherals Plenty of laptops these days especially Macs come with nothing but USBC ports but you still cant find a mouse that comes with a USBC connector Best you can get is a dongle and a USBA connector which while workable obviously isnt ideal Same goes for keyboards headphones external drives on and on I would love it if I could ditch USBA entirely and not have to worry that I have the right combination of both on my PC and laptop Hopefully someday soon,,0.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5b0thq,i_liek_trainsss,,56,2025-01-04 04:34:05,,,,Im in a bit of a funny spot right now My employer saddled me with a laptop that only has USBA ports so Im good for connecting a printer or thumb drive or cheap mouse but when it comes to plugging in my phone or a USBC memory card reader to copy some photos I need to use an AtoC adapter And when it comes to plugging my laptop into our meeting rooms TVs USBC display device Im just shit out of luck Welp that last one is solidly not my problem,m59eiqp,1.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5ba698,Christopher135MPS,,5,2025-01-04 05:44:33,,,,I personally cant stand wireless gear Its subjective to interference and the batteries seem to run flat at the most inopportune moments Id be sort of okay with the second issue if they came with swappable battery packs so I can charge one and use one simultaneously but ultimately Id just still prefer a physical connection,m59m1pa,2.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5c1xxy,Eruannster,,7,2025-01-04 10:20:02,,,,Eh it depends what it is I used to be against wireless mice but Ive been rocking wireless mice even for gaming for years now and its pretty much impossible to tell the input lag from wiredwireless Same with headphones I keep hearing but the wireless delay and Ive been using bluetooth headphones for years now Sure I guess if I need to stay in perfect sync with the beat if I was playing the drums or something Id be way more picky about perfect sync but as it stands its almost impossible to tell the difference Plus wired connections arent even a perfect solution either Ive got a soundbar that is always 100200 milliseconds out of sync over HDMIARC if you feed it a Dolby Digital or DTS signal when playing games Only LPCM will stay in sync for games with that setup,m5ba698,3.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5c1q34,Call_Me_ZG,,3,2025-01-04 10:17:43,,,,My wireless mouse logitech mx master is wireless and charges via usb c might be worth looking into If the battery runs our you can plug it in and pretend its a wired mouse until it charges up Logitech also does unifying dongles so only dongle can connect multiple devices saves up your ports Bonus points that if you have multiple devices a button on the mouse can switch it from one laptop to another,m5ba698,3.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5c7roy,Vokasak,,2,2025-01-04 11:21:33,,,,I get where youre coming from but wireless peripherals have come a long way Both my wireless headset and mouse last long enough a day and both of them can charge while being used effectively turning them into at worst part time wired peripherals anyway I havent had much in the way of interference Ive managed to use the headset in particular from a few rooms over and even as far as out in the backyard before I start losing signal Obviously thats going to depend on a lot of the particulars though,m5ba698,3.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5b1c8a,None,,5,2025-01-04 04:37:50,,,,Im generally not a huge fan of Bluetooth it can be more finicky to set up than just plugging something in but I will say that once youve got everything connected unless youre like a professional CSGO player it wont matter I literally cant even tell the difference between a wired and wireless mouse Also depending on the mouse full on Bluetooth can actually be faster than wireless to a plugin usb receiver although wired will of course typically be the best,m5aaqoy,3.0,1hsnarn

comment,m56scak,GermanCommentGamer,,210,2025-01-03 14:45:46,,,,Genuine question as I dont know How does this legislation deal with a new better standard coming along Lets say in 5 years USB Xyz is released that is much improved and uses a different form factor How would that be implemented Previously device makers would just switch over except for Apple that is but that is seemingly prohibited now,,0.0,1hsnarn
comment,m56u376,MultiMarcus,,345,2025-01-03 14:55:51,,,,The legislation empowers the commission to take action should a new standard be proposed by standardisation authorities which generally have the larger companies on them Then the legislation can just be rewritten to use a new standard,m56scak,1.0,1hsnarn

comment,m57s2ss,Ajreil,,44,2025-01-03 17:51:22,,,,Does the legislation mention USBC at all I thought it gave the standardization authorities the ability to choose and enforce a standard independently USBC is obviously their choice right now but Im pretty sure the standard can be changed without writing a new law,m56u376,2.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5827rw,realityking89,,67,2025-01-03 18:41:18,,,,USBC and USB PD specifically the respective ENIEC standards are explicitly mentioned But the EU commission is empowered to make changes to this and in fact already has without going through the full legislative process,m57s2ss,3.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5adsoq,valdus,,9,2025-01-04 02:06:44,,,,No all that did was move people from Apple 30Pin to Apple Lightning They made Lightning to be a proprietary connector to take over Thunderbolt and USB so they could make the licensing fees,m5a7l3r,7.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5baxkf,DepthHour1669,,-3,2025-01-04 05:50:38,,,,Or just remember that technology gets obsolete every 510 years and do you REALLY want a law which demands us use floppy disks still sticking around Its pretty obvious that if you just require the USBC law to exist for 5 years supply chains will optimize for it by the end of 5 years and itll be the only thing products use Then you dont need the law anyways Then what You think the next big thing will come easily Imagine if the government mandated CD drives in 1999 I dont mind the legislation I just think youre an idiot if you want any tech hardware legislation not have an expiration date 25 years from now,m5az2u4,8.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5aobj4,MobiusOne_ISAF,,14,2025-01-04 03:11:27,,,,No because theres wont be a new standard until theres an actual need for it The whole point of the legislation is that companies wont randomly switch connectors until USBC cant adequately meet demands 240W with 80 Gbps transfers If that comes up the companies will get together to solve the issue rather than randomly go about making connectors,m5akt0x,5.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5aoqab,None,,-11,2025-01-04 03:13:58,,,,But making a new standard would create a lot of waste The point or so they claim is that this law reduces waste It would be less wasteful to keep an old standard to reduce waste than to innovate right,m5aobj4,6.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5aqw0h,MobiusOne_ISAF,,14,2025-01-04 03:27:27,,,,That why we arent doing that until USBC is unable to complete the job The old standard is USBC were going to be using it for a while The law reduces waste because it stops Apple from wasting time and resources pushing Lightning and codifies the USBC connector so no other company pulls an Apple,m5aoqab,7.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59cyiy,FightOnForUsc,,7,2025-01-03 22:37:50,,,,But who gets to be the standardization authorities There were ways 10 years ago lightening was better than microUSB Yes proprietary But what if some small company invents a better connector Or what if a large company makes a better connector but its proprietary and so the EU just doesnt get the connector I do like USB C everywhere for now but it puts way too much faith into the government organizations being correct IMO,m56u376,2.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59hg9z,atomic1fire,,18,2025-01-03 23:02:24,,,,The USB Implementers forum probably Basically they design new specifications and certify them for release If a newer better spec comes along I assume the EU will just mandate the upgrade That being said I think the USBC stuff should mostly be in the clear until manufacturers literally cant squeeze any more data or power output into the port as is I cant see that happening any time soon because the power and data output are always increasing Something that I dont think was possible with Lightning,m59cyiy,3.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59hx34,FightOnForUsc,,-7,2025-01-03 23:05:00,,,,But who says the next best standard will come from USB Thunderbolt 34 is better than USB and definitely was at the beginning yes admittedly its the same port But even before USB C there was Thunderbolt 2 yes DisplayPort connector There was lightening which was better than microUSB So who is to say that USB will always be the best standard Why cant we all just vote with our wallets and not buy the things that dont have the connectors that are best for us,m59hg9z,4.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59ibu7,atomic1fire,,15,2025-01-03 23:07:17,,,,Its not about what objectively is best its about what works for the majority of consumers MicroUSB was used by the majority of devices until the needs of those devices outweighed them Lightning was used by Apple because MicroUSB wouldnt work for the demands of the Iphone Apple switched over to USBC on macbooks and Ipads before they switched Iphones over and even with the current magnetic connectors Im pretty sure a macbook can still be charged with a usbc cable Im probably not articulating my point well but consumers generally dont like replacing all of their old cables so having some sort of system that doesnt change much is a better approach then requiring a whole new bunch of cables,m59hx34,5.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59im7q,FightOnForUsc,,-10,2025-01-03 23:08:52,,,,Exactly and those choices couldnt be made anymore If USB C doesnt work for a device then what Maybe another connector handles more power Maybe its thinner Then will it change Also it only regulates the plug type but not the implementation specs so it could still have 5 watt charging and usb 20 speeds,m59ibu7,6.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59ww5n,Oerthling,,11,2025-01-04 00:28:58,,,,The EU regulation doesnt say USBC until end of time Itsays there should be a standard so we dont have a zillion different cables and chargers like in the bad olden days of Nokia and BlackBerry phones That standard is USBC for now And that will eventually be replaced by another standard But given that USBC can easily handle everything from Bluetooth earplugs to laptops we should be fine for a number of years Nobody is going to use such a cable to charge their EV,m59im7q,7.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59xo7q,FightOnForUsc,,-7,2025-01-04 00:33:22,,,,Who develops a standard that cant be uptaken without the approval of a regulatory agency one that is especially hostile to US tech companies The lightening plug was more durable slow and proprietary of course are downsides No one would create an open lightening port equivalent if they first go through all the expenses and then the EU says no Bluray vs HD DVD etc have been decided by customers not buy a government mandate,m59ww5n,8.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5a0l4t,Oerthling,,16,2025-01-04 00:49:45,,,,Its not hostile to US tech companies 1 particular US tech company is hostile to interoperability with everybody else including other US companies Everybody else was already standardizing on USBC We used to have a zillion different chargers for every device Customers had no way of controlling that We bought a phone from Nokia BlackBerry or SonyEricson etc and we didnt just get a different charger for every company we got different chargers for different models from the same goddam company Those were the bad times when it comes to cables and charging your devices The differences between lightning and USBC are pretty unimportant Having a common standard OTOH is a good thing In a couple of years even people like you wont remember what the fuss was about Forgot your charger No problem any other charger somebody has lying around will do Thats pretty neat You used a common standard wall plug for all your electrical devices for decades and never worried about it All government regulated how terrible Sadly for historical reasons theres globally half a dozen major variants or so but at least Apple doesnt require you to install an Apple power socket into your wall Itll be fine For many of us it was already fine for years,m59xo7q,9.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5a3u15,FightOnForUsc,,-2,2025-01-04 01:08:19,,,,Its not just hostile to Apple Apple Amazon Google Illumina Mastercard Meta Microsoft and Qualcomm Have all been fined Apple was one of the first to USB C on all their macs I love that iPhone now has USB C but that doesnt mean that it being mandated is the right way to force standards Technologies are created and then people settle on the best one I bet the improvements in connectors over the last 20 years will be much greater than the next 20 years Because before companies kept creating new better connectors and technology Now USB C limits how thin a device could be USB C is fine for now but at some point there could be something better I highly doubt the EU will be the one to create it,m5a0l4t,10.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5a6inl,Oerthling,,7,2025-01-04 01:23:52,,,,Nothing in the regulation forbids future standards You keep arguing like this cements cable and charging technology for the next 50 years But its fairly normal for technology to have a hectic early phase and then things mature Early cables had slow data rates and charging cables were distinct from data cables Starting from shitty low performance and distinct cables there was a need for fast iteration But things have matured in the meantime Modern cables have high data transfer rates and at the same time this has become somewhat irrelevant as people generally prefer to send data wireless And now that the same cable can be used to charge either a small Bluetooth device or an Ultrabook theres just no need to fast iteration of even newer plugs Sure perhaps devices could become even thinner though given screen motherboard and battery and basic stability of a device comes with a minimal thickness for the foreseeable future I dont see an urgent need But doesnt matter when the need arises an industry consortium can provide a new USBZ 31415326 plug for ultrathin devices For now you imagine problems that are unlikely to actually exist,m5a3u15,11.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5a30ef,atomic1fire,,-6,2025-01-04 01:03:39,,,,Personally I dont think a government should be able to demand what devices consumers chose to use with the sole exception of maybe public safety and finite resources such as radio waves It shouldnt kill you or harm you and it shouldnt unnecessarily interfere with other peoples stuff Thats sensible legislation to me That being said Im fine with USBC because it fills the exact same benefit as lightning with the addition that you can always have devices that draw more power or use more data and the connector type wont change In fact I think it would be great if USBC expanded to printers as well since they have such weird ports that are kinda useless otherwise,m59xo7q,9.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5apyjc,atomic1fire,,6,2025-01-04 03:21:38,,,,I mean from the perspective of forcing people to buy new hardware Sure From the perspective of ensuring that the hardware they buy doesnt require 30 different adapters or force them to be locked into specific models Nope USBC is present on everything from phones to computers to game consoles to cameras to the charging case on my bluetooth headphones And because of the way the spec works you can have a cable that has two UsbC ends and it does not matter which way you plug in the cable and which side you plug in the cable Software can denote which device is the parent and which device is the child so you could arguably do a file transfer from phone to phone without needing an OTG cable Plus Thunderbolt and USB are built into the spec so newer versions of products can do things like use displayport support Older USBC cables and plugins may work at a reduced capacity but theyll still charge your phone or other devices so you dont have to throw them away On top of that a 60w charger is going to cover anything that uses USBC charging even if it doesnt need that much wattage,m5akygc,5.0,1hsnarn
comment,m59hngd,say592,,9,2025-01-03 23:03:31,,,,I think part of the idea is to encourage companies to work within the framework of existing standards bodies or at least use the same form factor and ensure backwards compatibility with the existing standards You have to remember that one of the cited reasons for doing this in the first place was to reduce ewaste The EU doesnt want different formfactors,m59cyiy,3.0,1hsnarn

comment,m59tzgd,AMusingMule,,2,2025-01-04 00:12:46,,,,Theres a couple of pins on the USBC connector that need to be connected to specific resistors to ground in order to signal that the device accepts charging otherwise the port could also be something like a charger output Some manufacturers simply swap their old microUSB connectors for USBC connectors connecting the power and data pins on the old connector to the corresponding pins on the new one This still works with AtoC cables as the A side doesnt have any of these special pins CtoC cables dont work with these devices as theres now an ambiguity is this new port a power supplier or a power drawer Some people have fixed these kinds of devices by simply soldering resistors from the CDC lines to ground but manufacturers should really test their products harder,m583lx8,5.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5adrz2,Oerthling,,7,2025-01-04 02:06:37,,,,If a manufacturer produces shit then shit is what you get That has nothing to do with a standard when the standard has a protocol to deal with this Data transfer almost doesnt matter anymore Wifi and 5G is plenty fast for most purposes and people prefer sending the data wirelessly anyway Once in a while Ill use a stick to boot Linux on a laptop Most people wont even do that No doubt there are rare obscure problems But thats irrelevant because its not a relevant argument against having a standard That only means a particular manufacturer needs to produce better devices and fix their mistakes If somebody sells me a shitty product that triggers my breaker when I plug in my coffee machine or whatever Im not going to complain about the standardized power plug Ill complain about the shitty device manufacturer who did a shitty job implementing the standard USBC is not only now coming into use on January 1st Its been around for many years Most recent devices already used it It works Its interoperable We dont need a different charger for every single electronic device anymore Thats a good thing Apple is the only company who was a PITA about this And Spoke just lives to be different Sometimes to keep their garden walked off Somebody just because its on brand to be different They insisted for ages on single button mice to signal that their devices are so much easier Which was complete bullshit You still got the second button functionality for context menus by pressing a key And a zillion Mac users ignored the stupid singlebutton mouse and simply bought an extra regular mouse with 2 buttons This was just Apple being Apple Again the differences between Lightning and USBC are unimportant You can charge either way You can transfer data either way You can transfer data even faster with USBC but again thats not really important in practice as few people will use that feature and even less will notice the speed difference under most circumstances Having a matured universal standard for electronic devices is a good thing And the regulation does not forbid future updates of the standard,m5a63b6,5.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5jw1na,Toby_Forrester,,1,2025-01-05 17:41:37,,,,Were saying the same thing except I added that the microUSB standard was voluntary which was nowhere in your comment My point is that the voluntary aspect was forced by EU with the threat they will make it a law unless the industry voluntarily agree on a standard So it was de facto mandatory even though de jure it was voluntary And it wasnt really that Apple forced EU to adopt USB C as a legal requirement rather EU forced Apple to adopt USB C by making it a law Apple didnt want USB C to be mandatory in their phones EU forced Apple to do this EU was already forcing the industry to agree on a standard but with softer methods than law Those softer methods resulted in micro USB becoming a charging plug standard in EU and contributed to USB C being developed as the successor standard The EU agreement for unofficial standard for micro USB is Memorandum of Understanding from 2009 It was basically an EUinitiated deal with the industry that the industry will have a standard and will develop new standards together so that EU will not need to legislate it This was signed by Apple LG Motorola NEC Nokia Qualcomm Research in Motion RIM Samsung Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments The fact EU later legislated it is a demonstration on how micro USB was not simply voluntary but that it was motivated by the threat of legal regulation And as Apple voluntarily didnt comply with USB C EU forced So the voluntarily was like you will voluntarily eat this food or I will force feed it to you Its a bit silly to say that you ate the food voluntarily then You were forced to eat it yourself And if you refuse to eat it and you are force fed its not you who forced the other one to force feed you,m5jn6ie,11.0,1hsnarn

the cheapest thing For others its pennies Yes it favours larger companies Thats a large money for maybe someone who is making their hobby into a small business That absolutely is a small money to anyone wishing to mass produce consumer electronics for a large market and compete with Samsung Apple and such A company with that aim already would need to have considerable financial backing and 3 500 dollars is a tiny amount Its the cost of a few business trips If a company cannot easily afford 3 500 not even take a loan of that sum does the company even have credible financial basis or a credible product Except within the EU you do have differences in electrical sockets and appliances have to match the socket that is offered by incountry regulations which have to do with several issues including grid compatibility For example the Republic of Ireland uses Type G sockets France uses Type E Both are in the EU Yes and you asked where it is legislated I provided a link as an example of one country And yes there is variation between countries with electric sockets But not variation within countries Theres no socket A for Samsung televisions socket B for LG televisions socket C for Braun kitchen appliances socket D for Philips kitchen appliances and so on Are you sure you want your argument to be that its only a tax if the proceeds are collected and funding directly a governmental entity Are you sure you want your argument to be that if government standardizes something for the sake of consumer benefit it is effectively a tax on those who do not want to comply with the standard Like if there are health standards for restaurants it is effectively a tax for those restaurants which do not want to comply with said health standards I do not understand why would you have to plug both simultaneously I dont have to but as a manufacturer I cannot just assume that no one will try to do it and if they do actually do that how fucked I am How is it an issue The device can simply recognize what power sources are plugged to it and choose which one to use Like phones already can recognize with USB C what power source it is plugged to Yes microUSB was not enshrined because it was replaced by COMPETITION No it was replaced by coordinated agreement and cooperation by the industry pressured by EU USB C wasnt a competitor to micro USB as a charging port It was the industry agreed successor to micro USB as a charging port The EU agreement for unofficial standard for micro USB Memorandum of Understanding from 2009 says this 34 The Signatories note that this MoU should not preclude innovation in the Mobile Phone and EPS markets for example in relation to battery and charging technologies new interfaces multimodal charging capabilities and improved environmental or charging performance Therefore a review process is necessary to adapt this MoU and to address the impact of such changes on the related specifications and standards Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical economic social or environmental perspective This was signed by Apple LG Motorola NEC Nokia Qualcomm Research in Motion RIM Samsung Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments So the 2009 agreement with EU already laid the groundwork for that the industry will develop a successor which would still be a common charger plug Thats why they developed USB C as a charger plug successor to micro USB EU mandated it The industry reviewed their situation and updated their stance in 2013 Letter of Intent to EU which stated The Signatories hereby declare their intention to Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones while considering The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary That minimum geographical area should be the European Union but aiming towards a global reach So mirco USB was not replaced by competition in EU It was replaced by EU mandated cooperation by the industry They developed USB C to meet these requirements so the EU mandated standards development affected the development of USB C Sure the legislation allows room for development except the only companies that will have that room for development will be the ones ruling over the fucking consortium Again every manufacturer is free to have another charger plug in addition to USB C And be honest how much room for innovation do you think there is left for charger plugs USB C can provide 240 watts and thats enough to fully charge a smartphone in less than 10 minutes If some charger plug is faster than this is it really the crucial factor for a major part of consumers Like instead of phone memory storage OS cameras Or with laptops their memory storage graphics card size Or with bluetooth speakers their sound quality portability and such Do you remember how it was in EU before 2009 There was like 30 different charger plugs and no one chose the phone based on what charger plug they had The diversity in charger plugs was only a nuisance for the consumers Hey does anyone have a Nokia charger Sorry I only have the Ericsson wide charger hmm I have Samsung charger Hey I have a Nokia charger but its the small plug Oh that wont do I have the large Nokia plug The competition was just awful for consumers EU had to step in and force companies to agree on a standard and thus micro USB and its successor USB C,m5a8y5b,6.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5k5dhf,Toby_Forrester,,1,2025-01-05 18:25:53,,,,Yes it quite literally is barring the poorest people from accessing the market Consider what it takes to produce devices you need to hire engineers and coders to design the software and hardware All this is also more costly because you have to design the product so that it is in line with legally required safety standards You also need to hire someone to manage the finance and marketing of your product And then you have to pay for the manufacture and logistic distribution of the phone You have to make deals with different sales companies travel around the world So you are saying the USB C cost for device manufacturers is a problem for homeless people people who have to prostitute themselves who have to steal or sell drugs who have to worry day to day how they will feed themselves and their children or can they afford the rent You are saying these people the poorest the homeless the ones prostituting and stealing and selling drugs the ones worrying how to pay their rent and feed their children can afford to set up a company hire engineers and coders to design the software and hardware so that it is in line with legally required safety standards You are saying they can afford to hire hire someone to manage the finance and marketing of their product And then you say they can afford to pay for the manufacture and logistic distribution of the product They afford to make deals with different sales companies travel around the world but 3 500 dollars is too much for them Do you have any idea what the priorities of the poorest people are and what kind of resources they have to run a company producing radio frequency devices Yes and you asked where it is legislated I provided a link as an example of one country Quite literally because you need to have that standardization in order to ensure that all devices are compatible and not going to blow up So you agree there is need for standardization for the benefit of the consumer And the electrical sockets ARE NOT copyrighted nor ruled over by private institutions on the contrary if I want I can create one and pay no one Now that I looked more into it the use of USB C is free for every manufacturer The difference is that you have to pay to have the USB certification and logo And the cost is pretty much just a fee to test that your product is in compliance with USB standard Like you cannot sell a product with USB logo if no one has checked that your product actually works like USB In addition any manufacturer is free to join USB implementers forum for 5000 dollars USB C came around because Apple refused to cheaply sell their lightning connectors and EVENTUALLY USB C showed up And the USB C that you have right now is not even the same USB C you had previously Every time USB is beaten they have to come up with a new standard Now they cannot be beat because theyre the only players USB C is partially based on Apple tech Apple was part of developing USB C And USB C is just the plug Its not the protocol that controls the plug The EU standard concerns the physical plug being used for charging It does not concern about the protocol of data transfer with USB C And no USB C has not been beaten every time in the EU since after micro USB by far the most common and widely used charging plug has been USB C Apple was the only other and it was used only by Apple products Thats the same as me saying Yea all combustion vehicles can still exist as long as they can still be charged with electrical ports No its not since the devices we are talking all use electricity We dont have mobile phones running on combustion engines So its the same as saying yea all EV cars must have this charging port but they can have additional charging ports too Or All gasoline cars must have this kind of gas tank opening to facilitate the common gas nozzle but they can have other kind of gas tanks openings too I do and companies voluntarily adopted better technologies as demand grew for them In the EU no EU in essence forced the companies to agree on a single charging port standard for phones Thus micro USB became the charging port standard in EU Ah yes people sure do complain that we can charge phones in 15 minutes and transferring files through cables doesnt take 3 hours The current charging capabilities of USB C have not come through competition but because of EU mandated cooperation As I quoted the 2009 Memorandum of Understanding said this Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical economic social or environmental perspective And the 2013 Letter of Intent to EU stated this The Signatories hereby declare their intention to Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones while considering The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary That minimum geographical area should be the European Union but aiming towards a global reach So the industry specifically said they aim to develop a new charging plug standard for EU in a way that EU would not need to legislate it They developed USB C But Apple refused to comply so EU made it a law The current capabilities of USB C is not a result of free competition Its the result of cooperation by the industry cooperation which EU mandated Also EU doesnt legislate the data transfer capabilities of USB C so those are irrelevant,m5dtn37,8.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5817wq,Toby_Forrester,,35,2025-01-03 18:36:23,,,,Nothing prevents companies having a better plug alongside USB C Its just that they also need to have USB C But why would they bother since the power capability of USB C is up to 240W and thats far beyond current charging capabilities of phones And you know what also results in innovation Cooperation The EU law clearly states that the industry can develop new better technologies but they must agree on the new standard And ironically thats partially what happened The USB C as such a developed plug is affected by EU pressure Before USB C the unofficial standard for phone plugs was micro USB In 2009 EU pressured phone industry to agree on a phone charging plug standard like agree on a standard or we will make a law about it The industry agreed on micro USB since it was handy to combine a common USB data transfer cable with charging EU also pressured companies to develop the next charging standard together so the industry developed USB C as the next charging standard and as it is also a data cable it would replace other USB ports Like if every phone is going to have the same charging plug any way so why not make it USB C which can also double as a data transfer cable Apple refused to comply with EU so EU triggered their threat and set the standard in law so that Apple has to have USB C But the EU pressure to agree on a standard already 16 years ago did not prevent USB C from being introduced In the opposite it contributed to development of USB C,m57ovlm,2.0,1hsnarn

comment,m57ajho,07budgj,,8,2025-01-03 16:23:42,,,,USB C to C cables are minimum 60w in the spec Not much that can be done when manufacturers dont follow that spec with knockoff cables As far as extensions USB C can go up to 4m if you are just transferring power and are fine being data limited to usb 2 That is more than enough for the vast majority of usecases And if by chance you need to transfer data or power over longer distances there are other standards that do it better Its Universalnot meant to be the best at everything but good enough I agree that the video side is less than ideal Thunderbolt has much more rigid specs but adoption has been poor USB 4 seems like a step in the right direction it balances a better feature set with more open standardsspecs Could it be better Yes Is it far better than what we had before YES,m572dl5,1.0,1hsnarn

comment,m57hhun,101_210,,1,2025-01-03 16:58:42,,,,The power source and charge also negotiate power but the cable impose its limit All usbc connectors include a pub that handles power negociation Otherwise you would overload the cable if you use a 240W power source and sink and a cable rated for 60W leading to a fire hazard The usb team saw that coming and implemented the simple thats the most I can do part in the standard It is not a dumb cable Although as I mentioned usb EXTENTIONS are dumb cable and will set fire to your house if you use a 240 W load supply and usb cable with a 60 W extension or at least overheat,m57f4mg,4.0,1hsnarn

comment,m573hzr,nmarf16,,0,2025-01-03 15:47:19,,,,I suppose thats true but I mention iPhone because thats how this specifically started since apple was the big abuser of unique ports And that is fair although Im not sure if youve seen but usb c chargers for laptops are very sturdy because they have a casing around the plug to prevent wear and tear I totally missed that part regarding laptop changes though I concede that and thanks for pointing that out Like I mentioned a moment ago though usb c chargers for laptops will likely have that casing i mentioned so that they have a similar built to other chargers I personally use one for my work laptop and its been really nice Dell also carries a docking station that has a usb c charger they are pretty much identical in quality Maybe thinking about how much you move a phone vs a laptop could provide some insight on the longevity Hopefully if the usb c laptop policy is a dud theyll find out and have alternatives before its enacted,m572f90,7.0,1hsnarn

comment,m5b1mv5,UpsetKoalaBear,,-2,2025-01-04 04:39:58,,,,This is great but my concern with this is the specificity of USBC Whilst this directive was created in 2022 hence the directive name 20222380 the discussions around this go back to 2014 There was even seeds of this back in 2009 as well This legislation took a decade to be implemented it should have targeted an industry agreed common connector standard via a body like USBIF rather than specifically USBC because if a new connector comes along youd be ending up with the same delay between the cable being introduced and legislation being changed to account for this Considering the amount of proposals in the EU that end up on the back burner for a substantial amount of other relatively minor issues updating the legislation to a new connector is something that might not ever be done quickly Time will tell if it ends up being an issue I dont see USBC being superseded anytime soon for sure it could be that now the mandate is in place it will be far easier for them to change it However it would have removed all speculation all together about that issue if they had just opted to specifically specify a connector standard from the USBIF rather than specifically USBC,,0.0,1hsnarn
comment,m5czrvw,Toby_Forrester,,4,2025-01-04 15:00:37,,,,This legislation took a decade to be implemented Not really Before this legislation EU didnt want to legislate it but to get manufacturers voluntarily agree on a standard The 2009 MoM you linked is specifically this EU pressed voluntary agreement Basically it was EU saying agree on a standard by yourself or we will make it a law That worked for a while but Apple didnt really want to fully commit to it Thats why it was then legislated The legislation didnt take a decade to implement This legislation took a decade to be implemented it should have targeted an industry agreed common connector standard via a body like USBIF rather than specifically USBC because if a new connector comes along youd be ending up with the same delay between the cable being introduced and legislation being changed to account for this But this is how it works The legislation allows EU Commission to update the standard without the full legislative process The directive says It is also necessary to reflect future amendments to labelling requirements such as for charging devices or cables or other technological progress The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should therefore be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending categories or classes of radio equipment and the specifications relating to the charging interfaces and charging communication protocols for each of them and amending the information requirements regarding the charging interfaces and charging communication protocols In other words EU parliament and EU Council delegated the power to update the standard to Commission so theres no need for legislative process to update the standard,m5b1mv5,1.0,1hsnarn

comment,m589sm2,ksilenced-kid,,1,2025-01-03 19:18:09,,,,Part of where I still struggle is USBC itself came along initially outside of being the mandated standard Obviously new standards can potentially develop outside the EU and the EU could then see that like it and adopt it Is the EUs adoption of standards dependent on what the rest of the world does in that case Or is it that go forward manufacturers will take any new standard outside of the mandated USBc to the committee before implementing them to see if the EU would consider adopting that instead and consider it better Or would they have to do a side by side connector for a while on their devices to see if it caught on beyond USBc Any way I can think of innovation occurring here just becomes clunky But maybe Im overthinking it,m587lvn,7.0,1hsnarn
comment,m58g9bi,Toby_Forrester,,2,2025-01-03 19:50:09,,,,Part of where I still struggle is USBC itself came along initially outside of being the mandated standard Yes the industry was developing a new standard for data cables any way We have previous industry standard data cables like USB A which is still very common after like 30 years The EU agreement for unnofficial standard for micro USB Memorandum of Understanding from 2009 says this 34 The Signatories note that this MoU should not preclude innovation in the Mobile Phone and EPS markets for example in relation to battery and charging technologies new interfaces multimodal charging capabilities and improved environmental or charging performance Therefore a review process is necessary to adapt this MoU and to address the impact of such changes on the related specifications and standards Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical economic social or environmental perspective The industry reviewed their situation and updated their stance in 2013 Letter of Intent to EU which stated The Signatories hereby declare their intention to Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones while considering The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary That minimum geographical area should be the European Union but aiming towards a global reach They developed USB C to meet these requirements so the EU mandated standards development affected the development of USB C Is the EUs adoption of standards dependent on what the rest of the world does in that case IIRC yes In the end what EU sets in law is agreed by the industry not solely dictated by EU If the industry decides that in a few years they globally move to USB X because it is better then there is a mechanism in EU law to update this to EU law In a sense USB C was also partially like this USB C wasnt developed as a standard because EU said it specifically should be the next standard It was developed because the industry itself decided it should be the next standard in EU and EU then took this industry proposed standard and set it into law Or is it that go forward manufacturers will take any new standard outside of the mandated USBc to the committee before implementing them to see if the EU would consider adopting that instead and consider it better I believe the EU does not consider standards from individual manufacturers but the industry as a whole A single company cannot say their and only their plug will be the new standard Rather the mechanism is that the standard needs to be suggested by large representation of the industry The EU approach in this is that better standards are developed when companies are forced to cooperate instead of competing with each other Or would they have to do a side by side connector for a while on their devices to see if it caught on beyond USBc Yes a single manufacturer would need to have a side by side solution This is currently the situation with wireless charging While many phones already have wireless charging they are also required to have USB C The USB C standard does not prevent seeing how wireless charging catches up,m589sm2,8.0,1hsnarn

comment,m588k2t,icelandichorsey,,2,2025-01-03 19:12:01,,,,Yes flat ones work And I often need adapter from Switzerland to Spain or Germany because in Switzerland we often have plugs that are 3 prong and you cant handle that in the rest of Europe So it is a real issue,m5872qn,4.0,1hsnarn

comment,m58fmm1,Osoroshii,,1,2025-01-03 19:47:03,,,,If you are in France or Poland they use Type E If you go over to UK Or Ireland youll need Type G Switzerland stands alone in using Type J while only Italy uses Type L Type A two flats with no ground is the most common used plug This is used by China and the United States If the EU is serious about reducing electrical waste they would standardize their outlets as well,m58272f,2.0,1hsnarn
comment,m58woeo,PM_ME_HOT_FURRIES,,4,2025-01-03 21:13:44,,,,Switzerland and the UK are not in the EU France and Poland uses CEE 75 sockets Type E sockets Germany and most of the rest of Europe uses CEE 73 socket Type F Schuko sockets And in Italy they use Type L sockets but actually modern builds have more universal sockets But as for Plugs both The Type E countries and Type F countries allow for use of CEE 77 plugs which fit in Type E and Type F sockets and provide a ground connection And for ungrounded connections there is CEE 716 Alternative II Type C Europlug which fits in Type E sockets Type F sockets Type L Danish Type K Israeli Type H sockets and UK shaver sockets which will only supply up to 200 mA China uses Type I and Type A both of which are incompatible but the sockets to fit the type A plug can often also take a Europlug But heres the silly part The US and Japan uses Type A at 110V while China uses Type A at 220 V so if you stick your 110V US appliance into a Chinese socket you might fry it China probably shouldnt support Type A plugs on that basis You say Type A is the most common used plug Do you have a citation for that In summary plugwise in the EU Europlug is the standard for lowpower doubleinsulated appliances and CEE 77 is approaching the standard for earthed connections with only a few holdouts,m58fmm1,3.0,1hsnarn
