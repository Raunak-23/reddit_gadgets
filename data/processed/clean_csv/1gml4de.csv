post,1gml4de,a_Ninja_b0y,TSMC will stop making 7 nm chips for Chinese customers,1209,2024-11-08 15:27:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1gml4de/tsmc_will_stop_making_7_nm_chips_for_chinese/,116.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,lw3fvgg,invent_or_die,,279,2024-11-08 15:50:07,,,,Oh but only ASML has the expertise to make 7nm and smaller fabs and the USA wont allow any exports to China by ASML of the high end equipment China is a long long way from recreating this technology ASML is allowed to sell older tech to China,,0.0,1gml4de
comment,lw4ghhx,voidvector,,142,2024-11-08 18:47:37,,,,China already make 7nm from ASML equipment ASML was only blocked on selling EUV equipment to China ASML has been selling China billion dollars worth of DUV machines 7nm is the lowest achievable for DUV,lw3fvgg,1.0,1gml4de
comment,lw4q2rk,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,79,2024-11-08 19:35:11,,,,10nm is the lowest achievable at a cost that makes sense at scale 5nm is the lowest theoretically achievable outright 7nm is where they have got down to so far and its already only possible with subsidies,lw4ghhx,2.0,1gml4de
comment,lw5me14,danielv123,,26,2024-11-08 22:20:44,,,,I mean considering they now have no alternative for 7nm production I guess subsidies arent needed anymore the cost is just what it is,lw4q2rk,3.0,1gml4de
comment,lw6kit3,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,10,2024-11-09 01:37:51,,,,In most cases it will make more sense to produce 10nm chips and just make more of them The time it takes a DUV machine to produce a 7nm wafer is literally double what it is for 10nm and the chips are a nowhere near twice as fast 7nm is mostly a propaganda exercise for China hence the subsidies,lw5me14,4.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9ke9x,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 16:25:44,,,,For some applications it still makes sense to produce 7nm at an inefficient cost because of application requires it Like phones and car AI chips which have calculation speed requirements,lw6kit3,5.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9ko94,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 16:27:10,,,,Phones yes laptops too Probably not datacenter AI chips though The total computation you can get out of the fab is maximised at 10nm At 7nm youre trading off less total compute due to much lower production rates for better power efficiency,ly9ke9x,6.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9mdfr,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 16:35:58,,,,Chinese EVs are designing their own compute chips to replace Nvidia Orins Just wondering if they can source it domestically Sounds like they can just at a higher cost than Taiwan foundries,ly9ko94,7.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9mtqm,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 16:38:20,,,,Tesla and Waymo have both realised that our previous estimates for the compute needed to make self driving work were way too low Its really out of the reach of even a 7nm based system barring some massive unforseen software optimisation advancements,ly9mdfr,8.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9o8vq,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 16:45:34,,,,Only if you design it like a large E2E model I think you need to split off the tasks into a large number of models It can still be E2E just smaller models handling each part of inference work Then you can just have more chips Chinas ADAS leader XPeng just said in their AI day they estimate 3000 TOPS is required for L4 robotaxi They are moving away from Nvidia because Orins are general purpose not optimized for NNs Sounds like they are planning to put a large number of chips into their robotaxi,ly9mtqm,9.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9pkmy,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 16:52:14,,,,Both Tesla and Waymo already design and use their own dedicated AI chips to go alongside andor replace the Nvidia ones The Waymo system in particular is hideously expensive using tons of chips that pull several kilowatts altogether and like I said even thats not enough 3000 TOPS is required for L4 robotaxi Not great when their competitors are targeting L5 and its generally agreed by the industry that anything other than L2 and L5 is just not safe,ly9o8vq,10.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9x5hv,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 17:29:59,,,,Waymo is really L4 though Remote operators can help out stuck units If you get good enough in L4 it would take far less operators than vehicles L5 I doubt Waymo plans to get rid of their remote helpers Probably needs road sensors as an infrastructure to get to true L5,ly9pkmy,11.0,1gml4de
comment,ly9ywk6,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 17:38:38,,,,Waymo is L4 because they still dont have the compute to make L5 happen Tesla think they can get there by 20262027 and my guess is Waymo will be similar All of that is dependent on large amounts of sub2nm silicon China just cant compete,ly9x5hv,12.0,1gml4de
comment,lya4z8o,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 18:08:16,,,,Well see Tesla has been trying to get FSD into China with regulator support Because Elon is very popular there It is failing to get through basic tests XPeng and Huawei are excellent ADAS systems already arguably closest to L4 without geofenced lidar mapping like Waymo and Baidu One advantage to Chinese is that the sanctions are porous They have no problem accessing H100 for training For onboard inference is 2nm really going to make a difference It might not matter because you are reacting to events in real time Having a 2nm just means you can stack bigger models but bigger models can mean slower reactions,ly9ywk6,13.0,1gml4de
comment,lya5sh8,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 18:12:18,,,,For L5 absolutely everything has to be in the vehicle You cant rely on any remote computation because it has to remain functional in the event of a connection outage Even if you assume the connection is flawless it still doesnt work because you cant go in a tunnel,lya4z8o,14.0,1gml4de
comment,lya7x1v,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 18:22:55,,,,For AI you have a training datacenter usually H100s nowadays When you have trained a working model you load it onto the vehicle So there are two separate chips when it comes to ADAS training versus inference,lya5sh8,15.0,1gml4de
comment,lya83m5,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 18:23:50,,,,Yea and the ADAS chips we currently have are not strong enough to run a model of the size needed Still going in circles,lya7x1v,16.0,1gml4de
comment,lya5woc,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 18:12:53,,,,bigger models can mean slower reactions Which is why you need exponentially faster chips Youre so close to getting it lol,lya4z8o,14.0,1gml4de
comment,lya7h8g,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 18:20:44,,,,Or you can achieve speed by having smaller models Im not convinced stacking bigger and bigger models can achieve higher intelligence Or wed be seeing GPT6 by now Instead the smaller models are improving at a much faster pace Despite the enormous compute advantages US holds the LLM model capabilities between US and Chinese ones are pretty close necktoneck essentially,lya5woc,15.0,1gml4de
comment,lya7xle,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 18:23:00,,,,You stack small models into lots of smaller expensive chips or a large model that actually works into a smaller number of larger expensive chips The models currently in use are plenty fast enough reacting and they just arent big enough to do complete L5 and remember thats already using chips much stronger than China can produce Bigger models are just necessary and theres no getting around that,lya7h8g,16.0,1gml4de
comment,lya8pmw,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,0,2024-11-21 18:26:54,,,,Agree to disagree Bigger models have flaws too that they are much more difficult to train If a model does one aspect out of a thousand ADAS tasks incorrectly theres no way to selectively fix the flaw in a large model More training can easily fix that one aspect then break a different one More smaller models is the path forward not bigger models,lya7xle,17.0,1gml4de
comment,lya8wdb,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-21 18:27:50,,,,You can agree to disagree with the entire trillion dollar industry of millions of researchers working on this problem then,lya8pmw,18.0,1gml4de
comment,lyaaewh,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 18:35:23,,,,That is not an equivalent statement though I was saying ADAS problem specifically needs to be broken down to smaller models because it is a realtime problem If GPT doesnt answer you in time or it makes a mistake and hallucinates an answer you dont die And the dimensions of the problem is exponentially more complex than a language model problem LLM is at the core a creative problem Language itself by design have a contextual relationship ADAS is a precision accuracy and speed problem The fact you have to turn right to avoid death is not at all contextually related to how you were driving 2 seconds before,lya8wdb,19.0,1gml4de
comment,lyabwbw,RockyCreamNHotSauce,,1,2024-11-21 18:42:48,,,,And you can be sure out of the trillion dollar industry The majority will be fluff to get rich out of a phenomenon without true scientific understanding of the technology And thats fine because it is how we progress The real AI breakthrough recently was AlphaFold that can map a protein structure quickly when it took years of research before ChatGPT was not the real breakthrough A dozen almost as good chat bots launched just months after Wheres GPT5 I give it 60 chance OpenAI is not going to give us anything interesting,lya8wdb,19.0,1gml4de
comment,lw95pu7,CASyHD,,0,2024-11-09 14:42:06,,,,You do know that for example the newest Huawei Phone uses Chinese made 7nm Chips,lw6kit3,5.0,1gml4de
comment,lw95vpn,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,0,2024-11-09 14:43:06,,,,Yes those are heavily subsidised by the Chinese government and also if theres any place where those expensive to produce chips could make sense its in a high end phone The compute you can get out of the fab is a lot lower but the chips are still more power efficient,lw95pu7,6.0,1gml4de
comment,lw9f8lx,shot_ethics,,0,2024-11-09 15:37:40,,,,Even if the compute flops per hour of fab machine time is worse with 7 nm surely the power efficiency is better Seems like 7 nm is the better choice for mobile,lw95vpn,7.0,1gml4de
comment,lw9g446,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2024-11-09 15:42:34,,,,At the high end yes but think about it personally would you pay double the price for a phone thats 20 faster with the same battery,lw9f8lx,8.0,1gml4de
comment,lwcu3fg,shot_ethics,,1,2024-11-10 03:15:08,,,,Its the processor price not the whole phone price The cost of the processor has been estimated to be about 50 dollars using the 3 nm process The processor is about ten percent of the total cost You could reduce to 23 percent with a 10 nm process but IMO not worth both the speed and the power utilization,lw9g446,9.0,1gml4de
comment,lw716gd,tacosforpresident,,2,2024-11-09 03:22:32,,,,Cost isnt a factor to China when theyre doing AI regressions for state needs If they need the performance and can get the process to 5nm then theyll be running at 5nm,lw4q2rk,3.0,1gml4de
comment,lw71hxk,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,9,2024-11-09 03:24:42,,,,Cost is always a factor saying its not is just a misunderstanding of what cost even is The total compute you can get out of a DUV fab is much higher making 10nm chips than it is making 7nm or 5nm Datacenter AI is not at all the place theyd want to push past 10nm Its pretty much exclusively high end phones and laptops that really benefit to that extent from the smallest possible node,lw716gd,4.0,1gml4de

comment,lw59xwc,invent_or_die,,0,2024-11-08 21:15:37,,,,Yes but no more spare parts for DUV,lw4ghhx,2.0,1gml4de
comment,lw5gqtv,your-move-creep,,8,2024-11-08 21:50:55,,,,But China stock piled on DUV They will not need spare parts for another decade or so Theyre estimated to have about 300 DUV equipments,lw59xwc,3.0,1gml4de
comment,lw7oqsg,M0therN4ture,,-1,2024-11-09 06:31:03,,,,Kind of But the DUV 7nm is just a fancy term for 10nm with some adaptation on the DUV machine to mimic EUV 7nm Its nowhere close an actual EUV 7nm chip,lw4ghhx,2.0,1gml4de

comment,lw4gds2,triklyn,,27,2024-11-08 18:47:07,,,,at a certain point you must surely realize that geopolitics is essentially a giant game of extortion and barely concealed threats no talk about international law when push comes to shove the dutch company might rebel from enacting US foreign policy but will the dutch government how about the consumer countries that the US might convince to take an unfriendly view of the company not playing ball the US is the prime mover in geopolitics because it has the biggest guns and one of the largest economies in the world and those facts reinforce each other to maintain it that way,lw47umc,4.0,1gml4de

comment,lw3umho,trainbrain27,,51,2024-11-08 17:01:28,,,,For comparison iPhones use 3nm chips and China can make 7nm and even some 5nm but it costs much more The only company that makes the Extreme UltraViolet lithography machines that make the chips is Dutch and they will not sell to China Once the ones already in China fail they probably cant make any more 7nm chips,,0.0,1gml4de

comment,lw3jy5u,None,,121,2024-11-08 16:10:04,,,,China has been trying to develop their own advanced fabs for decades The only way youll get advanced fabs currently is EUV tech made by ASML who is currently not selling to them The machinery that ASML produces is so complex that their services after delivery is their most important selling point These end companies are getting help from the direct engineers who built and modeled these projects for the past 3040 years Even if China gets a piece of this tech from them the engineers will not help them China will have to sink billions upon billions of dollars in education and RD for the production of advanced chip making,lw3eibv,1.0,1gml4de
comment,lw48xkt,-ChrisBlue-,,19,2024-11-08 18:10:45,,,,The way it was explained to me was that currently the US strategy is to knock out a tiny piece of chip manufacturing for the chinese Than the chinese push all their efforts to fill in that one hole either with work arounds or developing the technology Once China figures out the work around the US knock out another tiny piece The end results is the best possible set of training wheels for Chinese designers This is in opposition to just pushing over the entire house of cards US banning all chip tech to China or not doing anything and let them start from the base of the mountain of superior imports,lw3jy5u,2.0,1gml4de

comment,lw3go6k,manamara1,,18,2024-11-08 15:54:02,,,,China will develop sooner or later Probably sooner irrespective of any ban The key is encouraging the development ecosystem in the west This ecosystem was outsourced and will a challenge to reintroduce Saw a documentary on the US going to Korea to encourage shipbuilders to assist the US build navy ships The outsourcing overtime has reduced the ecosystem for industry in multiple fields,lw3eibv,1.0,1gml4de
comment,lw61vkf,AbsoluteZeroUnit,,1,2024-11-08 23:47:55,,,,As opposed to what Just letting them have it Are you thinking of some scenario where there is a US advantage that lasts forever If you cant ensure that youll stay at 1 forever the best thing you can do is at least make it harder for others to catch up,lw3eibv,1.0,1gml4de
comment,lw3fu2d,Woodworkin101,,-9,2024-11-08 15:49:56,,,,We should give China as little tech as possible and make them spend their own time on making it while we improve it That is how we can stay ahead of them,lw3eibv,1.0,1gml4de

comment,lw4gwxb,CanadianLynx,,-2,2024-11-08 18:49:45,,,,It doesnt matter when China inevitably catches up and surpasses TSMC The US and the west will just slap on tariffs like they are doing to the more advanced Chinese EVs It was never about the free market it was about protecting corporate interests,,0.0,1gml4de

comment,lw4zud6,CanadianLynx,,13,2024-11-08 20:24:33,,,,TSMC has a de facto monopoly on advanced microprocessors how is protecting them from foreign competition beneficial to the free market If anything this is a textbook case of protectionism and will undoubtedly lead to higher costs for both Western and Chinese consumers The greater implication is that the US is using TMSC as a proxy in its trade war with China,lw4q9qu,2.0,1gml4de
