comment,ma7fn0c,None,,21,2025-01-31 15:15:33,,,,I installed an emulator on the school network decades ago it honestly took way longer for them to catch on than it shouldve but I remember I got busted during keyboarding class because no one was doing work we were all just playing multiplayer Bomberman I think they just assumed it had to be me and I was a kid so I caved They were talking about the mountains of different trouble I was in how Id never touch a computer in the district once they removed it blah blah blah Then I told them theyd never be able to They were like wut And I explained that it was actually all over the network hidden files in other hidden files in case I got caught and because different computers had different permissions and theyd never find all of the redundancies even if they tried They let me remove it all I got in zero trouble and was never banned from the computers,ma6icz9,3.0,1ie5mhe
comment,ma9g09m,Bassman233,,10,2025-01-31 20:56:15,,,,When our business classroomcomputer lab got networked Windows PCs they setup logins for the whole student body and faculty that were on default passwords that followed a pattern like last name first initial or something else generic IDK it was 30years ago Everyone was told to change their passwords when they logged in but several of us realized that a bunch of people would rarelynever be in there so we logged in as various teachers and other students and immediately changed their passwords then logged off and got on our own accounts When any of us finished an assignment wed log off our own account and explore this new internet thing on someone elses account Sooner or later someone managed to break the network with something they downloaded but as far as I know they never figured out who This would have been Windows 31 or maybe NT so network security was a pretty unknown thing for most people back then,ma7fn0c,4.0,1ie5mhe

comment,ma8i10a,throwawaybrowsing888,,2,2025-01-31 18:16:13,,,,Yeah dude And what good does it do for me to worry about it We pass along the info to people who need to be aware of it especially to those can actually do something about it Thats sometimes all we can do And if were going to get through this without burning out were going to need to grapple with the fact that were limited and powerless in some ways We gotta empower who we can when we can hold them accountable ifwhen they fail us look out for those most affected by these issues and keep ourselves sane so we dont get emotionally dragged down by every horrific news story that will inevitably pop up in our feed,ma8ckp5,3.0,1ie5mhe
comment,magodun,benyahweh,,3,2025-02-01 23:46:58,,,,It might be time for you to take a break from the news Youre right it doesnt do you or anyone else any good to worry about things while feeling limited and powerless The utility of journalism and discussions about current issues is not to cause worry but to inform society so that we can make informed decisions hold people accountable expose corruption and so on In truth we arent powerless Weve been made to feel powerless We arent limited either But we have been made to feel like theres nothing we can do Everyone has got to look out for their stress and mental health and occasionally take a step back get some fresh air or whatever else it may be that grounds you,ma8i10a,4.0,1ie5mhe
comment,maibhw2,throwawaybrowsing888,,1,2025-02-02 05:35:42,,,,I dont feel powerless though Im not worried about the current situation Im extremely aware of how bad things can get and Im not getting overwhelmed at all For each new piece of horrific news I cant help but react like yep Ok Well Got a mental note of that Moving on This shit is all too familiar to me I grew up with abusive family members who would be physically violent if I were to try to stand up to them or escape in the wrong way I only escaped because I learned their patterns and adapted to them Its the same patterns Im seeing now Were still living at the mercy of the people in charge and although we are not completely powerless we have to reckon with the fact that these people will without a doubt in my mind try to erode our sense of autonomy And with the ways that these attempts are going to inevitably traumatize our peers and allies were also going to have to learn how to distinguish between learned helplessness and self awareness of our own limitations,magodun,5.0,1ie5mhe
comment,malu4qh,benyahweh,,2,2025-02-02 19:33:18,,,,Okay my friend thats my bad then Im glad to hear youre not overly stressed about the ongoing situation happening in this country Im sure many are feeling that way as I myself feel the effects of this stress on top of the pressures of regular daily life and have at times had to take a step back So maybe Im projecting that a bit my apologies for that Im sorry for what you had to endure growing up Everyone deserves to be loved and supported but unfortunately that ideal is not the reality for far too many children still today I completely agree with the parallels youve described between abusive power dynamics and the authoritarian regime were currently under I know I sound naive but I feel that we must come together and find our strength in numbers I dont know what it will take for Americans to organize and unite against this but that is our power as everyone well knows,maibhw2,6.0,1ie5mhe
comment,manbv9w,throwawaybrowsing888,,2,2025-02-03 00:01:30,,,,No worries I get it The self reflection is much appreciated and rarely encountered so thank you I dont think its naive to feel that we must come together in large numbers Thats exactly what we have to do But we have to do it in certain ways that I dont know if were prepared for Were all so spread out in the country and so little can be done to organize on such as massive scale Thats part of why this has become such a stressful situation for many its easy to feel powerless when were so far removed from any opportunities to make wide scale change But the key is to try to find the things that we can change in positive ways and to empower others to do the same We can still influence each others in the little nooks and crannies of our everyday lives Its in those small moments that we will be able to retain our hope and sanity We might be able to only make small changes and we will definitely not see the impacts for a long time if ever But our alternative is acquiescence to the pressure of hopelessness that were being crushed under Its far too easy but also understandable to throw up our hands and say there is no way I can change anything on a grand scale so I wont try What we need is for everyone to learn how to accept edit but not excuse the things that are out of their hands despite how unfair and unjust it is then roll up their sleeves and get to work on the things they can do But that is way easier said than done,malu4qh,7.0,1ie5mhe

comment,ma61ygj,_RADIANTSUN_,,16,2025-01-31 09:08:49,,,,Yea the reason this makes me concerned is that for this one thing that got caught there are probably 20 that didnt and tomorrow they will just learn from this one Maybe the devices dont ping any IP address until at least 6 months after being turned on and then only do it randomly of something or maybe not at all as they await some condition to be met etc Stuff like this which is basically caught by 1st line of defence methods is probably the least sophisticated of what is on offer,ma5g5xg,1.0,1ie5mhe

comment,ma61dlh,--Arete,,52,2025-01-31 09:02:39,,,,This is extremely serious Although a device like this is not the only way to monitor a patient the risk is that the monitor displays the wrong data We tend to rely on the data we have available The worst case scenario is not that the monitor is shut down or stops working The real danger is if someone manipulates the data making it seem like the patient is in a different state This could potentially lead to the wrong treatment and ultimately death or severe injury or illnesses,,0.0,1ie5mhe
comment,ma80hw4,nodtomod,,15,2025-01-31 16:54:56,,,,Whilst youre right Im not really sure thats of particular interest to China I think the bigger risk is that in a war scenario China has direct access to a hospital network which they could hit with an attack to disable or significantly cripple this hospital and potentially many others Its this kind of widespread chaos across many industries which would do significant damage to the country and affect national response,ma61dlh,1.0,1ie5mhe

comment,mako2kn,KrackSmellin,,1,2025-02-02 16:20:36,,,,Youre sadly mistaken and part of the problem to not see why this is relevant Ive seen way to many companies and Ill throw medical providers into the mix have it that a compromised system can wreak absolute havoc and cause a data breach by exploiting a single system and spread from there But lets ignore that for now and talk about the ICU device monitoring my vitals Given it needs to be smarter than just a beeping machine they typically are tied to a patient and have information about the patient name ID access to post the data somewhere etc So the data is no longer just anonymous data being sent but potentially all your info now as well So why care Well lets say data gets out there andor is a breach of the company thats collecting it that isnt HIPPA certified because its being hosted unknowingly in a location that isnt as secure seen this more times than you can imagine Now additional data about you is being exposed without your consent or knowledge and who knows how much of that data is now exposed or what The whole hiding by obscurity because of all our data being out there isnt as obscure as you realize So now my patient info is out there maybe the last 4 of my social a patient ID DOB the doctor I see etc nothing stopping someone from contacting a healthcare provider to get even more information about me from the provider given Ill have most the info to reach out Maybe even get access to online systems with the questions they would ask to sign up But lets just be ignorant and figure we are good because we dont understand the implications and as a result figure if we dont see or hear about things it wont impact you,mak08nt,2.0,1ie5mhe

comment,mal4l00,KrackSmellin,,1,2025-02-02 17:38:18,,,,But again thats NOT how Medical industry is geared given HIPPA this has nothing to do with social media or what Im EXPECTING is a company protecting my data GDPR is an amazing thing for those in Europe because they can slap the ever loving hell out of a company with fines which makes them realize they now need to do better and protect their systems even more or pay an EXORBITANT price in fees and fines,makz5pa,4.0,1ie5mhe
