comment,mptrlsc,qa3rfqwef,,2,2025-04-30 12:08:40,,,,Definitely like that Kaleid Flux design and colour I think my only gripeif you can even call it thatis that Im not a huge fan of translucent controllers which most of them including my own seem to be I get that its for the RGB effect but since I care little for that Id prefer a version without it,mpt57d9,5.0,1kb7h2n
comment,mpu16j3,burningicecube,,3,2025-04-30 13:07:05,,,,How are the ergonomics of the Cyclone 2 I find the base Xbox controller too cramped I havent used an Elite but I read its bigger is the Cyclone similar,mpsy12o,4.0,1kb7h2n
comment,mpu8xun,qa3rfqwef,,3,2025-04-30 13:50:07,,,,The Cyclone 2 is about the same size as a base Xbox controllerso no luck there The Elite v1 does feel a tiny bit bigger mostly because the shoulder and trigger buttons are raised higher off the body and the grips are a little thicker overall Its basically just a bit more bulbous That said I cant really recommend the Elite due to how shoddy the build quality is Despite pretty light usage Ive had to replace the hand grips and thumbsticks after they started falling apart Another thing that doesnt get mentioned enough with controllers is how the face buttons often feel loose I hate that a button can lose contact just from slightly shifting my thumb or easing up on the pressure without actually lifting off the button every official Xbox controller Ive used has this issue Ive taken mine apart several times to clean the contacts but it never quite feels right Im not going back to anything that doesnt use microswitches and hall effect sticks,mpu16j3,5.0,1kb7h2n

comment,mpsuqfu,BassheadGamer,,5,2025-04-30 07:01:40,,,,I had QC issues on 3 controllers I bought their Xbox collab controllers when they released to try them out see what the deal with Hall effect is and didnt want to buy a controller I could only use on pc I tried the ultimate wired and ultimate c My first ultimate c had a trigger just randomly stop a month and a week after purchase Support was no help and told me to seek return via Amazon Amazon said talk to 8bitdo support Just bought another and returned defective 2nd ultimate c had a weird issue tied to software It wasnt a software bug The triggers could not be set to a value lower than 10 without them bugging out in game If I had them set to 11 no prob Small issue but i still returned 3rd ultimate c has had no issues so far about a year after purchase Ive only had to recalibrate once I also My first ultimate c had really nasty buttons that would scrape Like the plastic mold was defective and a bumper had no tactile response but still showed input Instantly retuned and have had no issues a year after purchase I use the ultimate wired as my main I mainly play fps The only reason I kept the ultimate c was because I enjoy playing rhythm games with it Clone hero and fortnite festival feel so good with the ultimate c over the ultimate wired The software is alright it works I only use it on console and save profiles to carry over to pc The software on pc looks sketch The ultimate c had lighting bugs that were later fixed via update Calibrating the ultimate wired is great you do through the app and theres visuals Triggers and joysticks 4 profiles The ultimate c on the other hand is weird to calibrate The documentation doesnt show how to and I had to look it up It also has you calibrate the triggers and joysticks at the same time with no visuals or any indication it has completed a calibration step It has no app support aside from updates One weird bug on both is that on Xbox I cant select the mute mic option via the Xbox menu Since the ultimate wired has a mute switch and when I play festivalclone hero I dont use a mic it doesnt bother me but its soemthing to note I dont notice a big difference in stick accuracy vs the first party Xbox controllers tbh And Ive never had a stick drift issue since xb1 onwards even though I play a lot of fps Ny 2 controllers since 2013 Ive broken have been because I dropped them and the triggerbumper have gotten damaged What I thought was no drift on the first party Xbox controller was just a forgiving deadzone Being able to set it to 0100 with no deadzone is weird at first Very responsive The deadzone on the Xbox cons feels like 20 on the 8bitdo I wont go back to controllers without this customization though Trigger and joystick deadzone options inapp calibration and profiles Hall effect or tmr joysticks triggers and micro switch buttons,mpsb558,2.0,1kb7h2n
comment,mpw2mam,SmokingEuclid,,2,2025-04-30 19:10:45,,,,I feel like Im the only one on the planet that doesnt like them that much Maybe I got a bad batch because the buttons were WAY too mushy My Xbox buttons were too clicky but the 8bitdo felt like I wasnt clicking buttons at all But the other thing is the controller feels too narrow Compared to the Xbox I feel like I have to hold my elbows closer to my body to hold it Ive really wanted one of the Flydigi Apex or Vader controllers but I dont play competitive games so I dont need a lot of the features Ill probably get one of those when my Xbox controller gets stick drift,mpsb558,2.0,1kb7h2n

comment,mpwdhgj,Reesespeanuts,,-3,2025-04-30 20:03:44,,,,Im just curious why cant these things be built anywhere else but China Is it the slave labor and low wages what is it The US has become so dependent on China that its just truly sad to see If businesses cant build stuff in China they virtually cripple under markets its the Achilles heel of virtually every American business Americans sold their manufacturing jobs to China for cheap goods and now Americans are selling their service jobs to IndiaPhilippines and AI what is left,,0.0,1kb7h2n
comment,mpxy3wb,Programmdude,,2,2025-05-01 01:07:44,,,,Partly the low wages the slave labour in china hardly seems worse than the slave labour in the US But also partly because all the expertise and raw materials are also already there Some other countries India Vietnam etc could and are manufacture some stuff instead but that wont bring it into the US Some stuff is going to take decades to build up factories the skill required and thats assuming companies even bother due to the increased cost of running businesses in the US It also doesnt help when all the factory tools raw resources are tariffed just as much as the finished goods If you want to bring manufacturing jobs into the US you need the carrot to encourage factory building and training and the stick to tariff finished products but not the raw resourcestools that the factories use And finally have everyone be prepared to pay 23x as much because of the increased cost of manufacturing,mpwdhgj,1.0,1kb7h2n

comment,mpsi6g4,xmod3563,,-2,2025-04-30 05:06:29,,,,For Ultimate 2C the controllers of a specific color are all set on the exact same channel on 24Ghz So if you buy 3 green controllers guess what Only 1 can connect to the PC at a time How do I know they are all using the same channel on 24Ghz 1 only one controller would connect at a time and 2 the damn USB dongle doesnt even have a button to resync it with a controller With EasySMX controllers you can buy 4 controllers of the same color and connect all 4 at the same time because the USB dongle actually has a resync button and the controller and USB dongle handshake to find a good channel on 24Ghz,mpscv85,2.0,1kb7h2n

comment,mpt2ldo,xmod3563,,-1,2025-04-30 08:24:21,,,,Probably because playing local multiplayer on PC is pretty rare Most of the times when people buy these controllers for PC they just buy one Anyways I bought 2 gaming laptops one for my gfs son and another for my gfs nephews they live in Vietnam And I bought 8 of these controllers 4 one color 4 another color The dongles connected through a USB 20 hub 30 has this design flaw that interferes with 24Ghz I found this out major flaw in the controller while testing them out They got returned rather quickly,mpst41t,4.0,1kb7h2n

comment,mpuicuk,dark_sylinc,,8,2025-04-30 14:38:22,,,,There are import costs transport custom fees besides tariffs storage space fees while filling paperwork storage fees marketing fees postsale costs eg salestech support warranty dealing with IRS paperwork etc To make it worse the regulation is changing on a daily basis When it takes you like 3 days to figure out how much you have to charge customers you realize you were selling at a loss for the last 3 days if tariffs go up by another 80 that doesnt mean the product will go exactly 80 up It can be more or in a few cases less And you have to consider things like the prices that you announced on ads which are now outdated but due to consumer laws you cant change it overnight Or else youre breaking consumer laws When you get all that trouble just to sell three of these because no one else will buy it at that price you decide its not the worth it If someone wants it really that much that one guy can import the device as a consumer import and let him deal with the madness himself,mptu243,1.0,1kb7h2n
