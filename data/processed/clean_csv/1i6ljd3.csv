comment,m8h26ao,guyincognito121,,1,2025-01-22 03:11:43,,,,Limit your charge to 80 there are settings that will do this for you and try not to discharge below 25 Also minimize use of fast and especially super fast chargers,m8exoqp,6.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8hmppo,unripenedfruit,,6,2025-01-22 05:23:07,,,,Ive been doing that with my s23u since day 1 basically It may prolong battery health but it wont make it last forever My battery doesnt last a full day anymore and if I know Ill be out and about with heavy phone use taking lots of photos etc I basically need to charge it to 100 at the start of the day now The reality is batteries degrade and there isnt much that can be done about it Aside from making them easily replaceable again,m8h26ao,7.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8hrltz,guyincognito121,,-1,2025-01-22 06:01:09,,,,But did you really actually prevent it from going below 25 consistently Or did you do what pretty much everyone does and throw it on the super fast charger when it hit 15 and the alarm went off Im a data scientist at a medical device company and have compiled analyses of extensive testing of hundreds of lithium ion batteries The steps I described make a huge difference in battery longevity,m8hmppo,8.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fmwn3,jeepsaintchaos,,4,2025-01-21 22:41:19,,,,I do I have a Ulephone that has a fucking massive battery and I only charge it every 3 days I can use it as a power bank for other phones and stuff too Huge speaker and damned near unbreakable as a phone I throw it sometimes for fun and have gone swimming with it too Underwater music is fun and I love the flashlight mounted on top Has one for the camera too 9600mah battery I think The phone is kinda slow and the Duraspeed app kills my important background processes like a blood sugar app and Spotify Its also massive and heavy but thats part of the rugged phone I dont say this to be a shill and Im looking into replacement options for the phone because of the Duraspeed and the battery isnt as good as it was new Im looking at Blackview next because I miss my CAT thermal camera although the rest of the CAT phone was shit TlDr you can absolutely have the battery you want,m8edd3q,5.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8h1set,guyincognito121,,1,2025-01-22 03:09:32,,,,This is more of a consumer issue Batteries now have a lot more capacity than batteries from five years ago and components and software are more efficient It would be entirely feasible too make a reasonably priced phone with performance equivalent to that of five years ago but the kind of battery life your talking about You could also make a similar phone that has virtually infinite battery longevity ie the capacity doesnt drain over time so you never need to replace it by using a modern battery but preventing it from ever charging above 75 or discharging below 25 It would need to be recharged daily since youre only actually using half of the stored charge but it wouldnt degrade over time,m8edd3q,5.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fqpua,NickCharlesYT,,7,2025-01-21 23:00:08,,,,The thing that usually gets me is memory When apps start closing on me 5 seconds after I leave them thats a signIts actually worse on iPhone but by the time this starts happening it makes EVERYTHING that much slower to get done because Im constantly losing context or progress on one thing or another To me my phone is a tool and when that tool stops functioning like its supposed to I need to replace it Recently its been longer but for a while that was every 23 years Now Im on an S23 Ultra and I think Ill be fine for a while longer because I got the higher spec model with increased memory but time will ultimately tell I think part of the aspect of phone upgrades that compels me to upgrade sooner is that I also use the phones Ive retired from daily use Many are lying around as touch controls for various applications and when one of them finally does die I have to replace it If my regular phone is getting older Ill often buy a new phone so I can retire the current one to whatever needs replacement,m8dwlce,3.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8gyfxu,Call_Me_ZG,,1,2025-01-22 02:50:56,,,,Limit your battery charge to 80 from the settings and turn off fast charging and only use it when you need it If you plan to use your phone for 4 years battery health will be the weakest link,m8fqpua,4.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fmbx1,timeshifter_,,4,2025-01-21 22:38:32,,,,Ive owned exactly 3 smartphones in my entire life I bought my first one in 2007 The biggest problem Ive ever faced is manufacturers not providing any further Android updates meaning some apps simply wont install on my phone at all Otherwise Ive never really felt out of date Also the most Ive paid for a phone was about 400 My current phone TMo literally gave me for free in its release year Sure it could have been considered ewaste the day it released but here I am more than 5 years later still using it Third battery but the back plate pops off and lets me easily replace it so why toss it did ya get that last part manufacturers,m8dwlce,3.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8fuuu0,sucfucagen,,2,2025-01-21 23:21:18,,,,Oh they get it Which is why they dont do it They _want_ you to spend to completely replace something like a battery or a screen when everything else is completely fine They make it as hard as possible on purpose,m8fmbx1,4.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8gxm59,twigboy,,1,2025-01-22 02:46:22,,,,Same here Even then I gawk at the exorbitant prices of new phones The SD card removal is still a bitter pill to swallow Constantly running into space issues on 265gb as I used to have a 512gb SD card I only buy refurbs now once they hit an acceptable price Its just not worth going full price but hey each to their own,m8dwlce,3.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8kg74y,cookielicious1237,,1,2025-01-22 17:17:25,,,,Im around the 4 year mark between upgrades Biggest difference ends up being battery life since the old one is generally depleted to the point where the delta is pretty big Performance changes are so minimal it doesnt even matter at this point,m8dwlce,3.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8goj6a,Stashmouth,,9,2025-01-22 01:56:43,,,,Its weird that people cannot get this through their heads You seldom have to upgrade your phone but when you do dont you want the luxury of choice to get that years flagship The issue as it exists is that not everyone is on the same upgrade cycle which means manufacturers will be trying to outdo themselves every year Hypothetically if Apple released a new phone every oddnumbered year and Samsung released one on the evennumbered years what does that do for consumers It doesnt do much for the companies or their stakeholders,m8dsz97,2.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8o0yi6,davispw,,1,2025-01-23 03:50:24,,,,Youre not accounting for all the people with scratched and cracked screens beat up phones dead batteries busted charge ports Yes these are all repairable issues but if my phone is more than 24 years old Ive got some cash and my damage insurance if I ever had any has expired an upgrade is a lot more attractive Most people do not cannot keep their phones in perfect condition for 6 years,m8goj6a,3.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8s3mxs,Stashmouth,,1,2025-01-23 19:46:24,,,,Youre not accounting for all the people with scratched and cracked screens beat up phones dead batteries busted charge ports I said you seldom have to upgrade your phone not you never do And my point was that if for whatever reason you want to buy a new phone wouldnt you like to be able to choose from a current roster To be clear I think what the author of the article is proposing is myopic and stupid he suggests going back to the tick tock cadence Apple used to use where big number changes happen every two years and we get an S model in between It results in the same thing for the consumer Hes complaining as a journalist I think that he has to cover a major launch every year even though the changes are incremental at best,m8o0yi6,4.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8ivzw5,chaotic_zx,,1,2025-01-22 12:20:36,,,,but when you do dont you want the luxury of choice to get that years flagship Not at all I once got flagship Samsung phones in any upgrade I had Id keep them until they broke Then I figured out that a low tier phone was faster than the one replacing it Im no longer playing the I want the fastest phone game I dont need it,m8goj6a,3.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fh0tr,Richard_Thickens,,1,2025-01-21 22:13:09,,,,They usually take care of that for us at some capacity incompatibility with the newest OS and apps no connectivity with new service technologies like 5G and obviously battery life if you arent able to replace that yourself You may not need to replace a phone every two years on the dot like many people do but for the vast majority of us they arent something that makes sense to keep beyond the upgrade period particularly since purchasing a decent smartphone in cash is not cheap,m8dsz97,2.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8gxsv6,godnorazi,,1,2025-01-22 02:47:24,,,,I upgrade because it honestly makes more financial sense to in my case I use a Google Pixel and they always do insane preorder bonuses I was out less than 100 this past year going from the Pixel 8 to the 9 after tradein and bonuses If I kept my old phone for 5 years until I really needed an upgrade it would cost me over 500 to get a new phone of the same quality vs paying under 100 a year to have the latest and greatest,m8dsz97,2.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8dzhmo,Aralevara,,-1,2025-01-21 18:10:50,,,,The predatory part of carriers doing it is it locks you into their service until the phone is paid off Shell be getting credits every month on her bill for 24 months or 36 Months but if she cancels shell owe whats left Its fine if you know what youre getting into but so many people would be better off not doing an installment plan with premium service Its normalized but for sure it is predatory Theyll take the hit and give cheap phones because the amount they get from the service cost more than makes that up You can definitely go on a prepaid plan and get the phone thru samsung or apple programs for less than the cost of service at the big 3 Additionally youll pay the sale tax of the whole cost of the device If you have a flagship thats only 12 years old you do not need to upgrade and its a total luxury waste The upgrade incentives are there to lock you into expensive service plans and keep you there If you can and want to by all means go for it I would recommend trading in thru samsung and apple themselves rather than a carrier if possible,m8do2lr,4.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8eadeg,JayKay8787,,8,2025-01-21 19:00:00,,,,Phone contracts are not predatory Im sorry They allow people with less money on hand to get a phone And if you get locked into a contract you can get out of it rather easily just pay off the phone and a small fee to end the line They tell you all this when you sign up its pretty reasonable,m8dzhmo,5.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fhi0k,asscdeku,,1,2025-01-21 22:15:23,,,,The problem is that its actually a bad deal for new phones lol Samsung provides a massive base deal for promotional trade ins during the first week of a phones launch The base value for most Samsung phones actually sucks balls for trade ins but the promotional deals gives a ridiculously high floor trade in value even for damaged phones This means people with broken phones or older phones are more incentivized and have a significantly better deal trading in their ie water damaged s20 for like a free 200300 off in comparison to something like a pristine s24 which only gives marginally more value Like yeah Samsung needs to make sales every year but they dont actually prioritize the previous year phones for trade ins,m8e1cbu,10.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8jzwbq,None,,1,2025-01-22 16:02:36,,,,solet me get this right you think companies would operate differently under communism or some other form of economic structure Even in feudalism or in empires you have one or two families read companies controlling each industry amassing all of the wealth One group controls the quarries others the logging others the manual labor others control the laborers The class of owners become the nobility of the land and are in the pocket of whoever controls the law whether its a government king or emperor This has been evidenced in every civilization we have ever known about From ancient Egyptians to feudal Japan to modern America What does capitalism have to do with it,m8jx6dw,2.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8hwgs9,calcium,,2,2025-01-22 06:42:34,,,,You should be able to plop in a new battery for less than 100 but the security updates are the larger issue IMO Im still rocking an iPhone 13 Pro and its been nothing but a solid workhorse for me I may hold onto it for 5 years and do a battery swap soon but I love that Apple will support their phones for a minimum of 7 years of feature updates and possibly longer for security,m8hv49q,4.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8i661g,toumei64,,1,2025-01-22 08:13:31,,,,Ive kept each phone Ive had for 3 to 5 years The one that I kept for slightly over 5 years I finally upgraded because It was getting old and struggling and my partner was like this new phone is coming out that youll be interested in now might be a good time to finally upgrade and get rid of your frustration I got the Pixel 4 XL and loved it I kept it for 3 years and only upgraded to the Pixel 7 Pro because there was a deal that made it practically free over 3 years By the time Google releases whatever AI abomination phone this coming fall itll be time to upgrade again provided that they offer a good deal Im kind of fed up because innovation has turned into blatant enshittification and planned obsolescence abounds as they release new software features exclusive to the new phones With a little tinkering you can fake it on old phones and get a lot of the stuff working I participated in some of the Android betas and Google made it clear that they do not give a shit what their users think They have their own plan and theyre leaning in on it no matter how much we hate it I used to like using Google products Now I just tolerate them because theyre the least awful,m8dvmpk,3.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8d8ep5,wildddin,,15,2025-01-21 16:06:15,,,,They mean the manufacturer not the consumer The point is its good that phone manufacturers release a new phone every year so if you need to replace your 4 year old phone as it has broken you can buy a phone that is under a year from release If manufacturers waited for meaning upgrades before releasing a new iteration you could be forced to buy a phone that is 2 and a half years old when theyll be releasing a new version in 6 months,m8d6r5u,2.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8env7f,darth_voidptr,,3,2025-01-21 20:01:13,,,,There are a lot of good reasons to keep doing yearoveryear improvements even if only a fraction of people buy them Think about how much more factory capacity you need for example to ramp up to resupply all of your customers at once versus 1412 of them every year Think about the risk you need to take if for example your phone burns up on an airplane and everyone decides not to buy that model Also and this is a hardware thing more than software adding new features is often easier to do as a sequence of small changes rather than one big change Theres a trade off between frequency and test overhead but harware development tends to prefer these yearly cycles Bottom line dont worry about it Buy a new phone when you need it MFGs will figure out the ROI and react Marketing will of course continue to insist you need to update every millisecond,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8hdmhq,mnorri,,3,2025-01-22 04:20:38,,,,I worked at a company making a low volume high price piece of equipment Engineering pushed for a model year rollout concept There were improvements that would make it a little better for the user a little cheaper for us to build a little easier to service etc Making a change to a product is expensive because we needed to show to lots of stakeholders that the change didnt affect the way it worked So lots of testing Maybe it was quieter or the UI was snappier the screen a little brighter but that the output was indistinguishable from the previous version Collecting a bunch of minor fixes until a triggering event fixing a real problem meant that we stopped improving the product at all because there werent any aw shit moments after the first months unless some sub component went end of life I understand that phones are changing much more dramatically than our twobit products but there is benefit to saying everything not ready by this date goes in next years model,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8f1e7i,VagueSomething,,1,2025-01-21 21:02:39,,,,I havent upgraded for 3 years but if I upgrade this year Id rather get this years phone instead of last years Youd hate for your phone to break and get the last version then barely 6 months later a 23 years jump releases Should the new model have some kind of design flaw youd hit even more customers with the software or hardware problems if were pushed into periodic updates Limited releases would likely see price hikes to make up for the sales lulls and as they know more people cannot wait much longer Unless phones were legally required to be more fixable such as removable batteries and easier to replace screens youre not going to see phones lasting longer 3 years already makes the hardware struggle regardless of system and manufacturer updates I am not fully against the idea of refining the process but there are a lot of consequences that will come along which may not be immediately obvious at staggering the releases,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8msgjk,Defiant_Office,,1,2025-01-22 23:46:54,,,,Honestly the sweet spot to upgrade is every 4 years I upgraded mine from s20fe to OnePlus 12 and the upgrade is very noticeable and worth it I dont understand why people need the latest and greatest Also Im ditching Samsung until they improve the battery life and charging speed The fact that I can charge from an almost dead battery to 100 in 26 minutes is insane I mostly just charge it for 1015 minutes and Im set for the day As long as I can play the most demanding games like Genshin with max graphics and 60fps and be able to have apps still in the ram without the app needing to be refreshed I wont be upgrading anytime soon,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8p97i3,THBLD,,1,2025-01-23 10:13:39,,,,I have the S22 ultra was thinking of upgrading but then I just heard that they got rid of the Bluetooth out the stylus which has a bunch of gesture features that I use quite often Huge mistake there Other than that I think the phone is generally pretty good although the battery could use a bit of a buff,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8qmps5,geekwithout,,1,2025-01-23 15:44:25,,,,ITs the result of a saturating market with phones that are future proof for several years Its like PCs that have way more performance than what they need for what theyre used for YEars ago every PC was way underpowered and every new modelnew cpu would sell rapidly Not anymore Thats why we now see gimmicks like AI on phones come out I got a brandnew 1 13 but the 12 was perfectly fine and the difference is definetely not very big I did it because of the great trade in and free gift a watch worth 300 If it wasnt for that I wouldnt have bought it,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8fpok5,IamAFlaw,,1,2025-01-21 22:54:57,,,,I think this post is silly People dont upgrade every year There is nothing wrong with incremental changes I buy a phone once every 5 years By that time if the changes are significant enough for me to want to upgrade or if my phone is damaged enough to get sick of it Ill upgrade No one is forcing anyone to upgrade Phones advance fast enough what more do you want You want a radical changes every single year somehow and you think people can pay for that Small changes and your not happy either Hold onto your phone for at least 5 years Take care of it and in 5 years check out some phones and see if it justifies the change for you,,0.0,1i6ljd3

comment,m8desk9,Jamie00003,,0,2025-01-21 16:36:15,,,,Id be more than happy for phones to go to a 23 year cycle I upgrade my phones when I feel like it Because my iPhones tend to last forever and tech doesnt move that quickly Another reason to slow down cycles is software updates Software quality gets worse and worse because they want to push a million features into a big release and rush to get it out the door in time for new phones to come out at least with apple,,0.0,1i6ljd3
comment,m8fc5bg,None,,0,2025-01-21 21:50:57,,,,New models every year a form of planned obsolescence The performance and camera improvements are negligible and even then would not warrant an upgrade for at least 5 years Running out of battery quickly Get the battery replaced save yourself 2 grand,,0.0,1i6ljd3
