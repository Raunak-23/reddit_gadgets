comment,m5vhb4e,None,,252,2025-01-07 14:17:28,,,,I commend this Usually these models have always been upgradable from the bottom with screws but I dont see any more 25 inch bay Having the lights around the top is an improvement Previous version had the lights on the bottom connected with thin ribbons cables that were easy to rip,,0.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5vurw1,DannyJJB,,32,2025-01-07 15:32:35,,,,Those ribbon cables were a nightmare if you hadnt had to deal with them before or if you forget yourself when you are trying to pry the bottom open One of the first times I opened it to upgrade my ram the cable got pulled tight and one of the corner led boards ripped clean off the bottom screw and all the plastic casing was cracked where the screw was placed Had to keep the board super glued down and the ribbon cable taped in place to keep from moving Still got 5 years out of the machine tho before the battery and charging port started to go haywire,m5vhb4e,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5wpxus,secretqwerty10,,16,2025-01-07 18:06:01,,,,Previous version had the lights on the bottom connected with thin ribbons cables that were easy to rip thats on the 15 and 17 inch models the 16 and 18 inch models which these replace also have the LEDs on the keyboard without the ribbon cables source i work at an ASUS ASP and see both pretty much daily,m5vhb4e,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5yawpw,Starfox-sf,,5,2025-01-07 22:41:44,,,,And that couldve easily been avoided by an extra 1c worth of extra ribbon cable length,m5vhb4e,1.0,1hvs74u

comment,m5vppcb,Azozel,,64,2025-01-07 15:05:37,,,,When I worked as a computer tech in the 1990s you could replace the HDD and the ram without tools then too you might need a small screw driver to open the ram compartment but I dont think that counts Much later while working at a large computer company I was surprised when a colleague asked if I could look at his daughters laptop and there was no access to the ram or anything else I guess weve come full circle now hmm,,0.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5wm774,zerosaved,,29,2025-01-07 17:48:05,,,,I was about to say This is absolutely full circle I used to repair computers and laptops and with the exception of Apple many manufacturers used to have the springthumb latch designs that gave you access to more than just the memory modules without needing any tools Apple required the torx drivers phillips and a ridiculous amount of convoluted disassembly to get to the internals but at least you could still replace them,m5vppcb,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5xy4ms,SloppyCheeks,,9,2025-01-07 21:38:12,,,,Apple repair has always been a nightmare but their internals look so good,m5wm774,2.0,1hvs74u
comment,m6219by,Mr_Nicotine,,1,2025-01-08 14:52:58,,,,Because people hold onto their stuff for longer and they know that theyre doing marginal improvements year over year cant sell you a whole new laptop Okay here are some official parts Enjoy,m5vppcb,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m66nyc8,None,,1,2025-01-09 06:09:03,,,,In technology most paradigms eventually come full circle after a while The reality is many decisions hit a fork in the road with clear drawbacks in either direction At some point the route you select either becomes unwieldy or some breakthrough makes the other road more attractive so the paradigm reverses Eventually those drawbacks become too much and another similar breakthrough now makes the original approach more attractive repeat ad nauseam This is just one more for the list,m5vppcb,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5vhkbw,Chronotaru,,73,2025-01-07 14:19:01,,,,Looks beautiful Ive never seen a laptop with the back off that looks that nice Of course part of that is because it has a second back,,0.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5vxe48,fire2day,,28,2025-01-07 15:46:02,,,,Yeah if you want to replace something like the wifi card it looks like youre removing 14 or so screws to get that inside plate off,m5vhkbw,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5xlsga,DaoFerret,,6,2025-01-07 20:39:34,,,,Which is what I had to remove on my last HP convertible to get to the battery and M2 slot so it seems like a step up Wont count the complete disassembly to replace the power jack or the keyboard since thats probably just as bad but thats expected,m5vxe48,2.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5xpwxb,fire2day,,4,2025-01-07 20:58:56,,,,Oh yeah HP is bad for that and some Acers are even worse The last one I had apart had like 18 screws with 3 different types Dell is one of the best with there only being 8 or so in the bottom of my XPS,m5xlsga,3.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5zsnzy,Gauntlet4933,,3,2025-01-08 03:44:16,,,,Yeah my XPS 7590 has been pretty repairable only exception now is the CMOS battery which requires full disassembly Mostly everything else could be done with opening the panel and removing just the few necessary screws,m5xpwxb,4.0,1hvs74u

comment,m5xfjme,ineververify,,6,2025-01-07 20:09:22,,,,Well this is also a large laptop The reason modern laptops started sealing their components with screws and glue was because of their use is designed to be transportable This is a big laptop that is designed to just sit on a desk So these design changes to make it easier to work on make sense It doesnt make as much sense for a air style laptop which needs to be compact and hold together,m5x2r2e,1.0,1hvs74u
comment,m5xo66m,AMetalWolfHowls,,4,2025-01-07 20:50:46,,,,All of my MacBooks until the touchbar had toolless ram My Mac minis too It was a big deal when Apple stopped making serviceable products Real frustrating I think the biggest consumer reason to go soldered in a laptop is vibration ram is less likely to get knocked loose Ive had it happen several times over the years I way prefer upgrading what I have to buying new so I hated the change Of course thats the business reason make people spend huge up front rather than waiting a year and upgrading as cheap memory floods the market,m5xfjme,2.0,1hvs74u
