comment,m8dhrv0,TheCuriousGamer,,61,2025-01-21 16:49:55,,,,Its not that simple scammers are now buying an item taking it out and resealing it with something else of approximate weight inside Then it gets returned as an unwanted purchase and because its still sealed it goes straight back into inventory Stores dont have any clue its been opened and the only way to tell for certain is to open it Ive heard of books bricks plaster casts of phones and even pies being put back into boxes for someone else to find up to months down the line,m8d4h4k,1.0,1i6lboy
comment,m8dmqz7,gSh3p,,53,2025-01-21 17:12:50,,,,Receiving a different product due to a refund scam is a different topic than a weaker CPU being modified to at first glance resemble a stronger CPU which is the case here In case of refund scams you can contact the store In case of this scam some users might never notice,m8dhrv0,2.0,1i6lboy

comment,m8j704w,cafk,,3,2025-01-22 13:34:11,,,,And hence its a scam as many consumers dont check more than the paper box invoice especially now as the BIOSUEFI doesnt show the CPU or memory information and just directly a loading wheel for the os or jumps to a bootloader And an associated article highlighting the scam possibilities to make theoretical uncle Jackies aware Its like CS majors being asked to fix the family printer during holidays,m8j4wky,6.0,1i6lboy
comment,m8dp4rv,TheCuriousGamer,,-19,2025-01-21 17:23:46,,,,Not really you buy a 9800X3D and return it with the modified CPU inside It was also done a few months ago with a completely fake CPU just a heatsink and SMD caps on top of a blank PCB with contacts on the bottom,m8dmqz7,3.0,1i6lboy
comment,m8heryf,DinoHunter064,,4,2025-01-22 04:28:05,,,,This happened to me with my COU cooler I ordered a Phantom Spirit 120 SE Opened the Amazon box and the outer packaging seemed correct but was taped up weirdly Opened that and was greeted with an unopened Dr Nose Best Nose Bot Nasal Aspirator Whats especially frustrating is that they clearly shipped a used item to me when I purchased a new item That shouldnt have happened in the first place,m8dhrv0,2.0,1i6lboy

comment,m8naqgy,BenefitOfTheDoubt_01,,2,2025-01-23 01:23:00,,,,Many of the marketplace driven websites that source products from other vendors are susceptible to scammed products Most of these websites have a soldshipped by company name to verify the product is being sold from them and is therefore more reputable as opposed to the company simply acting as the intermediary for another company and collecting a transition fee To be specific Newegg has a sliderbutton to only show products sold by Newegg As youve already purchased your CPU you should be able to check your order history to verify who sold you the bundle Of course if the processor is already installed you can check the BIOS or use software like HWinfo to verify the cpu model I hope this helps,m8hxkam,1.0,1i6lboy
