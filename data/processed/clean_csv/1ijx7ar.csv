comment,mbhokkh,THiedldleoR,,66,2025-02-07 15:25:47,,,,These aerosols are carried by vortex rings small donutshaped bands of air that transform the particles into short pulses of wind that convert nearby oxygen into ozone Once released their accelerated airflow generates rapid turbulence disrupting the natural combustion process and quickly extinguishing the target fire That sounds kinda stupid Ozone is extremely toxic if inhaled so even independent of the aerosol they end up using this tech might be even more hazardous than the foams they try to replace I get that it might be able to put out a fire but the point of dowsing it in a liquid is that it doesnt start up again If anything this could maybe rival CO2 extinguishers Edit no not even CO2 extinguishers On second thought I dont want a conductive mist anywhere near electrical devices Releasing Ozone in an enclosed space like a homekitchenoffice for small fires would also probably require you to evacuate for several hours until its gone,,0.0,1ijx7ar
comment,mbiof0i,Obitrice,,23,2025-02-07 18:15:50,,,,We use ozone machines in houses after cleaning up hoarder situations or crime scenes Generally to be extra careful we would let them run for 24 hours After about 23 hours with some doors and windows open its fine,mbhokkh,1.0,1ijx7ar

comment,mbi5yia,manbeezis,,31,2025-02-07 16:48:47,,,,ozone is harmful but not quite to that degree I used to mig weld aluminum for a living the arc of one of those welding guns is similar enough to lightning that it generates significant amounts of ozone due to the effect of the intense UV radiation on the air outside of the argon bubble It would cause lung irritation if you had fumes flowing under your hood and inhaled them directly for an extended period of time hours but it wasnt deadly or Id be dead I think something like this would be safe to use outdoors or in large indoor areas or well ventilated smaller indoor areas,mbhokkh,1.0,1ijx7ar

comment,mbj4xfj,Tentacle_elmo,,4,2025-02-07 19:34:11,,,,The issue of firefighting is that a lot more goes into it than just extinguishing a fire We evacuate smoke and heat and search for victims If this was a suppression system that could be installed into a home I think that would be beneficial One placed in a kitchen and one in a furnace room would control the two main areas that fires start At the very least it may buy victims time to exit the structure,,0.0,1ijx7ar
