comment,mzhjm65,gbzcngb,,102,2025-06-24 10:14:22,,,,Im still salty over the Fairphone 4 that had constant software related issues with basic phone functions like calls randomly muting and microphone quality and despite multiple bug reports nothing was ever fixed Its the same issues facing Framework now they focus a lot on the hardware and design but the BIOS support is not good These companies need to realise that software support is just as important as hardware,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzk5c69,G8M8N8,,17,2025-06-24 18:36:28,,,,I have a Framework Laptop 13 and am not familiar with the BIOS issues you mention,mzhjm65,1.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzklzam,gbzcngb,,2,2025-06-24 19:58:20,,,,Look in the Framework forums lots of issues with the FW13 BIOS for the AMD boards Constant back and forth over several releases trying to just get their battery saver feature working Not to mention people with FW16 feeling abandoned without a BIOS update in like a year,mzk5c69,2.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhmkpy,zwiftys,,8,2025-06-24 10:40:03,,,,For what its worth Im on the Fairphone 5 and Im not really having any bugs Is it the fastest phone No Is the camera amazing Fuck No But its a good enough phone for my use cases with no real software issues yet,mzhjm65,1.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhnuqr,gbzcngb,,10,2025-06-24 10:50:36,,,,I would have been happy to stick with mine of it functioned as a phone but it always had issues and they kept saying it would be fixed in future updates but it never was And then the only solution was to buy a new one because the part that might have been a fault the microphones couldnt be replaced separately because theyre built into the frame theres like 3 of them or something and their solution to that was to replace the whole phone which I feel goes a bit against the whole ewaste premise,mzhmkpy,2.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhobbp,zwiftys,,6,2025-06-24 10:54:11,,,,Yeah That sucks and undermines the entire purpose really,mzhnuqr,3.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzmqf5r,sproctor,,2,2025-06-25 02:49:08,,,,The bios on framework is fine Its not perfect but it works Ive had some charging issues with earlier versions but theyve worked most of the bugs out now The buggy thing was bios limited charging and adaptive charging I havent seen that on another laptop,mzhjm65,1.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzh6s2s,Forsaken-I-Await,,18,2025-06-24 08:08:40,,,,Interesting concept when it first was debuted Im glad its actually getting the attention it deserves and I really hope it takes off,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhf61d,tomtv90,,4,2025-06-24 09:32:31,,,,I also hope it takes off and parts or even future upgrades hopium will be readily available Really tempted to make the switch once my samsung finally gives out It looks good and specs seem decent enough,mzh6s2s,1.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhiyu7,dominjaniec,,33,2025-06-24 10:08:23,,,,still no jack thus no mony from me at least there is a SD slot,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzke8cx,vortexmak,,3,2025-06-24 19:18:57,,,,No idea when they will get rid of the micro SD too Might be better to go with the S10 instead,mzhiyu7,1.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzi01ct,51dux,,7,2025-06-24 12:16:35,,,,It would be cool if they also switched to selling it in Canada as well xD just saying,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzhxvu5,LittleTXBigAZ,,8,2025-06-24 12:02:40,,,,I really want to support this but Fairphones lack of US support AND the constant call issues I had when I tried the FP5 have me turned off of this project Its a damn shame because the concept is amazing,,0.0,1lj53uy

comment,mzj1p05,geeeman5510,,3,2025-06-24 15:32:35,,,,The biggest problem for this phone is just like every phone not on the att Verizon and not on TMobile I cant go to my carrier store and pick up this phone knowing its going to work with my carrier same problem One plus has same problem than nothing phone has Here in America we need more phones from other companies that are not Motorola Samsung Apple or Google in the store for us to pick from Hard for people to shout out seven eight 900 Right off the bat not really knowing if these phones are going to work on their carrier or not how to set them up on their carrier if it was with the carrier at the cell phone store you pick up the phone they activated the phone 100 works,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mziwqo3,Trang0ul,,1,2025-06-24 15:09:21,,,,Seems like resurrected Ara the older concept of a modular phone killed by Google,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzk1ko3,unematti,,1,2025-06-24 18:18:42,,,,Id really like to see them making a chassis and later the new model would just be the motherboard switched out Yeah battery change is nice But with a little bit of hassle you can do that in a galaxy phone with a hairdryer And since its once every couple years its not really a problem in my opinion,,0.0,1lj53uy
comment,mzlspge,mauricioszabo,,1,2025-06-24 23:35:49,,,,I have a Fairphone 4 Its simply not worth it Battery life is atrocious and the lack of headphone jack is complicated Camera is not that good either But the fair part shows somehow camera API have RAW support the OS is not bloated and I feel the OS is less buggy somehow But still way too expensive for the hardware and I feel the screen scratches just by looking at it wrong,,0.0,1lj53uy
