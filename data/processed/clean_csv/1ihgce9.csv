post,1ihgce9,chrisdh79,US FDA approves first-ever smart glasses with hearing aid for mild to moderate loss | Nuance Audio Glasses represent a novel entry into the med-tech segment by merging eyewear with hearing technology.,1382,2025-02-04 12:17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ihgce9/us_fda_approves_firstever_smart_glasses_with/,102.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mayxe28,Big_Rain2543,,40,2025-02-04 18:59:36,,,,Optometrist here I looked into all their marketing It seems Nuance is mainly aimed toward people who may not have hearing aids already have issues wearing hearing aids while wearing glasses dont like the look of hearing aids etc It isolates and increases the volume of conversation and cancels background noise Opticals would have a demo pair for customers to play with much like the RayBan Meta displays They would simulate background noise by having the user wear a speaker around their neck Like Meta I would guess this is not going to be anyones main pair of glasses or hearing aids and I suspect charging issues But likewise there will be a small influx of people asking specifically for this device Usually its those who love dabbling in wearable tech and maybe people who know they are losing hearing but in denial about needing a hearing aid And like for Meta I bet some insurances will deny coverage,,0.0,1ihgce9
comment,mb3dmlk,Xikkiwikk,,11,2025-02-05 12:15:15,,,,Hearing impaired here People treat me like shit if I wear hearing aids As soon as normal people see the hearings aids they start acting like I am below normal levels of intelligence It is so frustrating and insulting so I just stopped wearing hearing aids I would rather be treated normal and not hear everything than be treated like I have massive special needs Hearing aids arent cool and society has a lot of work to do with accepting them Hearing aids disguised as glasses is a great solution But fortunately I have great eyesight so no need for glasses,mayxe28,1.0,1ihgce9
comment,mb4poje,rdyoung,,5,2025-02-05 16:41:41,,,,You dont deserve to be treated like that but if you wanted to try something like this you could get one without a prescription maybe they could even add transition tech to it too so it can double as sort of sunglasses,mb3dmlk,2.0,1ihgce9

comment,mawz5nm,VincentNacon,,30,2025-02-04 13:06:48,,,,This will flop I do have hearing impairment and I do need hearing aids and I do wear glasses I never wished for both hearing aids and glasses to be combined because there are times I do need to take my glasses off but want to keep the aids on and vice versa Having them combined means I have to give up both not one Now imagine I have to recharge them and I cant wear the glasses part Nor could I wear the glasses in the shower without the hearing aids BTW this isnt the first time a glasses and hearing aids have been combined these existed back in the 70s My grandfather had one and he didnt really like it that much Having it being a smart glasses doesnt really make it more appealing to put up with the problem it has Unless they can bring the price under 200 which is very doubtful Regular hearing aids without all the fancy AI and Bluetooth for mildtomoderate loss can cost more than 900 each Wouldnt surprise me if they price them beyond 3000 No thanks,,0.0,1ihgce9

comment,mb203i6,FuzzyDwarf,,1,2025-02-05 04:44:39,,,,As someone also in the glasseshearing aids moderate camp the only upside I see is the directional microphones Every once in a while my hearing aids will lock onto someone with a loudclear voice and make it difficult to hear who Im actually talking to But thats infrequent and the glasses cant stream audio like my hearing aids can Plus even if they solve the insurance battery price etc problems this could have and the inherent restrictions of the glassesaids being combined they still have to deal with glasses being a aesthetic choice There are hundreds of frames at my optician Im also skeptical that they compete with a properly calibrated set of overear aids but I guess Id have to try them,mawz5nm,1.0,1ihgce9

comment,mdcem92,Dr---Strangelove,,1,2025-02-18 00:13:27,,,,Thats the point though There is a stigma against those that wear hearing aids So something like these will be of interest to more folks then you may think I tried them on at the optometrist today They DO provide a benefit If you have severe hearing loss no But if its low or moderate they provide a benefit You may be surprised And compare the price point against a noncostco pair of hearing aids Quite compelling Give them a try and you may be surprised,mdbpsro,3.0,1ihgce9
