comment,mla0sk8,BengalFan85,,193,2025-04-03 22:16:47,,,,I know no one trusts nvidia rn but also keep in mind the OG switch was extremely underpowered even back in 2017 when it launched so this claim is probably legit just based on that,,0.0,1jqu62q

comment,mm29s8d,ItemFast,,1,2025-04-08 16:57:53,,,,I would argue against it the components inside could have been more powerful They were using 4 year old architecture in order to increase margins which was pretty underpowered compared to available hardware with better efficiency They sold each console with a decent margin of 14 The console and dock itself only cost them 167 to make They could eaten up the 14 margin and ended up with a better processor which by far the worst aspect it had They made a ton of money on games that they never drop in price So yes there is a point of view to critic them but that is just the general opinion 85billion was made on the switch including its games 75 billion would also be nice and we would get a more future proof handheld console,mlrw2vo,10.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlc77q4,TornadoFS,,6,2025-04-04 07:30:32,,,,Man I get what you are saying but frame gen does make games fluctuating around 50FPS run well at a cost of visual artifacts I have been using frame gen in Monster Hunter Wilds with AMD FSR because I have a 3080 which doesnt support DLSS frame gen For that game specifically it is worth the tradeoff and I imagine that a lot of games on the switch will turn it on and that is a good thing But yeah dont trust whatever nvidia is saying frame gen is not magic and makes visuals worse Ideally it should be used only 4k modes with the user having an option to turn on a 1080p performance mode that doesnt use it,ml9pzo1,2.0,1jqu62q

comment,mla0sca,eestionreddit,,24,2025-04-03 22:16:45,,,,Its completely possible that Ampere was able to do frame gen all along But if it did support frame gen NVIDIA would be talking about it,ml9opv0,2.0,1jqu62q
comment,mla9p0d,fvck_u_spez,,17,2025-04-03 23:08:19,,,,Technically it does support frame gen in that FSR 3 frame gen works on Ampere Wouldnt be out of the norm for Nintendo to go that route I believe that there were some games they shipped that used a modified version of FSR on the Switch,mla0sca,3.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlat4ul,stellvia2016,,9,2025-04-04 01:06:42,,,,AFAIK theyre comparing the docked performance of the Switch to the docked performance of the Switch2 possibly with DLSS enabled The docked Switch was around 384Gflops and the new SoC in the Switch2 at full power is predicted to be a bit over 3Tflops aka 3000Gflops So I could see DLSS bringing that up to a perf roughly equivalent to 38Tflops then,ml9opv0,2.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlad6f4,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,3,2025-04-03 23:28:35,,,,It doesnt seem like they would need to massage the truth The Switch 1 came out in 2017 same time as the GTX 1080 Is the 5080 ten times faster than the 1080 That would be hard to measure fairly but it seems likely that it is Moors Law says that the new chip should be forty times faster,ml9opv0,2.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlafng1,Untitled_One-Un_One,,17,2025-04-03 23:43:20,,,,Moores law hasnt been a thing in ages The 5080 doesnt even deliver tens times the frames of a 1070 Either way neither the Switch or the Switch 2 are using GPU architectures from their launch year so the comparison is entirely pointless,mlad6f4,3.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlal4xz,pinkynarftroz,,9,2025-04-04 00:16:49,,,,Moores law is about economy of transistor density not performance Looking at the graphs on Wikipedia it still seems to be holding strong,mlafng1,4.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc6gea,Untitled_One-Un_One,,6,2025-04-04 07:22:21,,,,That chart is showing raw transistor counts not density Companies have been needing to make larger and larger chips in order to keep up with the consumer expectations built by Moores law Nvidias top of the line GPU in 2012 was a GTX 680 It sits at about 35 billion transistors Moores law suggests the RTX 3090 their 2020 top end chip should have 56 billion It has just a little over half at 283 billion To make matters worse the 3090 has over twice the total die area of the 680,mlal4xz,5.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlanf43,fullsaildan,,6,2025-04-04 00:30:52,,,,Judging performance by frames alone isnt really meaningful They architect the chips to handle complex tasks that may or may not increase frames on specific games depending on what features they use Not everything is just render the same thing more quickly Nevermind that driver profiles likely need to be updated for a lot of games to fully utilize those features,mlafng1,4.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc717n,Untitled_One-Un_One,,3,2025-04-04 07:28:33,,,,I dont see what youre getting at here Are you talking about certain render methods The workloads were normalized for testing in order to get those numbers Its about as apples to apples of a comparison as you can get,mlanf43,5.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlagmkk,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,-2,2025-04-03 23:49:09,,,,Either way neither the Switch or the Switch 2 are using GPU architectures from their launch year so the comparison is entirely pointless Explain your logic Regardless of their specific launch years they are eight years apart,mlafng1,4.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlad4i1,Fredasa,,5,2025-04-03 23:28:16,,,,I think users of a platform like Switch 2 will be far less aware critical of the fact that almost all of the detail theyre seeing is invented by an algorithmand theyll also be less sensitive to the kind of artifacts you get from that kind of guessing gameso tech like DLSS definitely works in the favor of NintendoPlaystation,mlabzdh,4.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlb8iv0,TrptJim,,1,2025-04-04 02:44:12,,,,Not just that you can tailor your game to work extremely well at low input resolutions Nintendo has a great track record for putting art design above graphics Marvel Rivals is a good recent example Details still look crisp on DLSS Ultra Performance with the Transformer model,mlad4i1,5.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc1zwh,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-04 06:38:10,,,,Frankly put people give Transformer a bit of a pass You _have_ to raise your eyebrow when you compare a natively rasterized 4K screenshot to a Transformerupscaled one and the latter has like 2x more detail Yes 90 of folks will land in the I dont care bracket which is the same as saying that 90 of folks dont care that James Camerons 4K blurays are an abomination that essentially discards the original visuals for a hallucinated alternativein any meaningful sense that doesnt ding the overriding point that youre not getting the intended visuals and if you could throw more GPU power at it you would But it _is_ useful when youre selling the most casual platform that can still reasonably be labeled as a console rather than just a glorified smart device with some nice first party titles which incidentally sums up how I feel about the Switch 1 And of course I actually reckon this is moot because Im not expecting games on the platform to use Transformer preferentially Not for a portable screen at 120Hz Nintendos userbase arent going to be that demanding,mlb8iv0,6.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlcdvml,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-04 08:43:06,,,,It uses more GPU power and while its not like twice as much its very non zero Developers making games that are going to be played on a portable 1080p screen are definitely going to ask why they need to lower their games performance by 15 for something that almost nobody in the platforms user base will understand is being utilized and probably couldnt tell the difference between DLSS and native either way,mlc463c,8.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlcjnmc,Fredasa,,1,2025-04-04 09:45:21,,,,Since Nintendo is plainly positioning the Switch 2 as a first foray back into the core gaming market studiospublishers developing for it also have to balance what gets revealed by review and analysis sites Digital Foundry et al If a game spends the majority of its time upscaling from 14th the native resolution of 1080p it doesnt much matter that you could say a screenshot of that looks goodit will have a blatantly obvious impact on the intent of the visuals and DF and friends will hasten to point that out and quite reasonably underscore that its a compromise and not ideal,mlchwfv,10.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlcjna7,Alfiewoodland,,1,2025-04-04 09:45:16,,,,Theres a lot of uncertainty about this but the extra cooling in the dock does imply theyre pushing it quite hard so maybe 10x seems incredibly optimistic though I assume the 10x figure is actually 45x DLSS making it effectively 10x Nvidia have been known to twist the truth like this,mlc7zje,3.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlgwj5w,mister2forme,,1,2025-04-05 00:51:25,,,,Recently Every release since they got caught cheating on benchmarks have been overstated I worked for an OEM years ago and we used to do the 50 rule whatever Nvidia claimed the best case scenario was 50 of that Its gotten worse now that they fudge numbers with fake frames and all that Thats not to say they havent made good hardware in the past but their marketing team are masters at number padding Real world read not influencer content posing as reviews was always a bit lower,ml9nsns,1.0,1jqu62q

comment,ml9tju2,steves_evil,,6,2025-04-03 21:36:33,,,,DLSS is basically mandatory to make the performance cost of raytracing tolerable so theres zero chance that any titles that use raytracing wont also be using DLSS to make up for the performance cost Raytracing consumes a lot more power than DLSS since it is more computationally expensive and DLSS helps that by rendering at a lower internal resolution lowering the amount of computations needed for ray tracing,ml9qtsw,2.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlfci3t,eljudio42,,1,2025-04-04 19:31:01,,,,So after all the backlash around the joy cons last gen and the EU also addressing it Nintendo offered free repairs to all joy cons indefinitely That was probably more cost effective than going back to the drawing board and releasing a 20 model When Nintendo started to offer repairs I think its safe to say people might have expected a redesign where this happens less frequently Because compared to any other controller joy cons were reported to drift very quickly using the same tech Now Im not saying at the time they would have started to offer hall effect because like you said its relatively new at least as far as I am aware but why do joy cons drift so much sooner than their pro controller the PlayStation controllers and the Xbox who all use pentominner sticks So since they never did a redesign they clearly didnt think there was anything to change By saying hey we changed the tech in the joy con 2 so these wont drift as much youre going to have a big crowd of people who will say why didnt you offer this last gen,mlf9myd,4.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlfl79z,rooftops,,2,2025-04-04 20:15:49,,,,people might have expected a redesign where this happens less frequently Ah yeah thats a good point as I also would expect at least some attempt to fix the problem instead of just replacing it with the same hardware So since they never did a redesign they clearly didnt think there was anything to change By saying hey we changed the tech in the joy con 2 so these wont drift as much youre going to have a big crowd of people who will say why didnt you offer this last gen Thats the thing though they dont have to say new tech to fix the old problems they just have to market it as this is fancy new technology and pretend to be forerunners of the tech The people whod complain about it not being offered are going to complain regardless and your average consumer probably would probably understand this wasnt really a thing back then but it is now over maybe we couldve but it wouldve cost lots of money and development time But I suppose saying nothing is the safest option for brand protection so who am I to argue lol Tangent but Ive been meaning to learn more about the technical side of things Ive always wondered if its feasible to have some module to swap out analogs for in existing systems but I doubt its translatable without some major hardwareprogramming changes at least from what Ive gleaned in my work experience,mlfci3t,5.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlahb9n,eljudio42,,2,2025-04-03 23:53:16,,,,As many advantages that the joy cons brought into gaming smaller controllers easier to press buttons for those with small hands and fine motor problem the ability to hold your arms apart and not have to deal with shoulder tension I never thought it was worth playing with my joy cons and kept them on for aesthetic purposes only I hope this time around theyre high quality cause Id love to use them,mlac3tm,4.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlbq47u,phillz91,,1,2025-04-04 04:54:00,,,,What an ignorant comment The 5080 is 20 slower or more while only being 15 cheaper than the 4090 in my market This is not the same as the leap from 2030 or 3040 series the 50 series is only marginally better than the previous across the board And who cares about 70 series You understand the 60 and 70 series cards out perform the higher end card in sales numbers every generation right The 80 and 90 series are nice to look at on a graph but most people are not spending that much on a GPU Nvidias own fucking marketing compared the sales numbers for the 4000 to the 5000 series and the new cards had only sold slightly more despite having 4 separate SKUs compared to basically just the 4090 for 4 of the 5 weeks measured Stop falling for marketing hype my dude,mlbomsv,6.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlbra7v,SpamingComet,,-2,2025-04-04 05:03:47,,,,Thats nice that people buy ewaste but I dont care I care about performance and the 5090 has that so its a good card Youre whining about a base trim corolla while my only concern is a supra,mlbq47u,7.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlbtq3h,phillz91,,0,2025-04-04 05:25:04,,,,Mate you asked who cared I answered Just cus you like to buy over priced electronics does not make you incapable of considering the market as a whole If you want the power great But that does not inherently make the 5090 a good buy and it only gets worse the further down the stack you go That was the point of the comment you replied to remember,mlbra7v,8.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc183d,SpamingComet,,1,2025-04-04 06:31:41,,,,The comment I replied to is this theyre barely more powerful than the 40 series and just use slightly better dlss and frame gen as a crutch I replied that the 5090 specifically was leagues better and you went on about 70s and 80s and other nonsense I was correct with my initial comment the 5090 is leagues better than anything else out right now and no amount of you whining about it will change that,mlbtq3h,9.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc1w15,phillz91,,0,2025-04-04 06:37:15,,,,So the original comment is about the 50 series as a whole Your comment was about the 5090 specifically which was not what OP was really talking about I then addressed both your claim of the 5090 being leagues better to paraphrase its not 30 is a pretty standard uplift for a generation Its good but not amazing in context 3090 to 4090 was a 50 jump on average and the original comment referring to the rest of the product stack which are barely better if at all My man you are the one that cant seem to comprehend context here,mlc183d,10.0,1jqu62q
comment,mlc3p6r,SpamingComet,,1,2025-04-04 06:54:05,,,,So the original comment is about the 50 series as a whole Your comment was about the 5090 specifically which was not what OP was really talking about You must be clinically insane If I start a conversation about bread its a general topic You can move it into favorite types of bread how to make bread how to use bread anything that still relates to bread because youre simply narrowing down a general topic But if you narrow it down to favorite types and I say I hate a certain type well thats the complete opposite so that doesnt really make sense In this scenario the comment I responded to was about the 50 series as a whole again a general topic I narrowed it down to the 5090 because their wording did not apply to that one You then ignored the 90 and went on about the 80 and 70 which doesnt follow what I said If you had responded to the same comment I responded to that would have made more sense Hope this helps Maybe when you get out the ward youll be able to practice more,mlc1w15,11.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlam5pc,TheEclipse0,,2,2025-04-04 00:23:08,,,,A lot of things too many to list here Basically Nvidia promised a lot of things that just arnt true The most prominent one being that the 5070 is just as powerful as a 4090 for 500 MSRP a fraction of the cost If this were true that would be AMAZING Well if I recall correctly someone correct me if Im wrong the 5070 actually performs WORSE than last gens budget card while all of those extra frames come from DLSS DLSS is very good in many instances allowing us to play games at higher frame rates than the card is capable of running by itself but there can be too much DLSS So when you turn it off we find that the card runs games at a single digit frame rate Yes single digit on modern hardware whereas its predecessor could get playable frame rates on the same games without DLSS In fact the entire 5000 series cards performs WORSE across the board on OLD games from the early 2000s because Nvidia removed PhysX People are getting half the frame rate in games like boarderlands 2 on their 2000 graphics card when their old card ran it at double the speed Eitherway with the 5070 and DLSS the AI is doing so much that it causes severe ghosting imagine driving a car in gta5 at half the frame rate as your old card and everytime you go around a corner your car splits into 5 versions of itself like a fan Nvidia basically false advertising,mla9c7r,2.0,1jqu62q

comment,ml9rs8t,steves_evil,,26,2025-04-03 21:26:59,,,,Ray tracing support is probably more of a byproduct of using an Ampere based GPU than a deliberate decision Tegra T239 The GPU is going to be somewhere around or under a rtx 2050 laptop depending on whether the switch is docked or in handheld Much more powerful than the og Switch but Ray tracing is still incredibly demanding so DLSS and actual optimization will have to put in a lot of work to make any use of those effects,ml9nzud,1.0,1jqu62q

comment,mlgiewm,PIO_PretendIOriginal,,1,2025-04-04 23:22:35,,,,If you have a game running at 51fps on a 60hz fixed framerate monitor it will cause uneven framepacing Uneven framepacing looks like stutter Edit keep in mind this is whithin the context of many consoles trying to force Vsync even if they cant hold that vsync framerate which also massively increases latency Its why most 60hz tvs have motion smoothing for 24fps movies Because otherwise you end up with a 32 pull down which looks like stutter I personally always turn motion smoothing off as I think it looks awful and I have a 120hz tv which does divide evenly into 24fps Yes screen tearing is also caused by a mismatch between the monitor framerate and GPU target but I didnt mention it as the word screen tearing is technical jargon that the average street person doesnt know If I told my mom gsync matches the GPU framerate to the monitor this improves uneven framepacing and removes image tearing however make sure you cap your framerate to 5fps below your monitors refresh rate to stay within the monitors refresh rate this also keeps latency lower in a similar way to nvidia reflex my moms response would be match the what to the what now it makes the game tear less Whats a tear Where as if I just say it make game look smoother then thats a simple enough explanation And on a handheld like switch 2 the console will automatically handle all the gsync settings So the technical breakdown and jargon will just confuse many console players,mlbpfo2,3.0,1jqu62q
