comment,lw657n5,superman_king,,30,2024-11-09 00:07:26,,,,Its baffling Ive owned every PlayStation console Im an enthusiast with disposable income I decided not to buy the PS5 Pro when I found out it comes with less features than my current PS5 I have to buy extra attachments to make it work I am honestly surprised they threw in a free controller at this point The fact I cant even watch movies on the pro variant is a joke Their target market wants the disc drive so why remove it,lw4gfx8,1.0,1gml7l1
comment,lw8d7ld,Ericjuuh,,9,2024-11-09 10:56:06,,,,The free controller is the next step Take a look at apple they removed chargers which is a crucial supporting addon for your device Sony can easily follow suit and call it sustainability Since everyone by now has controllers in their house right,lw657n5,2.0,1gml7l1
comment,lw69ktg,mark_99,,9,2024-11-09 00:32:53,,,,The data says most people dont want the disk drive They dont want to make 2 models again Making just a disk model or bundling the disk drive increases the price for everyone including the majority that dont want it You can buy an add on drive if you want one Not baffling at all Personally I havent used an optical disk for anything for at least 10 years The main use case seems to be people who want to save a few via 2nd hand games Probably even less intersection with the target market for PS5 Pro,lw657n5,2.0,1gml7l1

comment,lw6nvnw,Anton1699,,6,2024-11-09 01:58:02,,,,The data says most people dont want the disc drive What data The data Ive seen suggests that the base PS5 w disc drive outsells the driveless version by a significant margin even though its more expensive Yes people are buying more and more games digitally but purchasing a driveless console means you no longer have a choice while customers with a disc drive can choose which version of the game to buy,lw69ktg,3.0,1gml7l1

comment,lw8pakc,Bloody_Sunday,,2,2024-11-09 12:49:34,,,,Its not baffling due to what you described Its because a they are reducing the cost by not including a drive b they are maximizing profit by asking people to pay extra for it when they need it c they are also maximizing profit by increasing the price of the whole unit with one important component gone But what you describe is not the way it normally works at all A disc includes the game itself and all you need beyond that is to download any updates You cant expect everyone globally to have a fast easily available and cheap or even reasonably priced internet connection to just install multiple 70120GB games whenever they like It will take time customer annoyance affect data plans that are not unlimited the above limitations are also a considerable factor etc And then theres also the issue of owning a physical copy of something that may eventually not be available online anymore and that you can find various ways of making it work without an internet connection if that point is reached,lw69ktg,3.0,1gml7l1

comment,lwc5gtr,andDevW,,1,2024-11-10 00:41:09,,,,PS keeping physical media while eliminating the game resale market to stay competitive with PC which has no physical media Discs would install locked games that require activation via PSN Discs could be purchased with and without activation included Users can freely share game discs to avoid downloads Discs bought with activation could automatically activate on the first console theyre installed on With the current system each disc works as a license from console to console as long as the disc is always in the drive Its impossible for PS to continue to exist with this system undercutting game sales in perpetuity Studios will make more money from PC sales zero resale and end up deprioritizing PS as a platform,lw8s6oo,6.0,1gml7l1

comment,lw70xb3,Anton1699,,3,2024-11-09 03:20:49,,,,I get where youre coming from but as far as I know the base PS5 w the disc drive outsells the driveless version by a pretty wide margin and it is more expensive Not to mention that the PS5 Pro primarily targets the enthusiast audience who are pretty likely to own a large physical PS4PS5 game library that just wont be playable out of the box,lw709t5,3.0,1gml7l1

comment,lw91ek3,Giul_Xainx,,1,2024-11-09 14:14:44,,,,I gave up on gaming altogether back in 2019 I stopped buying games PCs and consoles And it is because something sinister brewed in the background I have seen all sides of the argument for against and even trade offs on gaming But it boils down to money If you follow the money you will see why things are going this way Its not just the development you have to remember security as well Gaming is becoming a service because of security Dont believe me Bad actors are starting to infiltrate mods and cheats Be careful what you do with your games from now on You really do not know who to trust anymore Features like unreal tournament 3 where they allowed custom maps to be put onto consoles PS3 360 will become a huge risk in the future We have seen arbitrary code execution happen in videogames I truly do believe that physical copies will be rendered a huge risk in the very near future as their code as is will be exploited I would say the speed running community if it gets bad enough will be the most vulnerable victims in the very near future I used to think that video games were a safe haven from hacks But it looks like it is starting to be an avenue for bad actors to start taking over your machines And it is all because no one really focused on them in such a manner,,0.0,1gml7l1

comment,lwa0n8k,None,,1,2024-11-09 17:33:38,,,,So glad I got the slim disc version as soon as it came out Buying the stand separate was enough of a pain I straightup wouldnt buy the console if I needed to buy that and a disc drive Theyre making some baffling decisions with this new era of console gaming Its one thing to offer the choice of a digital or disc version but its a whole other to only sell digital consoles and separate accessories I know a lot of people who game but refuse to upgrade because of the base console price already combined with the fact that most PS5 games are actually PS4 games not to mention the controllers fail more quickly and USB port failures have plagued some models The quality and upgrade just doesnt seem worth the price to a lot of people And Sonys response is to make the console more expensive and inconvenient to acquire Solid,,0.0,1gml7l1

comment,lw5nrsr,antara33,,3,2024-11-08 22:28:11,,,,I personally believe that physical games are a total waste of resources First most disks dont even have the full game and even if they do most games require patches to work and are a mess on release so you still need to download stuff to make it work and good luck if they decide to shut down the network No disk will save you from that At this point since having a disk is no longer meaning that you will be able to play the game neither saves you from downloading mandatory and required upgrades why are we spending shittons of resources making printing and moving them I think about it from an eco friendly perspective as dumb as that may sounds disks are 100 useless in the modern era save for selling older games so instead of pushing for keeping a wasteful media format why not push to enable game trading,lw56i95,1.0,1gml7l1
comment,lw6008j,Divallo,,2,2024-11-08 23:36:57,,,,and physical games are products that fall outside the control of publishers and platform holders in a way that they have found increasingly irritating in recent years Trading your used digital games sounds great but theres virtually zero chance of it actually happening anytime soon Like the article states they want as much control as possible Also a used digital game is for all intents and purposes completely identical to a brand new digital game because they dont take damage or degrade the way physical used games do Publishers are aware of this and are adamantly opposed to the idea of digital game trading,lw5nrsr,2.0,1gml7l1
