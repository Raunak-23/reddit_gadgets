comment,mrhj1bf,mailslot,,2,2025-05-09 21:16:50,,,,They were all terrible as I remember The last one I had the Samsung Galaxy S5 had gaskets that would misalign so it was rarely even water resistant The USB cover would fall out easily and get lost Also the back cover would pop off of the phone constantly even just setting it down on a pillow Then Samsung pushed an update nagging me to check the seals every single day I had all of the inconveniences of a water proof phone that wasnt great at water proofing so I could have a replaceable battery that never needed replacing I was stoked when I replaced the phone with the completely sealed S7 I was seriously tired of the battery falling out all of the time,mrg90bv,5.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr6juhx,DanNeely,,27,2025-05-08 02:46:49,,,,Arent they doing the same restrictions with onboard storage Its been a few years since Ive done any Android dev but each new version of the OS when I was came with additional restrictions on direct file access outside of your apps directory Instead you had to send the user through file picker APIs that returned abstract IDs dont recall the name instead of file paths Those were always awful to deal with so the first thing we always did was copy the file into the app directory for future use In theory forcing apps to use that approach should have been an improvement since it was the only way to reach files in cloud storage but every provider we tested ended up needing slightly different code to get a local copy of the file so it still didnt just work,mr6g2yb,6.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr6gll1,OperatorJo_,,-18,2025-05-08 02:26:31,,,,As I wrote elsewhere Android hasnt liked removable storage for awhile now YEARS now after the Material days Apps dont like being on external storage They dont play nice so all an sd card is for is photos music and files Sure thats convenient but the real reason people would like more storage is more large apps and thats not happening with an SD card,mr6bwom,5.0,1khcwhx
comment,mr6n8ki,SpeedflyChris,,25,2025-05-08 03:09:04,,,,Im not sure I buy that the main driver is large apps Whenever I run low on space its because of a large amount of photosvideo A microSD card slot would make that much easier to deal with,mr6gll1,6.0,1khcwhx
comment,mr707wz,HuntingForSanity,,8,2025-05-08 04:44:17,,,,But a micro sd card doesnt make you spend more money on the higher storage device that they are selling So they stop adding SD card slots so you pay more money for higher storage,mr6n8ki,7.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr9w3sy,kermityfrog2,,3,2025-05-08 16:59:59,,,,Because there are still things called audiophile headphones that cost up to thousands of dollars and they still use wires Wired headphones also just work and can be paired with infinite number of devices They work on planes if you want to watch a movie from the plane entertainment system If you only have wireless headphones you have to watch your own media Having a headphone port on a phone doesnt mean you cant use wireless headphones However removing the port means you are stuck with wireless only unless you carry a dongle Its also backwards compatible with a zillion devices My gym has a speaker system that the instructor needs to plug in a device so that they can pipe in music relaxing music for yoga and trademarked Les Mills music for other classes The stereo system uses a standard 35mm jack for audioin Instructors have to bring their own dongle because people would lose or steal the dongle if the gym provides it The 35mm cable is ziptied to the stereo Instructors have been bringing in their own iPods or dongles,mr6ql6e,2.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr8pz20,Abigail716,,2,2025-05-08 13:30:45,,,,The person youre responding to is not completely right but basically One of the main reasons they got rid of removable storage was people kept buying really cheap low grade microSD cards that had terrible performance People then associated the terrible performance of this garbage tier Temu Micro SD card with the performance of their actual phone This is one of the key reasons why so many people used to talk about switching from Android to iPhone and being blown away by how much faster it was,mr79fdg,3.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr6scfp,fluteofski-,,8,2025-05-08 03:44:12,,,,Years ago I was working lead global procurement for a leading brand in a different industry And Ive been in a handful of meetings with the Csuite One time I asked why this direction Are consumers even asking for this And the head of product said the consumer has no idea what they want And the head of marketing chimed in its our job to tell them what they want I sat back and pondered that for a minute Year after year the company would push new cool shit and consumers would absolutely eat it up It was wild how good the marketing team was at what they did But heres the thing At the end of the day when you take into consideration a development cycle which can be something like 3 years from idea to production If youre just responding to consumers today youre gonna be 3 years too late when the product hits the market So theres some merit to what they do when designing the next generation of product All that said Sometimes products totally flop Just the way it is product development cycles and marketing is absolutely fascinating sometimes,mr5xxrh,2.0,1khcwhx

comment,mr9c1ud,Nail_Biterr,,1,2025-05-08 15:22:32,,,,So Im really cool with my Galaxy 23 Ultra I still use it and still love it But can it just have a better battery and why can I buy an SD card with like 1000 TB of data for 4 but it adds another 500 to the phone to get just 1TB thats it thats all I want a batter that will last 2 days with use yeah its great when they say it will last 1 week in stand by mode but who uses a phone like that and has like 2TB of internal storage My HD photos and videos take up a lot of space I dont need it any thinner I dont need it any faster I dont need the screen any clearer,,0.0,1khcwhx

comment,mra3rv3,Zapador,,0,2025-05-08 17:36:53,,,,I dont get the idea of a really slim phone how exactly does it matter Its the width and height that you really feel in the pocket it doesnt matter much if it is a little thicker or thinner If anything a very thin phone seems much more likely to break than a thicker one and I cant imagine they managed to fit a typical sized battery,,0.0,1khcwhx
comment,mrcc8gt,Shmogt,,2,2025-05-09 00:45:07,,,,I agree They tried this with the s6 and s6 edge back in the day It was very thin and light Everyone hated it because it was too thin to hold and the battery life wasnt good They made all the phones a but thicker with a bigger battery and everyone loved them Making a super thin phone makes no sense UNLESS it folds That way it would be as thick as a normal phone when in your pocket but be able to expand into a much larger phone,mra3rv3,1.0,1khcwhx
