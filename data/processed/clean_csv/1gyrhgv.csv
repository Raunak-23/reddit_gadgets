comment,lytkzan,ElDoRado1239,,2,2024-11-24 23:27:43,,,,Maybe you could have a lot of enoses all around the room which would scan many different places and then some central computing unit would process the data and find out whats happening without having to rely on ionization optical particle detection or thermal fluctuations altogether because all reactions that produce the ionizationparticlesheat will also produce some signature smells Depending on how tiny they can be they could be integrated into flooring and ceiling panels Or just paint in the future something like stucco should be able to carry their smaller versions Actually integrating thermal sensors should be mostly easy its the ionization and optical particle detectors that are problematic because they need cavity traps and proper airflow which also means they have to be at specific places and heights Those are the ones we probably want to get rid of,lyrxs9h,2.0,1gyrhgv
