comment,n33h589,zekromNLR,,13,2025-07-14 15:59:23,,,,Just blowing some fuses would still leave the data in the actual flash storage part intact My guess for a hardware self destruct would be a boost converter that can send a few hundred volts through the flash chips to destroy them,n334ozj,2.0,1lzj2fu
comment,n35j2jy,rebbsitor,,9,2025-07-14 21:46:39,,,,My guess for a hardware self destruct would be a boost converter that can send a few hundred volts through the flash chips to destroy them Not if theyre antifuses that connect memory cells directly to ground or power Bye Bye data Generally a selfdestruct mechanism on a drive does two things Wipes encryption keys so the data is unrecoverable Drives like this will have built in hardware encryption thats always enabled and wiping the key is effectively wiping the drive blows some kind of fuse antifuse that it can detect in firmware If detected it will refuse to initialize and theres no way to reset it,n33h589,3.0,1lzj2fu
comment,n381s0n,other_usernames_gone,,3,2025-07-15 07:39:13,,,,You dont want anything detected by firmware You dont want to assume anything will play nice Someone could take the chips out and read them with a different device If youre worried about espionage level security you want to wipe the actual chips,n35j2jy,4.0,1lzj2fu
comment,n392nmn,rebbsitor,,1,2025-07-15 12:43:42,,,,Someone could take the chips out and read them with a different device They could take the chips out and read AES256 encrypted data which is indistinguishable from random data and that will take longer than time remaining until the heat death of universe to decrypt without the encryption keys We use Aegis Fortress drives like this and this is the government accepted standard for data protection FIPS 1403 The reason key destruction is used is because its quick extremely secure and doesnt require a lot of power Wiping a multiterabyte device under its own power requires having a large battery and guaranteeing its always charged which is impractical takes a significant amount of time and could fail or be interrupted Wiping a 256 bit key contained in the crypto module is trivial fast and extremely secure You dont want anything detected by firmware What it detects is a permanent fuseantifuse that indicates the drive is disabled Its not so much a security feature as an antitheft feature It prevents the drive from being reinitialized with a new encryption key and being used by someone else Theres no way to reset it Thats usually optional on these kinds of drives Turning it on or off doesnt make the data any more or less secure,n381s0n,5.0,1lzj2fu
comment,n39rwxo,other_usernames_gone,,1,2025-07-15 14:55:01,,,,While I agree AES256 encrypted data is plenty secure the entire point of these drives is they hardware wipe the data For people ultra paranoid about quantum computers or just ultra paranoid in general Edit by these drives I mean the P250QM80 drive featured in this post Which at least according to the article attaches a high voltage across the chips to fry them This method sends a highvoltage burst directly to the NAND flash chips physically destroying them to make data recovery impossible Multistage LED indicators visually confirm the process,n392nmn,6.0,1lzj2fu

comment,n34vev6,CandyCrisis,,2,2025-07-14 19:54:38,,,,Sure but you could intentionally design a drive which releases magic smoke and melts the board while simultaneously leaving all the data on the drive itself intact Youd never know the difference,n34onsc,5.0,1lzj2fu

comment,n33bdgl,dark_sylinc,,8,2025-07-14 15:32:22,,,,Theres always the risk the data could be decrypted Physical destruction brings peace of mind As to how the data could be decrypted we never know which algorithms the vendor used Many algorithms including AES modes trade security for parallel execution performance at acceptable trade offs However this introducesincreases data correlation which means the encrypted data could be retrieved with enough dedication in acceptable time This isnt meant for consumerlevel encryption its supposed to prevent industriallevel espionage And that is assuming the key wipe didnt malfunction and is still retrievable with enough dedication the key may no longer be readable by the SSD but still is with dedicated Hardware,n326plm,3.0,1lzj2fu

comment,n32ssih,lordraiden007,,1,2025-07-14 14:01:34,,,,I mean it basically just triggers the already builtin SATA Secure Erase when a button is pushed On SSDs that operation takes 23 minutes which seems about right per their demonstration and since they state theyre concerned about power loss midway through the operation If thats a real concern how do they stop people from just unsoldering the NAND and reading the chips directly Why not just make it a SED with 256bit keys and have the button wipe the stored keys That would take the time for data sanitization down to under a second and it would be just as secure The physical destruction method seems kind of neat but I dont see why the drive needs to be the thing sending the high voltage current Could very easily be a separate module that does the physical destruction Also with high voltage current being the method I would worry about partially functional NAND still existing It might make the drive undetectable but any number of things could cause that It could have just fried the controller or the NAND could be only partially destroyed or the PCB could have been damaged Theres no real way for them to check if physical destruction worked either since voltage was the method for destruction For a device that touts use in secure settings Id want something more reliable This product seems like the first draft idea that I would have made in my data forensics class in college,,0.0,1lzj2fu
