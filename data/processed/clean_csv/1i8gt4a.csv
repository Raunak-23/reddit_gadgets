comment,m8tgnt5,KingGorillaKong,,257,2025-01-23 23:37:17,,,,No The PCB is smaller so the components are all jammed in closer Theres a lot more even heat soak from all the hot components that having a myriad of additional sensors to monitor hot spot probably became redundant when the hot spot is now about the same as the core temp on the FE cards May be a couple of degrees out but the GPU will still throttle based on hottest temperature if it reaches that point,m8terll,1.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8ueud7,noother10,,46,2025-01-24 02:45:07,,,,Yeah but without knowing that they have said its a smaller cooler but with more power going through the GPU thus removing something that was standard can easily be seen as trying to hide something It isnt shocking at all to be shocked at such a thing means you cant see it from the point of view of others,m8tlfmm,3.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8vckad,RobinVerhulstZ,,6,2025-01-24 06:33:55,,,,Aib pricing for the 5000 series are way above msrp and we already know theres supply issues then add scalpers and the perf value is going to tank significantly Now admittedly if one has 40905090 budget they probably already consider the prices fairly trivial But if the top end card needs 150mmÂ² more silicon and 30 more power to achieve 25 raster performance gains i think its fair to say that all the other 5000 series cards are pretty much going to be barely any better than the 4000 supers given the near identical stats Pretty much the only major increase is the AI stuff and gddr7 And the msrp is pretty much identical to the supers ontop of that,m8vb9ab,5.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8tm3mf,kneepel,,6,2025-01-24 00:05:48,,,,An issue I can foresee especially with different AIBs is what happens if youre seeing throttling but your edge temps arent showing it Ive seen of a number of newer AMDNvidia cards that have had a 20 degree delta between edge junction that in some cases were fixed simply with new paste and proper clamping pressure this could make that somewhat annoying to diagnose going forward now,m8tgnt5,2.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8tmrgg,KingGorillaKong,,1,2025-01-24 00:09:14,,,,Even heat soak of components solves this There shouldnt be more more than a couple degree difference between regular core temp and hot spot Since theres no cool gap between components that generate the primary sources of heat all this heat will have to go somewhere Its gonna heat soak everything around it like a laptop before being picked up by the increased number of heat pipes they use on the cooler which then fast wicks the heat to the fin stacks AIB can make 25 to 3 slot GPUs to provide even better thermal management by making taller fin stacks and spreading the heat pipe spacing out towards the ends of the pipes Im on the page that the way that everything spills heat to the PCB center the GPU core itself is now the new hot spot Why have multiple sensor monitors reporting the same sensor,m8tm3mf,3.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8trn0e,kneepel,,4,2025-01-24 00:34:42,,,,I mean youre totally right there shouldnt be a delta larger than a few degrees but it didnt stop some AIB manufacturers from using inadequate solutions or poor factory assemblies with some Radeon 6000 and RTX 3000 series cards from experience My own Sapphire Pulse 6700xt had over a 30 degree delta between edge and junction under load which was decreased to 15 after repasting and remounting the cooler Even though many heat generating components are close to each other it still seems like the different sensors provided some relative degree of accuracy or at least useful information in diagnosis,m8tmrgg,4.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8tt4kr,KingGorillaKong,,-1,2025-01-24 00:42:29,,,,What you are complaining about is an issue with the production and third party designed coolers and nothing directly relating to most of those products However AMD is known to have hotter GPUs and a larger optimal delta between core and hot spot temps And AMD isnt going above and beyond with their designs because theyre not targeting the top market Massively overhauling a cooler design is an expensive RD process And AMD is a different architecture GPU from nVidia GPUs have multiple sensors and a hot spot monitor for a reason Because those GPUs have significant deltas in temperatures across components But the 50 series doesnt have that reason for a hot spot monitor when the entire GPU is concentrated to the GPU die and memory dies all around the core in a very tight format where even heat soak occurs Even heat soak means that all those hot components are going to cause just everybody to be the same temperature Why have 5 temperature sensors in this GPU if they all report the same temperature Why keep a hot spot monitor if its not detecting a hotter component than the GPU core which is now surrounded and enclosed by all these hot components This design removes having to monitor for a hot spot temperature makes for in theory more affordable coolers to be produced for it and makes cooling more efficient As the benchmark results on temp for the 5090 is cooler than the 4090 hot spot temp but warmer than the core temp and hits 575W and up,m8trn0e,5.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8wsr5y,KingGorillaKong,,1,2025-01-24 14:01:01,,,,Theyre getting rid of the hot spot monitor because they felt is was redundant to have a monitor reporting the same temp as the GPU core Like I said before in another comment the delta between the hottest spot and the GPU core is probably only a degree or two out from each other if that and the reported GPU temp is likely what the hot spot is in general now with the new PCB and cooler design,m8v3euv,5.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8vkg2v,T-nash,,82,2025-01-24 07:46:55,,,,I dont know why people are making excuses based on smaller pcb size it does not matter there are no excuses Hotspot temp in comparison to core temp is one of the most reliable comparisons you can make to tell if your heatsink is not sitting flush on the gpu I have a 3090 that i have reapplied several times and a lot of times i get good gpu core temps but bad hotspot temps 17c difference normally you would think your gpu temp is fine until you realize hotspot is through the roof then wonder why your card died when it had good gpu temps After reapplying my paste a few times back and forth and proper tightening of the backplate you can lower the difference of core and hotspot to around 710c We dont know if liquid metal will make a difference but nevertheless there is zero reason to remove the sensor,,0.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8xgvhb,T-nash,,2,2025-01-24 16:02:47,,,,Agreed These card designs ever since the higher end 30xx and 40xx are horribly designed there were just too many issues with the added larger heatsink weight power consumption and heat released they used 10xx and 20xx pcb specs on something much more heavy and power hungry I am afraid all the other manufacturers of 50xx that didnt use the nvidia design are going to suffer from the same failures of the previous generations that were that big Modern thermal pads are losing good contact to the heatsink after several months this is observed and happening with many people thermal putty seems to be the solution like UTP8 I also have a problem with the gpu retention bracket its difficult to tighten them flush,m8x9lju,2.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vus74,luuuuuku,,-31,2025-01-24 09:32:19,,,,Why does it matter Do you even know how temperature reporting works There are way more sensors and usually none of them actually report the true temperatures Sensors are not right in the logic and therefore measure lower values than actually present For reporting multiple sensors are added together and offsets are added The temperature it reports is likely not even measured by a single sensor And thats also true for hotspot temperatures which often are also just measurements with an offset This is also the reason why you should never compare temperatures across architectures or vendors If NVIDIA did changes to their sensor reporting its definitely possible that the previous hot spot temperature does not work as previously any more Temperature readings are pretty much made up numbers and dont really represent the truth You have to trust the engineers on that If they say it doesnt make sense it likely doesnt If they wanted to they could have just reported fake numbers for hotspot and everyone would have been happy But redditors think they know better than engineers as always,m8vkg2v,1.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8whdjx,audigex,,8,2025-01-24 12:51:43,,,,They did Hotspot temperatures are a useful tool in determining correct seating Everything youre saying is unrelated The way this sensor works is that it reports the highest single temperature out of all the temperature sensors on the card Its actually an abstraction of various sensors which is what makes it so useful When that sensor reads a value significantly higher than your overall GPU temperature it likely means that your cooler is not seated correctly on the die and part of the die is getting significantly hotter than the average Its therefore very useful for determining if your cooler is seated correctly So why does none of what you said have any bearing on the validity of their point There are way more sensors Yes Thats literally why this quasisensor is useful it gives the max of those sensors and usually none of them actually report the true temperatures Doesnt matter as long as theyre all vaguely in the right ballpark it still tells you whether your hotspot is much hotter than your overall GPU and you therefore have a hotspot For reporting multiple sensors are added together and offsets are added The temperature it reports is likely not even measured by a single sensor You are wrong for this specific sensor Literally the ENTIRE point of this sensor is that it doesnt do that And thats also true for hotspot temperatures which often are also just measurements with an offset No it isnt Temperature readings are pretty much made up numbers and dont really represent the truth This one worked as proven by hundreds of people whove reseated their cooler and found that the hotspot temperature reduced to be much closer to the average temperatures If they wanted to they could have just reported fake numbers for hotspot and everyone would have been happy If discovered people would have complained for the exact same reasons plus nVidia being misleading Chances are that people would have noticed when suddenly all reports of hotspots vanished Either way it wouldve been a dick move because its misleading,m8vyqv3,4.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8wjhd9,luuuuuku,,-14,2025-01-24 13:05:36,,,,How do you know that the regular reported temperature is not the hottest temperature What makes you think that the highest temperature is not used for overheating reporting and safety measures,m8whdjx,5.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8wr7kz,audigex,,11,2025-01-24 13:52:15,,,,Uhh because the hotspot temperature is almost always higher than the regular reported temperature Have you ever even looked at these temperatures It seems slightly baffling that youd even say that if you had ANY understanding whatsoever of what were talking about here,m8wjhd9,6.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8vvqnm,T-nash,,11,2025-01-24 09:42:24,,,,Really Are you going to pretend weve never had corporates dupe us and say a flawed design is fine to not take responsibility Ive been watching repair videos for years and guess what almost all burned cards are a result of high temperatures BELOW the maximum rated temp Heck just go and Google evga 3090 ftw vram temp issues and have a good look they cant even get their vram thermal interface correctly those said engineers didnt think of backplate changing shape over time from thermal expansion and contraction I have a whole post about this on the evga subreddit Want to put blind trust in engineers Go for it just dont watch repair videos Heck you have the whole 12vhpwr connector of the 4090 story designed by engineers Have you seen the 5090 vram temps They used the same pads as previous generation their engineer said he was happy with them i took a look at 5090 reviews and theyre hitting 90c despite the fact they gddr7 uses half the power of gddr6 Give it a few months for thermal expansion to kick in and lets see if 100c wont kick in as was the case for evga cards,m8vus74,2.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vw37p,luuuuuku,,-9,2025-01-24 09:46:01,,,,Well you dont get the point These are made up numbers If they wanted to deceive why not report lower temperatures That doesnt make sense to explain changes if theyre doing it to hurt consumers The 12VHPWR connector in itself is fine The issue is about build quality not the design itself,m8vvqnm,3.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vwcxf,T-nash,,7,2025-01-24 09:48:51,,,,Theyre not made up they have a formula behind them that is as close as it can get and i have reapplied my cooler enough times to tell it reveals misalignment 12vhpwr has engineering flaws did you watch Steves over an hour video going through what went wrong In any case what is build quality if not engineering decisions,m8vw37p,4.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vxqzg,luuuuuku,,2,2025-01-24 10:03:01,,,,They kinda are What do you think how it works You can add any offsets and thats it If NVIDIA wanted to deceive users why make this decision public You mean the overall bad video that was completely flawed Why arent are there any reported cases of 12VHPWR burning down in data centers where they were used with even more power The connector itself is based on a known and proven MOLEX design which spec can actually handle than 12VHPWR The connector itself is fine but if you use cheap materials and dont even meet the spec then the s are hardly to blame,m8vwcxf,5.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8w5c70,T-nash,,7,2025-01-24 11:17:05,,,,You obviously didnt watch Steves investigation on YouTube where it was proven bad engineering decisions were made yet youre here debating quality without researching into it I wont humor you further,m8vxqzg,6.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8v57ry,iamflame,,4,2025-01-24 05:34:15,,,,Is there specifically a hotspot sensor or just some math that determines core6 is currently the hotspot and reports its temperature,m8u5n91,2.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vvgc4,luuuuuku,,0,2025-01-24 09:39:23,,,,No there is actually no sensor that gets reported directly There are many more sensors close to logic and then there are algorithms that calculate and estimate true temperatures based on that Hot spot temperatures are often estimations based on averages and deviations Usually not a single sensor actually measures what gets reported because the logic itself gets a bit hotter So they take thermal conductivity into their calculations and try to estimate what the temperatures would be They take averages and something like the standard deviations to estimate hot spots You have to trust the engineers on this but redditors think they know better If engineers think that the hotspot value doesnt make sense in their setup it likely doesnt If they wanted to they could have made up something,m8v57ry,3.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8xl89j,iamflame,,1,2025-01-24 16:22:56,,,,That makes sense Heat flow through a known material and shape isnt hard to stimulate if you know the heat sources and sinks as well,m8vvgc4,4.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8ugnn0,lordraiden007,,28,2025-01-24 02:56:18,,,,Because if theres no hotspot sensor the temperature can be far higher than it should be at certain locations on the GPU die This means if your GPU runs hot due to overclocking or just inadequate stock cooling you could be doing serious damage to other parts of the die that are hotter and arent reporting their temperature Basically its dangerous to the device lifespan and makes it more dangerous to overclock or selfcool your device,m8u9pao,3.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vc35d,SentorialH1,,-2,2025-01-24 06:29:47,,,,Thats why they used the liquid metal And theyve already demonstrated their engineering for the cooler is incredibly impressive Gamers nexus has a great breakdown on performance and cooling and were incredibly impressed This review was available like 24 hours ago,m8ugnn0,4.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8vcfvv,lordraiden007,,7,2025-01-24 06:32:51,,,,They asked why it could be important and as I said its mainly just important if you do something beyond what NVIDIA wants you to do The coolers arent designed with the thermal headroom to allow people to significantly overclock and the lack of hotspot temps could make using your own cooler dangerous to the GPU so taking the cooler off and using a water block would be inadvisable for example Neither or both of those example cases could be relevant to the person I responded to but they could matter to someone,m8vc35d,5.0,1i8gt4a

comment,m8vlbq9,Global_Network3902,,4,2025-01-24 07:55:23,,,,In addition to what others have pointed out it can help troubleshooting cooling issues If youve noticed that your GPU hovers around 75C with an 80C hotspot but then some day down the road you notice that its sitting at 75C with a 115C hotspot that can indicate something is amiss In addition if you are repasting or applying new Liquid Metal it can be a good indicator that you have good coverage andor mounting pressure if you have a huge gap between the two temperatures I think most peoples issue with removing it is why From my understanding meaning this could be incorrect BS GPUs have dozens of thermal sensors around the die and the hotspot reading simply shows the highest one Again please somebody correct me if this is wrong,m8u9pao,3.0,1i8gt4a
comment,m8usyio,KawiNinja,,-2,2025-01-24 04:10:57,,,,If I had to guess its so they can pump out the performance numbers they need without admitting where they got the performance from We already know its using more power and based off this I dont think they found a great way to get rid of the extra heat that comes from that extra power,m8u9pao,3.0,1i8gt4a
