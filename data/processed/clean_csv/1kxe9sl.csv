comment,muqx9oh,_BMS,,1,2025-05-28 18:50:52,,,,I hate this new OneUI 7 update Had to spend hours defucking my phone and tablet Its been about a week and I still hate how they removed alphabetical sorting of the app screen if you want it in pages instead of one giant vertical scroll The old widgets looked much better too instead of this weird thing that Samsung is doing by trying to copy halfApple iOS halfGoogle Pixel design choices for various things,mupzj79,5.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mur265l,JMccovery,,1,2025-05-28 19:14:05,,,,Its the power button Samsung calls it the side keybutton With One UI 6 I think Samsung set the doublepress action to Assistant and the pressandhold action to power menu With One UI 7 the doublepress action is whatever you set it to and the pressandhold is now your default assistant Its basically now a Galaxy AI button,muqzi0s,5.0,1kxe9sl

comment,muuaon7,benanderson89,,1,2025-05-29 06:47:45,,,,Its why I stopped buying iPhones and Samsungs My last three phones have been Xiaomi because at least here in the UK you get damn good specs and a nice camera for half the cost of a Smasnug flagship Mate has a OnePlus for the same reason,murry3c,6.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mup6iac,ITGuy7337,,8,2025-05-28 13:48:05,,,,Youre totally right Some people at my work use the Gemini AI pretty often just for random information I doubt theyre laying in bed awake at night wishing they had a dedicated button to do it but if that button existed they would be using it Re the downvoting thing I see this has both a flaw and a strength of reddit I dont think I would get rid of it in its current form though Look at youtube There is a upvote and downvote button but only the upvote does anything visible and they hide the number of downvotes So whats the point of those buttons at all if all you can do is validate videos and comments On the other side of that Reddit coin very often posts and comments that are not in line with the groupthink are essentially removed by downvoting it Thus not allowing alternative ideas Hell even moderators enforce certain narratives whether political or whatever in their individual Subs Now that I dont agree with I think it should be free discussion on whatever topic unless youre really really crossing the line,muoteef,2.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mupi6w5,Enderkr,,2,2025-05-28 14:45:54,,,,Any AIassistant button needs to be programmable to do whatever else the user wants I agree I personally get a lot of use out of assistant gemini etc and would like a hardware button like someone else said the old Pixels had that squeeze button and MAN did I love that but I understand that not everyone does But I think having a hardware button you can set to do whatever you want thats useful AF Id use it for AI but maybe youd use it for a flashlight and should be able to do that The anticonsumer stuff issuch a large conversation that needs to be had and it feels useless most of the time I dont feel like theres any moderatetolarge sized company that actually really gives a shit about their customers and I mean any company from tech to food Consumers get the shit end of the stick all the time,mupg86z,3.0,1kxe9sl
comment,muq5y03,brickmaster32000,,2,2025-05-28 16:39:09,,,,Its the fact that this technology has become ubiquitous before it was ready for prime time You mean like every successful technology When cars where first adopted the where horrible pieces of shit that didnt even have proper roads ready for them Movies where shoved out on everybody before they could figure out how to add sound or color The cell phones you know enjoy were originally being sold when they where massive bricks You are completely oblivious to how any of this works This is how every product is released and has been released since the beginning of time There is never a point when you reach perfection and waiting to release a product until then just means you never release it ever Good enough is in fact good enough And this is in fact good enough for most people The reason it is spreading is because no matter how much you personally hate it it is being well received,mupg86z,3.0,1kxe9sl
comment,muqnnvj,eriverside,,1,2025-05-28 18:05:05,,,,But Programmable buttons have been around for a decade Ive been double tapping the power button to turn on my camera since at least OnePlus 6 probably before that too Why do I need a dedicated preprogrammed button just for that How about they give us a couple of programmable buttons and we do what we want with them I dont even mind if theres a suggesteddefault function out of the box but let me do with my device whats best for me One Plus just axed their rocker which is a shame because I dont know if theres another device that lets you physically push a switch to set your phone to mutevibratesound without looking atunlocking your phone,mup5ine,2.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mv091yv,ok_if_you_say_so,,2,2025-05-30 03:27:04,,,,Oh no the slight inconvenience of having to plan ahead Sounds impossible may as well throw my hands up and say its impossible for everyone All I said is I dont carry my camera equipement around with me 247 so it ends up being available for a lot fewer moments than ones I would like to capture Thats all No need to mischaracterize me I also didnt make any statements about anybody else but myself and how I use it Also youll still have 400 phone with a camera and the shutter speed might not be as good but still going to be fine in most situations As for not being able to share your photos Jesus Christ how addicted are you to validation You can literally wait until you get home and upload them Hours later Not days hours Nobody gives a shit what youre doing minute to minute But again you have your cheaper phone to get that dopamine hit if you really need it I have family who lives 3 hours away They like to be a part of my and my kids lives When I can take a photo of my kid doing something goofy before school and send it to my family members on the way out the door they get to feel included Later after the kids get home from school and they call grandma and grandpa on the portal they get to joke about the goofy thing the kid was doing that morning They can encourage my daughter to not be nervous for the play shes putting on at school the next day I can record her performance and send it to the family as its happening They can celebrate her wins with her while its happening to her not weeks later when dad finally gets a chance to dump his SD card Technology lets us stay connected Sharing doesnt just refer to social media I also just enjoy photography as a hobby and its important to me to preserve the photos I take Generally speaking its easier to maintain my photo collection with a phone than a camera and computer I do both but the phone is just easier and my life is busy I lived with a potato phone for a long time I sat through enough forced moments where I had to get everyone to stay still while the camera did its thing or just missed moments entirely because they passed before the camera app was ready for me An alwaysavailable camera just works better for me It sounds like you need this the same way I do because apparently you cant stay away from your phone I have that same issue its addicting this hell so Im having to set up inconveniences to try and make my life better and spend more quality time with my kids rather than a light box that brings no real joy I spend very little time on my phone I keep it in my pocket so I can communicate when needed especially as it pertains to my job Because its already there it means the camera it comes with is my most commonly reliedupon one Sorry to hear you struggle with keeping away from yours if using a cheaper one helps you with that I dont see any problem with that approach Especially if it helps you stay more involved with your family,muuzouj,6.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mupfvxn,TripTrav419,,18,2025-05-28 14:34:57,,,,This is a ridiculous claim The issue isnt hardware The issue is theyre running out of marketable products that make the next generation even look like an upgrade The phone i wrote this comment on has more computing power than the entire combined computing power of the whole world when we first put man on the moon and my iPhone 16 pro is like 37 TIMES more powerful than the flagship phones from 5 years ago The hardware isnt the problem most consumer phone hardware is being significantly underutilized The problem is that theyre struggling to convince consumers that the newest generation is any more valuable than the prior one Because theres only so much that the average consumer needs in regard to their phone So instead of convincing consumer even though theyre definitely trying theyre convincing shareholders who only care about numbers that are irrelevant to most consumers like how the AI market is worth billions of dollars even though many people dont even care about ai or even like it and even though most peoples experiences with ai are this is misleading and this is garbage Theyre running out of wealth to extract from the commonperson theyre running out of ideas to convince consumers that they need and theyre panicking and instead of doing whats right and thinking of the consumers and taking losses by making devices that are repairable and have longer lives theyre doubling down on what they know in a frenzy of failed attempts at trying to shove shit down peoples throats they dont want or need,muoncf7,1.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mur0e31,LordBiscuits,,-1,2025-05-28 19:05:37,,,,All of those things are by design The battery degrades within a set time frame the phones are slowed down slowly and progressively with software updates during its lifespan the screens seem to have common points of failure which go with the most menial of taps and the charger port breaks for the absolute sport of it All these things are fixable but they dont want you to fix it they want you buying a new handset We should have phones now that last a decade have replaceable common parts and are so robust you could drop them from a helicopter onto concrete but we dont because Apple et al want our money,muq9zvl,3.0,1kxe9sl
comment,mur0yrs,jawshoeaw,,2,2025-05-28 19:08:25,,,,Debatable I think by design as the batteries last at least 3 years and they are cheap to swap out And screens are cheap and easy to swap though you might get an annoying alert that its not apple certified still will work iPhones at least are easy to repair Most people dont bother in my experience but thats hardly the manufacturers fault I agree they could build a decade phone but it would be significantly heavier and historically technology has improved fast enough there was no point Who knows what the future brings but you also dont wanna put yourself out of business selling a device that lasts too long,mur0e31,4.0,1kxe9sl

comment,muozgzh,Big_Pair_75,,2,2025-05-28 13:09:46,,,,You are objectively wrong The internet has been vital for many advancements It used to be if you wanted to read a research paper youd better have connections or you werent going to see it In the modern day scientists work with one another across the globe So many things that save lives today would not be nearly as effective Everything from world news to disaster relief would be dramatically slowed Have attention spans taken a hit Yes Because they are no longer as necessary Our brain focuses on developing other things instead Intelligence until very recently thanks to the pandemic has only been trending up We are far more informed than we ever have been that just means were also better informed about people being idiots,muovm4p,5.0,1kxe9sl
comment,mup1epu,Naojirou,,2,2025-05-28 13:20:33,,,,You are defining the metrics then calling it objectively wrong And you are looking at a particular niche in humanity and measuring what has been accomplished by humanity on its peak rather than the general qualities that define being human We dont need attention spans because they are no longer necessary is actually where you should be peeping through Why Is ADHD a desirable trait Should people have less attention spans because theres nothing to pay that much attention to When you are focusing on 001 of the population you are disregarding the 50 which they can vote and have the power to bring calamity Even though internet made access to info easier it made the spread of shitty kind of information easier The ones with power as per before with regular broadcast has the key to control what these 50 is fed with just easier If any of these advancements made things better we would have better housing better healthcare better everything We just have bests that are better than the bests of before while we have collectively worse average,muozgzh,6.0,1kxe9sl

comment,muoy57q,Big_Pair_75,,0,2025-05-28 13:02:16,,,,A lot of the reasons the Industrial Revolution was a painful adjustment arent really a factor with AI 1 Industrialization lead to a large rush of people to more densely populated areas which were not set up for that number of people Not a factor with AI 2 Industrialization meant a much more dangerous working environment Chemicals heavy machinery etc The danger with AI isnt really innate in the same way If you dont put it in charge of something dangerous negative impact is minimal 3 Weve done this before Worker safety wasnt a factor in those days and although that is being clawed back in the US it isnt due to AI 4 One of the biggest downsides was over working which if anything we are going to have the opposite problem And even setting that all aside what is the alternative Never progress because change is difficult Im sure future generations wont look back on us to kindly if our excuse for not curing cancer or reversing the aging process was itll be too tough on us We should definitely be proactive in mitigating damage but the idea that this will be apocalyptic Very very very unlikely In fact with climate change going as it has been it may be what saves us,muouwf8,5.0,1kxe9sl
comment,mup2oh2,tomrichards8464,,1,2025-05-28 13:27:34,,,,If you dont put it in charge of something dangerous negative impact is minimal I think given a smart enough AI this ceases to be true because it will find a way to covertly put itself in charge of something dangerous or to put it another way for a sufficiently advanced AI being put in charge of anything is dangerous But that old doomer argument is for the birds we are in an arms race between ideologically opposed superpowers which could easily develop into a hot war as soon as the second half of this decade superhuman AI would provide an enormous advantage both on the battlefield and at strategic level so it will be put in charge of extremely dangerous things with great speed and wildly insufficient consideration of safety,muoy57q,6.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mus4o8c,Big_Pair_75,,1,2025-05-28 22:20:40,,,,I think the main issue is a miscommunication I am not saying generative AI and analytical AI are the same but that you cant just group analytical AI tech under good and generative under bad or of no value to society AI that produce new medications are a form of generative AI LLMs one of the most popular will be very necessary for your average person to communicate with AI We cant have computer scientists working as translators to tell the AI what we want it to do Hell translating one language to another is done better with an LLM because an LLM understands context When it comes to utility the lines are blurry as there are many practical applications to generative AI And thats before getting into how much easier it makes finding information when it comes to research This idea that generative AI has no practical applications is what Im arguing against,mupmynj,5.0,1kxe9sl
comment,mut1900,saera-targaryen,,1,2025-05-29 01:23:45,,,,Yeah i guess the argument i was saying is misinformation was the its all AI and the line is blurry because that is only the PR spin that generative AI VCcapital funded companies want you to believe I think its pretty important we dont let that work because its important to be able to identify which one you are using and what the pros and cons are so that you use them more effectively Someone being told they have a new AI to say sort comments as positive and negative from their product postings online and they assume that it is powered by an LLM they may be concerned about copyright or electricity use or hallucinations when they really should be concerned about confidence stats and accuracy percentage because its just an entirely different product Its the same way that it matters if someone knows if some app is using your camera or your microphone or both the handwaviness that these VC companies do is leading to the large drop in technical literacy in our population They want us to hand wave this stuff so we stop knowing it and they can sell that knowledge back to us I am not a fan of this and push back where I can,mus4o8c,6.0,1kxe9sl

comment,mupldsj,green_link,,-1,2025-05-28 15:01:01,,,,The phone will use more power when theres no signal because it will search for a signal more frequently than when it was a signal and yes when it has a signal it will still search to check to make sure it still has one that is a functionality of the phone not something that can be fixed on a phone The only fix is to stay within the service providers service area or for the service provider to expand their service area Spam calls are again an issue with the service providers They could fix that shit but dont bother Literally Your MDM issues are really more tied to how the MDM is set up on the phone I know for a fact that with intune you can have it set up to separate work and personal data on the phone and when its removed only removed the work data On both iPhone and Android But if its initially set up with intune then yes the only way to remove it is to wipe the whole phone MDMs are designed that way to protect company data Single copies of Company data shouldnt be stored on mobileportable devices,muotysj,1.0,1kxe9sl
