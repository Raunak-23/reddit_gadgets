post,1k07f13,chrisdh79,Multi-sensor stethoscope excels at detecting faulty heart valves | The device is sensitive and accurate enough that it can be used over clothing,1341,2025-04-16 00:24:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1k07f13/multisensor_stethoscope_excels_at_detecting/,33.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mncb33v,LITTLE-GUNTER,,78,2025-04-16 02:09:11,,,,this is honestly huge socalled silent cardiovascular disease is a massive MASSIVE factor in early mortality and being able to diagnose faulty valves potentially before they start producing clinicallydiagnosable symptoms would mean doubledigit increases in survival rates,,0.0,1k07f13

comment,mne4owb,nonowords,,4,2025-04-16 11:38:11,,,,Honestly the one thing this headline made me think is how the hell is the standard practice for checking hearts and lungs still listen to it with an ear cone I feel like there are 0 good reasons stethoscopes to be in use today,mncb33v,1.0,1k07f13
comment,mni1ra1,LITTLE-GUNTER,,8,2025-04-17 00:01:53,,,,stethoscopes are still kind of the goldstandard for diagnosing things like pleuritis and other respiratory issues theyre cheap readily available require basically no training to use other than education on what to listen for and have been proven to be effective for decades upon decades now,mne4owb,2.0,1k07f13
comment,mni98ld,nonowords,,2,2025-04-17 00:49:22,,,,I totally get that theyre effective otherwise they wouldnt be used its just im surprised that what is essentially a twocupsandastring phone is where that development has stayed at for so long,mni1ra1,3.0,1k07f13
comment,mnjh5oi,LITTLE-GUNTER,,3,2025-04-17 05:58:30,,,,classic case of aint broke so dont fix it id assume medicine isnt exactly a field thats averse to technological advances and the basic design has received gradual but significant improvements over the last few centuries the original design was basically just a wooden ear trumpet and weve come a looooong way since then edit a quick google search reveals that there are apparently Dopplertype ultrasound stethoscopes specifically for discerning things like heart murmurs supposedly the military use one thats capable of quality auscultation at a 110dB ambient noise level which is FUCKING loud,mni98ld,4.0,1k07f13
comment,mncmy8s,Timmy24000,,34,2025-04-16 03:25:11,,,,Back when I went to medical school you were taught to detect valvular heart disease with your stethoscope Now the docs barely touch you They just order an echocardiogram A good physical exam is becoming a lost skill And yes an echocardiogram and other diagnostics are definitely great tools but overused due to lack of clinical skills,,0.0,1k07f13
comment,mnd00ld,GuerrillaRodeo,,19,2025-04-16 05:03:43,,,,I recently diagnosed a later confirmed by echo firstdegree aortic valve stenosis just with my stethoscope The patient had no symptoms it was during a routine examination Makes me kind of proud actually The one thing Ive never skimped on is a good stethoscope a 300 Littmann is well worth the price,mncmy8s,1.0,1k07f13
comment,mnehavj,Timmy24000,,1,2025-04-16 12:59:36,,,,Ive had a difficult time recently because I have to wear hearing aids now I have to remove them to use my normal stethoscope will most likely buy an electronic one with Bluetooth capabilities Not sure if it will be as good but hopefully,mnd00ld,2.0,1k07f13

comment,mnf6syn,LastSummerGT,,2,2025-04-16 15:14:30,,,,What happened to physical exams Growing up as a kid it was very hands on Now as an adult its just a bunch of questions on a screen the doctor fills out without looking at me while I sit in a chair,mncmy8s,1.0,1k07f13

comment,mnh38k9,LastSummerGT,,1,2025-04-16 20:51:36,,,,They didnt scan me but they did a basic blood panel and told me which numbers were out of range,mnffhbc,3.0,1k07f13

comment,mnf2x98,demoshots,,2,2025-04-16 14:55:24,,,,My pediatrician correctly identified an issue in my heart with just his stethoscope It turned out to be an aortic aneurysm with a bicuspid aortic valve Every cardiologist I have ever seen has said it is beyond impressive that he caught it Hasnt caused me any problems in life but I have been fortunate to know about it and monitor it regularly,,0.0,1k07f13
comment,mnf4fms,chillichilli,,1,2025-04-16 15:02:46,,,,My son has a bicuspid aortic valve that was also caught by our family doctor with a stethoscope Thankful to her he is doing great and is monitored yearly,mnf2x98,1.0,1k07f13
comment,mncwgfo,PM_ME_YOUR_REPORT,,4,2025-04-16 04:35:35,,,,I dont understand why we dont yet have an electronic stethoscope you put on someone and it automatically analyses and alerts to problems Even possibly send the results to an online doctor Needs something cheap enough and foolproof anyone can just put on a family member and get an instant guide,,0.0,1k07f13
comment,mnd1yav,datengrab,,5,2025-04-16 05:20:15,,,,We do actually Just one random example Edit It probably wont replace a visit to the doc but it might be good enough to diagnose that something is off,mncwgfo,1.0,1k07f13

comment,mqtm1gy,rgnissen202,,1,2025-05-06 02:49:54,,,,I got lucky I had to go to the ER with Cardiac Tamponade caused by a Pericardial Effusion that my cardiologist just happened to find during what was supposed to be a routine echocardiogram I was only starting to see a cardiologist because my primary care doctor heard a murmur during a visit A visit that was only scheduled because my wife asked me too because even light jogging had me out of breath something I hadnt even noticed until it was pointed out to me When I think about that chain of events and how if any one had not happened I wouldnt be here it legit scares me Ive learned to listen to my body and go see a professional at the first hint of trouble now Cant help but feel something like this would make it easier,,0.0,1k07f13
