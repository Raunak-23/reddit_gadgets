comment,lvqazzz,Zomunieo,,150,2024-11-06 15:57:31,,,,Theres actually room for a hardware shakeup The GPU is the most expensive component now and the most power hungry Logic would dictate you design the motherboard around that and tack on a CPU but the typical PC design is still CPU centric Even big CPUs are small compared to GPUs Might as well have them integrated All a modern GPU really needs is some USB and NVMe slots to be a full computer,lvprey4,2.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvsh72n,Emu1981,,101,2024-11-06 21:49:57,,,,All a modern GPU really needs is some USB and NVMe slots to be a full computer This is incorrect Modern GPUs struggle with general purpose computing eg running a game engine while excelling at specific workloads eg rendering 2D representations of a 3D scene while modern CPUs excel at general purpose computing eg running a game engine while struggling with certain specific workloads eg rendering 2D representations of a 3D scene This is why modern computers have both a CPU and GPU because now you have a setup that will excel at both the general purpose workloads and specific workloads that the average person will ask of modern computers This is also why the average person will never have a quantum computer sitting on their desk but rather will have a quantum coprocessor inside their classical computer Quantum computing excels at certain workloads while being absolutely terrible at most other workloads,lvqazzz,3.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvtgpba,OneBigBug,,21,2024-11-07 00:54:10,,,,Logic would dictate you design the motherboard around that and tack on a CPU but the typical PC design is still CPU centric I can think of a reason why the Central Processing Unit might be more central to the PC than the Graphics Processing Unit A CPU is central because it actually does all the computer things You can have a computer without a GPU you cant have a computer without a CPU A GPU that becomes the central processor wouldnt become GPU centric it would need to be redesigned so much as to become itself a CPU It would just be a CPU with an incredibly large iGPU presumably I do think were long overdue for vertical Coplanar perhaps mounting of the GPU though because of the power and therefore heat and therefore size demands of modern GPUs I can imagine some sort of ATXlike standard where your CPU and all its associated components were themselves something more videocard sized and you connected a bunch of equallysized cards together rather than one big motherboard that we strap everything else to Sort of like the trash can mac pro if you unrolled it Its unreasonable to expect so much of PCIe brackets,lvqazzz,3.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvumety,LaxVolt,,2,2024-11-07 05:06:47,,,,To your last point this has actually been a thing for a while A lot of older industrial computers would have an ITX motherboard with extended pci slots for a dual slot cpu board that plugged in like a large graphics card In addition some of the nuc pro models have this architecture where the cpu unit and the gpu unit are mounted side by side,lvtgpba,4.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvuqg8x,tastyratz,,1,2024-11-07 05:39:09,,,,yes and no on reorienting the GPU Yes were asking a lot of the bracketsslots from the most extreme top end large cards But reorientation is either displacing the expansion slots for more than just GPUs like 2510gbe cards wifi cards storage adapters etc or if not then its going where the 3555 bays are It could be rotated 90 degrees but then it blocks airflow across a case If it was fully coplanar youre not going to want to give up other peripherals so the case just grows deeper Honestly what Id rather see first is getting away from PCIE slots and moving towards interconnecting internally with PCIE over thunderbolt cables Then we could flexibly modularly mount anything anywhere Maybe even see repurposing 35 slots for standalone accessories that would have otherwise been a slot card That being said any of this gets in the way of case compatibility and interoperability of existing peripherals largely driven by very niche needs excessively large high power top tier gfx cards,lvtgpba,4.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvv18od,ElusiveGuy,,1,2024-11-07 07:17:10,,,,Honestly what Id rather see first is getting away from PCIE slots and moving towards interconnecting internally with PCIE over thunderbolt cables As much as Id love that in concept I dont think thats ever going to happen for bandwidth reasons if nothing else Thunderbolt 5 gives you a grand total of 4 PCIe 40 lanes PCIe 50 gives twice the perlane throughput and a fullfeatured slot gives you 16 lanes for a total of 8x the throughput Now current gen eg 4090 GPUs dont actually use PCIe 50 x16 but they do use PCIe 40 x16 you do start seeing a performance dip at x8 and it gets pretty significant at x4 Ref Gaming will likely suffer less than content creation as far as throughput requirements go But its still suboptimal and therefore unlikely to be seen in conventional PCs And AFAIK theres a significant amount of signal conditioning required to get even PCIe 40 working over the much longer distance of a TB cable so not only is the interface more expensive but Id be surprised if they manage to get PCIe 50 or higher into a cable form anytime soon TB has always lagged PCIe by approx a generation so it could happen but will be a while at least,lvuqg8x,5.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvwhe7a,tastyratz,,1,2024-11-07 14:34:56,,,,Now current gen eg 4090 GPUs dont actually use PCIe 50 x16 but they do use PCIe 40 x16 you do start seeing a performance dip at x8 and it gets pretty significant at x4 Ref Yes and no There is an almost tiny statistical variance there where the difference is incredibly minor until you all but choke out the card That link Ive used to argue the other point all but the most grossly overpremium cards dont come close to really fully utilizing modern PCIE lanes We just dont need them for most cases And in those instances Those cards that really WANT all those good good lanes Why dont we just use 2 thunderbolt cables to connect them or 4 if we ever really need to A pack of plugs on the bottom of a motherboard similar to how SATA connector blocks look for thunderbolt to all the peripherals would displace all the slot space and render full size boards obsolete If modern remote gfx cards had the same bolt pattern of the bottom of an ATX board it might even allow us to retrofit existing chassis by making all new boards mITX and bolting graphics directly underneath it or maybe small graphics cards sit in a drive slot or bolt to the top or bottom of the case A cable gives you options We could see a resurgence of cases that have that broken out subtunnel under them just for graphics with big fans moving fresh air across them You might even see better performance from better cooling and better packaging than the theoretical lanes give you I think we CAN do pcie lanes over thunderbolt and were ready for a modern interconnect thats adequately fast enough to support our needs The card can be flexibly located in the case and IO can be handled with a remote daughter board that attaches to the case Hell if we really needed it for specialty connections there is no reason we couldnt plug in 5 thunderbolts and give a card 20x it goes the other direction too should the need ACTUALLY come about I also think we have a lot to gain by letting us have more flexibility in how lanes are assigned without being 1x4x8x16x configurations Maybe we see 2x or 3x nongfx cards We could see cheaper motherboards with less lanes because we dont need to burn them up on slots not in use Ultimately thats the real benefit to new PCIE standards doing more on less lanes,lvv18od,6.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvqy4ie,TwoBionicknees,,68,2024-11-06 17:40:06,,,,Pretty much none of that makes sense gaming is primarily gpu limited meaning more people upgrade their gpu than cpu throughout the lifespan of a build its also easiest to upgrade a gpu GPus are not latency sensitive cpus are incredibly latency sensitive and to run gaming code you need a cpu for the OS and game code itself which is all latency sensitive which means distance from cpu to major components like ram is by far magnitudes more crucial than the gpu integrated gpus and making other things modular is like the worst idea in pc building history Logic would dictate you design the motherboard around that and tack on a CPU but the typical PC design is still CPU centric if you know absolutely nohting about cpu gpu and pc architecture sure in reality no it wouldnt Surprisingly the entire industry and millions of hardware designers all randomly went against logic or youre wrong,lvqazzz,3.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvr6shg,Zuiia,,13,2024-11-06 18:19:26,,,,I agree with most of this but I think the OC meant that it would make sense for the CPU to be integrated in the motherboard which would be in line with most of your points,lvqy4ie,4.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvr7ajn,im_thatoneguy,,-14,2024-11-06 18:21:41,,,,GPUs are extremely latency sensitive so latency sensitive that they usually are on a full generation newer RAM and memory The only reason you can say GPUs arent latency sensitive is because we already have a nearly full computer on the GPU Its like a second computer connected by a highspeed network When you integrate a CPU and GPU you are removing the redundancy of holding the game in CPU and GPU memory if they can both share the same game state Apple has shown how powerful it is to have a SoC that shares memory for allowing a 48GB GPU on an enthusiast class laptop To get 48GB of memory on a GPU normally you need a like 20k Nvidia GPU The Apple M series processors have already demonstrated the potential performance especially of single threaded applications by pairing a cpu core with next gen memory,lvqy4ie,4.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvrangm,TwoBionicknees,,21,2024-11-06 18:36:51,,,,By the very basic nature of a gpu Something that is highly parralel with vastly lower clockspeeds is inherently less latency sensitive than something that is highly sequential and requires a higher clock speed Gpus are NOT latency sensitive compared to cpus full stop they require massive bandwidth and the memory they use has insanely higher latency than system ram its why your gpu pcb has gddr and not ddr45etc Integrating things can help but its not proof that they are equally latency sensitive as a cpu at all,lvr7ajn,5.0,1gkzhol

comment,lztbcpk,powerhcm8,,1,2024-12-01 02:49:59,,,,Thats if they succeed they have a good chance but its not granted While intel is way ahead in terms of sales they have been leaving a lot to desire recently more competition should be good and I dont think will dethrone Intel at least not in less than a decade they would have to release an amazing product at a great price for do that And they are just starting so it will probably take at least 3 generations to catch up And meanwhile Intel and AMD will be watching and trying to respond accordingly As example you can see how Intel is doing with their GPUs although its possible that Nvidia will have better luck with CPUs than Intel with GPUs Overall I think by the end of the decade we will have a healthy 3way competition on CPU and GPU market the monopoly probably only has a chance of happening in the next decade I hope no one give up,lzt8ums,3.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvqezdr,kevihaa,,3,2024-11-06 16:15:14,,,,Hard to tell If their goal is to extend the hockey stick profitability graph even further then the real money is in either data centers or OEMs that supply large businesses In both cases there is little appetite for anything flashy or untested even if it is better or more importantly better for the price As a result I could see a path for NVIDIA where they essentially start with a gaming CPU and then use that niche to get established in the market Pure speculation of course and NVIDIA certainly just has absolutely stupid amounts of cash to throw at new markets in the hope something sticks,lvpslgk,2.0,1gkzhol
comment,lvqg50p,octagonaldrop6,,1,2024-11-06 16:20:23,,,,Starting with gaming is pretty unusual in todays chip economy You always start with the highestend and then the defective chips get binned down to workstation or gaming and then general consumer Only reason why you start in the lower performance segments is when yields are too low and it takes a while to build stock for the server class Though as you say they have so much money they can do whatever they want and break the mould if they choose to So who knows Edit also there absolutely is a market for the flashy and untested look at Blackwell,lvqezdr,3.0,1gkzhol

comment,lwm6qld,nope_nic_tesla,,1,2024-11-11 18:09:33,,,,No they have traditionally been used in low power applications because power efficiency is really important when it comes to mobile devices but there is no inherent problem with them that means they cannot be scaled up for higher power usage The reason Intel continues to dominate in the desktop and datacenter space is simply because the x86 architecture has a massive incumbent advantage and power efficiency matters less for that use case so the advantage just hasnt been strong enough for everyone to switch Most applications for desktopdatacenter usage are written for x86 instruction sets So companies like Qualcomm dont even bother making ARM CPUs targeting desktop gaming for example because so few games would even work on it or if they did they would require some kind of translation layer which kills the performance advantage of ARM chips This is starting to change in the datacenter space as more and more applications are moving to CPU agnostic designs that can be compiled for any architecture but its going to take a while Amazon and Google are already making their own custom ARM chips to use in their datacenters We will also see a gradual change in the desktop computing space as Apple has moved entirely to ARM based CPUs including for their desktops and their M4 Max chip beats out Intel chips pretty handily in single threaded performance As software support for it grows we will likely see it take over,lwijtz2,5.0,1gkzhol

comment,lzsrh0g,SithTrooperReturnsEZ,,1,2024-12-01 00:44:06,,,,I hope people switch I wont be but I hope there is others who do Same with Intel CPUs I really dont want AMD for my next build luckily Im not doing it until this time next year and by then Intel should have their shit together with this new architecture and release something on par or better than AMDs counterpart This is how its always been yet people for years just shit on people for buying Intel or Nvidia when in reality nobody cares what others think and also now suddenly people are discovering this like its new Its not new we always wanted to stick with Nvidia and Intel This is why I love when people shit on Apple Windows Intel Nvidia etc Make more people switch and in the end I win Thats all I want I truly do hope people switch again Im not but I do hope some do Im in it for performance so I wont leave Nvidia until there is something better performance wise At this point though Ive been with Nvidia and Intel so long I just dont want to Luckily Im not making my new PC now as I said because Intels newest gen sucks but next year I will be,lzr45xc,4.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvtzdr6,Hanzo_The_Ninja,,1,2024-11-07 02:37:27,,,,Nvidia tried to buy ARM a few years ago but was blocked by regulators Nvidia is releasing an ARM CPU and possibly APU in 2025 and Simultaneous Heterogeneous Multithreading which has the potential to be a gamechanger has only been successfully tested with an ARM CPU paired with an Nvidia GPU thus far The reality is things are looking very good for ARM and Nvidia which is probably why last month Intel and AMD formed an x86x64 Ecosystem Advisory Group,,0.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvuhyi2,TooStrangeForWeird,,0,2024-11-07 04:34:12,,,,Nvidia doesnt really manufacture anything they just design it And theyve been using existing ARM CPUs and just slapping them together so far not actually designing their own cores or anything,lvslku5,2.0,1gkzhol

comment,lvpxahm,lemlurker,,8,2024-11-06 14:55:34,,,,I can see a global shift to arm were reaching the limit of die shrinkage performance so we need to reevaluate the way the software works to achieve the result Doing it with bespoke hardware is faster more efficient and more consistent it just needs that critical mass of support and itll become cost effective to dev dofteare in a RISC environment,lvpvux9,1.0,1gkzhol
