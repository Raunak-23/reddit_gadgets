comment,mgcq0jn,Shadow647,,36,2025-03-06 16:34:38,,,,Anecdote I know but for me SanDisk and Kingston memory cards and flash drives are the only ones that have never ever failed Samsungs died by the boatloads definitely genuine because they were replaced by Samsungs warranty Crucials 5050 Lexars PNYs ADATAs etc all had one or few bad ones My sample size is quite small few dozen memory devices over a couple decades so yes its definitely not a statistically valid data but still,mgcm686,2.0,1j4wu76

comment,mgtpk8s,HeftyArgument,,8,2025-03-09 08:43:01,,,,I love how everyones response to whether they bought them from authorised distributors is yes i got it from amazon Pretty sure the current understanding is buying from amazon especially with things like flash cards is that its no guarantee every suppliers item is piled in there fakes can be had just as easily as the real deal,mgjd1cz,6.0,1j4wu76

comment,mkmcorp,baithammer,,2,2025-03-31 02:06:42,,,,Just a heads up just because its from the Sandisk amazon storefront doesnt mean it comes from Sandisks own warehouse as the reason they use Amazon is to lower the amount of storage space they need for stock Amazon doesnt separate its stock and you have a crap shoot for it,mgw5wxy,8.0,1j4wu76

comment,mgv3ypf,werjake,,1,2025-03-09 15:25:40,,,,The problem is the one with DRAM is priced way higher than other brands so why pick it Edit Actually its more expensive but debatable if its significantly more for eg 2TB Kingston FuryKC 3000 209 and the Samsung 990 Pro is 230 So 20 more approx right Is it worth it at that price over others the other brands are under that amount eg Seagate Corsair Crucial,mgsj32d,6.0,1j4wu76
comment,mgxpcq2,MiddleEmployment1179,,1,2025-03-09 23:30:40,,,,Seagate definitely will pay Samsung 20 more Corsair crucial are ok have a couple of those So depends what you are looking for Samsung has a 5 year warranty I think,mgv3ypf,7.0,1j4wu76
comment,mh02day,werjake,,1,2025-03-10 10:40:33,,,,Dont most of the reputabledecent brands have a 5yr warranty nowadays I guess ppl who post here can be anywhere I suppose the USA is most common and prices there are better but in Canada everything is so expensive Anyway I am budgeting for a 200ish 2Tb drive so waiting for one to go on sale however Im only looking at a handful of drives Samsung 990 Pro 2tb 230 Crucial T500 215 Corsair MP600 LPX 210 Kingston KC3000 Fury Renegade 200 WD SN850X I was including this in the mix not sure if I should now 213 Seagate Firecuda 530R 215 I dont have the extra cash ATM or Id probably pick the Kingston nowthe Kingston drives seem to be on sale the most often with Corsair 2nd most,mgxpcq2,8.0,1j4wu76

comment,mgfb5ua,ThatKuki,,5,2025-03-07 00:09:47,,,,according to wikipedia sandisk is an independent company as of like last week i havent really researched a lot how intertwined they got in the last 9 years but i feel they were never really one company proper just WDs way to get a foot in the door if everything moved to SSD as it looked like it might happen back in 2016 and just as easily got rid of again once they knew that spinning disks are here to stay at least in datacenters,mgf3thw,3.0,1j4wu76

comment,mgcclcd,-Dixieflatline,,63,2025-03-06 15:29:41,,,,WD is an equity owner of Sandisk but the two are now independent companies complete with their own stock This move actually makes a lot of sense in that WD probably made a lot more direct money on enterprise business than SSDs for consumersgamers so it was a waste of RD money to be keeping up with SSD technology Believe it or not but their HDs are in massive demand right now due to explosive data center growth surrounding AI HDs are still the king when it comes to price per gig and data density per slot Leaving SSD development to Sandisk just lowered their overhead and theyll still end up making money off SSDs via their equity ownership as long as Sandisk stays relevant But it isnt just them logo swapping or at least it wont be until current inventory is gone,mgc3c61,1.0,1j4wu76
