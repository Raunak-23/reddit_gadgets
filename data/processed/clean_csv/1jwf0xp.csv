comment,mmiyzs0,TotallyNormalSquid,,14,2025-04-11 07:30:14,,,,Oh the laser stuff was a good few years ago It was CNNs typically for predicting the machining quality of microscale femtosecond pulsed laser ablation of beams shaped via spatial light modulators Basically put a shaped window in front of your laser in the shape you want to burn into the surface the shape at the surface will be a bit distorted from your window shape So you need to adjust your window shape pulse power to get the shape at the surface you actually want We really should have done the reverse transform with a CNN ie have the shape you want as input and predict the ideal window shape but we couldnt get that to work back in the day I think these days I could probably have gotten it to work but I was pretty new to deep learning back then,mmixkof,3.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmi543g,Polymersion,,32,2025-04-11 03:09:16,,,,Ive only had it for like three days so grain of salt but Cons I thought the model I got was supposed to have a leathery grip Instead it has an incredibly slick grip Havent dropped it and dont plan to but this means Im buying a case for it which I was hoping to go without since the phone yknow closes Closing the screen sometimes does stuff I wish it wouldnt Like backing out of this comment with no prompt so I had to retype the whole thing It isnt practical to close with one hand No snapping shut like an old flip phone On the flip side it doesnt wiggle at all when open but behaves like any other solidscreen phone Im not sure what the specs are for the external screen glass it picks up fingerprints like crazy but they also wipe off super easily Its almost a weirdly nice little ritual to wipe it off on a sleevehem when I close it I havent found any cool uses for halfopen mode yet besides being a camera standclock Pros The seam is a nonissue If you run your finger across it such as while scrolling you can feel where it is but you can only see it visually in certain lights Ohmygod icanputit inmypocket Without worrying about it being bent or bumping things The external screen is far more functional than I expected Still mostly a novelty but allows for checking notifications and time and whatnot without opening it Mostly redundant because I have a connected watch but still handy It will do apps as well but I havent tried You can customize which stuff is accessible on the small screen both with and without your PIN Being able to stand does make it great for photos or alarms Cant use it as a tent on the bedside because of the charging port but thats a minor quibble It has a few software things both good and bad that are common to Motorola devices I dont like that it doesnt have a photo gallery like LG only Google Photos Those are the things I noticed other people might have a different focus I couldnt tell you how good the cameras are for instance because I dont have much of an appreciation for the differences there,mmhyhv9,2.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmi8w4p,kayson,,7,2025-04-11 03:36:30,,,,Also just got a razr 2024 and Im a huge fan Really happy with it Its definitely not nearly as polished as a Samsung phone though Just a bunch of little bugs here and there and some big ones like Bluetooth pairing issues supposedly resolved in the Android 15 update thats making its way out As the other commenter mentioned the front screen is very functional I often dont have to open the phone when I get some notification Which is just like every other phone obviously but the point is that it being a folding phone isnt a huge deficit You can definitely notice the crease in the screen especially with a white background Not sure how it compares to other foldables but its easy enough to ignore The camera is servicable Again not as good as a Samsung phone but its rare that Ive wished it were better There are a few things weirdly lacking some of the UI is chunky the settings app is totally black and white making it hard to navigate The UI for customizing the front screen is great though and a lot of the moto stuff is fun It relies on Google apps for a lot of things which I didnt like calendar and files are examples I removed those and use open source alternatives I didnt think Id be considering another razr for my next phone but I am now,mmhyhv9,2.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmnlgdl,TheArmadilloAmarillo,,1,2025-04-12 00:16:32,,,,Gotcha I was genuinely curious about the reasoning and that makes complete sense I want a flip or a razr but Im likely getting an A36 bc cost,mmniddt,5.0,1jwf0xp
comment,mml6zj3,Not_Bears,,2,2025-04-11 16:35:26,,,,Had my Razr for almost 2 year now I love it I use the front screen mostly for my Google Wallet and pictures its definitely useful but I dont think its like having a 2nd device Its pretty cool sometimes when youre walking around a city and need directions to just have Google Maps running on the front screen That way you dont look like a tourist staring at this huge phone You can just kind of hold it like a small GPS and glance at it in your hand once in awhile Aside from that the form factor is great it feels so much smaller in my pocket and I love that I can like put it on speakerphone with the phone closed Ill probably get another one and I dont think Ill get go back to a nonflip phone as long as they keep making them,mmhyhv9,2.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmoc6nd,reduces,,2,2025-04-12 03:10:36,,,,I have had mine since black Friday I have the regular razr 2024 Its a good phone The physical act of flipping it shut makes me feel good about putting it down and I am not obsessively checking it as often I also put in a preorder for the new Clicks keyboard case Because to me the main reason I use my phone is to communicate with others and the on screen keyboard is kinda so tiny its unusable on the front screen So I dont use the front screen much,mmhyhv9,2.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmie9ut,juicebox12,,3,2025-04-11 04:17:41,,,,Ive had a razr 50 ultra razr 2024 in the states for around 6 months and its been my favourite smartphone yet I find the form factor so usable and love having a small square screen as my primary cyber deck style interface Keeps distraction down and allows me to function almost exclusively onehandedly There are so few compromises with this device I find it difficult to want for more Maybe an SD slot or slightly better camerasprocessor But Im certainly not suggesting these are issues or holding me back in the slightest So glad I went with this over the comparatively neutered Flip 6,mmhwdhe,1.0,1jwf0xp
comment,mmiftnm,Fujita21,,9,2025-04-11 04:30:16,,,,Im a big fan of my 2023 Razr and plan to trade up through my carrier for one of the new ones when my contract allows Practical and affordable phones They are the cheapest flips on the market I believe Ill be looking forward to the announcement My biggest gripe is that the assistant WILL NOT respond to commands with the phone closed because Google decided they didnt want it to It used to but it doesnt anymore That means no voice commands if its in my pocket No music controls no basic questions As far as Im aware there is no way to fix this and it affects all folding phones with a closed state Im generally not a fan of AI but if Motorola can create their own native AI assistant that actually does shit with the phone closed Im sold,,0.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmsi12q,Fujita21,,1,2025-04-12 20:39:12,,,,I wonder if that has to do with the 2024s having a fullfunction outer screen on all models Even when closed they may not actually have a closed state just a different display layout and whatnot I have the 2023 with the mini screen,mmq9gnz,2.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmtevri,Fujita21,,1,2025-04-12 23:56:37,,,,Thats what Im looking forward to I thought Id like the small screen but it was more limited than I expected when it came to functionality Are there any limits to what you can do with the outer screen Do all of your apps work I cant imagine its much different from the same apps running split screen on the main display,mmsjeix,4.0,1jwf0xp

comment,mmnrmry,doucheydp,,1,2025-04-12 00:55:53,,,,The only reason to even consider the Razr in my opinion was the retro inspired design which they basically dropped immediately They had a chance to stand out and be visually identifiable in a crowd and instead they basically just look like a lesser version of the ZFold which they basically are at this point,,0.0,1jwf0xp
