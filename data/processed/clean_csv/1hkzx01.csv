comment,m3jbtya,2001zhaozhao,,26,2024-12-24 02:43:38,,,,Amazing how much people are willing to pay to make the Mac Mini power button not be at the bottom anymore s,,0.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3l2z71,relentlessmelt,,5,2024-12-24 12:37:08,,,,Well it is irritating onpar with the charging port on the underside of the mouse design choice,m3jbtya,1.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3lhr7e,22Sharpe,,12,2024-12-24 14:26:58,,,,Ive had my M4 Pro for a month now and have never touched the power button aside from initially turning it on It really isnt as big of a deal as people seem to think Now the Magic Mouse charging port that thing remains incredibly stupid because you physically cant use the mouse while its charging by design so it just becomes a paperweight Needing to slightly lift an incredibly light device is not an issue though having it on the back was no better,m3l2z71,2.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3lnhrd,relentlessmelt,,3,2024-12-24 15:03:40,,,,It might not be as egregious as the mouse issue but its the same school of thought I find it hard to believe that if they didnt want a visible onoff button they couldnt come up with a more elegant solution rather than something that works against the user,m3lhr7e,3.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3lopa8,22Sharpe,,4,2024-12-24 15:11:09,,,,The mouse it was never about seeing the port its that Jony Ive didnt like the look of wires and figured that if people could use it while charging they would just leave it plugged in all the time so he made it inoperable while charging This is simply using the limited rear IO space on a small device to its fullest and moving something most users will touch maybe a couple of times a year to the bottom Sure they could have used the side or something but its really not the same school of thought IMO One is intentionally nerfing a device in order to fit the visual the designer had the other is maximizing limited space for useful things instead of a button that will often never be pressed Its not the smartest decision on the planet but it doesnt affect the usability of the device at all,m3lnhrd,4.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3xfyow,parisidiot,,0,2024-12-26 20:46:05,,,,its funny because i work in an office where we all have wireless logitech mice and people hate leaving them plugged in its annoying they usually only leave them plugged in to charge very very silly design also the magic mouse hurts to use the trackpad and regular mice are great,m3lopa8,5.0,1hkzx01
comment,m3xlthg,22Sharpe,,0,2024-12-26 21:18:47,,,,Honestly the Magic Mouse is king of form over function and I cant understand anyone being able to use it long term I dont mind it for like a few hours at a time but could never use it for a whole workday or anything That smooth scrolling is glorious though,m3xfyow,6.0,1hkzx01
