comment,mdbaobr,RayeFaye,,87,2025-02-17 20:53:11,,,,I miss my windows phone I really liked the layout but it not being able to run half the apps due to them just not being on the store or incompatible is what killed it for me Had that thing for like 4 years after I got a new phone and just used it as an mp3 playerpicture storage until it died I dropped it in the toilet lmfao,,0.0,1iro3at
comment,mdfbj3g,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,9,2025-02-18 13:25:42,,,,not being able to run half the apps due to them just not being on the store or incompatible This still happens on cheap android phones,mdbaobr,1.0,1iro3at
comment,mdiddv5,-Dixieflatline,,2,2025-02-18 22:18:00,,,,It was shocking to me that MS couldnt get their app store off the ground to make their OS a relevant competitor back then And the few top tier third party apps they did have were seemingly several revisions behind Apple and Android or just glorified browser skins when they first launched Windows Phone That lack of app support would end up being the OS killer Killed Windows Phone Also killed WebOS which was another promising OS although still alive on some TVs,mdbaobr,1.0,1iro3at

comment,mdctx1m,SupremeDictatorPaul,,3,2025-02-18 01:38:04,,,,Yeah the UI was better in pretty much every way to me than even current phone UIs It was most of the flexibility of Android while enforcing consistency like Apple Although it was really more consistent than Apple in a lot of ways And it ran smoother on half the hardware,mdb99of,2.0,1iro3at
comment,mdamwme,OperatorJo_,,45,2025-02-17 19:02:58,,,,Metro UI wasnt for everyone I liked it but I knew people that hated it That and lack of app support are what ultimately killed it Battery life wasnt stellar on the 8series either Honestly though Smoothestworking phones I ever had,mdabie4,1.0,1iro3at

comment,mdd4q12,None,,5,2025-02-18 02:40:21,,,,Ive never understood why they dont just make a custom Android variant with their customizations on top the software base has already been built for them Its never been easier for them to launch a phone They basically just need a custom skin and to build their own features on top Theyve already added Android support to Windows its such a gimme I just cannot wrap my head around it,mdaw4ie,3.0,1iro3at

comment,mdbjam5,MexicanJello,,21,2025-02-17 21:33:17,,,,Its Microsofts favorite thing to do Launch hardware poorly advertise it restrict it to the US Claim its a failure and cancel it Zune was a perfect example of this Superior device to iPod no one knew about it until it became a meme years later,mdb4u03,3.0,1iro3at
comment,mdfy7nf,Dantaro,,1,2025-02-18 15:32:25,,,,The original Zune had a huge marketing push from Microsoft it even managed a 9 market share of sold music players in the first weekend but it never got enough market share to be relevant Consumers clearly didnt think the Zune did enough to make it worth getting instead of the ipod Maybe if they had released it closer to the original ipod it might have been a competitor but they were too little too late Beyond that Windows Phone had a huge market share in India and relevant market share in other regions They didnt make the choice to restrict it to the US markets until the 950 series with windows 10 mobile None of this is to say that the Zune wasnt a good device or that windows phone wasnt I was a diehard windows phone user until it was sunset and I would absolutely use it again if it came back but you cant just hand wave away the issues blaming it on MSs marketing Consumers didnt like the products and MS wasnt ever able to shake it up enough to change that,mdbjam5,4.0,1iro3at
comment,mdjpke6,MexicanJello,,1,2025-02-19 02:36:33,,,,My sentiments come as a Canadian but a day 1 Zune and Windows Phone owner and a tech writer at the time Zune was not possible to get here Microsoft all but gave up by the time they released the Zune HD which I found to be the perfect device It was very disappointing especially after my window got smashed and mine was stolen the day after I got it All we got was the Samsung Windows Phone Im blanking the official name of it All ad spending I seen was on ineffective showings in many TV shows although as you said the ultimate killer was its lack of apps and many not liking the metro UI,mdfy7nf,5.0,1iro3at

comment,mdc4ftn,notagoodscientist,,-3,2025-02-17 23:17:44,,,,Still have a lumia on w10m biggest buggiest POS ever used Hate the damn thing Only have it because of the SIM card size it takes Even the hardware is garbage power the battery up full turn it off and leave it ONE week and the battery is dead and I mean literally dead then you have to try and charge it which fails because the phone detects power powers on then tries to draw too much power than it flips off this literally goes on and on until you unplug it at which point you need to remove the battery put wires into the terminals and charge it with a lithium battery charger for a bit then can put it back and theres enough power for the phone to power on and start charging Whats good about this phone Literally nothing I cant name one feature about it I like or that was actually implemented right and isnt broken or buggy,mdamwme,2.0,1iro3at
