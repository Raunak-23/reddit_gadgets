comment,m1dqacv,nicuramar,,-23,2024-12-10 16:43:43,,,,Of course it does Backdoor means very little and there are many ways to do it Depending on circumstances it can be quite secure Apple has a backdoor of sorts into iCloud backups but there is no evidence that this has leaked NSA has a backdoor into a now not used random number generator but there is no evidence that it has been compromised,m1d270r,2.0,1hb1sh6
comment,m1ex26i,booch,,9,2024-12-10 20:25:30,,,,Depending on circumstances it can be quite secure But quite secure isnt enough Because 1 The role of protecting the data has to succeed every time forever 2 The role of deprotecting getting access to the data only needs to happen once If there is a back door it can be well protected the vast majority of the time But then the one time it _isnt_ well protected makes all the previous times irrelevant,m1dqacv,3.0,1hb1sh6

comment,m1g0qoh,UrToesRDelicious,,11,2024-12-11 00:00:06,,,,Yeah no thats all complete bullshit triangulate your location through gps This right here is all anyone needs to completely disregard everything youve said because its apparent you dont know what youre talking about GPS is a completely passive technology you cant do anything through GPS you simply triangulate your own position based on ping time to overhead satellites No one can get anyone elses location through GPS And do you know how much data it would take for someone to covertly stream live video from your phone Enough that any network audit would immediately catch it even if the stream was encrypted and people audit this stuff constantly You would also catch something like this yourself when ATT charges you for gigabytes of data overages Regardless all of this ignores the fact that this isnt even possible without some sort of zeroday exploit or malware because your phone is encrypted and encryption is mathematically secure You have access to the same encryption the NSA uses and its open source so theres no chance of any backdoors If you are correctly utilizing proper encryption and security protocols then your data is cryptographically secure Stop fear mongering about things you dont understand,m1f4w4b,5.0,1hb1sh6

comment,m1flmck,Omegalazarus,,0,2024-12-10 22:33:05,,,,Where I think it might falter is the downside of the crap that all these companies claim right now and that is the leasing of the software Remember you buy an Apple iPhone which is the hardware and they lease to you the software So technically all the software where you store your data is Leased to you and owned by Apple Therefore I think someone could make a case that Apple might be guilty of obstruction of justice if they dont turn over all access to the software that they own as far as it relates to any specific criminal case with warrants,m1em55d,2.0,1hb1sh6

comment,m1cx8w9,AlureonTheVirus,,70,2024-12-10 13:57:24,,,,law enforcement supports strong responsibly managed encryption This encryption should be designed to protect peoples privacy and also managed so US tech companies can provide readable content in response to a lawful court order Companies should be required to turn over what they have but they shouldnt be mandated into making it convenient Especially at the cost of making their product objectively less safe I agree that CSAM is an issue but they should handle that clientside before its encrypted and reaches icloud in a way that maintains everyones privacy A backdoor into any system has and always will be a bad idea,,0.0,1hb1sh6

comment,m1d6rhc,AlureonTheVirus,,-8,2024-12-10 14:56:37,,,,I think part of the issue is that for the most part iPhones probably do a lot of the producing I doubt the FBI is going after apple for hosting organized CSAM traders its likely more of an issue with minors being trafficked or kids sharing way more than they should As for how you guarantee the model doesnt mess up Im not sure That would be a problem for apple to solve Id say maybe there could be some meet in the middle solution where if you go to upload content thats automatically flagged locally your device would warn you that it breaks ToS and offer that either you upload the flagged media and have it manually reviewed or you keep it to yourself Im no expert Im just throwing out ideas I guess But I do think its an interesting concept Privacy and moderation will always be at ends with one another Edit grammar,m1d5p8k,4.0,1hb1sh6

comment,m1dlf8r,123kingme,,8,2024-12-10 16:18:03,,,,Per the article As I commented at that time the issue is not scanning for CSAM the issue is introducing screening of any content on one side of Apples endtoend encryption Right now Apple can tell China Russia and others that it does not have the technology to monitor for political dissent or religious or sexual behaviors but bring in a backdoor for CSAM and theres no impediment to its expansion I was initially in favor of Apples proposed solution to scanning for hashes of CSAM but this counter argument has led me to change my mind Whats stopping a country like Saudi Arabia to demand that Apple checks for images of the prophet Muhammad Or countries such as Russia to demand checks for homosexual content Or countries like China demanding checks for anti Chinesestate propaganda such as images of Tiananmen square Its a slippery slope argument but its a valid one in my opinion Especially given that the proposed hash checking solution is already easily countered by watermarks image cropping image compression and other basic methods Its simply not worth the risk,m1cx8w9,1.0,1hb1sh6
