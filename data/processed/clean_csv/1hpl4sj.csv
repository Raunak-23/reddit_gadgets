comment,m4iy7es,Quigleythegreat,,220,2024-12-30 14:26:39,,,,They will if Nvidia decides to price the alternatives in space 30 less performance for 40 of the price is not a bad deal,m4icmfz,1.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4j8l5c,proscriptus,,39,2024-12-30 15:28:19,,,,Nvidia is pricing all of its highend products for enterprise AI customers it does not care if enthusiasts buy 5090s when Microsoft will order them 10000 at a time,m4icmfz,1.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jnuve,danielv123,,29,2024-12-30 16:49:52,,,,Microsoft doesnt order 5090s they order basically the same silicon for 10x more,m4j8l5c,2.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jqpvp,NorysStorys,,16,2024-12-30 17:04:28,,,,A lot of that price isnt in the price of the silicon Its in specialised driver support specialised technical support much stronger warranty and often a direct line to Nvidia for any issues Enterprise gear is often also much much more reliable than consumer So its not just an arbitrary price rise to some degree it is because they know business and enterprise can and will pay it,m4jnuve,3.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jqwfj,danielv123,,6,2024-12-30 17:05:25,,,,It doesnt take much to look at the balance sheet Most of that is profit margin,m4jqpvp,4.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jsb0l,NorysStorys,,8,2024-12-30 17:12:39,,,,Because things like technical support are not directly factored into the cost of an enterprise GPU via its sales price Its costs that occur in other parts of the business but is directly related to said GPUs The salary of a support engineer isnt broken down in the revenue of GPU sales while being part of the package when buying said 10 grand GPU,m4jqwfj,5.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m58yy60,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-01-03 21:25:15,,,,They dont focus most of their contracted capacity on server cards and price them high because the cost of supporting them necessitates it to achieve a reasonable margin They focus on server cards and invest what is necessary to support them because they can be sold for much higher profit margins Lmao,m4jsb0l,6.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4nfdie,dertechie,,2,2024-12-31 05:26:42,,,,Yeah H100H200 are Grace Hopper micro architecture Hopper architecture is only used for data center cards However for any other architecture there are usually data center and gaming cards sharing the same silicon just with different drivers and memory setups,m4mpjgf,5.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4rwvim,skaterhaterlater,,2,2025-01-01 00:06:47,,,,No enterprise is buying a 5090 for ai They have their own enterprise line for them a 5090 is almost entirely for the consumer market,m4j8l5c,2.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4k377j,SlayahhEUW,,2,2024-12-30 18:08:15,,,,I think the headache from the Intel ecosystem might not be worth the money AMD still is 5050 when writing custom kernels on ROCM their own definition of thread warps their own HW arch kernels that need elseifs everywhere even in Triton which aims to be HWagnostic they have really improved but every time there is anything external cuda is better integrated Am using AMD at the university and Nvidia at home and its just night and day cant even imagine Intel ecosystem on top of this,m4iyogo,2.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4j1w3d,gameguy600,,135,2024-12-30 14:49:31,,,,Arc isnt going anywhere first Skus of Battlemage 2nd Gen are out and good enough to a point of being a viable and desirable market option at the lowmid end 3rd Gen Celestial has had its architecture locked down with likely 20252026 release and Druid 4th gen is in early RD phases The rumours of Arc being cancelled were just flatout false What intels plan for these is quite straightforward Steal the lowmid end consumer card market share from underneath Nvidias and AMDs feet Then once theyre established start pushing upwards the card tier ladder with the now more mature tech All the while the tech then also gets applied to integrated graphics on their portable devices and CPUs the server side of things,m4izx7m,1.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jrf6l,NorysStorys,,58,2024-12-30 17:08:06,,,,And honestly them going for the lowmid range is the best for the market Nvidia have almost a monopoly in the GPU space and AMD seem unwilling to challenge them on price because ultimately they cannot challenge on performance Which allows Intel to gain a foothold by fighting for market share by being incredibly good on priceperformance,m4j1w3d,2.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4rm2ba,SupremeDictatorPaul,,7,2024-12-31 22:57:43,,,,The low end Arc Battlemage cards are also an excellent option for Twitch streamers High end streamers will often have a dedicated systemcard to handle the video streamingencoding Arc can handle encoding to plenty of high complexity video codecs and resolutions simultaneously live This creates a better experience for viewers who can get a decent stream at the right resolution and bandwidth using something like AV1,m4j1w3d,2.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4lk35j,StickyThickStick,,12,2024-12-30 22:39:53,,,,It all depends on the die size not only whether its chiplet or monolithic A small monolithic die has no problem with its yield,m4krbpy,3.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4lnzdz,TheModeratorWrangler,,-6,2024-12-30 23:01:15,,,,You proved why chipsets work,m4lk35j,4.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4lpp9r,StickyThickStick,,11,2024-12-30 23:10:57,,,,Whilst understanding your point its not what I said The latest NVIDIA gpu as well as the previous generations all were monolithic I dont know about amd gpus Small to medium sized chips dont need to be chiplets since defect parts of the chips are disabled and these chips are then used for the lower end products and cores disabled GPU chips arent as complex as CPUs with thousands of cores that can be disabled whether a few have a defect You said Monolithic architectures dont work whilst they are working and have been working for the last decades,m4lnzdz,5.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4luk9n,TheModeratorWrangler,,4,2024-12-30 23:38:52,,,,I concede your point and raise that the cost to performance metrics are why AMD was able to kneecap Intel and at this point NVidia is the leader because of CUDA and decades of library development What good are chips without a good software development kit behind it NVidia through TSMC can own the monolithic die GPU space but AMD was smart to learn to use scraps smaller dies with higher yields that can work together through an interposer layer Edit AMD and Intel competed in x86 giving NVidia a lead to develop graphics on the bodies of 3DFX ATI now AMD and others,m4lpp9r,6.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4j7ry9,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,19,2024-12-30 15:23:47,,,,I think that was a variety of employees leaking that they assumed that their GPU division was going to fail and be closed down if Battlemage didnt impress the public This was their finest hour but they pulled it off Their GPUs are frequently sold out now Im guessing now they are feeling confident about trying their hand at the highend with Nvidia Might also compel AMD to reconsider their plans to avoid the highend too since now theyre gonna be squeezed at the lowend by Intel,m4izx7m,1.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4kmkmt,joomla00,,14,2024-12-30 19:47:11,,,,Simply put its because they are pricing it to win None of the cards on the market are bad just not priced correctly,m4j9uu8,3.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4l60wh,100GbE,,8,2024-12-30 21:26:05,,,,For what its worth I bought 3 of the best cards in 2012 for a triSLI setup the double memory versions too cost me 1530 for all 3 of them A single 4080 coats more now not even 1 top end card now And before anyone days inflation put a brain in it,m4kmkmt,4.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4jyxlv,NorysStorys,,15,2024-12-30 17:46:43,,,,Its also that vram packages are very often in 8gb units these days so its simply just the next highest number to increase to without ordering custom ram modules instead opting for more generic parts,m4jvvct,5.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4jzulq,RedditCollabs,,-49,2024-12-30 17:51:18,,,,Youre still ignoring the dang question Your example is not near 24 GB of RAM Its not 23 its not 22 its not 21 its not 20 its not 19 its not 18 its not 17 Stop moving Goal posts,m4jyxlv,6.0,1hpl4sj
comment,m4k3pzw,NorysStorys,,22,2024-12-30 18:10:58,,,,More than just a game uses a GPU If a game uses all available vRAM say 16gb then there is nothing else left for the system to use in other tasks which with the increase of on hardware AI tools and software Requires a system to need more than 16gb of vram Instead of being a confrontational asshole try wording your questions better and not throwing a fit when said poorly worded questions are not answered,m4jzulq,7.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4jc7f9,slurplepurplenurple,,20,2024-12-30 15:48:15,,,,Well the article suggests that its likely not targeted for games specifically reports that the 24GB Arc PRO model may be targeted at data centers edge computing and the education market However the primary advantage of the increased memory buffer would be for AI inference in Large Language Models LLMs and generative AI Intel already offers tools for creative AI work such as its updated AI Playground tool for texttoimage generation,m4iwhsw,1.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4jlt6v,scarr09,,25,2024-12-30 16:39:22,,,,Unreal 5s global illumination and reflection system For example Ark just released a map on a wasteland Earth where you will have massive lightningmeteor storms in the sky Now normally youd just paint the skybox different throw in some random meteors going across the sky and call it a day But because of Lumen you will see diffused light coming through volumetric clouds and reflecting a different hue on various materials fog etc Each meteor going past the sky or lighting strikes will actually cast light on objects and creatures Or for example you can cover foliage with light in real time from the sun and actually have it scatter and diffuse through the leaves So if you look from the bottom you see darker leaves with light coming through different angles while the top of the foliage will have direct light and looks brighter,m4jile5,3.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4l9qtn,im_thatoneguy,,6,2024-12-30 21:45:07,,,,Intel has a PyTorch extension Also lots of OpenCL applications for raytracing video editing etc that need lots of RAM as well I wouldnt buy a non cuda card But for someone using blender as an enthusiast or for machines that are for purpose built solutions where you control the software like a server that hosts an ai product in PyTorch you control it could be interesting to have a budget GPU where an Nvidia GPU would be astronomical in price to the point that you might not even include a GPU at all otherwise Eg we have render nodes that are CPU renderers but a handful of tasks leverage GPU like depth of field blur and require a lot of vram,m4j13uh,3.0,1hpl4sj

comment,m4izia8,None,,9,2024-12-30 14:34:51,,,,Star Wars outlaws can use as much VRAM as you throw at it So can unreal engine games if developers enable it This for the newer LOD system these games implement where there is texture model pop not predetermined by settings but automatically determined by the game engine based on VRAM If youre playing at 4k with RT enabled you can very easily go over 16gb of VRAM Some unoptimized games like Star Wars Jedi Survivors actually needs more than 24gb of VRAM with RT and ultra settings at 4k,m4iwhsw,1.0,1hpl4sj
