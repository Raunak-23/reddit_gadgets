comment,m83t4k3,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-01-20 03:44:02,,,,More broadly unless the point of the product itself is to do like 50 things in one I dont see how AI integration is useful for almost any products delivered to end users I remember growing up in my country dishwashing machines were not common So when I was a kid and someone said dishwashing machine I thought of like a pair of robot arms and a camera attached to the backsplash which can do all the scrubbing etc Then when I found out how real dishwashers work and how effective they are it was kind of wonderful because the reality was much more simple than I imagined Similarly I remember someone writing about many modern higher end expensive robot vacuums with more sensors camera LIDAR etc vs a cheap Chinese Roomba knockoff which has 3 modes straight linefollow an edgego in a little spiral it varied randomly then when it ran low on battery it retraced its path to the charging base Apparently the cheap Chinese knockoff got like 95 as effective coverage for like 110th the cost I think in most practical cases there is just some simple solution available that effectively covers a majority of the bases and makes even the more complex nonAI solutions pointless Let alone involving AI I think AI will in the near term be more useful for finding or implementing those kinds of solutions rather than actually being part of them until we get more general purpose robots Its also kind of fascinating that despite the fact that we already have dishwashers gross people still let their dishes pile up in the sink Maybe if someone with a robot from the future came back they could solve that problem by having the robot automatically load the dishwasher for them But long before that robot will be invented this problem is already basically solved you can just rinse and place your dirty dishes directly in the dishwasher rack Thats the kind of problem I see with a lot of AI products they are like building a sinktodishwasherloading robot I only want such a thing if loading the dishwasher is one of the 1000 things it can do because theres actually probably something else Id rather have it do to cut that part out entirely anyway eg take my dishes from me at my table and go put them into the dishwasher directly So that function can be made pointless in a bunch of different ways Unless they can do that Just make a better dishwasher and I will load it directly,m82dfse,1.0,1i588tz
comment,m82uml9,Traditional_Cat_60,,2,2025-01-20 00:27:57,,,,What I need is an AI water turret gun that will spray my cats before they jump up on certain counters and tables Same with my dog trying to steal food off the counters The cheap model is stationary The high end model is a drone that can stealthily follow my little destroyers and correct their savage tendencies,,0.0,1i588tz

comment,m8bbpyk,BenefitOfTheDoubt_01,,2,2025-01-21 07:36:04,,,,This got me thinking What if I built one with a solar panel and rain catch system to charge itself and wander around the city feeding stray dogscats It would have a sign that said please refill me and three bins for water cat dog food Sensors could determine from a distance if the stray animal was a dog or cat stop call out to the animal and dispense foodextend a water bowl If its running low on food it could call out to humans to please refill it with food I could make an app so people could see where it goes People that are into it could revisit it to restock it with food The app would allow people to check foodwater levels The bot could snap pictures of animals it encountered and maybe even scan their chip for help with lost animals,,0.0,1i588tz
