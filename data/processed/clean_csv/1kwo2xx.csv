comment,muj59dk,auburnradish,,25,2025-05-27 15:34:13,,,,He has found a 2inch LCD screen with a resolution of 640480 pixels and changed the Mac firmware to output a 480342 image instead of 512342 In this way the screen keeps its native resolution with no pixel suffering Come again,,0.0,1kwo2xx

comment,mumhn9q,jamatar,,7,2025-05-28 01:40:09,,,,Assume they letterbox the display so theyre using pixels 11 but hiding the blank parts of the screen inside the case Edit theres a big bit about it and flipping the screen into portrait on the creators blog,mujoaq3,2.0,1kwo2xx

comment,mur75lr,Odin_Makes,,2,2025-05-28 19:37:42,,,,Likely trying to achieve the non square look of CRT screens Technically speaking a CRT does not have a pixel resolution it has a raster line resolution that we then interpreted as a pixel resolution when LCDs became good enough A result of the scan lines on the screen made the pixels look taller on screen than they were wide To be honest the Mac still created graphics that were pixel based but showing them on a CRT screen altered them ever so slightly Nobody thought much about it at the time as it was normal like smoking in a McDonalds or hanging guns in the back window of your truck in high school It was just normal Some of the first C64 art programs I used looked right on screen but printed squished because my old Okidata printer did print square pixels I am paraphrasing because neither DPI on paper nor raster lines on screen are true pixels IF that is what the artist was trying to do then I think that is very cool,muj59dk,1.0,1kwo2xx

comment,muj5lm5,cobra7,,11,2025-05-27 15:35:48,,,,The linked article implies that the original Mac had a USB port It didnt USB was the correct choice to make though since it opens up the array of mice and keyboards that can be used I still have my functioning original Mac 128k,,0.0,1kwo2xx
