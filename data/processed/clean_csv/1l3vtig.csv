comment,mw62pe4,sioux612,,256,2025-06-05 17:20:06,,,,Or his video where he connected a bunch of batteries in parallel and then lays on them Yes I know its super low voltage and it just happens to produce a couple kilo Amps but him laying on top of the poles made me very nervous,mw4u4m5,1.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw4aue8,VonArmin,,550,2025-06-05 11:50:03,,,,its way less watts and way less time to burn your eyes out with a laser about 5mW 0005 watt which is the legal limit in most countries will blind you in about 10 secs of exposure while im not sure if 200x power will burn your eyes 200x faster but a 1W laser is pretty powerful and will probably blind you instantly,mw49kb9,2.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw5hra3,Saotik,,169,2025-06-05 15:41:16,,,,Theres a lot that someone can just do if they really wanted to For example anthrax and sarin gas are surprisingly simple to make with a limited amount of specialised knowledge Society is built on the assumption that the majority of us arent terrorists and for those that could be theres a reason we have watchlists,mw5eor2,5.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw7x9ex,yoyotube,,2,2025-06-05 22:44:19,,,,Oh also heres what you need to make sarin gas If you care enough you can find the measurements and instructions yourself Phosphorus Trichloride tricky one Methyl iodide Red phosphorus Methanol HF or NaF tricky one i think isopropyl alcohol after that its just a series of reactions to get methylphosophyl dichloride So its not like any of this stuff screams sarin on its own I bet if you ordered them every 3 months along with other innocent chemicals inbetween then youd be totally fine,mw6r8ip,8.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw5mz02,Asatas,,36,2025-06-05 16:06:01,,,,Laser and omnidirectional doesnt really mix well Laser is concentrated light after all so you cant concentrate it into all directions Youd need many many laser diodes and a whole lotta energy to cover more than a few dots on the ground,mw5eor2,5.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw5puwx,AvatarAarow1,,8,2025-06-05 16:19:54,,,,Yeah best you could get is probably like 7 lasers arranged to spin like a disco ball but even then powerful lasers are pretty heavy so idk how well thatd work in practice,mw5mz02,6.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw6nz8h,nagi603,,4,2025-06-05 19:00:16,,,,Also exposure time would drop off significantly Those metrics for how fast your eyes get to well done are based on continuous exposure Even if you use powerful lasers there will be a distance where they pass eyes so fast it is no longer a hazard If they even hit as the further you are the much larger area it would need to cover with the blinding eyedeath scans,mw5puwx,7.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw75xyh,AvatarAarow1,,2,2025-06-05 20:24:29,,,,Yeah that too realistically such an idea would cause a bit of eye damage but I dont think theres any way to make such a drone that would actually blind any significant amount of people Which is probably a good thing lol,mw6nz8h,8.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw9kyfr,AvatarAarow1,,1,2025-06-06 05:00:56,,,,Im sure the software would be good at recognizing and parsing faces but I think you might be underestimating how difficult it would be translate that into aiming directly into someones cornea while on a moving drone Between movement of the drone constant movement of both people and their eyes some inevitable calibration issues related to where the software thinks its point the laser vs where the laser actually is I think there are way too many variables to realistically make this something effective for use At the very least itd be significantly less effective than posting up in a building in Manhattan and shining it down into peoples eyes by hand Unless youve got extremely precise machinery that youre working with how good the software is hardly matters and civilians wont have access to that kind of thing generally so if you want to be a menace to society this is a pretty inefficient way to do it,mw95hv2,10.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw9lbvi,jippiex2k,,1,2025-06-06 05:04:00,,,,A laser is a laser because the light is focused in one single direction And coherent monochromatic If you had an omnidirectional laser then you would dilute the power and essentially just have a lightbulb A few watts spread in all directions is not that bad We look at several watt lightbulbs all the time without going blind Random kids fucking around with lasers are a valid concern though It happens regularly and there are regulations against it,mw5eor2,5.0,1l3vtig

comment,mwbus9h,Whoa1Whoa1,,1,2025-06-06 15:11:18,,,,Sure but a 10 year old with a knife isnt as scary as one who gets some stuff on eBay to easily build a laser that can blind anyone they point it at in just 1 second The chance of them killing you with the knife is significantly less likely also because they see the laser thing as funny and saw their favorite YouTubers doing it and think it isnt as dangerous when it is totally permanently damaging to be blind,mwbgsbj,6.0,1l3vtig

comment,mwfglli,TaterTotJim,,1,2025-06-07 02:51:28,,,,Your eyelids work pretty good but there is a certain limit of where the laser energy is quicker than your reaction speed I think it is around that 15w range but I dont know for certain To get hurt with standard American laser pointer which is the loosest regulation you would have to hold your eyelids open to damage your sight,mw5eor2,5.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw5t55v,PaxNova,,8,2025-06-05 16:35:35,,,,Depends how youre measuring 40 joules in a second might be zero for 950 ms and then 800 for 50 ms A pulsed laser like this can get pretty hot Its also focused down to around 12cm as a target and doesnt deform like a paintball Theres no crumple zone on a laser and that much energy in a small space gets fiery fast,mw50cs2,3.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw6vqa4,Max-Phallus,,3,2025-06-05 19:37:21,,,,800J for 50ms would actually be 16000w Since 40W for 20 seconds would be 800J If you meant 800W for 50ms and 0W for 950ms then you can see why watt is not the right unit for describing energy delivered when the time frame is less than 1 seconds So you have to assume that 40W is the draw that is available over a second if no time component is mentioned At 40W you can draw 40 joules per second If you want to mention energy delivery over such a short amount of time youd use number of joules over a specific burst duration or just joules delivered is probably fine if its such a short duration IMO,mw5t55v,4.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw7ecnr,PaxNova,,1,2025-06-05 21:04:21,,,,Yeah when calculating the NOHD and reflective surfaces distances you use peak power per pulse But given that hes using a shorthand likely based on average power thats my point If you bought a 9mm gun nobodys going to joke about how it would be too small for your finger in the trigger guard We know thats bullet diameter not length of the barrel A phased plasma rifle likely uses a standard wavelength pulse width and duty cycle A 40W laser could still cut you if focused well or if its used to heat and eject plasma We dont know enough about the weapons to say its ludicrous,mw6vqa4,5.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw9kcdr,MaliciousMe87,,11,2025-06-06 04:56:02,,,,Not sure if you saw but less than a year ago he made his first video about his health He went to the doctor because some stuff about his body has always been weird They get a blood panel and turns out his body is pumping an absolutely insane amount of testosterone Like offthecharts levels And the weird thing is hes done a bunch of tests and they cant figure out why No cancer endocrine system seems to function well Anyway I dont remember most details but turns out theres a medical reason for his voice and looks none of which are bad but they are uncommon,mw81vkx,2.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw5gadr,KylerStreams,,35,2025-06-05 15:34:19,,,,Correct But what he is saying is that a regular 110v American wall outlet on 30amps can melt the tungsten ball tip on a welder before it melts aluminum This laser melted a thin film of tungsten Definitely a sick laser but it definitely isnt the worlds strongest laser as described and a wall sockets worth of power can melt tungsten under the right conditions,mw5d0eh,3.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw61gb2,ARoyaleWithCheese,,91,2025-06-05 17:14:22,,,,Styropyro makes the claim that its the strongest handheld so fully portable continuous so not pulse laser I dont think anyone in this thread has provided anything to undermine that claim Like styropyro said himself hes made way more powerful lasers in the past but they either werent handheld or they were pulse lasers,mw5gadr,4.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw5k8t1,GiftFrosty,,42,2025-06-05 15:52:58,,,,For clarities sake it was a tungsten wire he didnt describe it as the worlds strongest laser just the strongest hand held laser He went on to point out that his laser welder cleaner cutter was much more powerful but doesnt count as the power supply isnt self contained and weighs 400lbs,mw5gadr,4.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw7kqrp,KylerStreams,,0,2025-06-05 21:36:18,,,,Fully correct I didnt see the handheld section in the title I am not sure if he said the gauge in the video but it looked extremely thin on camera The point was never that what he did wasnt cool or a world first It was that melting a thin piece of tungsten can be achieved by a wall socket,mw5k8t1,5.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw8oyw1,CloggedSumoo,,5,2025-06-06 01:29:28,,,,I happen to think it was pretty cool Its a hand held laser no one thinks a wall socket is cool,mw7kqrp,6.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw6o3t5,Sabotskij,,2,2025-06-05 19:00:53,,,,I guess my point is that you have to compare it with itself as it were Yeah there definitely are more powerful lasers out there and there definietly are tools better suited to melting things But the fact that it can melt tungsten the laser being what it is is quite impressive or concerning depending on your point of view,mw5gadr,4.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw6rmk2,Eli_eve,,2,2025-06-05 19:17:45,,,,30 Amps at 110 Volts is 3300 Watts Yes that is a lot more powerful than this 250 Watt laser However this laser happens to be hand portable which a wall outlet is not and can project its power over some distance which a welder cannot,mw5gadr,4.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw7k049,KylerStreams,,2,2025-06-05 21:32:32,,,,Honestly didnt see the term handheld on here I know of some plasma cutters with backpacks that would definitely cut more stuff than a laser though But handheld ya he is probably right Although I am sure that other diodes exist that could theoretically be put into a handheld unit if your pockets were deep enough,mw5y4yb,5.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw61q4s,MadBullBen,,2,2025-06-05 17:15:37,,,,All of those examples are physical connections where it is MUCH easier to get products hot enough to melt 240v 15amps is 3600w which is hugely powerful but again these all have physical connections A Lazer like this is not a physical connection which makes power transfer MUCH harder to do,mw58j9j,2.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw4jpei,ToMorrowsEnd,,91,2025-06-05 12:46:34,,,,as someone that uses laser cutters Im extremely impressed that his lens is surviving I use lab grade front surface mirrors and active cooled gallium arsenide lenses and they get damaged from only 100 watts hes using a plastic projector lens that is not even cooled,,0.0,1l3vtig
comment,mw4l9xd,pelrun,,95,2025-06-05 12:55:48,,,,Probably because its a laser array not a single 250W beam Each beam is well below 100W and is spatially separated when passing through the lens so the power density is lower,mw4jpei,1.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw51hzq,stupid_cat_face,,26,2025-06-05 14:23:22,,,,A tiny reflection of that beam into the eye will blind anything and anyone including a camera If you watch the video you will note he takes care about protecting against reflections Even the part where he shoots a bottle He holds it very awkwardly and thats to attempt to control reflections He even remarks hes surprised he never burned out his camera I want one But I wont make one because my clumsy self will blind myself As a laser lover this would terrify me to be near,,0.0,1l3vtig

comment,mw562aa,drinkallthepunch,,-6,2025-06-05 14:45:38,,,,If you can figure out how to do basic electrical work you can probably do it Youd likely need some actual classes on low voltage circuit building and thats about it Its prohibitevly expensive tho which is its a kidteen who has been doing this most adults dont have the time or money to waste on such an endeavor Most of us growing up were simply too poor Obviously his first projects werent very expensive but this one for example must have been around 5000 in parts I would imagine possibly some special licensing his dad had to acquire through a business to allow his kid to even build it legally This isnt any different then those kids who get into college at 14 because ya know money and nepotism Thats basically it I was building lasers like what this kid was first building my and my buddy and cousin did it for fun along with building radios and receivers to listen in on police channels in our small town Its nothing new hes just got money to waste Edit and before you even start the cost of that titanium sheet alone was probably like 200 just let that sink in While you were blowing money on school lunch this kid is buying diamonds and titanium sheets to melt for fun 110 nepotism,mw4mbtl,1.0,1l3vtig
