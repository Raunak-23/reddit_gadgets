comment,lvoafx0,nailbunny2000,,42,2024-11-06 08:15:51,,,,I will never understand why such dumb appliances need to be connected to the internet what genuine value can that offer New recipes Its an oven it turns on and off its not going to suddenly go Ratatouille and make you Michelin star meals on its own,lvo9sxj,1.0,1gkt1pv

comment,lvoi2ee,brusiddit,,4,2024-11-06 09:24:53,,,,I can imagine that would be pretty useful if you wanted an easier way of setting to run when you were out or to schedule it to start,lvoal96,3.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvotry1,NorysStorys,,13,2024-11-06 11:19:10,,,,But you fill a dishwasher if youre going out for long enough that it warrants turning it on with an app you probably turned it on before you left the home,lvoi2ee,4.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvp8q6z,mr_vestan_pance,,10,2024-11-06 12:52:10,,,,Its much quicker when packing it to press the button to delay starting after 12 than packing it and then going to the app on the phone and setting the schedule Far fewer finger presses with device than the app,lvotry1,5.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvsukqb,searlee,,1,2024-11-06 22:55:25,,,,Depends I close my dishwasher and wake up the next morning and its done Ive setup home automation all it turns on and runs when I have cheap energy,lvp8q6z,6.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvryhik,brusiddit,,-2,2024-11-06 20:25:07,,,,I prefer using my phone for interacting with appliances The user interface is usually more predictable 100 this reason doesnt warrant connecting to some 3rd party just to do so though when you can just learn how to do it on the device,lvp8q6z,6.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvrz0jk,mr_vestan_pance,,1,2024-11-06 20:27:31,,,,I prefer ease of use and utility and in my example above the dishwasher interface completely trounces using the app,lvryhik,7.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvoi98d,mr_vestan_pance,,1,2024-11-06 09:26:44,,,,I tend to pack it and then schedule it to start after 12pm direct on the machine itself,lvoi2ee,4.0,1gkt1pv

comment,lvvl1yy,TotallyNormalSquid,,1,2024-11-07 10:48:36,,,,Legit reason check fluctuating electricity prices and start at a tasty dip Whether any dishwasher company has implemented this I dont know and your energy provider having a tariff that supports live pricing might be unlikely in your country But at least itd be useful and technically possible,lvoal96,3.0,1gkt1pv

comment,lvqxpl0,Frost-Wzrd,,2,2024-11-06 17:38:15,,,,lol my parents oven has a notification that comes on the tv when its done preheating seems unnecessary,lvoafx0,2.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvw2th3,fullup72,,5,2024-11-07 13:09:46,,,,the notification might be useful if you have a 5000 sqft home and you are watching TV on the other end of the house but then again at that point the oven would finish preheating while you walk over there,lvqxpl0,3.0,1gkt1pv
comment,lvwh2hv,Frost-Wzrd,,1,2024-11-07 14:33:10,,,,exactly and their oven is like 20ft from the tv,lvw2th3,4.0,1gkt1pv

comment,lvop3k5,AverageLoz,,18,2024-11-06 10:36:19,,,,For those that wont read this its actually nearly always the companion app and not the device itself that is doing the spying Cant say I have come across this problem myself but companion apps requesting access to your phones cameramicrophone etc is a little concerning,,0.0,1gkt1pv

comment,lw2idi2,None,,1,2024-11-08 12:40:47,,,,who the hell connects all these appliances to the internet It makes no sense to do so because I cant tell it to go to the freezer grab so fries and start cooking Id have to do all that stuff then get on an app just to tell it to start when theres already buttons there that would be quicker to just push vs the likely 30 screens 80 settings and a few popups Id likely have to deal with on an app We need to make appliances dumb again,,0.0,1gkt1pv
