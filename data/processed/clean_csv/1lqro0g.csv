comment,n17xde0,swarmy1,,105,2025-07-03 23:54:00,,,,I feel like some extra ventilation in the dock would have been a good idea They have a tiny blower in there to cool the docks internals They could have sized it up a bit to improve airflow around the console,n15gw0d,1.0,1lqro0g

comment,n190qj1,dramafan1,,29,2025-07-04 04:07:06,,,,It definitely gets hotter and the fans run more if using it in docked mode Maybe its more under clocked when in handheld mode Or a large external display uses the GPU more,n15gw0d,1.0,1lqro0g
comment,n1av4b4,unripenedfruit,,25,2025-07-04 13:12:51,,,,It has more power available so it will run at higher clocks when docked This was the same with the original Switch Handheld mode had reduced performance Except according to this it sounds like they maybe didnt get it quite right with the Switch 2,n190qj1,2.0,1lqro0g

comment,n1ey859,MultiMarcus,,0,2025-07-05 03:27:11,,,,Well I was referring to how like my iPad even if I use it for an entire day it doesnt warm up noticeably at all Sure theres probably actually some heat radiating from it but I cant feel that Meanwhile something like a steam deck or my desktop PC or now the switch 2 feel slightly warm Right out of the dock it feels warmer but not like overheating level warm Just warm to the touch These gaming handhelds almost always run quite hot The switch 2 is in my mind actually one of the ones that runs cooler At least compared to the more highpowered windows based handhelds,n1ewtjw,4.0,1lqro0g
comment,n1eyk1r,cloudcreeek,,1,2025-07-05 03:29:44,,,,Interesting From my iPhone 12 when its charging and Im using it to watch streaming shows it gets noticeably hot Sometimes it even needs to power off to cool down I personally dont own a switch 2 but my laptop also gets noticeably hot Maybe you just got luckyhave good enough ventilation in your place for it to not be an issue but the fact that its an issue for so many other people should tell you it isnt just a oneortwo person thing,n1ey859,5.0,1lqro0g

comment,n18ss9j,ChubbyChew,,0,2025-07-04 03:11:37,,,,Im not sure if this works in the way that people imply As i see it gaming as an industry is still new enough that it would have consistent generational growth no Which is to say every subsequent generation should consistently be having more and more people who are willing to approach games as a medium or who grew up with them My brothers around 40 and a lot of his nostalgia is centered around the SNES PS1 era of games He still buys consoles bought a switch 2 and i dont doubt there are a lot more people in his generation who do the same Consider that generation the current rising ceiling All the kids being born after his generation are being born into an era where games have a lot more relevance and appeal Until his generation literally starts to die of age or lose interest in games entirely The pool of people who are likely to buy games should just be increasing Unless a company or the market fails drastically somewhere every subsequent console generation should be performing substantially better than the last It should be the expectation Theyre gaining exponentially more relevant market But its always played off as a suprise that growth is still happening lol And thats before we even talk about wider distribution looking for more literal markets to sell Even if an entire generation or even 2 decided this sucks the number probably still goes up lol,n15c07a,2.0,1lqro0g

comment,n18liqv,ChubbyChew,,1,2025-07-04 02:24:23,,,,Heating was always an issue with Switch 1 in my experience Everyone i knew irl eventually had some form of damage from it Actually ended up sending mine to Nintendo and getting either a fix or replacement I would like to think its something thatd be corrected with the Switch 2 but i have 0 expectation of that being the case If nothing else at least repairs and replacements in my experience were free If not time consuming All we know for certain is whether its a legitimate design concern or not too many people are going to look for ways to represent it as somehow always being the fault of the consumer,n14znnf,1.0,1lqro0g

comment,n17ve3w,MachinaThatGoesBing,,0,2025-07-03 23:42:25,,,,Why do you keep using this weird phrase The suggestion of a trend That phrase doesnt really mean anything and 2 or 6 or 10 or even 20 consoles having an issue out of several million isnt a trend nor does it remotely suggest one Those are just pretty typical end of the MTBF bell curve numbers if this is a problem and not human error With any piece of equipment with any component going into a bigger piece of equipment theres going to be a certain number that are on the edge of tolerance or on the edge of failure but in completely undetectable ways There is no amount of QA process that can remedy this its just kind of a fact of making something It doesnt suggest bigger trends When our iMac came in 2001 and the hard drive died in it after a couple months of working finethat was frustrating but not indicative of some kind of negligence on the manufacturers part Just a component that tested as working but was apparently on the edge It is irresponsible of a tech journalist to publish something suggesting that there are larger trends based on what is essentially statistical noise and gossip on a site where people post anonymously Like all journalists their job is to increase peoples knowledge about the world That includes sharing knowledge about normal manufacturing flaw rates that they ought to possess if theyre at all qualified for their job If a pattern emerges of an actually significant number of units all with the same issue and with some degree of certainty that user error isnt at fault then it starts to get outside of the territory of normalcy and it becomes worth reporting on Even when there is a trend it doesnt always suggest negligence When every single one of the dozen to two dozen Dell Optiplex GX270 desktops we had at my workplace in 2006 needed a motherboard replacement because of bad capacitorsthat actually did suggest that there might be a larger issue Though it could still have just been an issue confined to that run Even then it wasnt necessarily one the manufacturer should have been able to catch given that the failures all happened after about 45 years of use I dont see any reasonable way to test for this sort of failure before shipping out Though it is probably something their supplier should have caught while stress testing their capacitor designs,n16ku57,8.0,1lqro0g

comment,n16eax1,KananX,,1,2025-07-03 19:04:13,,,,Its a terrible overpriced device outdated hardware that eats too much power badly designed dock that overheats the device aside from general overheating due to either bad design or outdated hardware infamous Ampere architecture of Nvidia that was never well known to be efficient all this for the great price of just 500 bucks Sadly people didnt boycott it because until this point it wasnt well known how bad the device truly is in the end its 200300 bucks worth at best sold at 500 and you have to deal with these issues didnt even mention the 2002 era sluggish LCD screen Oh and the games are also cheap at just 80 bucks or so per game All in all a great deal I bet,,0.0,1lqro0g
comment,n16ooiu,AntiGrieferGames,,7,2025-07-03 19:55:31,,,,Interesting that even the x86 Devices are much superior better and newer than a switch 2 which are z1 extreme aka 2023 chips The Switch 2 uses a 2020 nvidia architecture aka Ampere which is no wonder why its ineffiecy also Apere is made by Samsung which is the overheat issue knowing for that And Samsung Chips are very known to be crappy Not much issue on a desktoplineout laptop not aswell but the arm versions yes,n16eax1,1.0,1lqro0g

comment,n195xiu,Mhugs05,,4,2025-07-04 04:45:50,,,,Its very competitive at its price point Runs pretty much every game thats available better than a steam deck while using less power and costing less I also wouldnt be surprised to see a firmware update for the screen adding overdrive that takes care of the motion blur Id also much rather have a slower refresh speed monitor with vrr vs even an OLED without vrr Theres lots of very in depth analysis on digital foundry especially cyberpunk going into detail about the performance It even regularly beats out the Xbox series s because of how good dlss is even though its running at a lower internal resolution and consuming a fraction of the power DLSS makes it better than all of the other handhelds available because they currently all only have fsr3 at best which is trash,n16eax1,1.0,1lqro0g
comment,n1baftk,KananX,,-1,2025-07-04 14:37:39,,,,The steam deck has a great screen and doesnt overheat the steam deck is a fully usable PC the Switch is not try again you sound like a Nvidia fanboy pathetic to be a corporate trillion dollar ass kisser in 2025 while those same people dont give a fuck about you and demand highest prices while ripping you off with bad products Also the ROG Ally completely destroys the Switch in every regard learn to open your eyes get minimal information about tech and come back,n195xiu,2.0,1lqro0g
