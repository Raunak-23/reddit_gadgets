comment,m7uopry,YeOldeSandwichShoppe,,88,2025-01-18 19:37:06,,,,Looks like a continuation of an established trend after production is wellestablished salvage the lower quality silicon and sell a downclocked but otherwise feature complete product as with the 7500F 5700X3D etc Hope this carries on in future architectures and they dont try to cut cache etc,m7tdr89,1.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7yc1mn,zyntaxable,,9,2025-01-19 08:44:40,,,,Interesting I dont really know much about CPU manufacturing Is this really how it works Lower grade silicon results in a slower CPU Id imagine silicon is silicon so I wonder how is it lower grade,m7uopry,2.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7yd9rc,TheLepersAffinity,,31,2025-01-19 08:56:56,,,,Yes it is its an essential part of chip making Parts of the chip dont always work so they get disabled and sold with fewer cores This is really common and only 70 ish of chips made are actually good enough to be used for their intended product,m7yc1mn,3.0,1i4a1yr

comment,m7yhsxb,Zed_or_AFK,,15,2025-01-19 09:43:10,,,,Massive GPUs probably have even lower yield Statistically random errors will fault more chips if chips become larger is area,m7ydcfc,5.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7yibf2,SteveThePurpleCat,,15,2025-01-19 09:48:24,,,,Silicon can have a lot of internal flaws and modern processors with a lot of cores require quite a significant perfect area of it which can be difficult Chip makers can get very unlucky and end up with a yield that they can only get a handful of good large chips out of So they make there super fancy 16 core chip to find out that the batch fails internal testing but make perfectly fine 12 core chips with the faulty areas disabled Turning a total loss into a still profitable product Some APUSOCs combined CPU and GPU chips may have faulty GPU cores due to silicon failures so those areas can be disabled and the rest of the chip sold purely as a CPU You can buy AMD systems which are essentially PS5s but the chips only work as CPUs The 4700S,m7yc1mn,3.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7yiroy,zyntaxable,,1,2025-01-19 09:53:00,,,,So how do they sell these faulty processors as a single product I cant imagine the same area of these processors failing all the time Does this mean that each lower grade CPU is unique in the sense that different cores are enabled on each chip,m7yibf2,4.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7ylg7s,SteveThePurpleCat,,18,2025-01-19 10:20:19,,,,CPUs are built in families same architecture pin layout and features but different core counts and speeds So if a 8 core CPU has a faulty core or two they get locked off and it is sold the same as the 6 core member of the family Which in turn would get sold as the budget 4 core if that had a faulty core or two There will be thousands failing from every yield and getting knocked down to the lower version And Chips may indeed have different locked off cores but the internal logic of the chip is just set to ignore them 2 and 3 dont work Then use 145678 and display as a 6core Or all the cores work but are slightly flawed and dont clock as high so that gets sold as a nonoverclockable slower version This can effect the end user if they are into overclocking etc Your chip might become unstable with a tiny overclock while your mate with the exact same chip can get an extra Ghz with ease We calling that winninglosing the silicon lottery So an I7 would become an I5 or a high clocked 7600K would become a locked lower speed 7600T The Cell processor in the Playstation 3 had 8 special little cores SPEs however it was unlikely that all of them would work so the faulty one was disabled or if all worked then a working one was disabled so every PS3 had a dead or disabled core inside making all systems equal and to reduce costs from yield wastage,m7yiroy,5.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7ymdt6,zyntaxable,,3,2025-01-19 10:29:52,,,,Thank you for the comprehensive explanation It all makes sense and its fun to know,m7ylg7s,6.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m87rr4s,None,,1,2025-01-20 19:40:50,,,,Interesting Thx for sharing this The newly released Ryzen 5 7400F might be this type of a processor with no onboard graphics,m7yibf2,4.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m81hi2u,YeOldeSandwichShoppe,,1,2025-01-19 20:22:31,,,,Just to be clear I dont think the raw silicon wafers are of any lower quality but the lithography process isnt flawless or perfectly consistent Some individual dies may have defects or variation in their electrical properties So in addition to what the other reply mentioned obvious defects there will be more subtle differences between individual CPUs that have an effect on their operating frequencies and voltage So during verification some CPUs may not reliably operate at the desired frequency and voltage of a given model thus cannot be sold as such They might be thrown away or as is suspected with all these late AMD launches clocked lower and branded as a new model This is all super complicated and I know next to nothing but thats the general gist,m7yc1mn,3.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m8nimjr,Thewonderboy94,,1,2025-01-23 02:05:25,,,,Same applies to GPUs in a similar manner Like I think usually or at least sometimes NVIDIAs 70 series GPUs are based off lower quality 80 series dilicone with a bunch of disabled CUDA cores etc Although with GPUs this applies more specifically on the GPU core itself while theres a lot of stuff literally around the core thats built for that card model and price target specifically The 60 series GPUs on the other hand usually tend to be their own model even though I know some prebuit OEM GPUs could sometimes be really funky like this too my old prebuilt had a GTX 560 Ti with 1256MB of VRAM but no 560 had that amount of VRAM so the card was actually a further downgraded 570 with some CUDA cores disabled Though I dont know if 570 was a downgraded 580 in that gen a well Edit In some instances its possible to unlock some of those disabled cores and features with custom firmware but usually its not recommended since they were originally disabled for a reason to begin with There are still some instances of that working and people essentially get a free upgrade there,m7yc1mn,3.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7tyeer,--Bazinga--,,-72,2025-01-18 17:25:17,,,,Yes because a AM5 and DDR5 memory are so cheap s AM4 with R5x00 and DDR4 is still cheaper and a lot faster than this,m7tdr89,1.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7u1sfp,Cry_Wolff,,23,2025-01-18 17:42:08,,,,I paid less for Ryzen 3500 B550 mobo 32 GB RAM than cheapest AM5 processor AM5 is getting cheaper so Im not complaining either,m7tyeer,2.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7u3wfo,Paweron,,20,2025-01-18 17:52:28,,,,How is AM4 a lot fast than this Anything except the x3d CPUs are all worse than the 7400f for gaming This leaves the 5700x3d as the only real competition and it is more expensive than a 7400f While the mainboard and RAM for AM5 are more expensive they became a lot cheaper recently So an AM4 is a little cheaper but certainly not a lot faster,m7tyeer,2.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7ukdr8,diuturnal,,2,2025-01-18 19:15:19,,,,Microcenter should still be selling the 5600x3D But thats a moot point,m7u3wfo,3.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7wkcwe,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,1,2025-01-19 01:36:39,,,,The 7600X is faster than a 5800X3D in a lot of games As you say this 7400f wont be far enough off of the best AM4 to worry about and being able to upgrade to the last of the line AM5 X3D next year is a big plus,m7u3wfo,3.0,1i4a1yr

comment,m7urehs,nopointers,,31,2025-01-18 19:51:02,,,,Ive had good success with AliExpress buying small electronics supplies standard chips connectors solder etc Basically you dont have to worry about counterfeits because youre not buying a brand and the producing a part would be as expensive as the real thing Shipping times vary all over the place from days to weeks Speaking of which watch the shipping costs Sometimes they try to slip in per item instead of for the entire order Also an order that has multiple sellers will charge separately for each Its especially irritating because their logistics are pretty good about getting everything consolidated into a single package usually an envelope with bubble wrap and lots of tape,m7u8w0d,4.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7vbwdo,gramathy,,10,2025-01-18 21:39:41,,,,Their mini pc selection is pretty good too again youre not really buying a name brand for a premium so counterfeits are rare as youre buying low end parts anyway my opnsense box was an aliexpress purchase with 4x25g interfaces for about 120 WAY more capable than a consumer router at the same price assuming you could even get one at that price that didnt have wifi since I manage wifi separately,m7urehs,5.0,1i4a1yr
comment,m7w0jel,AirFryerAreOverrated,,4,2025-01-18 23:48:08,,,,While the price is great I would never buy a whole prebuilt from Aliexpress because of shit like this And funnily enough many of the Chinese manufacturers isnt even doing this on purpose They just copy the installation media that some other manufacturer made and somewhere down the chain it gets infected and keeps spreading There have been instances of an infected Android image being used for a whole bunch of generic Android boxes and half of the malware arent even functional because its been installed to an incompatible hardware,m7vbwdo,6.0,1i4a1yr

comment,m7ual26,stellvia2016,,8,2025-01-18 18:25:42,,,,I would say overall there are a lot more shady sellers or simply sellers of junk offbrands than eBayAmazon but AliExpress is at least one step up from Wish or Temu Getting ripped offbeing disappointed is the default experience for WishTemu With AliExpress yes if you vet sellers you can be moderately assured of at least getting the product as showndescribed,m7u9t08,6.0,1i4a1yr
