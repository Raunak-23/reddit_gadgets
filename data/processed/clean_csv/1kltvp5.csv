comment,ms7yyqm,SupremeDictatorPaul,,8,2025-05-14 05:03:53,,,,I made the same move and I think the 5x optical zoom on the 15 Pro Plus is a huge upgrade if you often zoom in for photos of things The CPU is clearly faster too with the 12 now seeming far less responsive in the UI Honestly just getting the responsiveness back was huge for me Finally moving to USBC for charging was really nice too Were slowly retiring our lightning charging cables so itll be nice to have one cable type around One complaint about Apples USBC connector though is that it seems far less reliable at data with abuse Wife and I both use it for CarPlay in our cars and after a month or so the connection will be prone to disconnects with moving the phone around Ive tried a few different cable brands without improving reliability Its weird because the cable wont feel more loose but replacing with a new cable fixes things for a while And dont see the same issue when just charging via cable at night,ms7dfh9,3.0,1kltvp5

comment,ms6fjcc,yungfishstick,,88,2025-05-13 23:14:09,,,,The smartphone industry in China is very cutthroat which only benefits the average Chinese consumer by giving them a vast amount of phones to choose from at every imaginable price point from multiple different OEMs all competing for the same pool of users Imagine a certain type of phone you want and chances are a Chinese OEM is making something almost or exactly like it at a fairly reasonable price In the US its pretty much the exact opposite and the gap in hardware between low end phones midrange phones and high end phones is larger which is also reflected in how much they cost A flagship that would typically cost 800 in the US might cost anywhere between 400600 in China For being a free market country theres actually very little competition in the US when it comes to smartphones and consumer electronics in general,ms5bq27,1.0,1kltvp5
comment,ms9aexj,Betancorea,,15,2025-05-14 12:17:28,,,,This is why I always laugh when people think Chinese made products are crap They fail to realise the insane competition in China forces companies to raise their game because if they dont consumers will ditch them in a heart beat People there arent accepting substandard goods another example is how Volkswagen dropped the ball so bad they went from a reputable brand to meh when compared to the latest Chinese car offerings Meanwhile in the west theres minimal competitive pressure Apple releases an annual iphone that makes minor incremental upgrades while Samsung and Google take it easy resting on their laurels,ms6fjcc,2.0,1kltvp5
comment,msdp9uv,yungfishstick,,3,2025-05-15 02:06:34,,,,China from the 2010s to today is a bit reminiscent of how Japan was from the mid 70s to late 90s at least in terms of consumer electronics Ive used some Chinese flagships from Huawei Vivo Meizu and ZTE and theyre all as good if not better than smartphones here in the US when it comes to hardware Some OEMs like Meizu and ZTE fall a little short when it comes to software but Vivo and Huawei all have very good software at least to me Both have Android skins that sort of shamelessly resemble iOS but functionally theyre fantastic and thats all that really matters IMO Very responsive no stutters whatsoever really nice animations and good English translations in the UI Were really missing out,ms9aexj,3.0,1kltvp5
comment,ms7cj09,RationalLies,,22,2025-05-14 02:27:16,,,,A flagship that would typically cost 800 in the US might cost anywhere between 400600 in China Incorrect Long gone are the days that flagship specs can be had in China for under 800 The Huawei Pura 70 Ultra 1TB is over 1500 dollars in China now Thats not the export price thats in the domestic Chinese market The first few generations of Xiaomi and OnePlus were absolute steals for the price Truly excellent specs for 400 Camera quality was a step behind but it was more than forgivable for the price In about 2018 however Chinese smartphone manufacturers finally turned the pricing corner they had been so impatiently waiting to turn The biggestbest Chinese manufacturers finally bumped pricing up to pretty much match Apple and Samsung,ms6fjcc,2.0,1kltvp5
comment,ms7j9wa,yungfishstick,,27,2025-05-14 03:10:19,,,,Globally yes Chinese flagships cost roughly the same as their nonChinese counterparts Domestically its a different story Vivo X200 Pro mini and the Pixel 9 Pro are pretty similar yet the Vivo has a bigger battery slightly better cameras plus a way better SOC and costs 660 for the 12256 variant while the Pixel costs 1099 for the 256GB storage variant except you get 4GB more RAM The Find X8 Pro costs 745 for the 12256 variant domestically while the S25 costs 1K for the same configuration except the cameras are arguably worse and the battery is smaller This doesnt take into account flagship killers though Redmi K80 Pro would be considered a flagship here in the states and given its specs youd expect it to be priced at 700800 or even more but it costs about 500 for the 12256 variant domestically The same goes for the Vivo S20 Pro except thats a bit cheaper at 470 for the 12256 variant Honor GT Pro comes with the same SOC as the S25U decent cameras ultrasonic fingerprint reader IP69 rating and a 7200mAh battery with 90W charging yet it costs about 500 for the 12256 variant For reference the Galaxy A56 and Pixel 9a both cost 500 yet they dont even come remotely close to what Chinese OEMs can give you for the same price,ms7cj09,3.0,1kltvp5

comment,ms8vfah,hamiltonisoverrat3d,,3,2025-05-14 10:24:54,,,,There are plenty of phone options in the US The big difference isnt hardware its ecosystems The US consumer buys into the Apple ecosystem Google but for not Android rather search Workspace Maps Chrome Etc Meta and Amazon China is almost inverted where the hardware and OS Android is largely commoditized and super apps are the ecosystem There is effectively none of ecosystems above,ms6fjcc,2.0,1kltvp5
comment,ms9icwv,phero1190,,3,2025-05-14 13:06:07,,,,There arent many options in the US You get Apple Samsung Google and Motorola in stores maybe OnePlus in some markets Youre missing out on a ton of other often better options,ms8vfah,3.0,1kltvp5
comment,msb607b,hamiltonisoverrat3d,,3,2025-05-14 18:00:11,,,,The top 5 brands including Apple command 78 of share in China The US is very 2 brand driven Apple and Samsung I would counter that plenty of unlocked phones are available from many brands in the US People just want their Apple and Samsung makes great phones,ms9icwv,4.0,1kltvp5
comment,msb6xua,phero1190,,1,2025-05-14 18:04:40,,,,And I would counter that with people but whats available in stores Every parent that k know that has a Samsung is disappointed in it because the cameras have such long shutter speeds and makes for blurry pictures Its not so much that theyre great its that theyre whats easy to get Ive shown people the pictures my x200 Ultra can take and theyre genuinely impressed even more so when comparing to what to they have but they say they wont get it because they cant just pick one up,msb607b,5.0,1kltvp5
comment,mscegq1,hamiltonisoverrat3d,,1,2025-05-14 21:40:18,,,,Samsung is pretty well known to have better hardware than Apple Apple wins because of the UX ecosystem and simplicity and quality of workflows like taking a picture Every carrier carries a boatload of Samsung devices Ive never heard device availability being an issue,msb6xua,6.0,1kltvp5

comment,ms75inx,zapporian,,11,2025-05-14 01:45:39,,,,The high end vivo xiaomi oppo etc offerings have grossly superior camera offerings to the pro max ish with caveats and at like 23 of the price And 90W fast charging And variously onboard mic arrays that embarrass everything on the apple lineup iphones still obviously have better more energy efficient chipsets sort of though thats almost completely irrelevant given that smartphone processor performance is total overkill has been for some time and those phones all have onboard AI processing too just a generation or so behind apple The one actual differentiator I could maybe think of is the lidar sensor Though I could be off base on that And the iphones specifically need a bunch of stuff for faceid bc apple killed off touchid and never implemented in under screen fingerprint readers which all of those chinese android phones have The reasons for all of this should be downright obvious apple operates with extremely high margins chinese manufacturers are operating at cutthroat competition with very low but not zero matgins Apple chips and ios aside all of those phones are often using near identical components and the chinese phones have outright better hardware components if not necessarily software at the same similar pricepoints And this is just talking about flagships the difference in price vs hardware for budget apple phones like the SE or 16e is pretty severe More or less checks out if you just project that eg 50 of an iphones cost is margins note that Im potentially being very kind to apple with that guesstimate and apple still to its credit has at least some advantages from large contracts quality control and economies of scale If of course you arent buying a new phone for camera upgrades or what have you there is pretty much zero reason to upgrade on the apple side of things if youre using a phone released more or less anytime within the last 5 years Sans maybe eventually planned obsolescence OS upgrade lockout resale value falling off a cliff bc of that or what have you Ofc w tarrifs at 147 those iphones samsungs pixels might look like a good deal But outside of that yeah one doesnt exactly have to speculate much why that and an openly adversarial US president is not too surprisingly causing apples chinese iphone sales to fall off a cliff And presumably indian plausibly EU insofar as apple sales even exist are widely prevalent there anyways as well Bear in mind that many of those chinese phones only recently released ish while current iphone flagships did not but this has been an ongoing trend for a while at this point And nevermind yes the pixel samsung etc,ms5bq27,1.0,1kltvp5

comment,msfzy6g,alc4pwned,,0,2025-05-15 13:16:16,,,,Yes but those are entirely separate models Their main lineup that most people buys and which competes with iPhones has been just as stagnant if not more so Also funnily enough I actually switched to a Z Fold6 around 6 months ago myself I enjoy it but Samsungs folding lineup has also made very few improvements over the last few years The mere fact that they have folding phones isnt really anything newspecial anymore,mse5ofb,3.0,1kltvp5
comment,msgt5vh,MoTHA_NaTuRE,,1,2025-05-15 15:45:52,,,,What im trying to say is android phones offer more options more features that literally takes apple 5yrs or more to implement like folding type c fast charging alot of different price points looks features low end to super high end cameras The software evolves in a faster pace whether good or bad People like to see differences new and shiny things in hardware and software especially for people who buy new phones every year Im not saying apple is bad but its like buying and eating the same food every single day even if it tastes great and you like it it eventually gets stale,msfzy6g,4.0,1kltvp5
comment,mshpd0f,alc4pwned,,0,2025-05-15 18:21:31,,,,Android phones borrow features from Apple all the time too youre just not paying attention to that stuff Proper face unlock lock screen shortcuts the whole control center style menu satellite sos physical mute switch Yes there is definitely more variety if you go with Android But obviously that will be true Apple is just one company whereas many many companies make Android phones,msgt5vh,5.0,1kltvp5
