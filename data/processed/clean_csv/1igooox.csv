comment,masajcy,spesimen,,12,2025-02-03 19:09:06,,,,hmm thats like one of the only things i use siri for that and setting timers i wonder why it doesnt work for you my main wish is that it would be context sensitive so if i ask something like when is the tigers game tomorrow it will tell me but then i want to say ok set a reminder for that but instead i have to specifically say the date and time and name of the reminder to set it,marlawa,3.0,1igooox
comment,mat4g5y,stellvia2016,,2,2025-02-03 21:26:56,,,,Yeah what they need to have is not only the LLM but a secondary thread that is fed those different pieces of the conversation to do more comparisons Sometimes it feels like they do that other times decidedly not,masajcy,4.0,1igooox

comment,marb483,AgencyBasic3003,,8,2025-02-03 16:24:59,,,,Depends on the use case We developers have definitely around 50100 more productivity due to AI Its like having a copilot sitting next to you who does the boring work and is refactoring stuff while you think about the exciting problems The 20month for the cursor subscription is something all of us gladly pay for the nice productivity boost,maqvdqa,2.0,1igooox
comment,marfhrl,IM_OK_AMA,,14,2025-02-03 16:45:30,,,,Programming is the only place where your job is to produce text that is extremely formulaic and verifiably correct Plus theres just an astounding corpus of good training data in open source Not just the fact that the code is available but that _each change_ to the code can be trained on with context like the commit message and pull request that describe what the change is doing in plain english Programming is like the _ideal_ use case for LLM assistance,marb483,3.0,1igooox
comment,maseg7u,NickCharlesYT,,3,2025-02-03 19:27:14,,,,And yet I seem to have very little luck in that regard I tried using various AI models over the weekend to do some emergency patching It was for a web app in an environment and language I was less familiar with so I figured the AI could figure out the basic syntax while I tell it what I need but I swear I spent more than half of my time going in circles while the AIs completely failed to provide working code and kept committing basic syntax errors and omitting context or even complete lines of code I would give it context with function definitions and requirements and it would ignore the defined function parameters and try to use functions that didnt exist in the scope or even make up its own functions to do things instead I also ran into an issue where some form validation wasnt working properly due to an abstraction layer in some tool we were using and it literally went in circles trying to make changes to get it working and every time it kept telling me things like This will work this is my final change this will 100 work this is completely foolproof and nothing fucking worked I spent an hour trying to get working code out of it but ultimately gave up and spent another hour finding the obscure documentation to just do it myself,marfhrl,4.0,1igooox
comment,mash0dc,None,,1,2025-02-03 19:39:02,,,,Wonder if its similar issue wise what you are having when I was fiddling around with various text models meta and others Fiddled with chat bots and yes even those types and while im not exactly the strongest writer with a advanced doctorate in english studies ugh Never ceased to end how the only way you would get good results out of the stupid thing was basically running the show yourself chat wise Then it became obvious it was basically taking your input and parrotingbuilding off that Maybe it needed more work in the backstorylore cards and more but just felt half assed like if you didnt do all the work then it did nothing except giving pathetic one liners run on lectures of positivity etc,maseg7u,5.0,1igooox
comment,mashtjl,NickCharlesYT,,1,2025-02-03 19:42:47,,,,I had a subscription I used for ChatGPTs advanced reasoning models including one thats supposed to be specifically tailored for programming They all did the same thing just with various degrees of chattiness in between,mash0dc,6.0,1igooox
comment,matxtlh,Kyrond,,0,2025-02-03 23:48:55,,,,Yeah it doesnt matter that code is repetitive and verifiably correct when thats not what LLM is good at It has no internal logic checking or syntax checking so all that works for me is basic scripts like search all files in certain dir and find a piece of text compare that with this list,maseg7u,5.0,1igooox
comment,marinz1,alickz,,3,2025-02-03 17:00:03,,,,Programming is the only place where your job is to produce text that is extremely formulaic and verifiably correct Doctors lawyers analysts various types of accountants anyone with paperwork They all have a need to produce text that is formulaic and verifiably correct Plus the legal medicinal and business corpuses would all also be enormous Not to mention how good LLMs act as a rubber duck for debugging which many professions besides programming do Even if it remains at current tech in one or two generations the social stigma will be gone and many if not most jobs will have an AI copilot Anyone who wants to keep up is recommended to start learning them now just as our parents and grandparents needed to learn computers to keep up,marfhrl,4.0,1igooox
comment,maru6fn,IM_OK_AMA,,22,2025-02-03 17:53:31,,,,I disagree youve misunderstood my comment Doctors lawyers all have a need to produce text that is formulaic and verifiably correct Youre using verifiably correct differently from how I am I mean that the verification _happens automatically and is effective_ not that its _needed_ Code must parsecompile which ensures the code is valid and has automated testing that ensures the code does what it was supposed to and the developer can manually test to observe the desired behavior None of that exists for doctors or lawyers filling out a form In fact forms are minefields for LLMs because theyre really bad at leaving things blank Theyll happily hallucinate a middle initial or medical history or whatever The human has to read every single form field to make sure its correct at which point why not fill it in yourself,marinz1,5.0,1igooox

comment,maum54u,AgencyBasic3003,,1,2025-02-04 01:58:05,,,,You should try cursor The composer can autogenerate the usual boilerplate while you can focus on the actual business logic,mas3870,4.0,1igooox
comment,mauteuz,moch1,,2,2025-02-04 02:37:54,,,,The thing is that Im rarely writing much boiler plate at work Thats not where most of my time goes so the possible time savings are minimal Thats why I find it useful for hobby projects or home assistant config generation but not for actual work in an enterprise In my work I spend more time reading other peoples code to figure out what I need to write than I do writing code Even then more of my time is spent writing tech specs establishing processes running bug bases getting alignment with partner teams etc The biggest time saving for me is writing sql queries not code Even that isnt a huge time savings,maum54u,5.0,1igooox

comment,maumiao,AgencyBasic3003,,1,2025-02-04 02:00:03,,,,This depends on how you use it We use cursor for example which is a vscode fork that has extremely good code generation capabilities for boilerplate and refactoring,matvzcp,4.0,1igooox

comment,mas85mf,RandomlyMethodical,,6,2025-02-03 18:58:03,,,,It seemed like most of the features they were talking about in the Apple Intelligence commercials were the same features they talked about when Siri first came out in 2011 About the only thing I still use Siri for is setting timers while Im cooking and now even thats gotten slow and unreliable Last night it took her over 15s to register what I said and start a 1 minute timer I can set down whatever Im working on and manually start a timer before Siri,maqeawd,1.0,1igooox

comment,maxfmk7,Slightlydifficult,,1,2025-02-04 14:43:16,,,,Siri doesnt get updated until 184 apparently The beta should start this week probably Thursday if they follow the same pattern as previous years Apple has been including neural cores in their chips for years in anticipation of new AI features Im cautiously optimistic Siri will be much improved The fact that they havent scrapped their LLM and gone with something open source bodes well but Apple is also famously slow with new technologies so well see,maqeawd,1.0,1igooox

comment,matmrsh,MoonOut_StarsInvite,,9,2025-02-03 22:52:52,,,,The thing that gets me is that I dont think people realize the cumulative effect of this across our entire daily lives Ive been on a journey to figure out whats going on with my mental health since I quit drinking And I realized that all of these things take me to the brink of my sanity There are bugs in the platform I use at work The IT security policy requires a restart My social media account is locked The router needs rebooted The smart lights arent working The Roku remote isnt pairing The router needs rebooted again And on and on So when people are out here messing with these products I just really dont think people understand the scope at which our lives become dependent on how things operate and the ease at which they do so Thats why I have no desire for AI you people glitch out on that shit Im just trying to keep the fucking lights on over here,mar4wse,2.0,1igooox

comment,maqn938,NeverLookBothWays,,1,2025-02-03 14:23:15,,,,I think he means moreso the paradigm of the iPhone that Steve Jobs envisioned With Jobs he was able to fundamentally drive the tech industry forward with new ideas that people actually made use of and wanted Beyond his death we have primarily seen the Apple Watch and Vision Pro but these have not really had that same fundamental impact on technology that Steve Jobs had Instead it seems like Apple is leaning on the product line Steve had iterating on it rather than pushing the envelope with revolutionary ideas We kind of take it for granted now but the iPhone was revolutionary and to some degree so was the iPad Nothing came close to the experiences either product provided at the time of their introduction and since then many have jumped on the form factor bandwagon even the iPod was a revolutionary idea and has served its time Nothing Apple has come up with since has had that same magic to it,maqjktt,3.0,1igooox
comment,maqtu1c,DidItForButter,,2,2025-02-03 14:59:26,,,,I agree with you The iPhone was a monumental leap in technology one that forked many other technologies and ascended start ups to multi billion dollar corporations It was the nexus point for smart devices and truly mobile computing It was a Pandoras box But like any significant nexus point in technology cars guns the internet you can only iterate off the concept until some other nexus point comes along But Apple didnt lean on the iPhone they leaned into it And realizing they couldnt capture lightning twice they shifted to their ecosystem The airpods and watches while not on the same level of leaps in technology are huge innovations,maqn938,4.0,1igooox
comment,maqw1lg,NeverLookBothWays,,1,2025-02-03 15:11:10,,,,I think it really comes down to how Jobs just had this amazing intuition on how we interface with technology and that drove all of his demands on how technology should be designed He ran that company with passion obsession and really a lot of abrasiveness as well but it was necessary for the realization of these ideas even if no one but him initially saw the potential He would obsess over the placement of pixels and minute details of different fonts and layouts He brought to the industry the idea of diegetic interfaces which was honestly a great experience for its time even if weve outgrown it where the interfaces resembled realworld materials and objects Not a perfect person by all means but a visionary nonetheless who understood a lot about how technology could fit in our lives without getting in the way,maqtu1c,5.0,1igooox

comment,maqs6di,Edward_TH,,16,2025-02-03 14:50:35,,,,Its more like the smaller battery is cheaper and its good enough so products have higher margins Thats it They could easily put in a larger cell and have much better battery life but why bother Majority of their users wont notice the difference margins would shrink and they would sell less battery replacements Its a complete loss for the company from their point of view,maqns4o,2.0,1igooox
comment,maqukic,-Dixieflatline,,8,2025-02-03 15:03:24,,,,The why bother question is because Apple has always positioned themselves as class leaders and they done far less important engineering options just to keep that status Its the reason they put titanium in some models just to say the word titanium A 400500 mAh would not significantly decrease profit margins on the iphone and even if that was a concern theyd just raise the price accordingly knowing that price is flexible with their audience One doesnt buy an iphone because its cheap They buy it because they are locked into the brand and its a premium device,maqs6di,3.0,1igooox
comment,maqztkl,Edward_TH,,4,2025-02-03 15:30:21,,,,That works up to a point Whats the point in the mind of a megacorp I mean of providing a 3 days battery life device given that doing so at the same price would hurt their margin and doing it but rising prices accordingly would lower sales of the device AND lower sales of after sales services Apple devices are generally pretty good but they gain nothing from selling a significantly better product if even most of their end users dont get a significant difference in experience so they go for the best balance of cost to performance that works for them which is good business practice Thats also the reason why Im the beginning they didnt even disclose the battery capacity of their phone for their targeted demographic it didnt matter Most of the people who buy a new phone dont care about the actual battery capacity they care about how long that battery capacity is gonna last even you do you care more if your phone battery has X thousands mAh or if you can use it for long enough between charges without being bothersome,maqukic,4.0,1igooox

comment,mas4c7a,-Dixieflatline,,1,2025-02-03 18:40:31,,,,True When you sell 151 million of anything even the pennies add up However if you look at YoY costs to MSRP Apple makes some interesting moves from year to year For instance the cost for the iphone 14 pro was 484 with an 999 MSRP The cost of the iphone 15 pro was 523 at the same 999 MSRP making less net profit in the same model line year or year That would suggest that there is some deeper strategy than just bottom line margins Super cycles vs S years competition releases and other factors play into what they are willing to spend and net profits So a minor increase in battery sizecost would be very low impact in the grand scheme of things for their bottom line when it is clear theyll spend money to be in the conversation of top hardware,marwiao,7.0,1igooox
comment,maw5log,makomirocket,,1,2025-02-04 08:42:06,,,,Because a fuck ton of Android users would actually switch to an iPhone if they started matching the 5000mAh battery in the Ultras or the 6000mAh in the OnePlus in their bigger phones and could swing their metaphorical dick around saying that they literally have double the battery life of their competitors with better performance too Youre talking about costs as if making a product better doesnt also come with increased sales Them spending so much money on keeping their 7 year old iPhones software still up to date costs them far more in development costs and lost future sales than a better battery ever would They already make a tidy profit on their phones and with new users they get even more money from their software sales that theyre currently pushing for and is partly why theyre keeping those 7 year iPhones going,marwiao,7.0,1igooox
comment,mar6wbo,Edward_TH,,3,2025-02-03 16:04:54,,,,Do you know how much Apple pays for their batteries Or what theyre being quoted a larger one No But can you say the larger one would be more expensive Of course its basic math So why didnt they chose the latter Is the answer that they cant engineer a better phone Or that they think theyre immune to market demand so they can do whatever they want Or maybe just maybe they made their analysis over the decades and realized over and over that larger batteries gives more downsides than upsides for them and their users Apple has great engineers they could totally design their phones around larger physically batteries They are rich and their margins are far from thin they can easily cash out for higher density batteries They position themselves in the high end segment they can easily rise price accordingly They dont do that Why Because they dont need to Even during the battery capacity war about a decade ago they refused to officially disclose their phones battery capacity until they felt not doing so hurt their sales more than doing it and their much smaller batteries would have been a great show of how efficient their phones were which is exactly what happened when they officially put it on the specs but still didnt because their philosophy has always been to give the users a device that would feel like a magic box you dont need to know whats inside and how it works you just need to know that it does and it does it well I mean it was LITERALLY Steve Jobs mantra it just works what reason more do you need that Apple themselves,mar17mp,6.0,1igooox

comment,mar4ftn,fraseyboo,,4,2025-02-03 15:53:02,,,,The value proposition is very poor atm with the AVP Apple have clearly put a lot of thought into the electronics and optics but are so focussed on making it a device for media consumption that it is less usable than the iPad with significant drawbacks in terms of battery life and longterm comfort Id estimate at least 80 of the current user base for VR are children and theyre predominantly playing on the Quest because it offers a cheap entry point for VR gaming If Apple wants to be successful in the VR space then they either need to make a convincing product that appeals to the casual gaming market 500 with controllers aim for the prosumer niche that buys headsets like the Index PiMAX 1000 with controllers or make an industry focussed headset for creatives that actually provides tangible benefit to their workflow eg fullydeveloped CAD modelling 3D sculpting With how prevalent screens are in our daily life the focus on AR is a nonstarter unless the technology can be miniaturised and made effortless,maqii42,2.0,1igooox

comment,maqg24c,drae-,,3,2025-02-03 13:40:59,,,,I was responding specifically to this but even amongst the more mature providers if AI ive yet to see a really useful application that the avergae person would really benefit from and Id argue that Apple absolutely competes in this space not directly with Photoshop on workstations sure but the ai processing and on phone editing of photos and video is absolutely a segment apple competes in Theyre positioning the iPhone as the device for amateur video creation and the processing and tools come with that I dont think iPhone is lagging behind at all this is just a space with a ton of disruption and leaps forward right now Apple has stuff in the works its just not the flavour of the week being paraded right now I have little doubt theyll hit on something,maqen9w,3.0,1igooox

comment,maqk70b,audigex,,1,2025-02-03 14:05:44,,,,Not the parent commenter and I havent replaced search with AI so I cant quite comment as to the exact point theyre making but I do think I use it in a broadly similar substitute for Googling way as they do I have started to incorporate AI substantially into my workflow for things that I used to Google Eg its great for whats the command to do XYZ where I can put XYZ in natural language without having to use the correct technical term Its also great for collating quick information or finding a product with some specific qualitiesniche Eg find me X but waterproof and mains powered saves me a ton of time trawling through Zigbee sensors Where previously Id try a Google search in my own words scanread the top 4 results then repeat for another search until I found what I needed I find GPT Claudeetc do a good job of quickly scanning that information out for me I then follow the sources the AI provided or ask for sources and verify it myself As long as you stick with trust but verify then an LLM can be surpringly good for this stuff basically just a search engine that does more of the work for you I wouldnt trust it to be correct in the same way that I didnt just trust Google correctly pulled out the top result correctly but it does a better job most of the time of pulling up the right info for me to check out The problems come when people just blindly trust the output entirely rather than checking it For me I find its faster to let it do 90 of the work and use 10 of the time to verify its not hallucinating eg searching that used to take me 10 minutes becomes 1 minute of verifying the LLM output Although Ill note that the more important the information is the more Ill do it manually eg when I wanted to know whether my cough was dry or chesty I asked GPT Whereas when I wanted to know which cough medicines its safe for my pregnant partner to consume I looked it up myself,maqek7z,3.0,1igooox

comment,marzxe1,ob_knoxious,,2,2025-02-03 18:20:05,,,,Eh Apple has its problems but they have been the first to get mass success in a product segment MP3 players didnt have any mainstream success until the iPad Tablet computers were mostly just gimmicks running bad versions of Windows and oversized PDAs until the iPad released Wearables werent even considered a real segment of products before the Apple Watch Sure they werent first to market on any of those but they were the first to get it to work VR headsets were primarily very niche devices for gamers and select industries until Apple came along and went nowhere with them,maqshsv,1.0,1igooox

comment,maqdmzu,retro808,,1,2025-02-03 13:25:57,,,,Seems like theyve been in a holding pattern since Steve Jobs passed in the midlate 2000s they were the most exciting tech company with all the fresh gizmos they cranked out now its the 20th version of Macbooks and Iphones with stuff like smartwatches and home speakers on the side neither of which are revolutionary The market for AR devices like the Vision just isnt ready yet and its still in the air whether the AI craze is justified or an overhyped bubble,,0.0,1igooox
comment,maqm8wv,Aechzen,,2,2025-02-03 14:17:33,,,,I disagree entirely Those struggles show that those things just kind of suck Think about it for five seconds AR sucks There are some nice uses like heads up display while you are driving a car But full immersion AR sucks Nobody wants to walk around the world with a dorky headset looking like somebody from Star Trek AI came to Google Now the results are almost as good as they were ten years ago and take longer to load and costs 15x as much electricity to be sometimes wrong AI sucks Actual apple products like MacBook remain very good,,0.0,1igooox
