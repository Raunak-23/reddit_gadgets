comment,mjinyb3,Vandrel,,12,2025-03-24 18:11:53,,,,Nvidia has had absolutely massive mindshare for a couple decades at this point There are people who will buy Nvidia no matter what they do how they treat their customers or how their cards perform compared to AMD Even when AMDs cards were unquestionably better back around the 7970 era they still couldnt make much headway toward gaining market share in the GPU market Even for their CPUs which are absolutely destroying Intel at this point theres still quite a few people who view AMD CPUs as being cheap knockoffs but the effect wasnt quite so extreme in that market since AMD did manage to make a lot of progress there,mjh9axe,4.0,1jip9zv

comment,mjgx83d,MultiMarcus,,-9,2025-03-24 12:49:26,,,,As long as you are in the market for lower end hardware like the xx70 tier 7900 XTX and the 9070 XT are arguably reasonable competitors for the 4080 but its not a good one for the 5080 and certainly not the 5090 What was my option if I wanted a 4090 tier your card two years ago And what is my choice if I want a 5080 or a 5090 tier card now I always recommend AMD to people who are buying mid range cards and I recommend Intel to people buying low end hardware but for the highend there isnt any viable competition for Nvidia right now,mjgwsaq,2.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjioyro,Vandrel,,11,2025-03-24 18:16:47,,,,The 5080 is only around 10 faster than the 4080 Super and 7900 XTX in rasterization lets not act like its some kind of big jump from what was previously available For the 4090 and now 5090 there of course isnt any substitute but the number of regular people in the market to spend that much on a GPU is tiny,mjgx83d,3.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjiq7ab,MultiMarcus,,-11,2025-03-24 18:22:43,,,,Not only is 10 a fairly large gap but the 5080 has an actually good upscaling solution and Ray tracing is probably something you want to use on highend graphics cards especially with how many games are starting to have it as a baseline requirement or at least a very much recommended feature Indiana Jones is one of the few that require requires it but assassins Creed shadows certainly looks much better with good hardware accelerated ray tracing As for the market not really buying the 5090 or whatever I think thats very much true but thats not really the point Im making I was just mentioning that there isnt really a highend option if youre not buying Nvidia That was my primary point I even explicitly said that I recommend AMD to people who buy mid range products and Intel to low end product users,mjioyro,4.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjiunk1,Vandrel,,6,2025-03-24 18:44:21,,,,Not only is 10 a fairly large gap On paper it sounds big but in practice it isnt 60 fps vs 66 fps 120 fps vs 132 fps etc The difference exists but its rarely going to be something you can even notice let alone make a difference in gameplay but the 5080 has an actually good upscaling solution Arent all the DLSS 4 features are available on the 40 series except multi frame gen Thats what Nvidias website says And then FSR4 is quite good now as well beating out DLSS CNN by a good margin and for certain things doing a better job than DLSS transformer and Ray tracing is probably something you want to use on highend graphics cards especially with how many games are starting to have it as a baseline requirement or at least a very much recommended feature Indiana Jones is one of the few that require requires it but assassins Creed shadows certainly looks much better with good hardware accelerated ray tracing Its funny that you bring up AC Shadows theres essentially no performance difference between the 5080 the 4080 Super 7900 XTX and 9070 XT with ray tracing on,mjiq7ab,5.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjko4sh,UsernameIn3and20,,5,2025-03-25 00:13:00,,,,I love it when people keep bringimg up Raytracing might be something they care about when it tanks performance down to the absolute shitters for most games and in others genuinely doesnt even look good Maybe 1 out of 20 games actually looks good and doesnt tank frames,mjiunk1,6.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjixe34,MultiMarcus,,-1,2025-03-24 18:57:23,,,,Yeah the point was that if you want good upscaling it is NVIDIA or a new AMD card which doesnt come that close to 4080 let alone 5080 performance Since the 4080 super is an Nvidia card it still holds to my point of buying highend means buying Nvidia or its 7900 XTX which has a terrible upscaling solution using FSR 31 Great to hear that AC shadows is one of the games that doesnt have a large difference in ray tracing performance but a cadre of other games that are coming really want good hardware accelerated ray tracing performance If you want to get a highend GPU you are stuck getting Nvidia whether it be a new or old Nvidia card or youre going to be getting an AMD card with some sort of sacrifice The 9070 XT doesnt really come close to the 5080 performance in most scenarios though I still think its a much better card since it has an actual reasonable price The 7900 XTX is close enough to at least be comparable but it doesnt have a good upscaling solution and even if you get it 5090 youre going to need upscaling because games just demand it nowadays Like AMD has done a lot of good stuff and if they launched a 9080 with comparable performance to a 5080 but with FSR four it would be my go to recommendation for anyone whos buying an xx80 tier of GPU provided of course that the pricing is good,mjiunk1,6.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjiy7tc,Vandrel,,5,2025-03-24 19:01:18,,,,Its weird that you say the 7900 XTX is close enough to be comparable but the 9070 XT isnt when its the same speed in raster and much faster in ray tracing,mjixe34,7.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjj05zi,MultiMarcus,,-1,2025-03-24 19:10:42,,,,Oh I believed that the 7900 XTX was more performant as Ive personally not use that card because I prefer highend products but it was being consistently rolled out as an actual viable choice for people wanting 5080 level performance In that case there just isnt an offering thats comparable with the 5080 on the AMD side The 9070XT seems like an incredible product but its mid range and though it can brush close to 5080 level performance in some scenarios in most cases its definitely a weaker card,mjiy7tc,8.0,1jip9zv

comment,mjgxkuu,EducationallyRiced,,2,2025-03-24 12:51:46,,,,In my opinion the 50 series are a scam its all fake frames And also less melting in them cables,mjgx83d,3.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjgz0z8,MultiMarcus,,-7,2025-03-24 13:00:59,,,,Well its offering better performance than both last generation cards and all the highend AMD offerings Personally right now I am playing assassins Creed shadows on my 4090 and getting roughly 50 frames per second at 4K DLSS 4 quality mode with everything on Max Instead of playing it at that frame rate I add frame generation to smooth things out Yes there are some slight artefacts but in general the game feels similar to 90 FPS visually speaking and though there is some added latency its not a whole lot and since Im playing with a controller theres already going to be some latency Multiframe generation isnt magic of course not and the way Nvidia markets it is ridiculous but to me it would be a value added feature If I had the 5090 instead of the 4090 and I could run the game at 60 FPS and then use multi frame generation to get it up to 240 which is the refresh rate of my monitor that would be a better experience than running the game at just 60 without it Im not going to compare a real 240 and the frame generated 240 because they are not comparable What I am going to do is look and see if my gameplay feels better with frame generation or multiframe generation which I feel like it does I think Nvidia is manipulating the numbers to make it seem like they have far higher frame rates than they actually do but to me frame generation does add value,mjgxkuu,4.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjlt1hr,Peteskies,,1,2025-03-25 04:35:15,,,,Sorry youre getting 50fps in a 4090 with DLSS ON This is the state of gaming right now,mjgz0z8,5.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjh4a2r,jamesbecker211,,-9,2025-03-24 13:33:10,,,,Could you define what you mean by fake frames because its still generating the frames I would genuinely like to know what difference it makes to you if a frame was generated natively or by some form of machine learning As of now it just sounds like you have no clue what youre talking about and are just parroting what youve read elsewhere And dont say they look worse or you can tell because that just means you havent tried it or are lying,mjgxkuu,4.0,1jip9zv
comment,mjhv6gx,General_Jeevicus,,3,2025-03-24 15:53:34,,,,input lag and artifacts are the problem with fake frames just use the silicon for better processing instead its a problem of AI cards and GPUs being paired together instead of going in two different directions and providing excellence and pricing appropriate to the market,mjh4a2r,5.0,1jip9zv

comment,mjijwsz,Albatross_Charcoal,,1,2025-03-24 17:52:39,,,,Noticed some weird behaviour with my 3080 ti lately especially since the nvidia app changed and added performance section I still use X1 Afterburner but had to fight for its config to overrule the nvidia stuff My PC found to be the cause of tripping a 15a breaker when in maximum performance mode IDK what or how its doing but its the only thing on the circuit that could do it Also on a UPS surge protector Works fine otherwise get the odd monitor black screen but always comes back,mjhqgd8,1.0,1jip9zv

comment,mjindbz,Stubs_Mckenzie,,8,2025-03-24 18:09:05,,,,I think its disingenuous to suggest that confirmation bias is the cause of their concern the last 6 years of graphics card releases have absolutely had a lot of bad press for good reason The 20 series cards were way too expensive and did not deliver on promised addons they were marketed on and the 30 series while overall very good on launch baring notably bad lower end cards quickly were unavailable for anything but astronomical prices for the majority of their run due to scalping and AI use not to mention concerns about memory specs and other issues On the radeon side the 500 series was just a refresh of the 400 series that was decent price for performance but wasnt wowing anyone and the 6000 series 6700 and above was again generally well received like the Nvidia 30 series but quickly became unavailable Its unfortunate that the mostly fixed driver issues with radeon was still a cloud hanging over their head but the negative sentiment around this time was about price and availability for both brands and very valid for a very large segment of the population,mji1cs8,2.0,1jip9zv

comment,mji3t0o,TwoBionicknees,,7,2025-03-24 16:36:25,,,,Nvidia did a phenomenal PR job and internet job to make problems seem small They take over every site that has like tech forums and direct all users to their own nvidia forums most people with problems go to nvidia forums and no one else at all goes there So on reddit amd users post problems dont go to amd forums they are dead useless and not pushed to be used by amd at all and so their problems are very public Nvidia users go talk about nvidia problems in this tiny private corner of hte internet and so most people are unaware of problems I forget how long ago this was but there was a pretty big stuttering issue on nvidia cards probably like 67 years ago now and there were MASSIVE threads thousands and thousands of posts long for months on end begging for a fix but those threads werent on reddit werent on any of the store forums I check now and then tech forums it was only talked about there At the time you would have the average user swear blind Nvidia has zero driver issues ever and AMD have constant issues Its almost entirely down to PR and working hard to control where people go to get help Nvidia has plenty of driver issues they just largely get hidden,mjheotx,2.0,1jip9zv

comment,mjmaew4,kalirion,,2,2025-03-25 07:27:30,,,,Speaking strictly of its framegen based on my experience dont use it on shooters or action games requiring quick reflexes unless theyre oldretro games that come permanently locked to 30fps by the engine ie games like Viking Battle for Asgard lazy console ports without working 60fps patches etc As far as games where the GPU genuinely struggled to reach 60 I got decent results with Arise A Simple Story and Beyond a Steel Sky though I didnt play too far into this so dont know whether that would hold In these I locked the games to 30fps kept the settings near maxed 1080p and the scrollingrunningpanning were noticeably smoothed out and I didnt mind some additional input lag Whenever I tried LSFG with a FPS though I quickly disabled it they just felt so much worse to play despite the visual smoothness of looking around For funzies I played some Wacky Wheels and old DOS cart racer that runs at 1012fps with LS set to Adaptive FG 60fps It was a very surreal experience like playing the game on hallucinogenics I originally bought Lossless Scaling for the well lossless scaling functionality integer scaling to use with lowres retro games so I could see their pixels in all their glory without interpolation from GPU or monitor getting in the way So for me all this FG stuff is just a bonus that was added later Ill be getting a new PC by end of year after MS drops support for Windows 10 Win 11 wont take to my i7920 lol so right now Im avoiding games my PC struggles with both CPU and GPU wise Plenty of games in the ol backlog that I dont need any kind of framegen for performance boosting Who knows maybe Ill even get around to Skyrim probably not,mjlysu4,2.0,1jip9zv
