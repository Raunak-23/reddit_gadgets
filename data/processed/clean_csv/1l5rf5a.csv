comment,mwk25uz,noochies99,,177,2025-06-07 21:41:27,,,,Here lemme save you a click Microsofts 12inch Surface Pro powered by Qualcomms Snapdragon X Plus chip delivers impressive performance and battery life The redesigned tablet featuring a fanless design and a repositioned stylus combines the best of tablets and laptops While some apps like Premiere Pro still require Intelbased versions the overall experience is smooth and versatile,,0.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwkzaov,tablepennywad,,48,2025-06-08 01:04:17,,,,What the point in Snapdragon now that lunar lake has near parity in battery and higher performance and 0 worries of compatibility,mwk25uz,1.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwlp2h5,Esfahen,,42,2025-06-08 04:00:11,,,,Native Arm apps on the latest Snapdragon outperform Lunar Lake as far as I have seen The issue is most of the ecosystem still runs on emulated x64 which has a 1520 perf penalty which makes it fall behind Additionally the battery usage is WAY better for native apps,mwkzaov,2.0,1l5rf5a
comment,myefx6e,tablepennywad,,2,2025-06-18 05:40:10,,,,But how many native apps are there Who are making them If you are in any main professional field there are none You either go Wintel or Apple ARM,mwlp2h5,3.0,1l5rf5a
comment,myehxp7,Esfahen,,1,2025-06-18 05:57:45,,,,At this point its just a matter of lack of developer awareness for MSVC crosscompilers and such a small amount of time between now and when the first laptop form factor Arm PC came out last year Not counting Surfaces as a PC for awareness to grow I think people overestimate how hard it is to crosscompile for Windows on Arm Its literally just a couple extra linker and compiler flags and maybe some extra work for remapping your SIMD for which there are several MITlicensed open source projects making it dead easy for an instant 20 CPU lift Dont want to port all the middleware Ok just compile for Arm64EC instead Any competent dev can do it in a couple days on their project yes that includes software as complex as AAA games,myefx6e,4.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwm54tw,ThisI5N0tAThr0waway,,0,2025-06-08 06:13:17,,,,Once the switch to Arm is completely done the performance per watt should be much better I just bought a MacBook Air for this reason,mwkzaov,2.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwoxmx3,Edward_TH,,4,2025-06-08 17:53:02,,,,Yeah even x86 is still going super strong 20 years after people were certain it would be completely gone after 2010,mwmc4dh,4.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwsgfih,REV2939,,1,2025-06-09 06:51:48,,,,RISCV will eventually go further than ARM but neither will go as far as x86AMD64 did collectively But all things tech who knows what breakthroughs will come next year,mwmc4dh,4.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwoj1qi,flatroundworm,,-1,2025-06-08 16:40:26,,,,Unfortunately I dont think youre gonna get anything on par with apple silicon out of Qualcomm,mwm54tw,3.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwouos3,Esfahen,,9,2025-06-08 17:38:29,,,,Considering Qualcomms CPU architecture is made by the creators of Apple Silicon Nuvia Id bet money you are wrong They will be most limited by the Windows ecosystem if anything Arm ports for all Windows middleware are being worked on right now support is added in commercial engines and I would expect AAA games to release native ports in the next year Devs already need to target Arm for Switch 1 2 anyway Not much harder to recompile for Windows,mwoj1qi,4.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwxtjgp,Fwiler,,1,2025-06-10 01:26:56,,,,For number one please show us For number two you expect but have nothing and they will only develop if there are enough sales Number 3 Im not even sure where you get Switch to Windows easy to recompile from,mwouos3,5.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwxyusi,Esfahen,,3,2025-06-10 01:56:46,,,,Compiling for a Switch platform target requires the Clang Arm64 compiler Targeting for Switch means you have ported your SSEAVX SIMD instructions used all over a AAA engine for animation occlusion culling vector math libraries into NEON intrinsics This also happens to be 99 of the pain in x86 Arm game ports This makes the added effort for compiling native Windows on Arm very small just a couple of MSVC compiler and linker flags and tweaks to build system There are also instruction mapping libraries like SIMDe which simplify this process greatly Additionally Windows has the Arm64EC binary type which is interoperable with emulated x64 making the porting process even easier in case some proprietary middleware your game depends on has not published Arm libs If you want an example of ported Arm middleware for games just look at the Cyberpunk Switch 2 port They have a splash screen on game load of all their licensed middleware For commercial engines you can just pull latest UE5 or Unity and see Windows Arm64 build targets right there I will not answer your questions on market adoption or ports just check back in a year and youll see The efforttoperf ratio of acquiring 1520 free CPU perf and better battery is too attractive to pass up,mwxtjgp,6.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mx4dlcq,Fwiler,,1,2025-06-11 01:03:16,,,,So you dont know about Qualcom vs Apple Silicon performance but youre willing to bet on it You are waiting until next year for AAA games but yet you say its easy to port And you wont speculate on market adoption or ports Not to mention the horrible performance in apps against a simple macbook air shown on dozens of youtube videos Or what happens to Windows performance when you unplug from power supply Sounds like a solid foundation to me The ya but just you wait has been going on forever bud People dont sit around and wait they buy what works really good right now Im not saying this is a bad product but it doesnt do anything extremely well Just like when we had Windows Arm 12 years ago,mwxyusi,7.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwnmqxv,karatekid430,,-7,2025-06-08 13:50:31,,,,Break the duopoly of x86 x86 is incompatible with ARM and since apps like ChatGPT have been released with no x86 version we should be wondering why there is no way to run arm64 code on Intel chips which seems to be a liability,mwkzaov,2.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwnuyjd,r_golan_trevize,,6,2025-06-08 14:36:09,,,,While some apps like Premiere Pro still require Intelbased versions I dont understand this The whole reason I bought a Surface Pro 3 eons ago was because I could run real desktop apps on a tablet with a pen and be productive without having to get out of bed or off the couch It was a 100 uncompropmised Windows compatible machine in a tablet form factor If I want a tablet that cant run the full Adobe suite Ive got iPads for that That poor old Pro 3 is still chugging along Its useless as computer in its own anymore but it still makes a fabulous terminal for Remote Desktop or as a wireless and portable second display for a laptop I got my moneys worth out of that thing,mwk25uz,1.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwo7j3t,ThatGuyTheyCallAlex,,8,2025-06-08 15:41:10,,,,Its Adobes fault their software doesnt run natively on ARM not Microsoftthe products fault Its a current software limitation because developers are lazy rather than a fundamental flaw with the product category Support for ARM is catching on really slowly in the Windows world unlike with macOS where it literally had to happen overnight Most Windows software will have to run through an emulation layer rather than natively,mwnuyjd,2.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwor2g4,ineververify,,1,2025-06-08 17:20:30,,,,Thats just one example though I have many other pieces of software that will never get updated to function on ARM,mwo7j3t,3.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwm429a,RippFlombay,,10,2025-06-08 06:03:21,,,,i mean to me being saved a click is more about saving time than avoiding clickbate its more answer to the question the headline is asking so i dont have to skim three paragraphs rather than is the article clickbate or not,mwk3wqi,2.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwl6dq2,remedialrob,,8,2025-06-08 01:50:54,,,,I just upgraded from the Surface Pro 8 to the 12 I got the 13 inch with 32 GB of Ram and the 1 TB SSD I do wish they were more variable with the colors since I wanted the Sapphire blue one but I always end up with Silver because they only make the interesting color versions with the most basic of specifications So if you wanted an upgraded ram processor or storage you invariably end up with silver or black I have noticed some screen wobble that wasnt present on my SP8 but other than that its been a seamless transition except I can now do a lot more with the 12 Games specifically are much more playable than they were on the 8,,0.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwm4jzz,thedanyes,,-5,2025-06-08 06:07:52,,,,Personally I dont get the purpose of these big heavy tablets Maybe for artists who were in the market for something like a Cintiq but cheaper Otherwise why not just get a laptop Id choose a Thinkpad or Elitebook over this every time,,0.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwmp7xt,desf15,,3,2025-06-08 09:29:13,,,,I have 13 tablet and 13 laptop and when sitting on a couch I pick first one every time Its more convenient for me Just for web browsing Im not any kind of artist,mwm4jzz,1.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwpfy6e,thedanyes,,1,2025-06-08 19:24:51,,,,Sure tablet is more convenient than laptop for web browsing but a 15 pound tablet is a shitty compromise form factor For casual browsing and media lightweight tablets are so much better and more ergonomic For me that cut off is about 350g or 08lbs,mwmp7xt,2.0,1l5rf5a
comment,mwsgnis,desf15,,1,2025-06-09 06:53:52,,,,I have to disagree I replaced 10 tablet with aforementioned 13 tablet around 600g if I remember correctly and its better for me,mwpfy6e,3.0,1l5rf5a

comment,mwmvzb0,nagi603,,1,2025-06-08 10:35:53,,,,Here is one Id guess chrome is even more hostile to adblockers like how the version on smartphones is Its a lightweight primarily browsing machine with more control ceded to the corporations And a Cintiq is a display drawing device not an actual independent machine,mwm4jzz,1.0,1l5rf5a
