comment,mwb0d71,Talkycoder,,203,2025-06-06 12:30:20,,,,People here dont understand how good latency is on wireless nowadays that and the article said it can be used wired There can be little to no difference and a good wireless can even outperform a mediocre wired Latency is also extremely crucial in FPS games yet large portions of tier 1 Valorant and CS2 pros use mice like the Logitech G Pro Wireless In the past it was all wired Zowie mice but hardware improves and times change,,0.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwb49h1,lazy_tenno,,23,2025-06-06 12:53:46,,,,I browse rpcmasterrace and rgaming sometimes and still astounded that in the year of our Lord of 2025 these group of people still exists actually not that surprised that i see TONS of people still use wired pheripherals on rbattlestations and similar subreddits According to my observations after reading several comments regarding wireless vs wired on those subreddits these people thought that wireless pheripherals are inferior to wired due to the massive input delay these people thought that wireless pheripherals can be disconnected for no reason just scroll in the comment section youll find one right away these people thought that they have to charge the wireless pheripherals every few hours and they really hate to do it What baffles me is that these group of people who thought that the wireless is inferior IS the same group of the average common PC gamers who mostly plays single player and steer clear of competitive fps games These average common PC gamers COMPLAINS AS IF they will gain massive competitive disadvantage by using these wired pheripherals If i drew venn diagrams of these groups of people it wont make any sense at all,mwb0d71,1.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwd1z32,xenwall,,10,2025-06-06 18:38:58,,,,For competitive fighting games a big reason to have issues with wireless is that you show up to a system play a set and leave There have been occurrences in the past where people have forgotten to unpair their controller from the console and messed up a later set that other people were playing The fact that it can run wired and presumably not have to worry about pairing is that it allows for a smoother tournament experience,mwb49h1,2.0,1l4ppun
comment,mwb99wp,randomIndividual21,,15,2025-06-06 13:22:18,,,,Wireless is also expensive though The wireless version of the mouse i wanted costs double at 80 and it doesnt help some peripheral like rgb keyboard is better with wire since the battery doesnt last long They generally only last like 50 to 70 hour,mwb49h1,2.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwbj5vs,lazy_tenno,,1,2025-06-06 14:14:50,,,,Is there any chance that your mouse is a logitech razer steelseries or any other well known brand I stopped using those brands because of the omron switches they often use to cause double click issue in a matter of relatively short time Ive been using cheap chinese brand mouse ever since because 1 AFAIK they never use omron switches 2 Ive been using the very same chinese mouse since 2019 with no issues at all 3 AFAIK there are no wireless version at twice the price of wired version on cheap chinese brand mouse Im sorry but double the price just for the wireless version is down right extortion 50 hours to 70 hours of keyboard battery life That is good no Lets just say that im using the keyboard at home after work at 6pm to 9pm or 10pm every day that means The battery will last approximately 12 to 23 days depending on usage 125 to 175 days with 4hday 167 to 233 days with 3hday That means you just have to charge it per half a month or per month at best And average rgb gaming keyboard charging speed is just 34 hours,mwb99wp,3.0,1l4ppun
comment,mwbpbq2,recursivethought,,7,2025-06-06 14:45:01,,,,Counterpoints regarding my choices I LOVE wireless everything strick with wired for my main Im using the same kbmouse for work Its gonna last me a week 70h batt 11h use though tbh likely 10 since I dont actually use my PC for 11 full hours 7d a week When the battery is drained its gonna happen midsomethingimportant There is no benefit for me I have a very large underdesk tray The cables are routed through loose channels under the desk I dont see my cables The cables are neither visually nor functionally limiting in any way My exisiting setup never needs any fiddling whatsoever If I dont do something every 10 even 30 days it keeps working Guaranteed every time In other words there is literally zero benefit to me going wireless Fun fact my devices are actually wireless I just keep the USBC cable plugged in always This is because I have other PCs with USBC cables available that I move to when I need to do a maintenance session sometimes ServersMediaNVRetc plus like 2xmo when I actually need to be in the office Sidenote While I agree with you regarding Chinese keyboards there is no Chinee mouse that mimics the functionality of a Logitech G502 for example esp with GShift Its a middleground between Naga and your typical mouse with backforward thumb buttons Not for everyone but if you want that you cant get it in a knockoff yet unfortunately But when it happens I agree theres little downside to going that route And the same argument Im using for my mouse some people may have specific needs for their keyboards that arent met by Chinese ones But those are fringe cases typically nothing to get up in arms about in forums to each their own I will say that the whole wireless charging for a peripheral thing when thats more commonplace and affordable I would totally go that route personally Less cables to route fewer USB ports used esp if people have their peripherals on top of their desk,mwbj5vs,4.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwbow5l,Rigman-,,8,2025-06-06 14:42:58,,,,Most people buying wireless controllers arent trying to be competitive they just want comfort I play almost everything on wireless and have no problem having fun The lack of wireless arcade sticks has been annoying for years so its nice to finally see someone addressing it I love using arcade sticks but I hate running a long cable across my living room just to play If that extra frame of input costs me a match whatever Im here to enjoy myself not win tournaments,mwb3oxk,2.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwb7e1x,xsilas43,,13,2025-06-06 13:11:41,,,,Where did you get 1000fps Fighting games usually run at 60fps and balance things around the frame time A polling rate of 1000hz would be how often the controller polls for input Which is standard for high quality gaming peripherals Many even go above this now,mwb6kyj,3.0,1l4ppun
comment,mwbdd5x,ExoticSalamander4,,-3,2025-06-06 13:44:35,,,,your wording made it seem like you were saying all 1000hz would be necessary to not miss a frame which would imply that the game was running at 1000fps the actualconnection which im sure you can draw so it seems odd that youre ignoring is that you dont need to poll anywhere near 1000hz to not have an input delayed by a frame if you had a 600hz input device there would be a 10 chance that an input would be delayed by a frame assuming uniform distribution of input timing across a random frame if that was 1000hz it would be about a 6 chance obviously lower chance is better but what are you going to choose as a hill to die on,mwb7e1x,4.0,1l4ppun
comment,mwb9yi3,NoisyGog,,-8,2025-06-06 13:26:02,,,,Where did you get 1000fps In fighting games even 1 frame of latency can make a difference Theres no way that stick is polling over 1000hz Those two combined suggest that you were making 1000fps claims If you wanted less than a frame of delay then lets pull twice per frame 120Hz,mwb7e1x,4.0,1l4ppun
comment,mwbcxly,xsilas43,,9,2025-06-06 13:42:17,,,,120hz would be below even the cheapest wireless devices which typically poll at 125hz and feel terrible to use Fighting games are locked to 60fps because they balance around frame times A frame of delay would be depandant on the fps the game is running at in fighting games case as they are locked to 60fps this is 167ms The polling rate of a device is completely independent of any game however,mwb9yi3,5.0,1l4ppun

comment,mwfpzuy,pm-me-neurons,,4,2025-06-07 03:57:58,,,,My best guess is that it had to do with the arcade layout for Street Fighter In the arcade the top row of buttons from left to right is LP MP HP and the bottom row is LK MK HK When the game was originally ported to PlayStation consoles they mapped HP to R1 and HK to R2 So this stick and generally all others since follow the arcade layout with the top row as square triangle R1 and the bottom row as X Circle R2with the left shoulder buttons to the right of them per tradition lol,mwe13zc,2.0,1l4ppun
