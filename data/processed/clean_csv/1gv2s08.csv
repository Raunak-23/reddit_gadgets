comment,ly1o3f8,dirtfondler,,24,2024-11-20 03:48:30,,,,I had a DP show up to a shoot with the gen 1 A1 and I was skeptical He delivered some truly stunning 8K shots and I was floored Im sure the gen 2 is even better I know this isnt built as a cinema camera but it delivers,,0.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyoazj,martijnonreddit,,148,2024-11-19 18:01:38,,,,Seeing how the iPhone employs computational photography I consider this a good thing AI is an awful buzzword but I assume this is not DallE in your camera,,0.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxytlv1,Xavier9756,,51,2024-11-19 18:27:34,,,,It unfortunately has become a massive buzzword,lxyoazj,1.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxz3jbz,Blackzone70,,150,2024-11-19 19:16:18,,,,The AI processor in Sony cameras have nothing to do with computation photography or HDR They are solely for more advanced subject detection for improved autofocus on things like humans birdsanimals insects and various vehicles,lxyoazj,1.0,1gv2s08

comment,lxyw19x,JCAMAR0S117,,-10,2024-11-19 18:39:29,,,,If its anything like the new Canon R5 II itll be a couple half baked features that nobody will ever use but it wont get in way of the actual photo processing,lxyoazj,1.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly2tyyw,Adam_Meshnet,,7,2024-11-20 10:20:23,,,,Its certainly nothing like that As mentioned by other commenters the AI processing chip is used to enhance autofocus Coming from a smaller APSC camera I can safely say that this is a gamechanger for shooting videos,lxyw19x,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyloil,dexterthekilla,,40,2024-11-19 17:48:51,,,,Its built around the same 501mp stacked CMOS sensor as the original,,0.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyuqvs,M3msm,,42,2024-11-19 18:33:10,,,,That sensor was way ahead of its time Its also a fantastic sensor and I have no issues that they kept it the same,lxyloil,1.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyw57p,Ivanjatson,,18,2024-11-19 18:40:01,,,,I have a D7500 and will say hands down the autofocus is its weakest point while still not bad I would welcome this technology to become the baseline in a decade or so,,0.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzgd2v,dc456,,33,2024-11-19 20:21:50,,,,The gap between your 7 year old camera and a midrange mirrorless camera is probably bigger than the gap between midrange and this camera Most of this tech is already readily available this just refines it Were definitely getting into diminishing returns with camera tech now,lxyw57p,1.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly2tn9e,HakimeHomewreckru,,5,2024-11-20 10:16:49,,,,The one thing holding us back is compressed raw that RED in hands of Nikon now is holding hostage behind their patents Its crazy how a small mirrorless camera like the A7 series can compete with 50k cinema cameras in terms of image quality,lxzgd2v,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly2tqwu,dc456,,2,2024-11-20 10:17:56,,,,Cant imagine thats much of an issue for someone currently shooting on a D7500 though,ly2tn9e,3.0,1gv2s08
comment,lyh4d9d,Bridgebrain,,1,2024-11-22 20:52:39,,,,Yeah we peaked at pretty much 20mp at 4k Sure you can go bigger and bigger but what youre really doing is giving yourself room for digital zoomcropping and eliminating other bottlenecks more than getting an actually better picture Pretty much no one can distinguish between displays are above 4k and no one prints above 900dpi so unless your photo is being shown or printed at a giant scale its just wasted quality,lxzgd2v,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4uomn,AbhishMuk,,1,2024-11-20 18:02:54,,,,Are you saying modern mid ranges are very good or old top models still hold their value Im not very familiar with cameras anymore but I thought the old wisdom was to buy a few years old top model,lxzgd2v,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4urj4,dc456,,2,2024-11-20 18:03:19,,,,The former The D7500 is neither a few years old nor a top model,ly4uomn,3.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4vede,AbhishMuk,,1,2024-11-20 18:06:33,,,,Thanks I guess sensor tech has mostly matured and its processing power giving more benefits nowadays,ly4urj4,4.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4vt24,dc456,,2,2024-11-20 18:08:35,,,,Its more the fundamentally different way that DSLRs and mirrorless handle autofocus A modern midrange mirrorless has a wealth of autofocus capabilities and features that are essentially impossible on any DSLR let alone a 7 year old mid range one,ly4vede,5.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4x74j,AbhishMuk,,1,2024-11-20 18:15:39,,,,Thanks wasnt aware of that IMO I kinda hate the absence of an optical viewfinder and was aiming to eventually buy a DSLR but Ill probably rethink that when I reach there,ly4vt24,6.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4xfc5,dc456,,2,2024-11-20 18:16:48,,,,I prefer optical viewfinders too but DSLRs are an evolutionary deadend so will always be cut off from a lot of mirrorless features,ly4x74j,7.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly4y6ky,AbhishMuk,,1,2024-11-20 18:20:37,,,,Hmm just thinking aloud wouldnt it be possible to have a DSLR where some light continuously goes to the sensor via something like those partially reflecting mirrorthings allowing mirorless like fullsensor autofocus Though it probably might make it even bulkier,ly4xfc5,8.0,1gv2s08
comment,lyba8wy,ml20s,,2,2024-11-21 21:36:52,,,,This is basically the SLT design from Sony on the Amount,ly4y6ky,9.0,1gv2s08
comment,lyd5zy1,AbhishMuk,,1,2024-11-22 04:21:21,,,,This is basically the SLT design from Sony on the Amount Thanks wasnt aware Any idea if its any good in practice,lyba8wy,10.0,1gv2s08
comment,lygxk0c,Richard_Butler,,2,2024-11-22 20:16:08,,,,SLT was essentially the opposite of what you suggested It had a semitransparent mirror that directed about 13rd of the light 12 stop to an SLRstyle focus module then the other 23rds to the main sensor which provided a live view stream to an EVF This meant you got DSLRstandard AF speed in both stills and video which at the time was the desirable outcome But SLR focus is no longer the benchmark for AF Onsensor phase detection allows mirrorless cameras to focus across most of the image not just a few fixed points and with tracking AF and now subject recognition this is far more flexible and delivers a much higher hit rate than DSLRs could It sounds like youre proposing something slightly different directing some of the light to an optical viewfinder while also allowing some through to the sensor which sounds more like Canons Pellicle film SLR I suspect youd end up either with a viewfinder that was unacceptably dark or an AF system that struggled in anything less than perfect light SLT was an interesting idea and allowed the continued use of DSLR lenses but it looks even more like a deadend now that mirrorless focus and lenses designed to be focussed that way is working at the very highest level,lyd5zy1,11.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly5imly,dc456,,1,2024-11-20 20:04:04,,,,Then the viewfinder is darker And the sensor still has less light to work with,ly4y6ky,9.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly5shl9,slipperyslope69,,2,2024-11-20 22:03:42,,,,You still to have a good scene natural or created lighting a narrative good composition and many more elements to make a good photo or video This is an expensive albeit good tool with fancy marketing Nothing more,,0.0,1gv2s08

comment,lxynoq0,Kike328,,-36,2024-11-19 17:58:37,,,,i would prefer them to innovate in different ways instead to please their ai sick investors,lxynfsj,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyo0aa,skyhighrockets,,32,2024-11-19 18:00:10,,,,Its for subject recognition and image stablilization not any kind of image generation or anything like that But you would know that if you actually opened the article instead of just commenting out of a blanket hate for AI,lxynoq0,3.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxypgg0,Kike328,,-42,2024-11-19 18:07:15,,,,eh no the AI is just for the autofocus So the main selling point for upgrading this 6500 camera is literally AI for 50 performance increase in bird focusing xd Its just consumerism at its maximum exponent companies throwing buzzwords to make you believe are buying the cutting edge when is the same thing Good luck with your enhanced bird focusing device,lxyo0aa,4.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxyrjfj,skyhighrockets,,24,2024-11-19 18:17:27,,,,Not just for birds lmao This is a flagship camera where improvements in autofocus subject detection better IBIS better articulating screen better ergonomics faster ethernet etc all for the same 65k price Stuff that pros have been wanting Better yet the older model is now 1k cheaper and the used market will probably see the old one drop to 354k price range Even if you dont want the new features this is great news if you wanted what the first one offered Its fine if you dont personally need it but that doesnt mean they shouldnt update their flagship with the features cheaper Sony cameras have had for a little while now,lxypgg0,5.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxz5496,M3msm,,17,2024-11-19 19:25:00,,,,Youre trying to teach something to an idiot it is a losing battle,lxyrjfj,6.0,1gv2s08

comment,lxyx3ap,PikaV2002,,14,2024-11-19 18:44:38,,,,Which is irrelevant to the actual product,lxyrm64,7.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzb5b0,None,,-17,2024-11-19 19:55:26,,,,its literally a software update and a flip screen this isnt a mark ii its a cop out,lxynfsj,2.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxze9iz,skyhighrockets,,14,2024-11-19 20:11:14,,,,Its literally not Theres a new CPUchip that enables Better subject detection faster reliable AF better IBIS Also better EVF great articulating screen better ergonomics faster ethernet new menus focus stacking etc Just because you dont feel its enough new features doesnt make it a cop out I dont see any other camera that beats it right now,lxzb5b0,3.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzfom6,None,,-14,2024-11-19 20:18:24,,,,do you own an A1 or more than one because i do and these upgrades are a slap in the face to the owners of the original to call this a mark ii IBIS and subject and AF are still far above everyone else in the A1 that any better upgrades in this are purely hype upgrades and to say theyre better new menus omg cool like how the fx3 and a7siii got like 2yrs ago all of these upgrades couldve been a software update but instead we got 2 software updates in the lifetime of the A1 that upgraded literally nothing in a real world application these upgrades are going to be minutely noticeable if at all,lxze9iz,4.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzior9,skyhighrockets,,6,2024-11-19 20:33:27,,,,Youre right about some of that but thats not what you said and not what I was replying to you said this is just a software update on the same chip which just isnt true The new AF and new IBIS require the new chip Much of what is new categorically cannot have been software updates Also new EVF new body design new articulating screen It can be both true that this update is worth it to some pros AND that Sony should update the original A1 with the few software things that its chip can and should support Also theyve definitely added features via firmware eg focus breathing compensation improved IBIS better flash performance C2PA and a whole bunch of workflow improvements here and there In the real world is going to be different for different working photographers,lxzfom6,5.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzlc7b,None,,-8,2024-11-19 20:46:41,,,,i said its a software update and a flip screen i didnt mention chips this is far from a mark ii and these minor updates couldve been pushed as software updates instead they kept these small features from updates for years to just put into a newer model anyone upgrading from an A1 to this is just purely wasting money and glazing for sony,lxzior9,6.0,1gv2s08
comment,lxzlvvz,skyhighrockets,,7,2024-11-19 20:49:25,,,,you keep saying that but that doesnt make it true the improvements to the subject detction AF IBIS require the new chip thats why I talk about chips Also lol at you just continuely ignoring the physical upgrades We get it you dont think its worth it Its obnoxious you think that others being excited about the update means were just glazing for sony,lxzlc7b,7.0,1gv2s08
comment,ly149ja,None,,-1,2024-11-20 01:47:21,,,,it uses the same AI processing unit thats almost 3yrs old used in the A9iii A7RV etc it has the same grip and button layout as the A9iii it doesnt have groundbreaking or new tech in it its rehoused with a software update and chip thats already in other units like what,lxzlvvz,8.0,1gv2s08
