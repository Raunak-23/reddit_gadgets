comment,m5kzpfn,Affectionate-Memory4,,5,2025-01-05 20:49:05,,,,The 5090 better have 2 12pins on it 4090s were melting with a TDP of 75 the maximum rating If the 5090 is really going to be something like 575W thats 96 Basically 0 safety margin when a 13x one was already apparently insufficient,m5j3pym,1.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l2cbj,ChrisFromIT,,1,2025-01-05 21:01:29,,,,You do realize that the older cables 6pin and 8pin could also melt if they had a loose connection,m5kzpfn,2.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l3rvd,Affectionate-Memory4,,2,2025-01-05 21:08:03,,,,Yes and I would advocate for it to have a reasonable number of those if it were going to use them 575W through a connector rated for 600W when its known to be relatively easy to mess up so badly it melts at 450W is a bad idea Splitting the load between 2 of them is safer all around 300W each if we round up gives you as much overhead as a modern 8pin possibly a bit more,m5l2cbj,3.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l83l6,ChrisFromIT,,0,2025-01-05 21:28:24,,,,I dont think you understand It doesnt matter how much wattage is being passed through or how much safety there is ie passing through 150 watts through a wire that can handle 300 watts if the connection is loose and therefore a short the cable can still melt Splitting the load between two 600W cables will not prevent a cable from melting And you are forgetting that the 12 pin standard has been updated that it is much more difficult not to plug it in properly the sense pins act like an additional safety net and the device wont draw power if the sense pins arent detected Part of the new standard is changing the length of the sense pins that it is very difficult to have a loose connection and have the sense pins connected 6 pins and 8 pins connectors dont have that safety net and never did,m5l3rvd,4.0,1hu7urx

comment,m5l1zer,Affectionate-Memory4,,1,2025-01-05 20:59:47,,,,Chuck a pair of XT90s on there and its fine Easier to plug in too Honestly though we need up up the supply voltage Moving to 24V halves the current for a given power delivery or to put it another way gets us twice the power through currentlimited connections,m5l1m66,3.0,1hu7urx

comment,m5j02q8,raziel686,,11,2025-01-05 14:50:50,,,,The term jump is rarely used for decreases they almost always use drop for that NVIDIA is losing its grasp on reality 1500 watts is the max steady draw on a circuit you can expect in an American home and that includes all the other shit that needs power which is almost always shared on the same circuit Most users arent going to know which breaker runs to which outlet to split the load if they even can split it Any 20 amp circuits a home may have are almost always relegated to kitchens for appliances I half expect Jensen to come out on stage and talk about how the 60 series will need a dedicated 240 line NVIDIA is skipping the efficiency round that would normally come after a generation that significantly increases power draw almost certainly because they are too focused on AI and took shortcuts on the GPUs If nothing else it swings the door wide open for AMD Lets hope they dont trip on their own shoelaces trying to get through it like usual NVIDIA needs a serious competitor and could use a generation where they get punched in the mouth and arent on top,m5iutag,1.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5j3rhj,nesquikchocolate,,2,2025-01-05 15:12:48,,,,The high estimates for power consumption for the 5090 is 600W thats 13 of the capacity of a normal 15A 120V receptacle Even a two slice toaster uses more than that But because of how undervolting and downclocking works you could almost certainly cut that 600W in half while still having 75 of the performance if you really wanted to this way gives everyone options Nobody wants to buy a 5090 thats only 10 better than a 4090 even if it uses 30 less power doing that so much rather sell a 5090 that is 40 better and uses 10 more power Even though the actual efficiency is still so much better in both cases,m5j02q8,2.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5j9em3,ACanadianNoob,,4,2025-01-05 15:44:35,,,,If you add an Intel CPU expensive water cooling all the other components and tons of drives in a high end system you are looking at 1000W1500W depending on your build And your power supply isnt 100 efficient at converting AC power to DC either That 600W power draw from the GPU 12VDC rail is more like 640690W draw from the AC outlet The real solution is to vote with our wallets though and dont buy halo tier products with high power draw,m5j3rhj,3.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5jb3l2,nesquikchocolate,,1,2025-01-05 15:53:46,,,,If youve got 1500W worth of kit on your 1500W platinum rated power supply its 93 efficient so youre drawing 1615W from the wall Still below the 1800W available Besides Im not sure how youd even get to 1500W without a second gpu since even a wild cpu doesnt draw 400W and balance of system above 100W is very high If you can afford 2x 5090 you can also afford the dedicated 240V supply for it,m5j9em3,4.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l2rym,QuickQuirk,,1,2025-01-05 21:03:34,,,,Youre assuming that the computer is the only thing you are driving off that circuit Add in a monitor speakers your phone charger wifirouter and most of all the air conditioner youre going to need to help you cool down the 1500 watt space heater in the summer It really is getting a bit much for most folks,m5jb3l2,5.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l846t,nesquikchocolate,,0,2025-01-05 21:28:29,,,,So you want to give your PC a 50W power budget because you insist on being able to run your whole home on the same outlet Thats insane You shouldnt be putting your aircon on the same outlet as your PC anyway and if you cant afford to have an additional outlet put into the house what are you doing with a 5090,m5l2rym,6.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5ovosn,Sure-Temperature,,2,2025-01-06 13:01:19,,,,and if you cant afford an additional outlet put in your house Wow what a terrible argument Hiring electricians to run new circuits is definitely more expensive than a 5090 its not even close,m5l846t,7.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5ow6s4,nesquikchocolate,,0,2025-01-06 13:05:01,,,,Uh Im an business owner electrician that put additional circuits in homes as part of my dayjob and youre incorrect Nobody is charging 1600 for a single outlet in a residential house,m5ovosn,8.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5ozr7e,Sure-Temperature,,2,2025-01-06 13:30:02,,,,An outlet probably not but an outlet on a separate circuit I tried to have some low voltage guys run ethernet up two floors and they wanted like 600 for two guys for an afternoon Maybe electricians arent as expensive as I thought though,m5ow6s4,9.0,1hu7urx

comment,m5p7ljw,Sure-Temperature,,1,2025-01-06 14:24:20,,,,See I thought that price was crazy too which is why I didnt even give it a second thought after the first call Just for info how much would you charge hypothetically to run an outlet up from a finished basement and up two floors Theres an attic but of course the second floor is right below that,m5p0m8g,11.0,1hu7urx

comment,m5l4o8m,nesquikchocolate,,1,2025-01-05 21:12:10,,,,The 75 of perf from 50 of the power is from a techpowerup post I read a while ago it was with a 4070 though so it might be even better on the larger cards My own 1070 is too slow to underclock for any meaningful efficiency gains Im just hoping the 5070 isnt as expensive as the 4070 was at launch then I might finally get an upgrade,m5l26po,4.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l2mxv,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,2,2025-01-05 21:02:53,,,,Even a two slice toaster uses more than that A toaster is basically a space heater Its actually a pretty high draw device That why it hurts when you touch the toaster If you combine the 600w you with a 250w CPUs a couple of monitors and some other peripherals youre going to get pretty close to the 1500w limit,m5j3rhj,3.0,1hu7urx
comment,m5l3hwp,nesquikchocolate,,1,2025-01-05 21:06:52,,,,I dont know what cpu you game with most are 90120W and would only rarely be running at full load while simultaneously running at full load on the graphics card I dont know what monitor you use my 27 LG 4k monitor has a 65W 40W power supply But regardless neither of us are likely the target market for a 5090,m5l2mxv,4.0,1hu7urx

comment,m5j7xsx,ACanadianNoob,,5,2025-01-05 15:36:25,,,,12v 100amp circuits are a thing but they use 4 or 2 gauge wire the real thick stuff And even then the wire runs have to be really short Its usually just enough to go from the battery to an inverter where its converted from 12v 100amp to 120v 10amp and can then be put through much smaller wire Copper is expensive no one is wiring their home for 100amp circuits Youd be better off wiring a circuit for 230V and getting an EU power supply for your PC Either way no one is going to rewire their home just so they can have a shiny new computer They will try it on existing wiring and either pop a breaker or the wires in their wall will get really hot We need hardware manufacturers to keep our circuit limitations and the fact that other devices will be on them in mind and have fair products with lower power draw Not to mention energy costs keep rising,m5iwzby,2.0,1hu7urx
