comment,lw6brlo,ingrapaleave,,5,2024-11-09 00:45:48,,,,Have the issues for the 14th gen chips been resolved I had a 14900 that I ended up RMAing a few months ago I put my 10th gen hardware into my PC while the RMA was happening but I never ended up putting the new parts back in when the replacement arrived What Im really asking is if I were to put the new parts in and immediately update bios would it function properly now,lw44p37,2.0,1gmkobd
comment,lw7snx3,Gammacor,,3,2024-11-09 07:10:22,,,,Roll of the dice It may have process defects It may not It probably does The process defects may be minor and only degrade the chip notably in four five six years The process defects may be major and the CPU may function exactly like your old one The sheer scale of this monumental fuck up is wildly understated Theres no fixing this,lw6brlo,3.0,1gmkobd
comment,lw87t0k,Elon61,,2,2024-11-09 09:56:38,,,,Process defects are FUD all the proven issues have been addressed now so any new chip is going to be perfectly fine and older chips will probably be fine if they arent already experiencing issues The process oxidation thing has never been shown to be the cause of any issue,lw7snx3,4.0,1gmkobd
comment,lwak2k6,Gammacor,,3,2024-11-09 19:17:00,,,,Uh Absolutely the oxidation is an issue Thats whats accelerating degradation at the high voltages that Intel has been running forever now Thats why the BIOS and microcode updates are so important because they lower the voltage targets across the board The issue is that the barrier material that coats the copper traces was etched too much and nonuniformly likely because the etchant was contaminated with water and so you have a significant electromigration issue which leads to metal poisoning Like you said any chips produced in the last few months are fine Anything before that spanning at least a year if not more back are potentially defective Theres no way to know which was my whole point The entirety of 13th and most of the production run of 14th Gen was affected,lw87t0k,5.0,1gmkobd
comment,lwalhts,Elon61,,0,2024-11-09 19:24:40,,,,Im sorry but repeating unsubstantiated speculation doesnt make it any less unsubstantiated Intel has repeatedly and explicitly claimed its a nonissue and that the accelerated degradaation is unrelated What youve repeated here is GNs speculation based only on the verified fact of there being an oxidation issue Thats all he had to go on before making this whole thing up What we do know is that the degradation issues were still seen on chips manufactured in 2024 which is a year after the process issues were fixed according to intel Tech jesus has a slightly overactive imagination at times,lwak2k6,6.0,1gmkobd
comment,lwarvcy,Gammacor,,3,2024-11-09 19:58:52,,,,I work in industry and can corroborate Steves reporting Intel of course says its a nonissue because thats the corporate playbook,lwalhts,7.0,1gmkobd
comment,lwascyf,Elon61,,0,2024-11-09 20:01:33,,,,What can you corroborate the fact that there was an oxidation issue nobody ever denied that but unless you work at intel you actually just dont know whether it causes any accelerated aging or anything else really since there are none of those running with the new bioses and again new chips running on old bioses still experience the same issues,lwarvcy,8.0,1gmkobd
comment,lwauo9x,Gammacor,,1,2024-11-09 20:14:25,,,,From my knowledge and experience in the semiconductor fab industry oxidation of the tantalum nitride via water contamination of the etchant HF most closely matches the failure analysis results of the independent analysis done by whomever GN used as well as matches what I have heard and seen through the grapevine personally We the industry know that metal migration poisoning is accelerated when the voltage across the diffusion layer or the contact point between two metals is higher just like higher voltage accelerates Galvanic corrosion Reductively its the same principal Reducing the voltage with the new microcode can slow down this metal migration and the effect is nonlinear,lwascyf,9.0,1gmkobd

comment,lw4drvl,ajcp38,,29,2024-11-08 18:34:27,,,,To mitigate the issue you need to 1 Update BIOS 2 Use an overclocking voltage 3 Reduce your clock speeds 5253 fixes it usually To actually fix the issue you need a new CPU Its cooked done literal trash So pop that cooler off and start the RMA process,lw3ejn5,1.0,1gmkobd
comment,lw7u5g8,Elveno36,,3,2024-11-09 07:25:54,,,,Using the most updated bios released roughly a month ago for most motherboard manufactures and setting the cpu profile to Intel default prevents any further issues Just finished RMAing my 13900k new one seems to be performing way better than expected Think I may have won the silicon lottery,lw4drvl,2.0,1gmkobd
