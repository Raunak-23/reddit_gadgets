comment,m0yuo2b,EndlessBirthday,,14,2024-12-08 02:04:25,,,,Actually yes it does work For those that dont know tinnitus is imaginary Its the absence of sound usually due to hearing damage Your brain thinks I should be hearing something at this frequency then it creates that sound We can cancel out a frequency of tinnitus by playing the same frequency at the volume your brain imagines I have tinnitus at many many frequencies and Ive been able to test and confirm this with limited success The REAL problem is that theres no easy or convenient way for doctors to tune out complex tinnitus like mine at multiple dozenstohundreds of frequencies without spending hours of work daily And since tinnitus is imaginary the volume of tinnitus is constantly changing throughout the day The technology just doesnt exist to dynamically cancel that out But If you only suffer with one or a few specific frequencies of tinnitus then yeah theres something called Notch Therapy You could also theoretically create tinnitus cancelling hearing aides and adjust the volume yourself,m0wlq5y,3.0,1h8tzsx
comment,m0yzq68,NJ_Legion_Iced_Tea,,9,2024-12-08 02:37:54,,,,And since tinnitus is imaginary the volume of tinnitus is constantly changing throughout the day I swear I can make it louder by focusing on it Which sucks when Im trying to fall asleep and its all I hear like a shitty feedback loop,m0yuo2b,4.0,1h8tzsx

comment,m10lpna,SatansFriendlyCat,,1,2024-12-08 11:19:31,,,,Look Ill explain my objections to your original statement so were clear about what were discussing The most common causes of tinnitus are to do with hearing loss especially in the high frequencies The greatest cause of hearing loss is damage to the hairs in the inner ear which vibrate according to the frequencies to which they are sensitive and cause the cells to which they are attached to send signals via the auditory nerve Such hair cells are susceptible to damage from normal aging processes but also and very very commonly by exposure to loud noise The cells sensitive to high frequency sound are also more readily damaged by high frequency sound So noise is damaging if its loud and much more so if its loud at high frequency White noise is equal amounts of actual sound energy across the hearing frequency spectrum but we are not equally sensitive to every frequency and so perceptually what we experience is random hissing noise peaking in apparent volume in the broad range of frequencies 16khz with notable sizzle above that and next to nothing in the bass notes But perceptual frequency isnt the same as actual sound energy which is equal in white noise along the spectrum As a source of hearing damage therefore its not especially threatening because of its character its not primarily highfrequency but can be dangerous if you crank the shit out of the volume just the same as anything will be So objection 1 is that theres nothing special about white noise which would make it dangerous other than the volume at which you might choose to listen to it Objection 2 is that noisecancelling headphones arent cancelling noise using white noise That would just be masking no different from playing white noise through any headphones Thats not at all what noise cancelling technology is Noise cancelling technology is phase inversion taking the incoming sound with varying degrees of prediction and flipping it 180 out of phase and injecting that sound into the audio stream or into the ear Nothing to do with white noise Objection 3 is to do with your claim that its the biggest cause for tinnitus which seems obviously wrong on the face of it because Even if white noise were harmful it isnt especially it wouldnt be the biggest cause of tinnitus because most people arent exposed to it regularly unlike the known and overwhelmingly more common causes such as loud music industrial noise think power tools and machinery engine noise age and more and Even if white noise was the technology used in noisecancelling headphones it isnt it still wouldnt be the biggest cause of tinnitus because the use of such headphones amongst the population is low as a percentage and especially miniscule compared to the percentage exposed to all the other actual proven causes of tinnitus and Even if tinnitus was caused by white noise from noise cancelling headphones which is to say a not unusually harmful type of sound found in a device which doesnt generate it it still wouldnt be the biggest cause because tinnitus had been around forever and noise cancelling headphones are a recent innovation with far from universal adoption So your suggested biggest cause is the wrong thing in the wrong place for the wrong amount of time I would gently suggest that youve conflated several different bits of information and that maybe what you meant to say was something along the lines of the fastest growing cause of hearing loss which may lead to tinnitus especially amongst the young is long exposure to music at excessive volume particularly as delivered through inear headphones which would be true and there are certainly guidelines and regulations being drawn up and adopted all over the place to address this particular and genuinely serious threat,m10ccvr,3.0,1h8tzsx
