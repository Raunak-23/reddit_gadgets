comment,n1k0pfr,vinteragony,,3,2025-07-06 00:10:00,,,,Ive seen some cool drone shows but they have a long way to go to rival a good firework show,,0.0,1lrin6s
comment,n1k9eyx,VincentNacon,,-4,2025-07-06 01:07:44,,,,Its safer doesnt explode and make your fingers or eyeballs go missing and doesnt scare the dogs What do you mean they have a long way to go Firework has a long way to go to improve themselves but they havent for decades Its time for them to move on and let the drones take over the sky,n1k0pfr,1.0,1lrin6s
comment,n1lgab7,Rpcouv,,1,2025-07-06 06:39:26,,,,Some of us enjoy the booms and blinding lights Like how a lightning storm can be exciting Fireworks done properly are just much safer than random lightning strikes,n1k9eyx,2.0,1lrin6s

comment,n1b1cg5,superpj,,2,2025-07-04 13:49:12,,,,I saw this in North East Florida before people shot mortars at them One out of control drone can cause a lot of problems Kinda surprised no movie has had a death scene like a bad series of events like the ice skating scene on The Boys but drones hitting and cutting people,,0.0,1lrin6s
comment,n1idhij,StevesRune,,7,2025-07-05 18:29:49,,,,I would argue an out of control mortar is infinitely more dangerous than an out of control drone A falling drone is going to hit one or two people max A mortar can easily kill someone or injure a dozen,n1b1cg5,1.0,1lrin6s
comment,n1ikfwh,superpj,,2,2025-07-05 19:07:55,,,,The scars on my hands eyebrow and my friends on their shoulder and chest are proof 1 drone flying into a group can cut quite a few people Lucky it didnt get an eye or a throat,n1idhij,2.0,1lrin6s
