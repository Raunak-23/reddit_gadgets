comment,n3nukzv,Peuxy,,3,2025-07-17 16:58:53,,,,Samsung phones are definitely getting juicy I would consider switching to one from my iPhone 13 pro except I dont want to abandon the compability with my Watch airpods and Macbook Cant complain though my phone still holds strong after 4 years without a battery swap,,0.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3o3tj0,thejwalk-,,1,2025-07-17 17:40:21,,,,Understandable I have the same setup as youiPhone 13 pro Apple watch 8 and Macbook Air I bought a Garmin to replace the Apple Watch and preordered the Blue Fold 7 MacBook still works well without an iPhone Ive had Android in the past so I know what to expect I like both platforms for different reasons and will probably return to Apple whenever their foldable phones compete with Samsungs,n3nukzv,1.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3o48td,Peuxy,,1,2025-07-17 17:42:13,,,,How will you solve the watch situation since they are teathered with an iPhone Ive heard Airpods and Macbooks being somewhat manageable with android,n3o3tj0,2.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3o5ejn,thejwalk-,,1,2025-07-17 17:47:25,,,,I bought a Garmin watch Its a much better fitness tracker than the Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch for that matter AirPods and MacBook work well with Android,n3o48td,3.0,1m27bb5

comment,n5beg4e,Silver_Ad7267,,2,2025-07-26 19:44:15,,,,Except privacy security UI dedicated ecosystem etc,n4ei3cf,2.0,1m27bb5
comment,n5gzrea,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-07-27 18:05:00,,,,Agreed on the privacy and security But Apple AI is a fucking joke compared to Samsung and their ecosystem is a huge negative iOS sucks,n5beg4e,3.0,1m27bb5
comment,n513yf4,goldaxis,,3,2025-07-25 04:27:21,,,,Folding phones are very cool but anyone who pays more than 500 for any phone is out of their mind 2000 is certifiably insane Dont me about how much you care about your phone they all run your content consumption apps the exact same,,0.0,1m27bb5

comment,n3mkxis,nater416,,-13,2025-07-17 13:22:56,,,,I tried switching a few months ago Turns out iCloud has a ton of features available for dirt cheap that would add up to be at least 25mo elsewhere between cloud storage password manager with 2FA tokens vpn disposable email addresses etc EDIT Even forgot one being able to use your own custom domain for icloud email Youve gotta pay 17mo minimum to get that through Google Workspace Paying twice the price for a phone and even more monthly for what I consider to be basic features is wild,,0.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3mm3ro,Verniloth,,4,2025-07-17 13:29:03,,,,Hm This is the first person who Ive seen try and actually justify iPhone ownership as opposed to just admitting bias Interesting I am pretty sure youre still full of shit Half of the shit you mentioned that adds up to 25 per month is free so shrug,n3mkxis,1.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3mnce2,RegionalHardman,,0,2025-07-17 13:35:31,,,,Ive also never used any of those features mentioned and cant imagine a situation where I would need them tbh,n3mm3ro,2.0,1m27bb5

comment,n3mrhf2,nater416,,0,2025-07-17 13:56:31,,,,Any good VPN is not free Any password manager with 2FA tokens is not free I couldnt even find a service that let me create disposable email addresses that fotward to my primary and can be deleted anytime But granted maybe I didnt look hard enough for that one Cloud storage is meh I could find that anywhere for about the same price But it being included with all of the above is killer Of course I also forgot to mention another feature I use custom domain with my email That costs 17mo minimum on Google Workspace And no I dont want a blanket forward from my custom domain to my email inviting spammers and scammers from miles around,n3mm3ro,2.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3mw8j3,Verniloth,,1,2025-07-17 14:19:44,,,,Thanks for clarifying Im glad you like apple Im even more glad you find the value in it Saving debatably 300 per year to change my phone and its os is far too inconvenient It was inconceivable when they still used those fucking apple branded chargers for 15 versions The only musthave you mentioned is a vpn theyre like 25 per year for a secure one I think we should just agree to disagree here Before we start using emojis on each other,n3mrhf2,3.0,1m27bb5
comment,n3qhnjq,nater416,,0,2025-07-18 00:57:37,,,,I consider private emails a must have so I dont get spam but to each their own,n3mw8j3,4.0,1m27bb5
