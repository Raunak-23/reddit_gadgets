comment,mnmgj31,Tasty-Traffic-680,,2,2025-04-17 17:55:04,,,,No its just context based ads on steroids They analyze your watching search and ad interaction habits to further categorize you in hopes of better reaching you with emotional appeal in ads They aim to find what tugs at your heart strings and captures your attention Theres some major flaws with that though The first being that a lot of people react negatively to ads like this as pointed out in the article Secondly and most importantly you need to have advertisers to fill all these categories and not just one or two of them People get ad fatigue from seeing the same thing over and over Its a turn off 200 million devices sounds like a lot until you realize every other platform including apps on their own TVs all competing for the same advertisers Ad budgets wont just grow infinitely to support all of these new outlets Netflix has 70 million ad supported subscribers and theyre platform agnostic Hulu has another 37 million Disney Plus has 157 million Roku channel has 145 million including native device and app users Im not even going to get into all the other tv manufacturers Ad dollars are spread thinner than ever Of all the companies I will note that Pluto has somehow cracked into local advertising while others seem to flounder there I dont know if theyre more accessible work with a third party or how it happens but its refreshing to see small local businesses rather than 3 commercials in a row for the same irrelevant prescription or product,mnm5oc5,1.0,1k1h8ry
