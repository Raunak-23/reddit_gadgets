comment,m5w1v2o,versusgorilla,,0,2025-01-07 16:08:29,,,,What I find fascinating was that push way back to get durable and lowpower laptops to the developing world as a way to spread internet access to developing nations and you dont really hear about it anymore Its like the capitalists realized that there wasnt as much money in that as they initially thought so efforts just ended It felt like that was the end of the altruistic internet and wed moved into the era of just trying to squeeze the blood out of the stones that were already hooked in It feels like that getting the entire world connected may have been that next big leap But it didnt happen so weve just been left with companies trying to create something and then the big money venture capitalists trying to turn it into the next big money maker and it hasnt happened Like you said theres been a 16 plus year gulf where theyve been trying to make all the dumb tech Ive mentioned into the next thing Fuck I forgot flexible screens Maybe thatll finally take off and not just be a kinda shittier version of a solid screen phone,m5vzff7,5.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5sjdwe,YoureGrammerIsWorsts,,3,2025-01-07 00:39:49,,,,Even though I dont use AI much and am generally skeptical of it right now I think thats really underselling it Think of it more like any big jump in technology the first 5ish years are about trying to cram it in as a solution to existing problems But to actually utilize it you have to rethink the problems Take steam engines for example When they first came out places literally just replaced their waterwheels with steam engines and honestly didnt get that great of improvements out of them It wasnt until they built factories away from rivers so you didnt have to worry about flooding and closer to raw materials to lower transportation costs or laid out in more logical ways you dont have to build everything around one central crankshaft that steam engines actually became really valuable to production You can use the same idea about computers in general or the internet or almost any new technology Give it time,m5s191u,2.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5s9jjp,suicidaleggroll,,16,2025-01-06 23:45:30,,,,Yeah this is what gets me AI can be very helpful but the tiny models are not that In order to be legitimately useful it needs to be one of the big powerful models running on thousands of dollars worth of GPUs which companies cant just sneak into a laptop So either 1 Theyre integrating tiny models that can run in real time on a laptop without major impacts to form factor or battery life in which case its guaranteed to be useless 2 Theyre just shipping the requests off to the big cloud servers anyway which they can already do on any computer right now so nothing is changing,m5s73k5,2.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5vlpkm,mattindustries,,1,2025-01-07 14:43:23,,,,I havent seen their promo material what are they advertising as far as capabilities Many things can be done without an LLM like way better searching for emailsfiles using GloVe and average cosine similarity Throw in some RAG for notes app and you are already in a better place Add a phrase table and whisper to do faster offline calendar creationwouldnt need to run all of the time and could start up fast if storing in parquet files I guess my point is a collection of focussed models can feel pretty great as far as the user experience,m5vg7n2,5.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5tjqam,NickCharlesYT,,1,2025-01-07 04:09:31,,,,Im glad you had a positive experience obviously not everyone has the same deal I did I think what I found through my own research after the fact is essentially their top end spec is too much for their designs and theyre forced to limit power and thermals also suffer as a result But this would be consistent for any laptop with the same hardware and a similar thermal design My problem stemmed from the fact that they advertised the full performance of the i9 chip and gpu I bought instead of the actual performance of the machine and furthermore they provided very inaccurate battery life metrics claiming up to 9 hours while the reality was you could sit idle at a web browser and run the battery completely out in just 2 There was literally no way to even get half the advertised battery life with their top spec yet their dedicated page for that model made the same claims My last good PC was a Dell XPS 8300 tower so its not like I went into the XPS laptop expecting it to be bad in fact quite the opposite I just didnt get what was marketed to me and what I therefore expected of the machine and it didnt fit my use case as a result The final nail in the coffin for me though was their complete disregard support wise The support team I worked with did not try to find a solution nor did they offer an exchange or refund for what could only be two possibilities a defective laptop or an obvious case of false advertising They tried to spin it the other way and blame me for apparently believing their own specs and performance metrics I dont take kindly to that so dell is now on my shit list until further notice and they will not be getting any more money from me,m5tiq46,3.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5uzn5b,mycroft-holmie,,6,2025-01-07 12:14:41,,,,The physical escape key was a major improvement But all the software development tools I use make heavy use of function keys f5 f10 f11 etc all the time Having an actually button makes work a lot easier And that is why I decided to not buy another XPS15 and instead buy a Lenovo I also use a MacBook Pro all the time too,m5toqgu,3.0,1hvbj3z

comment,m5uhkhp,CatProgrammer,,4,2025-01-07 09:11:34,,,,4K at that size is just dumb And while I like OLEDs Im still wary about getting a computer with an OLED screen The main reason is sourcing though theyre a small company and the 28K screen is itself higher resolution than the Framework 13 originally came with,m5uhcce,3.0,1hvbj3z
comment,m647unr,cujo67,,2,2025-01-08 21:21:22,,,,Hmm 4K at that size is not dumb The iPad Pro M4 has a pixel density of 264 pi while the iPad Mini 67 have 326 ppi which looks noticeably sharper while viewing high res photos Ive got the Dell XPS Plus with the 35k display which looks phenomenal yet to experience burnin Again its still disappointing that 28k is the maximum resolution seeing as its a company marketing swappable components to not include a higher end display even if it did cost more Id pay for the upgrade Not having it as an option unfortunately steers me into the direction of Dell which Id rather not do but not many are making tandem oled displays yet,m5uhkhp,4.0,1hvbj3z
comment,m5w7h7w,_Lucille_,,3,2025-01-07 16:36:15,,,,I like the framework but imo their value proposition is just not good enough for general public And until framework is mainstream or has a better logistics network getting the parts for repair is still going to take a while Take something as common and simple as a keyboard replacement for example ordering a new framework keyboard will have it shipped out from Taiwan and generally takes a week meanwhile your local repair store may already have a keyboard lying around for a dell and you can have it replaced within 24 hours,m5srhsg,2.0,1hvbj3z
