comment,lyv975n,AuroraFinem,,8,2024-11-25 06:14:42,,,,Most people dont upgrade every generation The intention is do compare it to a typical person who might be looking to upgrade I still use my 2019 MacBook Pro for anything I doing do on my desktop it matters more to me performance compared to other options I might be considering or to my own machine knowing its 20 faster than last years doesnt matter because Im not picking between it and last years and Im not going to upgrade if I just did last year,lyv7xkz,4.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyv9xc9,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-25 06:21:29,,,,The vast majority also dont upgrade very expensive Macs every 2 years so thats not a very good point The M1 itself was only released in late 2020,lyv975n,5.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyugpgu,r31ya,,12,2024-11-25 02:41:33,,,,Apple still benchmark M4 against M1 in some official benchmark panel It still a great chip mind you but the improvement have slowed down and follow the standard performance development curve,lyt9jan,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyuhvm1,PocketNicks,,8,2024-11-25 02:49:06,,,,The M1 is still a great chip with more than enough power for a typical user doing web browsing and word processing and other light to medium duty tasks I remember MKBHD saying even he didnt feel the need to update to the M2 when it came out and hes a very rich tech YouTuber who uses the latest and greatest of everything,lyugpgu,3.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyvgojy,darti_me,,3,2024-11-25 07:27:39,,,,People are elated at the M4 generation of products mainly because the new base RAM is now 16GB and the Mac value argument keeps getting stronger,lyt9jan,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyz9uez,hosky2111,,1,2024-11-25 22:22:11,,,,Its all relative The hype over M4 comes in part from the appeal of the new Mac mini the new 16gb ram base config but also the fact that a lot of people bought the M1 macs The genongen improvements since M3 arent a revolution but the cumulative upgrades since M1 are now enough to be very noticeable in regular workloads Its the first Mseries chip marketed towards Mseries owners instead of just intel Mac owners which changes the framing of the coverage The same will probably be true of the a1iii even if the upgrades are similar to those between i and ii people will suddenly be comparing a camera from 2021 to one from 2027 and so even if there arent major improvements having 6 year newer hardware and software will feel like a bigger leap I also think they probably released the a9iii and a1ii in the wrong order instead of the a9iii being positioned as a a1ii with global shutter the a1ii became the a9iii without global shutter Realistically they were never going to have the global shutter and high frame rate of the a9iii AND the resolution of the a1i given how recently the a9iii released but peoples expectations suddenly got lifted to an unreachable height Meanwhile the many ergonomic and software improvements added for the a9iii were basically taken for granted on the a1ii,lyt9jan,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lywjk56,StarbeamII,,0,2024-11-25 13:38:48,,,,M4 when it launched in an iPad it was something like 20 faster percore ie single thread than the IntelAMD desktop flagships 14900K7950X so it got a lot of welldeserved hype,lyt9jan,2.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyuaj27,helpnxt,,5,2024-11-25 02:02:06,,,,I mean the M1 demonstrated that Apple can still push their boundaries a bit and people were excited with what might be unlocked turns out nothing and then with the M2 its just back to the yearly gradual speed increase that they will claim but give no actual proof on until people buy the product and run benchmarks,lyq8yvm,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyup310,monsantobreath,,29,2024-11-25 03:36:15,,,,Maybe perpetual excitement is an artificial concept born of modern marketing If the tool does the job whats to get excited about Why should you be excited for an iterative change An actual pro doesnt upgrade camera bodies like conspicuous consumer minded people get a new phone every year or two The big change is worth excitement Reads like industry press speaking to the internal ideology of the producers and not the users,,0.0,1gynyrv

comment,lysdp7k,Virreinatos,,124,2024-11-24 19:37:52,,,,It does kinda fits PS4 was so solid people didnt migrate to PS5 as expected They didnt see the point Even today games still keep coming out for both 4 and 5 because the 4 player base is still so large Which means a lot of AAA games arent taking advantage of what the 5 can do because it doesnt make financial sense,lyqrtu9,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lytcf9z,vom-IT-coffin,,43,2024-11-24 22:38:17,,,,A lot of it had to do with when the PS5 marketing blitz happened when it was released covid and chip shortages led to people not being able to get one Low growth led developers to focusing on both ps4 and ps5 for sales Then when the hype dried up and ps5 became readily available people didnt have to switch because all the games were available on the old system Had ps5 been able to supply the demand during the marketing campaigns when it came out we likely wouldnt be at this point,lysdp7k,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyugwg5,r31ya,,9,2024-11-25 02:42:47,,,,and right now PS5 is solid enough many consider PS5pro to be unnecessary but Sony is aware of this and position PS5Pro as premium option rather than replacementupgrade,lysdp7k,2.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyu6vk3,lmea14,,3,2024-11-25 01:39:30,,,,It would help if there were actually some good exclusive games that made the purchase of a PS5 essential It boggles the mind how this generation just seems to have been abandoned,lysdp7k,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyupnpu,None,,60,2024-11-25 03:40:10,,,,At this point its often just about improving performance and ease of use in more and more extreme conditions Mostly in the areas of auto focus and low light performance Do you need to have autofocus capable of tracking a ping pong ball and getting noise free shots from the other side of a dimly lit reception hall No but professionals will gladly pay to have a higher performance ceiling and expand their range of operable conditions,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyuw70g,None,,16,2024-11-25 04:26:13,,,,A camera sensor is a fancy analog to digital converter When dealing with 50 million pixels outputting 14bits you got a damn huge amount of data that needs to be offloaded General stats you see get better on cameras is how many megapixels how many shots can be captured in a second and how many shots the camera can fit in its buffer and offload to a memory card Pro bodies from sony nikon canon are outputting at least 12GB of data per second So ontop of the massive data being recorded the camera is using each brands form of machine learningAI assistance autofocus to decide what the subject should be Modern systems get better every model at tracking eyes face heads birds animals trains planes and automobiles Every brand has their own proprietary SOC and allow firmware updates to adjustimprove autofocus algorithms bug fixes or straight up new features never seen before Nikons autocapture was added to their flagship 2 years after release via firmware Unfortunately its known in the photography world that Sony and Canon will purposefully hold back improvements that could have been a firmware update and include it in the next physical body they release,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyuom4m,monsantobreath,,13,2024-11-25 03:33:04,,,,The dslr basically established the baseline for digital camera ergonomics Mirrorless has been more of a revolution toward video recording performance Raw image quality hasnt really improved much in ten years Many find the modern still photo lenses too sterile even and add the character of less perfect lenses in post For video though they seem quite favoured And for what its worth still photo takers tend to find sony the worst at ergo confusing menus and uninspiring colour science,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyv17qi,Gnochi,,4,2024-11-25 05:05:19,,,,That said mirrorless makes all those old lenses fun to use again with WYSIWYG and metering and perfect albeit manual focusing capability and such All you need is an adapter,lyuom4m,2.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyv37my,monsantobreath,,1,2024-11-25 05:21:46,,,,Well my Nikon dslr makes them fun to use as well Im not sure what mirrorless did to make them more fun Nikon has used the F mount for decades and most dslrs could use lenses going back to 1977 without adapter The Df uniquely could use the ones from even further back that normally needed to be modified As for wysiwyg I feel modern camera users use that as a crutch especially if shooting for pleasure,lyv17qi,3.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyuupxk,SweatyInBed,,2,2024-11-25 04:15:37,,,,In addition to other replies to you different cameras have different capabilities on multiple facets For video alone this can include things like frame rate resolutions resolutions AT specific frame rates color depth record formats outputs color space workflows etc I wont bore you with the details but some of these are crucial to success in the video landscape,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyv7j02,QuickQuirk,,1,2024-11-25 05:59:19,,,,Its been slow ticking evolution over the past 15 years Digital cameras leapt forwards by bounds the first few years and now the improvements are pretty mild and incremental The megapixels are so high that most users dont care and thats stagnated plus adding more MP just slows down processing and needs more expensive storage The technology has shrunk so much that now the size limitation is simply ergonomics and the size is a product decision rather than a technical one Is this camera going to have a huge grip to balance very large lenses or will it be small enough to stuff in a jacket pocket Camera CPU speeds have increased so much that all cameras can shoot faster and longer bursts even budget cameras exceed the flagships of 20 years ago The ISOdynamic range is bumping up against the limitations of physics and material science so you dont see much advancement there any more either Really the only thing left is around integrations with other apps like direct upload to social media AI features to improve the photos you take at which point why not use an iphone and autofocus and ease of use The last two are pretty decent but not required for most photographers And even then the improvements are incremental All cameras have phenomonal eye autofocus now and very little skill is required to get sharp photos of most subjects I think this is great as I have little skill Professionals are happy to pay for that slightly better autofocus performance so they nail the shot but even a lot of them are perfectly happy with what they have Youre right Cameras have always done their job well digital or film The difference is that with older cameras more skill was required to get the right exposure the right focus the right framing the right moment in time Now the camera does a lot of that for you and is a lot more forgiving of mistakes,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lyvd0p8,DaviesSonSanchez,,2,2024-11-25 06:50:57,,,,Just a small point with regards to AI I only know how Sony uses it but they strictly use AI for auto focus and subject recognition Theres no AI improvement of images going on,lyv7j02,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyvtmyw,quick_justice,,1,2024-11-25 09:50:24,,,,Theres quite a few things For traditional mirror cameras autofocus speed and quality mostly important for dynamic shots like sports and wildlife Magic autofocus is supposed to grab and track moving subject against any background but we are quite far from that so lot of room to improve It also gets worse in the low light and theres speed of acquisition Burst speed both time between shots and quantity it can take before buffer is done Image stabilisation both optical and electronic which is partly on lens but has to be supported by the camera Size and weight Battery life Picture quality itself namely photosensitivity or rather amount of noise sensor generates in low light For mirrorless for a while they were too lagging for dynamic subject but now they are actually better but they ones that are better are excruciatingly expensive So cost here is a factor of improvement Edit to be clear none of it matters very much for an average tourist or a family guy who wants some family memories They are also not a target audience However if you are for example in a wildlife photography even as a hobbyist you will be facing a lot of small fast moving targets in a low light and in difficult focus conditions think a flock of finches moving through the branches at dawn Even at this level every bit of innovation pays If you are in concert photography you might be looking at taking high quality photos of moving subjects in a very difficult light and so on Cameras now improve for these sort of things and theres still a lot to do For a vacation photos 10 years old DSLR will do fantastic job,lyugu0p,1.0,1gynyrv

comment,lyz5iyg,unskilledplay,,0,2024-11-25 21:59:10,,,,Nonsense My Leica film camera from the 1980s is one of just a few cameras Ive owned that were never followed up with something better The Sony Alpha is missing a bunch of features that already exist elsewhere There is no computational photography that you get on phones My phone can take a stream of data and identify the perfect frame where nobody is blinking in the group I press the shutter once and it makes sure it gets the best shot The Sony accomplishes this by shooting 30 frames a second and then making you scroll through dozens of photos to select the one you like Theres a btter way to do this My phone can use data from previous and subsequent frames to enhance an existing frame Apple calls this night mode I have to bust out Adobe tools and spend a good amount of manual effort to get the same effect with the Sony The Sony does not do this well It has pixel shift which is basically just upsampling I still have to download photos and apply Lightroom presets to them I cant have this all done automatically in camera The Sony preset system is embarrassingly bad The Sony a1 ii isnt better than the a1 because the competition sucks Theres plenty of room to improve Maybe more room than since the introduction of DSLRs in the early 2000s,,0.0,1gynyrv
comment,lz1o1eq,-knave1-,,2,2024-11-26 08:19:35,,,,Professional photographers buy cameras because they get exactly what they capture with the device not because the camera combines photosuses AI to generate information Photographers want the raw image and the ability to do the rest in post in order to capture the most detailed image possible Then be able to use their creativity to create the feeling they want by croppingediting not just slap a filter on Having said that a lot of influencers and amateurs want cameras that act like phones because of ease of access but you cant really have both Fujifilm is to influencers what Sony is to professionals One has amazing prebuilt filters that help the photographer capture immediate Instagramworthy photoslike a phone The other creates high quality images ready for processing and editing in post Both are great and useful for different reasons but to compare Sonys new camera models to your phone is just dumb,lyz5iyg,1.0,1gynyrv
comment,lz3b9ba,unskilledplay,,1,2024-11-26 16:02:02,,,,Im really into photography I dont shoot professionally but I shoot a lot and a lot of people in my circle do this professionally I personally know around a dozen professional photographers in my city What you say applies to zero of them All photojournalists and some other professionals would care a lot about this I just dont know any Both are great and useful for different reasons but to compare Sonys new camera models to your phone is just dumb Revisit this on the mark iv and eat your words One has amazing prebuilt filters that help the photographer capture immediate Instagramworthy photoslike a phone The other creates high quality images ready for processing and editing in post Ive owned two Fuji cameras Sony alpha is the only nonanalog camera I currently own What you say is all untrue I know someone who uses Sony presets and Sonys Creators app to go from shot to share in little more than seconds What you say is just marketing narrative,lz1o1eq,2.0,1gynyrv

comment,lywhqyx,joeyc923,,2,2024-11-25 13:26:40,,,,Lol the downvote brigade is out I see By soulless I suppose I mean not very fun to use IMO Didnt feel like a camera so much as a device The menu system is part of that although I think all of them have their issues,lyw0xgf,2.0,1gynyrv
