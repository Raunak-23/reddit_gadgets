post,1hb23sv,a_Ninja_b0y,Leaked AMD Strix Halo benchmarks put this processor's integrated gaming GPU alongside the performance of the laptop Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060,181,2024-12-10 13:47:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1hb23sv/leaked_amd_strix_halo_benchmarks_put_this/,41.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,m1dnw53,aitorbk,,42,2024-12-10 16:31:09,,,,A 4060 in a cpu That can potentially be the bestseller of severalyears all depends on pricing and what memorymb is needed Furthermore HBM memory in package like 32GB would be the icing on the cake and increase performance substantially,,0.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1f319q,Old-Board1553,,11,2024-12-10 20:56:07,,,,Its the top model from Strix Halo That will go from 25K up for sure,m1dnw53,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1hik5z,QuickQuirk,,15,2024-12-11 06:06:26,,,,Are you suggesting 2500 Its dead in the water at that price A 4070 laptop can be had for 1500 This works best as an APU to reduce costs for the mid range 10001500 range Otherwise theres no point to it unless the efficiency is significantly ahead of nvidias 40 series,m1f319q,2.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i8lm8,fareastrising,,6,2024-12-11 10:48:58,,,,If over 2k then they better go balls out on the ram Nothing lower than 64GB at the very least,m1hik5z,3.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1l4ryt,QuickQuirk,,2,2024-12-11 21:00:30,,,,It wont be 2k Just doesnt make economic sense No one will buy it,m1i8lm8,4.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1k41be,GrayDaysGoAway,,3,2024-12-11 18:00:05,,,,4070 laptops get even cheaper than that Theyre regularly available for around 1100 these days,m1hik5z,3.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1l4mro,QuickQuirk,,3,2024-12-11 20:59:48,,,,yeah so I dont buy the 2500k price tag unless its incredibly efficient with the whole package in at 45w max TDP for thin and light macbook competitors,m1k41be,4.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1lding,Benzy2,,2,2024-12-11 21:44:07,,,,I believe it will push the 2500 mark Maybe some will come in cheaper but I absolutely expect this to be the better build quality better screen quality higher base spec choice and push well into mid 2000s for a decent spec build There are already Laptop options with a 4050 or 4060 that push low to mid 2000s AMD isnt going to sell a good CPU with integrated 4060 for less than a good CPU and 4060 The point is to be more efficient and easier to cool At least at first Come in as the form factor choice for a generation or two then trickle down to the budget performance choice But there is no way they undercut pricing on a quality CPU4060 combo and ignore the premium market while they hold a monopoly on the best performing all in one,m1l4mro,5.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1hl2ht,Old-Board1553,,7,2024-12-11 06:29:49,,,,Yes 2500 Think about it Strix Point aka HX 370 was 1500 Strix Halo lineup is another level above even the base model from this lineup is better compared to HX 370375 And the one in the article is the top model of Strix Halo so you aint gonna find it under 22002500 Maybe the base model and the other versions that showed up online But no chance for the top model They want to compete with Apple and Macbook ProMax lineup with this,m1hik5z,3.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1k537s,GrayDaysGoAway,,6,2024-12-11 18:05:20,,,,They want to compete with Apple and Macbook ProMax lineup with this Well thats pretty stupid on their part The people looking to buy Apple devices will never even consider anything with these AMD chips in them Only gamers will be interested in these and those gamers can get far better performance for far less money with other hardware,m1hl2ht,4.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1lftsj,QuickQuirk,,0,2024-12-11 21:55:47,,,,Not entirely true There are a line of expensive high quality thin and light windows devices None of them have close to the battery life of the macbook though So the only way I see this work is if the strix chip has pulled a phenonomal efficiency win with both GPUCPU to get it close to macbook level performance I still think that the real value of this chip is reducing cost on the low end though 4060 performance in one chip at lower cost and power That would be a winner for AMD and they could pump out a lot of these While there is a windows market for these devices its not a large one,m1k537s,5.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1lhd98,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2024-12-11 22:03:48,,,,Honestly even if the efficiency is insane I dont see that changing the equation much I mean people buying Macbooks generally arent doing so for the battery life Theyre doing it for iOS and everything that comes with that And yeah there are a fair number of expensive ultralight windows laptops but afaik they dont generally sell well Seems like every other day another ones being discontinued But yeah one way or another totally agree that its a very narrow market here if theyre priced at 2k or above,m1lftsj,6.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1lihof,Old-Board1553,,0,2024-12-11 22:09:44,,,,That will never happen unless Windows evolves on ARM and AMD speeds up the plan to enter in the ARM segment,m1lftsj,6.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1gxo6g,_CatLover_,,4,2024-12-11 03:25:48,,,,4060 mobile not the one you put in your desktop pc,m1dnw53,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1hha7e,GunnerTardis,,3,2024-12-11 05:54:46,,,,Depends on the wattage but mobile 4060 and desktop 4060 have identical performance,m1gxo6g,2.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i71k0,an0maly33,,8,2024-12-11 10:31:53,,,,Do they Previous generations had differences in core count Mobiles are always watered down to keep heat and power usage lower,m1hha7e,3.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1j34eg,GunnerTardis,,3,2024-12-11 14:44:11,,,,Usually that is the case but it is not unheard of I believe there have been laptop gpus from previous generations that were identical in performance Here is a video that dives into the laptop and desktop 4060 As you can see the dies are identical and there is nothing cut down from the card physically The joke is that NVIDIA put a laptop GPU in a desktop GPU as well which makes sense why the 4060 was so disappointing in terms of performance Normally desktop GPU push performance so hard they need to be cut down to cope with the laptop form factor however its almost like the desktop 4060 was made for laptops to begin with,m1i71k0,4.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1cw06m,a_Ninja_b0y,,29,2024-12-10 13:49:16,,,,From the article A nextgen AMD Ryzen gaming CPU has had its Geekbench benchmarks posted publicly weeks before it was expected to debut at CES 2025 Rumored to be AMDs flagship processor of the new Strix Halo line it appears its integrated GPU can go toetotoe with an Nvidia RTX 4060 However theres also a massive catch Current AMD desktop GPUs may not be the very best graphics cards in the world but they have been holding their own in terms of raw power However its the companys ability to embed its Radeon GPUs into its Ryzen CPUs that has proven a winner in the laptop and handheld spaces Nearly all the best gaming handheld devices use an AMD CPU with an integrated GPU As the company takes over the portable PC space its new AMD Strix Halo hardware could significantly increase performance OneXPlayer recently launched impressive Strix Point handhelds and Strix Halo could improve upon that further However the catch is that we might never play games on this specific chip The cumbersomely named Ryzen AI Max Pro 395 is potentially only for enterprise or development hardware AMD is still trying to make inroads into the artificial intelligence market and having a laptop chip as powerful as a laptop RTX 4060 onboard could make a big splash,,0.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1dipko,Bobbler23,,23,2024-12-10 16:03:23,,,,A low end integrated APU would certainly take a chunk out of what Nvidia call low end cards if we can get it in desktop architecture,,0.0,1hb23sv

comment,m1ffa1t,elite_haxor1337,,7,2024-12-10 21:58:46,,,,lol Im laughing at this comment Liquid cooling isnt ever necessary Chips dont need water they just need to be cooled Especially considering that this article is about mobile chips something tells me they will not be water cooled I mean sometimes these chips arent even air cooled Theyre passively cooled,m1dy962,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1ejsxj,crescentfreshchester,,3,2024-12-10 19:16:38,,,,Key Features and Questions The massive 40 CU iGPU requires significant bandwidth which might be addressed through HBM or multiple stacks of LPDDR5 RAM on the die carrier The CPU power seems excessive for the iGPU capabilities potentially limiting its appeal for gaming and AI workloads The Strix Halos power consumption is expected to range from 15W to 120W depending on the configuration The die carriers size and potential for expansion through DIMM sockets are unclear,m1dy962,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1fb5yn,Magnusg,,6,2024-12-10 21:37:33,,,,Liquid cooling is kind of a lie,m1dy962,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i7dey,an0maly33,,2,2024-12-11 10:35:32,,,,Not really I cant turn back from liquid Its silent AF even under load My 2080 with the stock cooler sounded like a vacuum cleaner,m1fb5yn,2.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i8jtm,Magnusg,,1,2024-12-11 10:48:26,,,,interesting some if not the majority of liquid cooling systems are often louder im glad it worked out for you though For me it also makes it so much more difficult to manage updating components and frankly its almost always unnecessary to keep things cool the 20 series had a lot of rough patches about it with the exception of poorly designed graphic cards and kind of the large immediate heat reservoir that builds in i dont think theres really any measurable perf difference with liquid that is worth using unless you are doing some serious overclocking,m1i7dey,3.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i9zp4,an0maly33,,1,2024-12-11 11:03:43,,,,My 3070 was loud too I have 2 loops myself and a buddy of mine has 2 Mix of custom and AIO stuff Havent really had any issues aside from topping off my coolant once in a while I know I should purge and flush periodically but I havent bothered with that either,m1i8jtm,4.0,1hb23sv

comment,m1id384,an0maly33,,1,2024-12-11 11:34:29,,,,2080 is EVGA and the 3070 is Gigabyte The 3070 wasnt as bad but Im not up for hearing a jet while I play games,m1ib8uo,6.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1fs8sw,None,,0,2024-12-10 23:09:58,,,,watercooling is roughly as effective as a good CPU fan its definitely not categorically superior,m1dy962,1.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1i7h2e,an0maly33,,1,2024-12-11 10:36:40,,,,Agree on the cpu I have a big heatsink and good airflow Its quiet My beef is with gpu air coolers I need water there,m1fs8sw,2.0,1hb23sv
comment,m1hvf3w,Thwitch,,-3,2024-12-11 08:17:45,,,,Seriously dont understand AMDS reasoning behind putting hamstrung GPUs on the same die as an overkill CPU Why can they not produce a chip with both lowmidrange CPU GPU,,0.0,1hb23sv
