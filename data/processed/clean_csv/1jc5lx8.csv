comment,mhzx6vu,AccomplishedBother12,,7,2025-03-15 22:50:27,,,,I think its less about is it efficient and more about how applicable is the technology Im sure that Fujifilm COULD sink all their RD resources into refining and miniaturizing their technology to rival something of this resolution magnitude but why How many people need 3200 megapixels Who has the hard drive space to store an image or multiple images of that size And how much would the end product cost Who could afford it,mhzqstt,1.0,1jc5lx8
comment,mi2d6z3,RedHal,,2,2025-03-16 10:07:00,,,,Add to that the need to have corresponding optics able to resolve to that level By way of explanation lets try a thought experiment We have a 32GPx sensor in a phone camera If the field of view is 90 we would require a lens aperture of 24cm around an inch based on a square sensor approx 56568 x 56568 pixels and wavelength of 560nm Thats Doable However phones are thin The distance from lens to sensor is going to be no more than about 5mm which means a sensor size of around 1cm² and a pixel width of 017 microns which is tiny and around a sixtieth of the size of current sensors Good luck getting any decent light gathering capability with that at any decently short exposure,mhzx6vu,2.0,1jc5lx8
