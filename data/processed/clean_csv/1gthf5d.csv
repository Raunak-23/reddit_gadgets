post,1gthf5d,Sariel007,It's Surprisingly Easy to Jailbreak LLM-Driven Robots. Researchers induced bots to ignore their safeguards without exception,2715,2024-11-17 16:33:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1gthf5d/its_surprisingly_easy_to_jailbreak_llmdriven/,171.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,lxmbjcf,goda90,,375,2024-11-17 17:25:32,,,,Depending on the LLM to enforce safe limits in your system is like depending on little plastic pegs to stop someone from turning a dial too far You need to assume the end user will figure out how to send bad input and act accordingly LLMs can be a great tool for natural language interfaces but it needs to be backed by a properly designed deterministic code if its going to control something else,,0.0,1gthf5d
comment,lxno2ew,DelfrCorp,,66,2024-11-17 21:45:45,,,,My understanding was to create a proper SafetyCritical System you should have a completely different redundancysecondary System different code programmed by a different team to accomplish the exact same thing that basically doublechecks everything that the primary system does both systems must come to a consensus to proceed with any action Could probably cut on those errors by doing the Same with LLM systems,lxmbjcf,1.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxpqks2,Luo_Yi,,5,2024-11-18 05:32:10,,,,I work in Process Control systems and that is actually how they operate The primary or basic control system looks after the normal operations while the safeguarding system is a completely independent control system that is designed to be higher reliability and has priority control So no matter how badly the Process Control system is designed built or operated the Safeguarding system keeps it out of trouble,lxno2ew,2.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxp5b79,GoatseFarmer,,3,2024-11-18 02:59:39,,,,Most LLMs that are ran online have this llama has it copilot has it openAI has it I would assume the researchers were testing those models For instance copilot is three layered User input is fed to a screening program pseudoLLM which then runs the request and modifies the input if it does not either accept the input or the output as clean The corrected prompt us fed to copilot and copilots output is fed to a security layer verifying the contents fit certain guidelines None of these directly communicate outside of input output None are comprised of the same LLMprogram Microsoft rolled this out as an industry standard in February and the rest followed suite I assume the researchers were testing these and not niche LLMs So assuming the data was collected more recently than February this accounts for that,lxno2ew,2.0,1gthf5d

comment,lyc50gz,bluehands,,1,2024-11-22 00:30:35,,,,Where would you put the guardrails It has to be in code somewhere which means the output has to be evaluated by something Wherever the code that evaluates a model is code has just become part of the model,lxn7gia,3.0,1gthf5d
comment,lycbndo,FluffyToughy,,1,2024-11-22 01:10:09,,,,ML models are used for extremely complex tasks where traditional rulesbased approaches would be too rigid Even small models have millions of parameters You cant do a security review of that its just too complicated Theres too many opportunities for bugs and you cant have bugs in safety critical software So instead what you can do is focus on creating a traditional system which handles the safety critical part Take a self driving car for example Drive the car is an insanely complex task but something like apply the brakes if distance to whats in front of you is less than stopping distance is much simpler and absolutely could be written using traditional approaches If possible leave software altogether If you need an airlock to only ever have one open door mechanically design the system so its impossible for two doors to open at the same time The ML layer can and should still try to avoid situations where guardrails activate if nothing else defense in depth Its just that you cannot rely on it,lyc50gz,4.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxp5zyj,LangyMD,,3,2024-11-18 03:04:05,,,,The guardrails can be built using a different tool than an LLM The LLM would be used to come up with a potential answer then deterministic code that isnt based on an LLM checks to see if the potential answer is valid Basically you should treat the output of an LLM as if it were the output of a human student who is wellread but lazy bad at doing original work and good at bullshitting Dont have that system be the final gatekeeper to your security or safety sensitive functions,lxmz6x2,2.0,1gthf5d
comment,lxpqz9k,Luo_Yi,,2,2024-11-18 05:35:34,,,,Basically you should treat the output of an LLM as if it were the output of a human student who is wellread but lazy bad at doing original work and good at bullshitting Or to put it another way you treat the output as a request The hard coded guardrails would be responsible for approving the request if it was within constraints or rejecting it,lxp5zyj,3.0,1gthf5d
comment,lyc5j7j,bluehands,,1,2024-11-22 00:33:43,,,,Where would you put the guardrails It has to be in code somewhere which means the output has to be evaluated by something Wherever the code that evaluates a model is code has just become part of the model The point is that literally the best way to evaluate the output of an LLM is an LLM If there was something better we would be using that instead of LLMs,lxp5zyj,3.0,1gthf5d
comment,lyc6wrl,LangyMD,,1,2024-11-22 00:41:50,,,,For the purpose of controlling robots Youre not talking about output that is in a natural language Using an LLM to evaluate the output and ensure it fits constraints like the robot can physically do this action or this action is unlikely to create a force strong enough to kill the human who has been detected to be in this area is silly The best way to evaluate a safety sensitive system is not to use just another LLM in almost any case,lyc5j7j,4.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxnxhts,Starfox-sf,,1,2024-11-17 22:37:57,,,,What expert do you know that manages to produce wrong answers at times or give two different answers based on the semantics or the wording of the query To a point the designers are correct in that they dont exactly understand the underlying algorithm but also explains why further training isnt giving any useful increase in how it spits out answers that and trying to train with output from another LLM literally GIGO,lxnsrst,3.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxockgl,Starfox-sf,,3,2024-11-18 00:05:37,,,,Yes but if an expert gave two wildly conflicting info based on some wording difference and could never give the same answer twice even if asked the same question would they still be considered an expert Youre just assuming that hallucinations are an aberration not a feature,lxoc5o0,5.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxndxg0,Pixie1001,,7,2024-11-17 20:51:23,,,,You can but its a swiss cheese approach The monitor AI will be a different model with different vulnerabilities to trick the AI you need to weave a needle through the venn diagram of vulnerabilities they both share Its definitely not perfect though theres actually a game about this created by one of these companies where you need to trick a chatbot into revealing a password Theres 6 stages using various different AI security methods or combinations there of and then a final bonus stage which I assume is some prototype of the real deal You can break through the first 6 stages in a couple hours but the final one requires getting it to tell a creative story about a special word and then being able to infer what it might be which very few people can crack Thats still not great but its one of many techniques to make these things dramatically more difficult to hack,lxmlxue,3.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxmzu03,obi1kenobi1,,3,2024-11-17 19:35:12,,,,Remember A Logic Named Joe It was a short story from 1946 about a Logic which was part computer appliance and part virtual assistant For 30 years the story has been hailed as a prescient prediction of the internet but over the past few years it clearly resembles LLM services more than anything with a bit of cloud computing sprinkled in Of course the AI in the story is a real AI capable of reasoning understanding and performing computations rather than an autocomplete algorithm that tricks simpleminded humans into thinking its an AI due to pareidolia but the core premise of safeguards being trivially easy to remove and cause chaos if you know how feels more relevant in the 2020s than it ever did before,,0.0,1gthf5d

comment,lxnkikd,QuantumQuantonium,,1,2024-11-17 21:26:20,,,,In order to fully prevent a LLM from breaking a rule based on natural language and not some specific action the not can do youd essentially need a separate LLM to interpret the bots response and deem if it violates the rule It becomes a sort of circular check or it becomes dependent on the strength of that second LLM to detect actual violating comments And its identical to the issue of generative ai checkers where youre using an LLM to check another LLM but that issue is more that ai speak is designed intentionally to mimic human speak which is very predictable and patternistic so its impossible to tell the difference in text,,0.0,1gthf5d
