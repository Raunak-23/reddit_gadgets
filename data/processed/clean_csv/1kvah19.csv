comment,mucrdet,The-Gargoyle,,4,2025-05-26 15:14:10,,,,Nobody got fired for buying intel or in this case maybe broadcom I think I dont remember which these were OH BUT WAIT D So there was a Nic chip by intel or broadcom I think And they had some of the most asinine bugs and flaws in them I have ever encountered Some of my favorites Oops the RXTX packet count has rolled over to a number that is too large so we crash the chip this means there is no way to make the card respond until you hard reboot boot This would result in your NIC just not working It would onlineoffline in the OS all day and pretend everything was hunky dory But never actually handle any packets at all It took about 12 hours to hit that packet count on a busy server So imagine having to hard offon your production servers every 12 hours because the broadcom ports are all mentally deficient This also happened on routingswitching if it had this specific set of chips in it Womp womp If you sent the right kind of packet fragments through it would just disappear them into the void It would also never tell the OS or the network anything about doing this It really loved doing this on UDP data streams Good luck figuring that out Im sorry this TCP packet is just too weird for us and we dont know what to do with it so the NIC is going to hang for about 3 seconds and then resume operation Its also not going to report any error codes to the OS or the network ever We had done a full row of servers and routers and switches and about half of them had these chips in them IT WAS PURE INSANITY,muaholc,3.0,1kvah19

comment,mu8t6f9,CocodaMonkey,,43,2025-05-25 22:05:50,,,,That kind of speed will get used moving files around easily I wouldnt often max out a 10Gbps link but I absolutely would max it out sometimes I already have a home NAS which runs at 4Gbps 4x1Gbps using Port Trunking Being able to have 10Gbps devices without breaking the bank would be really nice Right now almost everything I have is limited to 1Gbps because of cost Outside of home NASs though its also relevant for WiFi Most homes run all their WiFi through one access point which means even if you have WiFI 7 with a theoretical max speed of 46 Gbps youre actually sharing 1Gbps with everyone on your network For larger families that might mean each person is only getting a few hundred Mbps each,mu8hjff,2.0,1kvah19
comment,muatw4r,AVonGauss,,4,2025-05-26 06:21:30,,,,I already have a home NAS which runs at 4Gbps 4x1Gbps using Port Trunking Im guessing you mean link aggregation rather than port trunking in the quote but aggregation also might not work the way youre thinking if you believe it means the NAS is running at 4Gbps,mu8t6f9,3.0,1kvah19
comment,mucj2ed,CocodaMonkey,,2,2025-05-26 14:31:41,,,,Youre trying to be too technical because the terms arent as clearly defined as text books like you to think I use a Qnap which uses the term port trunking It can also be called link aggregation or Ethernet bonding and depending on exactly what device your using what that actually is can vary As it stand my NAS can reliably do about 35Gbps when transferring between the one computer I have on a 5Gbps link with it,muatw4r,4.0,1kvah19

comment,muclrug,CocodaMonkey,,1,2025-05-26 14:45:41,,,,This is simply the way the tech world is Terms come out and either get misused or different vendors argue different definitions Even simple terms like GB and MB arent clear as a text book will tell you they are divisible by 1000 but in the real world most devices will define them as 1024 The simple fact is Qnap which is a major supplier of NAS hardware calls it port trunking I dont care if that matches up with what you learnt in a text book,muck8j0,6.0,1kvah19
comment,mucno91,Muslim_Wookie,,-2,2025-05-26 14:55:26,,,,Youre an example of someone that is confidently wrong You dont have to care sure The same way I dont have to care about the opinion of someone that seems to think theres any confusion amongst professionals whether MB is 1000 or 1024 Its so obvious you are lost when you bring up that particular unit as an example of you being clever and oh ho ho a common sense person versus silly text book people Go on tell us more about the real world Edit ahahahahahaha they thought theyd reply to me and then super quickly block me but I replied to them before they could block me and now they are stuck Unblock me to reply to me and then wait 24 hours to block me again or just take the L Oh no what to do what to do Edit2 reply for urob_allshouse because the OP blocked me so I cant reply to other people in this thread So when you go back and read what I wrote do you see me discussing port trunking at all And given I cant reply to people in this thread thats the end of the conversation from my perspective,muclrug,7.0,1kvah19

comment,mue0uow,calcium,,2,2025-05-26 19:01:36,,,,I have 10Gbe at the office and will absolutely saturate it when moving around large files Only issue is that the files Im moving are between 500GB13TB each Getting large flash storage drives are expensive and even when using cache drives on a NAS I can saturate them if moving a lot of data At a certain point the speeds will fall back to 200MBs as thats generally the fastest the hard drives will write to Im an edge case for sure,mu8t6f9,3.0,1kvah19

comment,muasuzn,lorarc,,-1,2025-05-26 06:11:58,,,,Woah there You may be sometimes maxing the nas but how much data are you really transferring at once You may try to download a 30gb blurry rip but doing that in half a minute vs 4 minutes shouldnt be that big of a deal Especially since for most consumer devices they wont be able to write it to disk at that speed Same goes for your home Internet unless everyone is torrenting it shouldnt be an issue as people dont use full bandwidth all the time,mu8t6f9,3.0,1kvah19
comment,mub66w7,CatpainLeghatsenia,,10,2025-05-26 08:19:37,,,,always the same deal just like in the 90s Why would you ever need that Well right now maybe not but it is better to set higher hardware standards for lower cost now where we dont need it that wenn we cross this metaphorical bridge somewhere in the future we dont run into bottlenecks because we thought no one needs that Making better stuff for a lower price is a good thing and i welcome it and gladly would buy components that come with the highest standards for the lowest asking price,muasuzn,4.0,1kvah19
comment,mucl44r,CocodaMonkey,,3,2025-05-26 14:42:18,,,,Youre thinking way too small Many uses for that speed today have nothing to do with the internet and certainly not general internet usage Moving around a few hundred gigs worth of files on my local network is common for me Encoding and rendering large files often have me working with 10 gig files Im certainly not maxing out the speed at all times but I do notice the speed For example something that would have taken 20 seconds on a 1Gbps connect takes 6 seconds with my link to my NAS Its quick for sure but theres plenty of reasons to want it General internet browsing simply isnt one of them For average users that speed would mostly mean WindowsGames update faster It can easily translate into getting to play a game tens of minutes sooner then someone stuck on a 1Gbps connect,muasuzn,4.0,1kvah19

comment,mub1aqj,OneBigBug,,2,2025-05-26 07:31:18,,,,1080p60 what is this 2015 4k and 6k native is the new norm Sure but not a lot of things stream uncompressed video haha And 4k60 wouldnt be possible over 10Gb I guess my point was mostly that were getting into the realm of extremely niche Home consumer Enterprise and even commercial gear has already had 10Gb for decades use cases where this is useful Like someone asking if they need to upgrade their router or will the free router work absolutely doesnt need this And frankly I know several people who do have a home NAS or home server setups and I dont think I know anyone who needs this That doesnt mean those people dont exist but its a pretty specific niche And youre right and I said as much Its not that having better stuff for cheaper is bad The fewer bottlenecks we need to wait to clear by the time we do need them the better Its just thatnot a lot of people need to go run out and buy this right now,mua8rgr,4.0,1kvah19
