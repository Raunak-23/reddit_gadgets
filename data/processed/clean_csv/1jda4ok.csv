comment,miblqdn,RabidSeason,,50,2025-03-17 20:30:58,,,,Also Tolkien Estate is very much the family who was given ownership of the works by the original creator I dont give a fuck what your politics are companies are not people A person can own their creation for their entire life and they can give it to their great grandchildren to own and they can pass it on indefinitely for all I care But a company is not a person it has no thoughts creativity nor desires and it should have restrictions on its ability to profit on any such things If there is unreleased music from Michael Jackson Prince or any other virtuoso and their catalog is owned by their family then that is still a human being who has creative control over their creation Its theirs to hold share or profit off of at their whim If its owned by a company then it should absolutely be vulnerable to useitorloseit,mib7x68,5.0,1jda4ok

comment,mic4vjd,NecroCannon,,6,2025-03-17 22:06:01,,,,Im artist and fuck Disney for making public domains last as long as they do because of the mouse just for it to all not even matter years later Like Ill be honest Ive seen more passion in fan works of some of the oldest IPs than I do the companies hoarding them For example Paramount and Hasbro has been fucking the Transformers IP in the ass just to finally cater to fans on their failure that broke the partnership At this point the series should be in fans hands,mi8z66k,4.0,1jda4ok
comment,miar5jm,Gintami,,2,2025-03-17 18:05:07,,,,Of course they should The original works will enter public domain but if it is left to their sons and grandchildren yes they should If I create something and I die it should go to my family if I leave it to them I would want them to be set and should be theirs to handle and make a living off of it if I so choose to Not taken away so then Amazon can just make money off of it without compensating my estate The books are not lost You can buy them or read them for free from your library or online And the originals will end up in PD,mi8z66k,4.0,1jda4ok
comment,miazzge,Bamstradamus,,8,2025-03-17 18:47:19,,,,There really needs to be a middle ground where if I want to make a LOTR movie I have to work out a contract but if I want to make a movie using that established loremagic systemworld but a different story I have to wait X years since the last time the copyright holder created something in that world On the one hand its crazy that an IP can be dead for 100 years and nobody can touch it outside of parody But on the other hand if my kid keeps working on a book series that I started and it continues down the family line then I kinda get why it would be considered theirs until they sell it or quit,miar5jm,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,mibolou,RabidSeason,,4,2025-03-17 20:44:41,,,,I think that middle ground should be if the owner is a human or a company If I create a story and make little cartoons and videos for my kids and grandkids and they continue on perhaps entertaining friends and neighbors but keeping the story their own then that is absolutely their work no matter how old it is They should be able to say That story belongs to our family and you cant share recreations of it But if they sell it to Sony and Sony sits on it for 19 years and makes one flop of a movie just to say theyre still using it Fant4stic then it should absolutely go back to the public after some time You cant just say Marshal Mathers Eminem released his first album over 25 years ago so now Im going to perform it because its should be public domain Its still his work But something like NSync a companymanufactured product is a different form of ownership and it shouldnt be an issue if others want to recreate it,miazzge,6.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi972hx,GroinShotz,,-74,2025-03-17 13:23:38,,,,So basically you dont think anyone should be allowed to inherit property Or is it just against certain properties If Tolkien had a winery and the grandkids and great grandkids are running the winery currently This shouldnt be allowed,mi8z66k,4.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9ab5c,Sexy_Underpants,,32,2025-03-17 13:42:38,,,,You inherit all the money they made when they still had the copyright Is your argument that families should hold the copyright in perpetuity That 5x great grandchildren should benefit and nothing is in the public domain,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9bqib,chronictherapist,,21,2025-03-17 13:50:42,,,,Real property is just that real Intellectual property is something that eventually just enters the zeitgeist or is largely forgotten Its just impossible to protect it in perpetuity Tolkiens winery would always be a piece of ground with defined borders legally mandated by a deed Regulated by a local government and its records Plus its not being shared with the world willingly Tolkien didnt announce Here everyone share my winery Talk about it make parodies porn and memes of it IP is like a dick pic once you send it out into the world there is no taking it back or eliminating it entirely Also no one is taxing IP like property either are you suggesting we need to start taxing IP like a house or vehicle Id be all for that tax Disney for the estimated value of Mickey Mouse Tax Marvel for the estimated value of the MCU Tax Intel Qualcom Microsoft etc for the estimated value of all their collective IP Every year just like my house and make sure it all goes to education But trust me the second that happens all those wealthy corporations that keep lobbying to extend Copyright longer and longer would suddenly reverse gears,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok

comment,miaykzr,sapphicsandwich,,0,2025-03-17 18:40:37,,,,Ahh yes the corporate bloodline Lets be real the vast majority of creators are actually paid servants and the real creator is some corporation Its product like a Big Mac This is why AI image generators are so effective at damaging artistic job fields They dont need to create art because most of what creatives do isnt for the sake of art either nor is it that impressive and so the image generator output is equally good and of equal value,mi9ckjv,7.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9elus,TooManyBeesInMyTeeth,,6,2025-03-17 14:06:30,,,,This is a very bad analogy The Hobbit is a singular work of art and a winery is business that produces goods When you leave a winery to your kids they have to continue the work you were doing and keep the winery open if they want to make a profit off of it When you leave the ownership of a story like The Hobbit to your kids they make a passive income off of the work you have already accomplished and they reserve the right to tamper with the creative visions of any artists attempting to adapt or update your story in the future If we were talking about Tolkien leaving a Publishing Company to his Estate instead of the Intellectual Property Rights to an already written book then you might have a point,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi98r2f,Edythir,,23,2025-03-17 13:33:33,,,,A winery has property It has casks it has vinyards it has buildings After you die these buildings will still be there A book is really just an idea an idea you had Sure people have printed that idea but you dont own the printers If you harvest the same grapes go through the same process you will have the same wine But you cant have the same thoughts the same ideas and the same opinions as your grandfather so you cant make the same book so why should you control the book There is nothing to own but an idea someone else had,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9c8bd,sawbladex,,9,2025-03-17 13:53:27,,,,you also put money into the winery to fix stuff and that ship of Thesis process is enough to make it yours enough to pass it on,mi98r2f,6.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9fxed,nonowords,,-6,2025-03-17 14:13:38,,,,A book is really just an idea an idea you had Sure people have printed that idea but you dont own the printers youre there and then you bring up printers for some reason Its the idea that the writer owns The idea is the casks vinyards buildings etc The printer is the liquor distributor,mi98r2f,6.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9rwf9,Frostypancake,,5,2025-03-17 15:15:10,,,,No casks vineyards and buildings are tangible assets I should start a grape fermentation company and call it a vine yard is an idea,mi9fxed,7.0,1jda4ok
comment,mibdee5,nonowords,,1,2025-03-17 19:51:17,,,,Authors dont own the books or the printers They own the idea I should make a vineyard and call it a vineyard is not an idea in the same way that 100000 words written in a unique and novel way is an idea Pretending like those are more alike just because they dont have mass is ridiculous Your whole analogy is confused and forced into the conclusion you want A decendant absolutely can make the same book thats what reprints are They do it the same way a decendent can make the same wine They just do what their grandparent did with the things their grandparent passed on to them be it the vineard and the process intellectual property Or the book and the intellectual property And in both cases they might change and improve or degrade the product or they might spend the effort like what the Tolkien estate seems to attempt to do to maintain the products integrity,mi9rwf9,8.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9c5yv,GroinShotz,,-11,2025-03-17 13:53:05,,,,Okay So since the winemaking Tolkien is now dead For a certain amount of years And the kids have given up the current business As in no longer are producing wine with the Tolkien label I should be allowed to just take Tolkiens name and start my own winery I mean his putting his name on wine was just the idea,mi98r2f,6.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9ffi5,BemaniAK,,8,2025-03-17 14:10:57,,,,Youre still missing the key part which is that the IP of The Hobbit is not a Winery the advent of infinitely reproducible media and the desire to profit from it came with not just basic property rights that you have with a Winery but also additional rights on top of that these rights intentionally restrict the free flow of ideas and information for the purpose of commerce for the creator so it has a time limit that free flow of public domain information is more important than the right for great grandchildren to sue a father for putting a character on a gravestone,mi9c5yv,7.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9hqj8,alidan,,1,2025-03-17 14:23:09,,,,that is a trademark issue they are legally required to go after every single case of it or lose the trademark trademark is different from copyright disney gets hit with this alot because of their characters being trademarks themselves so every time a school puts up a muryal of mickey mouse and they find out they get a cease and desist and then a 0 cost licensee to use it I cant believe I am saying this about disney but in this case the laws legal requirements make them look like bigger asshole than they are,mi9ffi5,8.0,1jda4ok

comment,mi9i9sy,alidan,,2,2025-03-17 14:25:56,,,,im partially ok with life of creator some years personally so they benefit and then their family benefits I believe in leaving your family with what you have to make their lives better is a real thing in the case of video gamescorporates entities buying the rights away from the creator or its a mass effort under a corporation where its not one person im ok with 1425 years,mi9aoiy,6.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9zo5v,Downtown_Trash_8913,,1,2025-03-17 15:53:43,,,,A winery isnt a creative work though its a physical item Were specifically talking about intellectual property,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,miadgap,vyashole,,1,2025-03-17 16:59:55,,,,You should be allowed to inherit property You should not be allowed to inherit intellectual proprietary Ownership of intellectual property should be very limited like patents not virtually unlimited like copyright The current copyright term of lifetime 70 years or 95 years is just way too long for a society where information moves at the speed of light The original term of 1414 is more than enough for todays content creators Too much monopoly on copyright stifles creativity and hinders innovation,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok

comment,mi99tew,DrStrangererer,,-1,2025-03-17 13:39:46,,,,Real property should be inherited and taxed over a certain value say 1000000 to curtail nepotism Intellectual property should be held for a certain amount of time before it becomes public domain for the sake of art and humanity as a whole Its not complicated and is a well established rule throughout much of the world Maybe you just dont understand the difference between real property and intellectual property Its okay honey I bet theres a lot of things you dont understand Thats what you have smart people like me for though to explain it to you,mi972hx,5.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9dbxv,None,,0,2025-03-17 13:59:29,,,,The reason why its this long is because 14 years and then the product enters public domain is damaging to the original personcompany who made it Imagine you made a new superhero comic book aimed at children which is a stunning success In 14 years that comic book enters public domain and now your competitors can use your characters which creates confusion since then there will be different books with different plots and stories that do not interact with each other Thats like if there are 12 different Supermans all having same background and premise but entirely different execution If you want creative competition Encourage people to make Ultraman Not make Superman go public domain near instantly I am not a fan when companies gate keep old stuff but this is a case where I agree and think that intelligent property should not go public domain just because Tolkiens books and winery are valid comparisons and therefore Tolkiens grandchildren are the ones who should own the rights to LoTR so there wouldnt be millions of LoTR the XXX sequel by Brazzers that is posed as the sequel to the great Tolkiens books,mi99tew,6.0,1jda4ok

comment,mi9lgfx,DrStrangererer,,2,2025-03-17 14:42:29,,,,I literally said intellectual property should be held for a certain amount of time If 14 years is the standard thats fine by me I think it should maybe be longer like maybe 25 years Nothing Ive said denies that Your point is pointless Indefinitely timed ownership of intellectual property stifles creativity both by the owner and by new artists Disney buying and leaning into established IPs has seriously hamstrung their ability to create new and innovative stories Its cheaper easier and safer economically to pump out the same thing over and over Im tired of sequels to sequels of sequels Give me Atlantis or Treasure Planet not Star Wars Episode 69 or Avengers Rehashed Basic Slop Locking those IPs away from new artists indefinitely also drastically limits the pool of ideas they can draw from They certainly werent all good but look at the incredible stories that came out of the Star Wars EU when George Lucas was in control and allowed for that Imagine the incredible stories we could have now if Star Wars has gone public domain instead of being bought out by Disney Theoretically anybody could write whatever stories they wanted in the established universe including wild crossovers medieval Jedi whatever they wanted Then Lucas andor his estate could determine what is canon and not what fits into the Main story simply through the power of respect as the original artist I feel this would encourage him to write new characters and stories He would own the new storiescharacters and profit off them without owning the old characters and stories Or better yet create a new and original IP instead,mi9gu1k,9.0,1jda4ok
comment,mia66h4,None,,1,2025-03-17 16:25:11,,,,You just described why that would be a bad idea Star Wars legends was creative sure but it was inconsistent as hell In one novel Luke has children and in a second one he doesnt Say what you want about new canon but one thing that Disney did right is keep canon consistent And this leads to my main point When something hits public domain the franchise can be considered dead since then youll have different branches of non canonical bs that will be very hard for anyone to follow I love Star Wars and Avengers Id rather have them hire better writers than make these stories public domain and sit through reddit to see what is worth reading and what isnt because I dont have the time to sit through and consume every single Avengers story where Ant Man goes inside Thanos asshole and uses fork to kill him If I want to read cheesy sequels Ill open Wattpad On the other hand Gatekeeping characters from Star WarsAvengers makes people create their own characters which can be inspired by the source material but often times it develops into its own thing Invincible and The Boys This is even better as people will literally be forced to make brand new IPs instead of relying on the publics love for Iron Man to sell Iron Man and Sonichu,mi9lgfx,10.0,1jda4ok

comment,miahuij,None,,0,2025-03-17 17:21:07,,,,You cannot advocate for creative new ideas and at the same time advocate for ideas to go public after short wait time so that these creative writing people could write such creative works of fiction using characters somebody else made If someone is truly creative They will make Invincible without needing Superman to go public domain This isnt sucking corporate boot This is removing the boot out of your ass and looking at things logically,miado24,12.0,1jda4ok

comment,mi9evaw,SnowingSilently,,91,2025-03-17 14:07:56,,,,It seems like it might have been an issue from the very beginning The TASBot team was not the first group to notice this kind of audio inconsistency in the SNES In the early 2000s some emulator developers found that certain lateera SNES games dont run correctly when the emulators Digital Signal Processor DSP sample rate is set to the Nintendospecified value of precisely 32000 Hz a number derived from the speed of the APU clock Developers tested actual hardware at the time and found that the DSP was actually running at 32040 Hz and that setting the emulated DSP to run at that specific rate suddenly fixed the misbehaving commercial games Developers intentionally wrote their code expecting a higher clock speed than the spec While it doesnt confirm it outright theres a good chance it was due to the heating issue,mi9c4pu,1.0,1jda4ok

comment,mipby0r,midsummernightstoker,,0,2025-03-19 22:58:59,,,,They had difficulties because the SNES hardware is unreliable Of course its related to the console It doesnt matter if normal users notice the issues or not The existence of issues means the system is unreliable Heres your problem You are saying both Normal users cant notice the issues There arent issues Both statements cant be true Trying to argue both simultaneously is why youre getting so upset over this Be kind to your mind and use logic and reason instead,mip8w8u,16.0,1jda4ok
comment,mipckq1,Dazed4Dayzs,,1,2025-03-19 23:02:19,,,,The unrelated thirdparty software has nothing to do with the reliability of the console Ive explained reliability to you Ive explained how the console works reliably I have explained with quotes from the devs themselves I have explained the context of the commenter I was responding to and how their assumption was incorrect Im done listening to your nonsense and lies You will never learn,mipby0r,17.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9n8al,wrathek,,8,2025-03-17 14:51:32,,,,It was always like this If youd read the article youd even see that some games were coded based on a faster clock speed so that the audio would sound correct,mi9c4pu,1.0,1jda4ok
comment,mib13if,antpile11,,4,2025-03-17 18:52:40,,,,The article also mentions that the clock speeds they found through their recent survey found that theyre even higher than that and higher than what was found in the early 00s which is why they think they could be speeding up,mi9n8al,2.0,1jda4ok
comment,mihzzqs,Dear_Watson,,1,2025-03-18 20:23:33,,,,Old electronics can last functionally forever as long as nothing degrades I have many electronics that are 50 years old and still function the exact same way they did 50 years ago Problems mostly happen if something had a defect or design flaw however long ago that never got caught or fixed which is what seems to be the case here with the SNES Likely it wont affect all of them but it will likely be a nonnegligible amount that start to develop similar issues around the same age usually from the same batch of parts,mi9c4pu,1.0,1jda4ok

comment,mia3w0k,FlyingBishop,,11,2025-03-17 16:14:09,,,,The APU is running faster The problem is deeper than just the audio running slightly faster Also its running faster than spec and based on the evidence I am suspicious that any SNES actually ever had an APU that was as slow as the spec since I dont think they found any and also games dont work with the specced frequency,mi9b4xu,1.0,1jda4ok
comment,migcaan,No-Problem49,,1,2025-03-18 15:43:44,,,,The games running faster too its been known for a while in speed running community that you can cheat a speedrun on snes hardware by using a heatgun on the correct spot on an snes I dont know if normal usage enough to make a difference but with enough heat in the right spot the game will run faster,mi9b4xu,1.0,1jda4ok

comment,miaem4b,Mezmorizor,,9,2025-03-17 17:05:27,,,,I wouldnt exactly call resonators that took 30 years to degrade cheap or unreliable but yes this is a good example of why you need emulation Electronics usually have a lifetime of 15 years and the old consoles will absolutely become paperweights only suitable for museum displays,,0.0,1jda4ok
comment,mic4nfb,Jiopaba,,2,2025-03-17 22:04:49,,,,Some of the older data on this suggests people were aware of this as early as 2000 or so More importantly Ive yet to see any evidence of anybody finding even one of these things that actually ran exactly at spec anywhere It seems like they all ran very slightly fast relative to the spec,miaem4b,1.0,1jda4ok

comment,mig144d,heckfyre,,2,2025-03-18 14:49:00,,,,I love that this problem is really only affecting the speedrunners In my mind it sort of creates a new challenge for speedrunners since the game isnt guaranteed to be perfectly matched from run to run Makes it a lot more interesting if you ask me,,0.0,1jda4ok

comment,miaoeow,8funnydude,,2,2025-03-17 17:52:05,,,,Ah That explains a lot I have an earlymodel SNES that I have fully recapped upgraded the voltage regulator and bought a quality Triad power supply for And yet I STILL have audio issues The left audio channel likes to make poppy staticy sounds The pops occur when loading into a level and the static fades in and out depending on whats happening I thought that maybe the APU chip is failing but now Ill have to take a look at this ceramic resonator,,0.0,1jda4ok
comment,mijmlh8,AkirIkasu,,1,2025-03-19 01:29:09,,,,That isnt the kind of problems that this resonator would cause The resonator exists to clock the DSP and speeding it up will make it ever so slighly higher in pitch What you are describing is analog noise coming from RF interference somewhere around the analog portion of the circuitry Perhaps in your repairs you bent or damaged some of the shielding or perhaps one of the power smoothing capacitors youve replaced are not good quality Theres a lot of things that can cause that kind of noise and some of it could be from the factory to begin with Youll need to do some probing with an osciliscope to find out where the problem lays,miaoeow,1.0,1jda4ok
comment,mijtl8t,8funnydude,,1,2025-03-19 02:09:23,,,,Nope went over it all with a finetoothed comb and found no damage whatsoever the capacitors I used came from a Console5 recap kit The audio issue is still present before and after the repair job Also its worth mentioning that the audio issue only occurs after the console has warmed up I ran a burnin test for several hours and the APU passed each time No idea what else it could be but considering the price of an oscilloscope Im better off just selling the SNES and emulating it instead,mijmlh8,2.0,1jda4ok
comment,mik1484,AkirIkasu,,1,2025-03-19 02:54:57,,,,You dont need to buy a good osciliscope You can get good enough ones off of aliexpress for around 80 Since the sound you are hearing is in the audible frequency you dont need to buy anything particularly high resolution as even the 1MHz cheapies can handle it,mijtl8t,3.0,1jda4ok

comment,mi9nps7,Ionovarcis,,4,2025-03-17 14:54:01,,,,I feel like any time 2 years after the console is no longer being produced available new and its open game New editions get their own timelines if theres any significant transformative work or sustain their timeline if theres just new edition changes Virtual console would protect most games for the consoles lifespan 2 years in the new digital download climate imo The issue with legal game sharing versus illegal becomes impossible to distinguish since many games arent even available with physical media or DRM free software if I want to share some switch games or PC games I need to share a whole library access to that library Sure pirating isnt just borrowing a copy from a kid at school but theres gotta be a middle ground option that isnt more subscriptions or other BS,,0.0,1jda4ok
comment,mibe1yt,maazen,,3,2025-03-17 19:54:23,,,,as kids in school we just made sure everyone gets a different game and borrowed them across so in a sense we did have a shared library oh and of course rentals from blockbuster etc,mi9nps7,1.0,1jda4ok

comment,mikd5ug,trainbrain27,,1,2025-03-19 04:19:14,,,,Thankfully its only a problem when people hook up another computer to play games frame perfect The fraction of a percent variation in speed which is within the spec for the resonator as built makes it difficult or impossible for Tool Assisted Speed Runs to perfectly match the game when the APU isnt constant between different SNES or even the same one at different temperatures The article says some original games were programmed to run on hardware that was a tenth of a percent faster then the documentation It definitely doesnt affect humans playing normally,,0.0,1jda4ok

comment,mia4tu1,FlyingBishop,,1,2025-03-17 16:18:41,,,,In fairness the article is pretty technical I would guess that a majority of English speakers wouldnt understand the distinction between the APU is running fast and the SNES is running fast even after reading every word of the article,mi93qqt,2.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9fd7e,SnowingSilently,,1,2025-03-17 14:10:37,,,,The one part Im confused on is why the Audio Processing Unit matters much for a TAS Is it because the code execution sequentially needs the audio to run or something,mi93qqt,2.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9odxn,error521,,2,2025-03-17 14:57:26,,,,Im kinda talking out of my ass a little here but audio doesnt necessarily work completely separate from everything else A game might wait for an audio cue to finish before doing something for example And I could imagine it affecting loading times as well If a game loads 01 seconds faster because the audio is loaded in quicker that can completely throw off a TAS,mi9fd7e,3.0,1jda4ok
comment,miarvj4,SnowingSilently,,1,2025-03-17 18:08:36,,,,My thoughts were that you should only need to send data to the APU to get the audio to play so it should be asynchronous But if its waiting on the audio to finish and thus it would be synchronous that would make a lot of sense I wouldnt have thought of designing an audio chip that way but theres probably a good reason,mi9odxn,4.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9jkh7,alidan,,-2,2025-03-17 14:32:43,,,,if I have to guess its almost purely for autism reasons there have been points where if you repaired an arcade system that disqualified it from being used for a record attempt,mi9fd7e,3.0,1jda4ok
comment,mi9mxzb,MimeTravler,,2,2025-03-17 14:50:05,,,,I know nothing about this issue but enjoy speedruns and have autism so I feel I can weigh in lol The problem I can see with your example of the arcade machines is if one was repaired with new parts and the rest werent it would be like racers all driving a stock 2013 while you just replaced the engine in yours It might not make a huge difference but yours will run better even if its a small amount and thats an advantage when we are talking about records that get broken by milliseconds,mi9jkh7,4.0,1jda4ok
