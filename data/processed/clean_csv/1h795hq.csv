comment,m0l0mp0,FlintStoneOran,,15,2024-12-05 19:07:28,,,,Just a PSA if you have a graphics card with VirtualLink USB C port then you dont even need the adapter at all you just plug it straight into the graphics card You just need to get the PSVR2 software from steam and a compatible Bluetooth adapter for the controllers I believe the port is present in the Nvidia GeForce 20 Series cards Tested and working myself with my sisters 2080ti,m0jub6l,3.0,1h795hq

comment,m0txxiz,FlintStoneOran,,1,2024-12-07 06:12:32,,,,Might be some other stores near you that have it I know my local tech stores all still have stock And the DisplayPort shouldnt be an issue because you have multiple ports in the back of the GPU so you leave the HDMI plugged in to your monitor and GPU and you just plug the DisplayPort cable into one of the other ports on the GPU and run it to the adapter It effectively is just like plugging in a second display and doesnt interfere with your existing setup,m0s29hn,9.0,1h795hq
comment,m0u4b2z,Da1witdamstrplan,,1,2024-12-07 07:16:38,,,,Maybe I can run an hdmi to display port cable Or will it drop performance because of the cable,m0txxiz,10.0,1h795hq

comment,m0k7an1,alidan,,-4,2024-12-05 16:38:16,,,,my understanding is with vr and modern lenses is the way we need to scale vr to be 11 is a 150 scaling little more complex but thats about what it takes,m0jz5y6,5.0,1h795hq

comment,m0k2ghb,-Agathia-,,8,2024-12-05 16:13:16,,,,Just have to buy the adapter Thats the thing though Ive been trying to get one in the past month Not a single one available in Canada All shops are out of stock and we cant order for later It just feels like its been released without any production going after the initial release I wish Sony liked money but it seems they do everything in their power to fuck it up sometimes PSVR2 released with no games because PSVR1 games are NOT supported None of them Remapping controls should be extremely easy for 99 of them but nope PC adapter No HDR no eye tracking no bluetooth included in the adapter just leading to confusion Its always half assed its insane I want it because my current PC headset one is slowly dying,m0jub6l,3.0,1h795hq
comment,m0l6v15,wolfwings,,7,2024-12-05 19:39:25,,,,The adapter is nothing but a USB 30 hub that merges two DisplayPort lines in for a specific USB 3x alt mode in basically the old VirtualLink setup The old VirtualLink USBC 2000series RTX cards work without an adapter at all in fact And despite what Sony claims most folks dont need a separate bluetooth adapter If you have a laptop The builtin bluetooth has a FAR better antenna than their recommended microadapters and even most desktops a lot of motherboards support wifi bluetooth directly and again the included antenna will work far better For once they actually went with industry standards instead of propietary but then the standards body discontinued it out from under them after theyd already taped out the new tech But there are a LOT of thirdparty PC adapters out now when I look since it turns out the adapter is painfully simple,m0k2ghb,4.0,1h795hq
comment,m0ljo7v,PM_ME_YOUR__INIT__,,7,2024-12-05 20:46:26,,,,I have an RTX2070 with USBC in the back and just bought PSVR2 and Half Life Alyx for when I can get the adapter You may have just saved a ton of time,m0l6v15,5.0,1h795hq
comment,m0nk7g8,wolfwings,,2,2024-12-06 03:46:49,,,,Yup you get to skip the adapter entirely Go through the normal setup process in the PS VR2 app in Steam but just skip forward when it tells you about the adapter and when it says to plug your headset into the adapter Plug it into the VirtualLink port instead There is a bug in older PSVR2 firmwares that dont work out of the box with all VirtualLink ports especially NVidia due to a bug on NVidias side so you might need to find a PS5 to plug into briefly to update the firmware on the headset if the one you get has the really old firmware Also one caveat Ive encountered with the PSVR2 which others run into After running SteamVR I lose my mouse cursor on the right half of my primary monitor If that happens to you WinCtrlShiftB itll restart your GPU driver which fixes the issue,m0ljo7v,6.0,1h795hq
comment,m0mm1kp,AppropriateTouching,,1,2024-12-06 00:18:13,,,,That game is so good I hope you get to play it soon,m0ljo7v,6.0,1h795hq
comment,m0l4bb9,aman27deep,,2,2024-12-05 19:26:18,,,,Very true I havent been able to find an adapter anywhere so I havent purchased it yet even though the discounted price is attractive right now I only plan to play on PC as I dont have a PS5,m0k2ghb,4.0,1h795hq
comment,m0mlufn,AppropriateTouching,,1,2024-12-06 00:17:02,,,,As an owner of an oculus rift I feel for you on the dying part mine works 1 out of 20 times because the cable and usb drivers are shit and support could not give less of a shit,m0k2ghb,4.0,1h795hq
