comment,moz5ta6,jimgolgari,,3,2025-04-25 14:33:19,,,,Ok but thats software as a service At work I use 3 of those off hand I think thats a great business model when it is presented to the customer that way from the beginning So should all software be SaaS Including video games If so I suppose thats fine but then call it an annual license not ownership,moz2wu9,9.0,1k73140
comment,moz7qsa,Phoenix__Light,,-3,2025-04-25 14:42:47,,,,Its a free country If the people who make the game decide on it theyre within their rights to do so If you dont like the model youre within your rights to simply not purchase the game And if people crack and pirate it theyre also within their rights to come after them Just because you feel like something shouldnt be SaaS doesnt mean that youre legally justified to steal it This is delusional thinking,moz5ta6,10.0,1k73140
comment,mozdzbk,jimgolgari,,2,2025-04-25 15:13:07,,,,And I think selling someone something under false pretenses is fraud If its a license call it a license If its a subscription call it a subscription If I own a copy of Charlie Brown Christmas on Prime but then they sell exclusive rights to Apple and I shrug and buy it again and then they make it Apple with subscription only Ive been duped I was told by 2 separate companies that I own the rights to stream that content as the owner of that copy I have over the last 2 years begun focusing more on buying physical media and my son and I have been collecting a pretty significant collection of vintage game consoles cartridges and discs Everyone should vote with their wallet but companies selling in good faith would be a great start,moz7qsa,11.0,1k73140

comment,movtwjq,Statharas,,20,2025-04-25 00:06:11,,,,Technically it is the publisher who decides to go physical or not Otherwise they may choose to put down a key within the game card that will redeem in your account Or at least thats what I am understanding,movruws,3.0,1k73140
comment,movv0t6,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,16,2025-04-25 00:12:34,,,,Correct its a cryptographic key to unlock a downloaded game and play it on the system youre using Difference is you can download that game to any system you own or that someone else owns they just need that key card to play it It is very similar to oldschool days where youd let your friend or someone borrow your GBA or DS cartridge game for a while and then you wouldnt be able to play it until they were done with it Exact same system just now the game data is downloaded digitally Key card inserted to play the game pull out the key card and give it to someone else for them to download then play Its honestly kinda genius But still the game no longer resides on the key card itself which is highly infuriating for game archivists and some reverse engineer enthusiasts and folks that like to enjoy owning a full copy of the game data itself in their hands,movtwjq,4.0,1k73140
comment,mow1g6l,hyperforms9988,,11,2025-04-25 00:49:07,,,,Thats the thing I love this idea for digital games If Switch 2 was digital only fine Its not so Im in a weird spot now where I see myself not buying a lot of games that I otherwise wouldve bought if they had the game on the cart If Nintendo insists on putting their games on the carts I guess that means even more sales than they already get from me Its not the same as Steam Ive had Steam for like 20 years The library is still what it is PCs dont change generations and theres no concept of losing access to games because previous generations of games reside in shops that are no longer online so you cant redownload something you bought Backwards compatibility is pretty good too about the only thing you have to worry about are really old games that want older OSes and weird shit like that Im comfortable buying shit on Steam as a result plus you kind of dont have a choice for PCs anyway Physical media for PC died out a long time ago,movv0t6,5.0,1k73140

comment,moz2qif,hyperforms9988,,1,2025-04-25 14:18:02,,,,You still need some method of actually downloading the game if you dont already have the data for it Thats in theory not always going to be around Id feel more comfortable about it if they would just stick to the same infrastructure OS whatever from now to infinity so its always one store one place etc and we dont have these generations that are like a hard reset I hope thats the direction that things are going in for everybody Switch 2 makes that promising so far We wont know what that looks like until the next generation or two Quite honestly the only thing thats going to get me to fully adopt digital on console is the death of physical media I hope by then we have that kind of shit in place where your library just travels with you from generation to generation and a game you bought 15 years ago just works on the console youre playing now I get that physical media has this same problem where you need the older console connected and plugged in to play it but Im saying if digital is going to have the same restrictions and more than physical does then I have no real incentive to buy digital and so I generally dont for consoles Thats a little different for Switch because its portable and you have to think about carrying carts with you thats finally a positive thing for digital and it makes the desirability for digital go up for me as a result I dont want to carry carts with me all the time and so smaller games Im willing to buy digital to have a library of stuff that just lives on the console Another positive for digital with Switch 2 is that finally its looking like some carts will be more expensive than their digital counterparts and so theres now a pricing incentive that generally didnt used to be there While this is a fringe case we now have Ubisoft ripping The Crew out of peoples digital libraries Sony has ripped movies and TV shows out of peoples libraries The idea bothers me and if physical media still exists thats what Ill prefer probably right up to its death But like again real physical media and not what these game key cards are The data is on the cart I can play it off the cart I dont need an online connection or service or whatever the fuck to play it or download the rest of it or whatever and thats it,moymaqr,11.0,1k73140

comment,mow0hev,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,7,2025-04-25 00:43:35,,,,Game card can be redeemed an infinite amount of times as far as we all understand In a nutshell its a hybrid version of a digital game Its for games that are too big to fit in 64GB Switch 2 cards like Eldin Ring and probably the annual Call of Duty release or for indie devs and publishers that cannot afford producing full Switch 2 cards this option is much cheaper for indie devs to put their games on physical store shelves instead,movzmip,6.0,1k73140
comment,mox9r26,StrawHat89,,2,2025-04-25 05:36:38,,,,At this point its clearly just for any game a publisher doesnt want to pay for a real game card The only game that exceeds 64 GB right now is Split Fiction at over 70 Cyberpunk is the second largest at 59 GB and IS on a Game Card while virtually no other 3rd party game is,mow0hev,7.0,1k73140

comment,mozz18b,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,1,2025-04-25 16:55:04,,,,Oh I agree with you Id rather have the whole game on the card itself like what CDPR is doing with Cyberpunk for the Switch 2 Its frustrating but beyond a coordinated boycott Im not sure this would stop Every console manufacturer now allows this Its like trying to stop a tidal wave,moy9vaa,8.0,1k73140
comment,mp4phkj,BitingSatyr,,1,2025-04-26 11:37:27,,,,This is to cut production cost You say this as though its not an extremely important factor youre ignoring in this Estimates have put the 64GB game card at something like 15 so presumably a 128GB card would be even more expensive A publisher only recoups about 4050 of a physical games retail price and adding an extra 20 to manufacturing costs actually does have a measurable impact on the economics of making games,moy9vaa,8.0,1k73140

comment,movdy32,mrwho995,,54,2025-04-24 22:37:27,,,,For me whether this is a good or bad thing comes down to how developers respond to it My understanding is that it was pretty rare for 3rd party developers to have physical releases on Switch often resorting to download codes in boxes If this means those same developers are now using game cards over download codes or digital only then its a definite improvement given the cards can be lent and resold If it means developers who previously did physics not are moving to key cards obivously thats a big loss Unless theres info Im not aware of I think its too early to say whether this is a good or bad thing,mouvxuw,1.0,1k73140

comment,moy9121,XTornado,,1,2025-04-25 11:18:11,,,,Yeah and that is the same with the code ones The idea is that if we change the code ones with key cartridges is a win The issue is publishers start switching cartridges to key cartridges then we have a problem In the ideal world only cartridges with the game inside would be the only way unfortunately that will not happen Plus even if that was the case with the current state of affairs there is always updates you need that sometimes never get added to a cartridge At the end PC GOG or PC CRACKED,mox02ih,3.0,1k73140

comment,movsji6,Aritra319,,8,2025-04-24 23:58:26,,,,The download code is redeemed and the game gets added to your account Meaning you can only do this once The key cards are instead physical keys to access a digital version of the game You still have to download it but the card otherwise works like a card would Think of them as a game disc for PS or Xbox that needs a giant day one patch to run Its mainly a way to cut costs Especially if a game is large Its also pretty much a no brainer for games with a large online or full live service game like Monster Hunter where the game gets patched so much the initial data on the card becomes irrelevant after a while anyway,movnukl,3.0,1k73140

comment,movegn1,Feraligreater328,,-8,2025-04-24 22:40:17,,,,Not trying to sow negativity 80 and 70 are both ridiculous The gaming industry in general is getting greedy as hell Higher prices for less content these days with several notable exceptions of course Titles that appear to have a lot to do like Mario Kart World Id pay more for But the general increase in price is frustrating and makes me want to buy games less,movdw70,4.0,1k73140

comment,mov6ig1,Sir_Bax,,3,2025-04-24 21:56:21,,,,I think the point is to have a token you can sell 3rd party publishers already used digital code in physical editions which was one time use and locked to your account after use This is honestly a way better option Especially when Nintendo wants to stick with their expensive to produce cartridges anything above 64 32 GB gets pretty costly and even 64 32 GB cost them that much that they priced TotK which use it 10 higher Thats unfortunately too small for modern AAA games So between going full digital with code only and this Ill pick this Of course full physical would be better,mouyzfz,3.0,1k73140
comment,movs1lf,Chubby_Bub,,2,2025-04-24 23:55:37,,,,TotK is nowhere near 64 GB its like 16 They priced it higher because its Zelda and people would still buy it And they did the game still sold 10M copies in three days So 100M more just from that,mov6ig1,4.0,1k73140
comment,moxi6a0,Sir_Bax,,2,2025-04-25 06:55:42,,,,You are right I remember it incorrectly 16 GB is still relatively cheap and price hike starts at 32 GB which is what TOTK uses 64 GB is even more expensive and therefore not used at all yet now that I checked it again Even more crazy as its very hard to imagine many Switch 2 AAAs fitting into 16 GB Thanks for the correction,movs1lf,5.0,1k73140
comment,moy3umd,Chubby_Bub,,2,2025-04-25 10:35:55,,,,Yeah TotK is just over 16 GB but I think thats after optimization because I remember they originally listed it as 18 and suddenly changed it So they probably had to use the 32 GB cartridges either way,moxi6a0,6.0,1k73140
comment,movzvfv,shifty_coder,,1,2025-04-25 00:40:01,,,,No the point of the gamekey cards is to allow retail store sale of games that are larger than the storage capacity of the current game cards 64GB Yes you have to download the digital version of the game but you can go to Walmart and buy the game with cash download it play it to your hearts content and then resell it Much better than the digital redemption codes you can get for current systems imo,mouyzfz,3.0,1k73140

comment,moxfih8,green_link,,1,2025-04-25 06:29:49,,,,i havent seen anyone mention this so i will i think the point of these gamekey cards is to try to block or prevent rippingdumping the game data ROM from the cart itself for the longest time to pirate a game you just ripped the data off the cart or disc and that has been true for every nintendo console up to this point since the switch2 carts are basically the same as switch1 i could see the migdumper being updated to support switch2 carts so physically not having the game data on the cart is the best way to prevent people from rippingdumping the cart and game developers are of course going to flock to this as they want to protect their games and yes i know if you modify your console you can just use it to ripdump the games or even just copy the downloaded games to a USB drive but right now there is no software or hardware mod or exploit for the switch2 so far im also not saying i like it or agree with them im just trying to understand where nintendo and developers are coming from,,0.0,1k73140

comment,mow0oqs,Beefygaybro,,-1,2025-04-25 00:44:46,,,,Idk man I keep seeing all these Nintendo posts but none of my gamer buddies are serious about getting a switch 2 Not even the casual lets all get together and play Mario kart buddies I got suspiciously downvoted for just calling out how Nintendo has had flops in the past before Still think very few ppl are gonna buy this Were already in a recession,,0.0,1k73140

comment,mqkmpz4,gman5852,,1,2025-05-04 17:59:20,,,,Theyre comething because what you described makes absolutely zero sense Theres zero connection between game key cards and piracy nothing about piracy is solved by key cards and nothing about key cards is actually unique from an online license check in terms of security Youre also ignoring that physical games still exist on switch 2 and digital game sales so clearly devs arent concerned about using this as a security measure You just made up a connection from two unrelated topics and combined them while ignoring the real reason Nintendo only providing 64 GB cartridges and devs not wanting to pay that cost Of course youre going to get down voted,mp1gd3m,1.0,1k73140

comment,movgb0i,dannyb_prodigy,,-8,2025-04-24 22:50:27,,,,Lets be perfectly clear here no one has played a game directly off physical media in well over 10 years Ever since patches and dlc became a thing for console releases people have been playing off of the most recent version thats been downloaded to their device Its not even that notable that the physical media requires a download before letting you play Certain games usually ones with some form of online functionality because interoperability concerns have had lockouts on the version on cart that require the most recent patch to be downloaded before use Super Smash Bros 3DS for example Basically the fact that there is no game data on game carts now is a distinction without a difference from the way youve been playing games for a good while now,,0.0,1k73140
comment,movj3s2,EvilTaffyapple,,6,2025-04-24 23:06:03,,,,This is just utter nonsense 93 of all gaming media is playable from the cartridge cd directly Its literally being tracked on gaming sites,movgb0i,1.0,1k73140
comment,movndbr,dannyb_prodigy,,-8,2025-04-24 23:29:38,,,,Read what I wrote Even though it has been possible to play a game off the cartridge directly very few people do play off the cartridge directly How many people actually hit that No thank you button when they are told an update is available for whatever game they are booting up Maybe me saying no one plays games off physical media is hyperbolic but its patently absurd to think the majority of people playing video games nowadays are running unpatched versions of their games as they existed on the cart on day 0,movj3s2,2.0,1k73140
