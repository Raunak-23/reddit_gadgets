comment,lvdam2e,Aleyla,,166,2024-11-04 16:27:33,,,,Why These seemed to be a solid entry for those of us not wanting to give our left kidney so our 8 year olds could play fortnite,,0.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvdfz0f,ThorAsskicker,,95,2024-11-04 16:54:20,,,,They probably lost too much money with that CPU fiasco earlier this year and need to cut costs,lvdam2e,1.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvdltxy,PhabioRants,,72,2024-11-04 17:22:49,,,,Thats exactly why The GPU die size shows they were expecting 4090 performance What they actually got was 4050 performance and billions in sunk cost for less than 5 marketshare then followed it up with 200series CPUs worse than 12th gen Furthermore their behind the scenes wizardry requires Intel CPUs to pair with to actually extract their GPU features and no one in their right mind is paying 50 more for worse performance and efficiency with shorter socket lifespan vs AMD right now Intel is hemorrhaging money and discrete GPUs are not something theyre known for so its an easy amputation The US government just declared Intel Too Big To Fail which means they expect Intel is in jeopardy of folding entirely at this point Its possible the decision to axe discrete ARC isnt even theirs to make,lvdam2e,1.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvhh8b0,dertechie,,9,2024-11-05 06:40:16,,,,Yeah Intel has basically just demonstrated why no one challenges NVidia on that front except AMD who already has a pipeline You need billions to blow on getting it off the ground You need to get drivers together You need to produce them by the millions work out the kinks and iterate just to get to a solid third place where you have a good enough reputation to barely make profit per card If you dont have a pipeline to do this youre looking at years of work to get it going Intel wasnt starting from zero they have years of experience with integrated graphics to leverage but those dont have the same pressures They didnt even do badly they just dont have another few tens of billions to throw at it to get to something thats properly competitive,lvdltxy,2.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvjtat5,Hour_Reindeer834,,1,2024-11-05 17:03:53,,,,Kinda off topic but its kind of sad in an age where we have access to so much knowledge technology and resources in many ways its harder than ever to try to create something from the ground up on your own On the flip side of that these companies are having record profits and valuations and are cutting employees but I always hear about how this or that endeavor is too expensive or hard to do These companies should have enough wealth to run years at a loss,lvhh8b0,3.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvlfgoy,theGoddamnAlgorath,,1,2024-11-05 21:45:53,,,,Oh man you really need to check out how the stock market has murdered these companies Everyone buys on credit pays late and just enough liquidity to pay this month We really just need to burn it all down at this point interstate banking along with MMT has ruined us again,lvjtat5,4.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvxhnbb,CatProgrammer,,2,2024-11-07 17:33:41,,,,interstate banking Sorry I shouldnt be able to withdraw my money in a different state from where I deposited it Or invest in things in furtheraway places And MMT is about how the government adds and removes money tofrom the economy doesnt seem directly relevant to the stock market,lvlfgoy,5.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lw19wvm,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-11-08 05:41:40,,,,The GPU die size shows they were expecting 4090 performance What they actually got was 4050 performance Wait wtf How do you use that much silicon and that much worse performance Seriously asking how its not like their silicon processes are that far behind right,lvdltxy,2.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lw249so,PhabioRants,,1,2024-11-08 10:43:47,,,,Thats what Intel thought too Turns out you cant just scale up whatever they were doing for integrated and be done with it Obviously theyve clawed some back with drivers Theyre around about 4060 performance for raster now and their encode and decode is exceptional and their LLM performance isnt bad for the price either which is little surprise given how much compute there ought to be in them Im not a hardware engineer so I cant pretend to understand how they missed the mark by as much as they did but the die size on the 750770 suggests their silicon cost per card is at or possibly over what theyre selling finished products for We knew they were going to have to take some pain and Im sure Intel knew that as well but all evidence suggests they were looking to swing with the 7900s and the like,lw19wvm,3.0,1gjhr1y

comment,lvege16,Aleyla,,7,2024-11-04 19:51:52,,,,Sorry I feel like Im missing something I know the GPU isnt top of the line but it performed just fine while having the cheapest price point out there How does this lead to a product being pulled,lvdg3kw,2.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lveujx0,CanisLupus92,,20,2024-11-04 21:01:18,,,,They priced it according to its performance but the A770 is close to the same die size as a 4090 meaning it costs about the same to produce NVidia and AMD can get significantly more cards from a single wafer at that priceperformance level,lvege16,3.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvewj8v,Aleyla,,3,2024-11-04 21:11:06,,,,Ok That makes a ton of sense Thank you,lveujx0,4.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvejxcs,Recktion,,8,2024-11-04 20:09:13,,,,Intel GPU design costs lots of money makes little money They need many years of losses to have a chance to catch up Intel CPU design is doing bad but not way behind AMD much easier to take the lead there Intel foundry is losing billions of dollars a month trying to catch up to TSMC and arguably should be there next year They have to cauterize the losses somehow GPU is the furthest from turning a profit so makes the most sense to take the axe to them Theyre spending 2x their revenue right now Intel has been trying to fix over a decade of mismanagement with massive spending in the last couple of years to catch up,lvege16,3.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvdza8a,Nyther53,,3,2024-11-04 18:27:56,,,,Because making those GPUs almost certainly cost Intel money which means its not up to them if they make them or not especially not with the rest of their business hurting so badly Theyre bleeding out,lvdam2e,1.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvf328z,im_thatoneguy,,2,2024-11-04 21:44:01,,,,Because you can play a game like Fortnite just fine on an integrated graphics chip built into the CPU And if you want more you want a maxed out top of the line GPU that can do pathtraced raytracing and 4k resolution,lvdam2e,1.0,1gjhr1y

comment,lvea1w8,One_Minute_Reviews,,17,2024-11-04 19:20:30,,,,Hindsight is 2020 but intel hiring AmDs failed leader to lead their brand new gpu initiative felt like a pretty bad business decision,,0.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvecz39,ArseBurner,,20,2024-11-04 19:35:00,,,,Raja catches a lot of flack for Vega but some of ATIAMDs greatest hits have his name on them He was the principal architect behind the ATI R300 that was used in legendary GPUs like the 9700 Pro More recently RDNA2 was also his baby Sources R300 RDNA2,lvea1w8,1.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvf11oe,nipsen,,2,2024-11-04 21:33:51,,,,Its more that it always seemed like he wanted to work for Intel to make the powerhungry useless underperforming gpus that Intel always will spend money developing Meanwhile that all of the actually good products AMD have made recently have been resurrected old concepts that were put on ice up towards 2015 is not exactly a secret,lvecz39,2.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvjiceq,mockingbird-,,1,2024-11-05 16:10:30,,,,More recently RDNA2 was also his baby The guy left 4 years earlier but you want to give the guy credit instead of the people who works on the product until release,lvecz39,2.0,1gjhr1y
comment,lvnr0kd,ArseBurner,,1,2024-11-06 06:00:38,,,,If you read the article the package was sent to him from his former colleagues at AMD Radeon Group Its the people who worked on RDNA who are giving him credit for it From the article Koduri left his top position at the Radeon Technology Group back in 2017 following a short sabbatical from the role in the days following Vegas launch It was always said that the Navi architecture before we knew it as RDNA was Koduris pet project so perhaps its only fitting that the nowIntel GPU engineer would receive an RDNA 2 card in the mail GPU architectures take years to develop and engineers are often working on projects far ahead of what the public are running on or even have knowledge of Take the Infinity Cache within the latest RDNA 2 graphics cards for example During an AMD engineering roundtable ahead of launch last year Sam Naffziger product technology architect explains that this new innovation had been in the works at RTG for at least three years before we ever caught whiff of it,lvjiceq,3.0,1gjhr1y
