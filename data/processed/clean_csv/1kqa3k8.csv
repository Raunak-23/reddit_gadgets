comment,mt53fva,LupusDeusMagnus,,275,2025-05-19 16:01:11,,,,This generation of consoles got 16 GB of unified memory so usually 12 GB of memory dedicated to video Developers work with that in mind too,mt4wn5m,1.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt646o1,LupusDeusMagnus,,137,2025-05-19 18:59:51,,,,Realistically its 1012 of VRAM and 46 of RAM Remember that console OSs wont need as much ram because they arent generalist like desktop OS they arent running as many background processes and all that then you can switch between RAM and VRAM as needed but its 100 focused on the game with a few add ons screen recording for recaps achievements etc Then consoles are a known platform so theres a bunch of tricks and optimisations to get the most of the hardware Thats why you pay a premium for console gaming and accept the limitations of a walled garden lawn jail because despite all this devs have to conform to you not the other way around like in PC gaming,mt61dl3,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7lm91,iShockah,,25,2025-05-19 23:43:45,,,,I would not say 500700 for a console is a premium when compared to a gaming PC that can run the same specs I switched from console to PC for the majority of my gaming sometime in 2016ish but I still see the appeal of a machine that costs 600 and can run AAA titles at 60 fps reliably while looking pretty darn good There is no set of computer components that you could buy new from a retailer for that price and achieve that level of reliable performance Consoles are not the premium gaming experience PCs are,mt646o1,4.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt846cl,Moregaze,,7,2025-05-20 01:37:31,,,,Kinda bs Any game that is running native 60fps on a PS5 is using upscaling You can do the same on PC cheaply as well Now actual native 4 K at 60fps with no upscaling is not happening on anything but 8bit titles on consoles Everything else is rendering at 1080p or lower and using the upscaler,mt7lm91,5.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt8yqmi,SolidOshawott,,3,2025-05-20 05:18:48,,,,Youre exaggerating There are plenty of games from just a few years ago running native 4K60 with updates And many new games run at 1440p or 1800p 60fps,mt846cl,6.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt8j7xd,TehOwn,,-3,2025-05-20 03:15:55,,,,The buyin for PC is definitely more but keeping up with or even exceeding consoles is pretty costeffective if not basically on par with consoles The main area where consoles have us beat is in the resell value of games consoles PC games are effectively purely digital and nontransferable and the value of secondhand PCs is pretty dire GPUs have been an exception lately but only due to the supply issues,mt846cl,6.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt8sga9,Moregaze,,3,2025-05-20 04:26:09,,,,Most of the buyin moves with you So storage case accessories etc all move forward CPU and mobo if you buy right will last 48 years before an upgrade becomes necessary Back in the day generational leaps were massive but that is no longer the case A 12700k is not that far off a 14700k or the AMD equivalent skews The graphics card is pretty much the only 5year upgrade that you HAVE to do but that is only for Triple AAA high resolution max quality with zero upscaling For the price of a new PS5 you can upgrade the most important parts of the PC every 5 years The rest of it carries forward Sure that one time a 1500 to 2k drop is a big ask but that is if you dont have a single part Just clarification to your point not really a rebuttal For those who come along later,mt8j7xd,7.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt8gaqn,NoReallyLetsBeFriend,,3,2025-05-20 02:55:26,,,,Yeah a while back on my dedicated gaming PC I disabled a bunch of services and uninstalling programsapps that werent needed for gaming got my 6GB clean boot W11Pro idling ram down to about 35GB 64GB DDR5 now feels overkill lol Even in game is maybe only about 810GB I feel but I dont check it often enough to really know GPU does most the legwork,mt646o1,4.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt67ude,TehOwn,,10,2025-05-19 19:18:17,,,,Ive only really bought consoles for social couch coop gaming so havent really touched them in a while But yeah that makes sense Must be pretty tough to port simulationheavy games to console,mt646o1,4.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt6boim,LupusDeusMagnus,,27,2025-05-19 19:37:36,,,,The beauty of unified ram is that you can make it 2 GB of VRAM and 14 GB of RAM if you need to and the system has good memory management The most difficult part is input But yes consoles do well with their GPUs but suffer in the CPU side,mt67ude,5.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt5vuri,shifty_coder,,-41,2025-05-19 18:19:02,,,,Cars dont necessarily get faster when increasing engine size either If you cant see how having faster more efficient memory would get you net performance gains with the same capacity I dont know what to tell you,mt5vl3w,6.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt63gyo,Runazeeri,,21,2025-05-19 18:56:24,,,,Faster memory doesnt mater that much when you have to load the textures from SSD onto it the SSD is the bottle neck If you have more Vram you need to load less,mt5vuri,7.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt5bzjo,dampflokfreund,,30,2025-05-19 16:43:48,,,,So Doesnt matter when the VRAM spills into system ram on the 8 GB card because its not enough Memory speed is entirely irrelevant to this discussion,mt5aq7t,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt6i7ug,fullup72,,9,2025-05-19 20:10:25,,,,GDDR7 is twice the speed per pin but the 5060 is a 128bit bus card the PS5 is 256bit This essentially means both systems have the same total bandwidth The 5060 however still has half the VRAM,mt5aq7t,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt6iv36,shifty_coder,,-9,2025-05-19 20:13:36,,,,And a PS5 costs how much Also the PS5s VRAM is shared 2GB for the OS and 14GB for GPU processing so not quite a 11 comparison,mt6i7ug,4.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt4xyf5,MultiMarcus,,59,2025-05-19 15:34:06,,,,Or listen to digital foundry because that sounds exactly like something Rich would say I do think 8 GB is too little on a 300 product especially when I think the logical progression wouldve been 12 with 16 for the 5060 TI 20 on the 5070 and 5070 TI with 24 on the 5080 and 32 on the 5090 Then the 5080 would be matching last generations halo product in the 4090 we would finally be giving up 8 GB GPUs and the 5070 and 5070 TI would be more appropriate for 1440 which has almost started pushing beyond 16 GB at least with frame generation turned on I think VRAM is one of those things that really ages a card Another example from this generation is the very poorly allotted 5060 TI 8 gig which seems like a much worse proposition than the 5060 TI 16 gig I think one of the weirdest choices has to be the 5080 with only 16 GB of the RAM which is becoming an issue at 4K for a card that is theoretically at least meant to work for 4K gaming Though I guess the 5070 takes the crown with having 12 gigs of VRAM while being meant for 1440p which would probably benefit for more VRAM Especially since the 5060 TI which is a weaker card is being offered with 16 gigs,mt4wn5m,1.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5iztd,MetalBawx,,51,2025-05-19 17:17:38,,,,8GB was okay on the 3000 series On the 4000 it was a pushing things Now its a bad joke,mt4xyf5,2.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7cd5p,Nippy69,,14,2025-05-19 22:50:10,,,,The damn 3060 released back then had 12gb vram 12 and to think both 4060 and 5060 would have only 8 is so baffling,mt5iztd,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5yup3,akeean,,18,2025-05-19 18:33:47,,,,8gb was ok on 2000 series on 3000 cards like the 3070ti 8gb is an issue Hogwarts Legacy Resident Evil,mt5iztd,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5jov5,ray12370,,20,2025-05-19 17:20:57,,,,I did not feel the aging of my 3070ti until I played GOW Ragnarok The game will stutter like crazy if I try playing with anything above medium 8 GB was just barely not enough for this game The Nvidia 3000 gen definitely feels like planned obsolescence with that memory considering the 6000 AMD gen all had 12gb and above vram cards,mt4xyf5,2.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5u8n8,Finwolven,,20,2025-05-19 18:11:13,,,,Im quite happy I got my 3060 12Gb back in the day I definitely wont take a card that has less than 16Gb these days,mt5jov5,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt71ldv,ray12370,,5,2025-05-19 21:48:34,,,,Dude I was so mad that not long after I got a launch day 600 8gb 3070ti they released a cheaper 12 GB 3060 Nvidia just doesnt make sense Your 3060 will likely outlast my 3070ti,mt5u8n8,4.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7chr2,fordfan919,,5,2025-05-19 22:50:55,,,,Im feeling my 3070tis age now the 1070ti it replaced also had 8gb of ram but a much longer useful lifespan I was hoping to get another year or two out of it but will probably have to replace it before the end of the year,mt71ldv,5.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7opo2,ray12370,,2,2025-05-20 00:02:01,,,,Haha I also upgraded from a 1070ti Im gonna make my 3070ti last until the ps6 at least because the games that give me vram issues are few and far between So far it is just MH Wilds wildly unoptimized and GOW Ragnarok that make my 3070ti struggle,mt7chr2,6.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7m02k,Finwolven,,1,2025-05-19 23:45:57,,,,Well if its any consolation I did have to buy it at about the cost of a 3070 TI and that was from an official seller And I was very lucky to score one at the time,mt71ldv,5.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt7brgx,jezevec93,,5,2025-05-19 22:46:41,,,,Its crazy to say 8gb is enough after how 4060 ti 8gb turned up DLSS framegen main selling point btw takes approx 1gb vrma after that you end up with 7gb We could find games on 1080p that were bottlenecked by VRAM on 4060 ti Now a year later it will be just worse and worse as the time will progress Even consoles has more Vram,mt4wn5m,1.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5j7ur,WhenPantsAttack,,13,2025-05-19 17:18:43,,,,Its more of a sign of the times and resolution 8GB harkens back to an age when most people were gaming on 1080p High resolution and high refresh rate monitors becoming incredibly cheap and more accessible than ever Modern GPUs should reflect that At 8 GB its leaning quite hard on DLSS and other AI tricks to get reasonable framerates at reasonable settings in modern games for investing 300 and at questionable quality compared to raster,mt4wn5m,1.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5jgnd,shifty_coder,,30,2025-05-19 17:19:53,,,,Most people today are still gaming at 1080p or lower Dont believe pcmr tripe,mt5j7ur,2.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt5kp39,WhenPantsAttack,,18,2025-05-19 17:25:42,,,,That may be true you dont upgrade parts in your PC for your current system You upgrade to hopefully get more out of the system If you buy this GPU you could spend 150200 on a monitor and your brand new GPU is already out of date,mt5jgnd,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt66srn,Green-Salmon,,-6,2025-05-19 19:13:03,,,,But the value market is still there A lot of people still choose 1080p monitors because theyre cheaper Most already have a working 1080p monitor and dont want to spend another 200 to upgrade it And that market doesnt build an expensive pcs thinking only about futureproofing They buy what they can afford today,mt5kp39,4.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt6abu9,WhenPantsAttack,,13,2025-05-19 19:30:43,,,,If youre that kind of thrifty gamer you shouldnt even in the market for a 5060 Its a bad value card at 300 Intel battle mage last gen Radeon or used is going to be much better value if you plan on being a 1080p gamer for the near future The ONLY reason I see to get the 5060 is if you are okay cranking the AI enhancements to near max and the hits in fidelity that come with that while playing the bleeding edge of nonesports games Im not going to yuck someones yum if thats their use case but I dont think that is what most people are looking for when they are spending hundreds of dollars to upgrade their system,mt66srn,5.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt6ppc6,Green-Salmon,,-3,2025-05-19 20:47:15,,,,Its a bad deal for sure But one many will still make because they want raytracing or dlss Its an upgrade path many will simply choose to stick with 1080p instead of spending 200 on a good monitor and then an even more expensive gpu that can handle 1440p and whatnot,mt6abu9,6.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt6aard,Kruxf,,71,2025-05-19 19:30:34,,,,55 of Steam users still game at 1080p Clearly this card wasnt meant for you It was meant as an upgrade path for people still running 1080 which seems to be a sizable group Conversely 1440p is only 19 of Steam users Youre up in arms over hardware that never had you in mind to begin with Would it be nice to have a 12gb card for 300 yes Is it required for that 55 of the Steam user base Absolutely not They were aiming at millions of users not just the 19 of 1440 and 45 of 4k users,,0.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt74duk,Metallictr,,9,2025-05-19 22:03:58,,,,Thats kind of the point though People who buy a 5060 wont want to upgrade it for a while If they ever want to get a 1440p monitor which is likely as they are buying a new gpu itll be an issue soon 8 gigs of vram was the baseline in 2020 I think we should be allowed to ask for more,mt6aard,1.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mta8p6v,NPDgames,,2,2025-05-20 12:22:47,,,,And it is a significant number if you sum them up around 8 or 9 percent and thats leaving out low powered dedicated laptop GPUs that arent upgradable too as I did not mention them I dont see any way to look at the stats only for 1080p gaming but its a very reasonable assumption that this group is over represented in 1080p Im not saying 1080 isnt the most popular resolution it definitely is but I dont believe its as extreme as the person I replied to is saying,mt6sjl3,3.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt92rys,Ikari1212,,4,2025-05-20 05:55:13,,,,Ok so you think people gaming at 1080p do it by choice or because they cannot afford upgrading Because I personally would assume that a card 89 years released after the 1080 would be a LOT stronger even if it is the lower end card,mt6aard,1.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mtanner,Seigmoraig,,2,2025-05-20 13:52:22,,,,Ok so you think people gaming at 1080p do it by choice or because they cannot afford upgrading Its both a lot of people dont actually care about 2k or 4k because its not that big of a difference if you dont play cutting edge games and playing at 1080p makes their existing hardware viable for many more years than if they would insist on 4k Not only that but if you play 20 year old game all the time like me and my friends 2k or 4k is often not even supported by the games and makes the interface tiny,mt92rys,2.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mta61ee,thelonesomeguy,,4,2025-05-20 12:04:54,,,,by choice or they cannot afford upgrading You would be surprised how many people just do not care about wanting to move from something that does the job for them Damn this thread feels like everyone is in a bubble,mt92rys,2.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mtsgoqu,everybodyiskungfu,,0,2025-05-23 06:07:48,,,,You are missing the part where 8GB isnt enough for 1080p either That video is two years old Buying an 8GB card now likely using it well into the PS6 Gen too is a terrible idea for anyone I swear to god Nvidia could release a 6GB 6060 and some people would still defend them,mt6aard,1.0,1kqa3k8

comment,mt89d6n,TomaccoCat,,9,2025-05-20 02:09:44,,,,I think you might have done some research already but the 5060 TI sucks ass for its price point and you legitimately might be better off going for a 4070 Super But honestly just go for the base AMD RX 9070 its efficient got 16GB ram outperforms the 5060TI by about 40 in pure raster and it might go on sale in the near future since everyone wants the XT,mt6v4my,2.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt9ne8o,ZiggyZobby,,7,2025-05-20 09:27:40,,,,This is exactly whats wrong with this thread You cant fucking recommend the 9070 compared to the 5060TI when the price difference at least here in europe is 350 euros I would love to buy AMD right now Id love to give the middle finger to Nvidia but the 9070 is 100 more expensive than the 5070 I have been sitting on an upgrade since December and im still patiently waiting for the 9060s to come out but Im very confident ill get shafted,mt89d6n,3.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mtapd95,TomaccoCat,,3,2025-05-20 14:01:35,,,,My condolences EU pricing definitely sucks rn Where I am the 9070 is only about 120USD more than the 5060TI making it the no brainer choice If you can I think it would be worth waiting 6 months longer AMD card prices have historically dropped like crazy after Nvidia prices dropped and better value cards like TI and Super variants come out Hoping for some discounts to come your way,mt9ne8o,4.0,1kqa3k8
comment,mt8ayic,kamikazi1231,,5,2025-05-20 02:19:54,,,,Yea might be the way to go AMD has stepped up their game and a way to divert some of the money from nvidias crazy prices Thank ya,mt89d6n,3.0,1kqa3k8
