comment,mtgwaus,kermityfrog2,,-49,2025-05-21 13:21:33,,,,Dangerously close to the reset button Also the 525 floppy drives are an anachronism They were gone by the time 386 and 486 processors were around which is when this case is trying to emulate Edit Getting downvoted yall had 3x525 floppies no 35 and no CDROM on your 386486s Something looks off its supposed to be a sleeper case that looks almost exactly like a typical computer of the era,mtg73cc,1.0,1krufj7
comment,mtgz5fn,TabrinLudd,,33,2025-05-21 13:37:24,,,,From a consumer perspective perhaps But we had Pentium II systems at home with 525 drives The reason being serious business systems that were a little old but still working perfectly were still using them so if you wanted to be able to do a little work from home they were still relevant,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7
comment,mthr26o,bravejango,,7,2025-05-21 15:54:41,,,,There are US government systems that still receive binary updates via floppy,mtgz5fn,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mth2y0m,mattcraft,,31,2025-05-21 13:57:16,,,,I can tell you without a doubt many of us had 5 floppies well into the Pentium days Having a newer computer didnt mean all your software was magically on the new disks,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7
comment,mth5kea,kermityfrog2,,-25,2025-05-21 14:10:35,,,,Edit would you have 3 of them and no 35 and no CDROM Why would you not transfer the software onto 35 floppies and HDD Thats what I did Only my IBM XT clone had a 525 floppy and a 35 as well no HDD 525 was dying out when the Mac Classic was released in 1984 My 486DX4100 had a 35 floppy a CD ROM read only and a 540mb HDD in 1994 If you had a 525 floppy you moved it from an old computer as they were obsolete by the early 90s Windows 95 only retailed on 35 discs and CDROM You could still buy the drives and you could move them over from an older computer but most people didnt want them anymore by around 1990,mth2y0m,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mthes5o,EraTheTooketh,,11,2025-05-21 14:56:05,,,,Moneytimehardwareetc etc etc Amazon wasnt a thing yet and you had to drive to a RadioShack or an equivalent to even see if they could order stuff for you,mth5kea,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mthrevc,kermityfrog2,,-8,2025-05-21 15:56:22,,,,Not that many people built their own computers back then People were buying prebuilt Tandys from Radioshack but those were gone by 1990 I think either people dont remember or had some special situation whereby they inherited a 525 into the 90s,mthes5o,5.0,1krufj7
comment,mthrx4u,dominus_aranearum,,3,2025-05-21 15:58:46,,,,What are you smoking Yes Apple selected the 312 disk drive in 1984 but just because they were in early adopter doesnt mean the 514 drive was dying out It wasnt until 1988 that the 312 drive became more popular with the 514 being completely phased out in the mid 90s No different than people still using cassette tapes well after CDs became widely used or CDs before DVDs etc,mth5kea,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mths7jr,kermityfrog2,,2,2025-05-21 16:00:09,,,,It didnt die out in 1984 but was not normally sold with new computers by 1990 My XT clone in 8586 had both floppy types and I migrated everything to the 35 as soon as I could You think this PC case looks representative of the era With 3x 525 floppies and no other drives If you saw it on someones desk you wouldnt say that something looks off,mthrx4u,5.0,1krufj7
comment,mti6c00,dominus_aranearum,,5,2025-05-21 17:07:49,,,,No it doesnt look representative They should have had three plain blanks with a single 514 blank that could be swapped in if desired Maybe even a CDROM blank for that mid 90s I added a SoundBlaster multimedia kit look The double 514 floppy is more reminiscent of the mid 80s before hard drives became more common in the late 80s Personally by the time I was in the computer industry I really didnt care for the beige color and wished that manufacturers would come out with other options but that didnt happen until the late 90s Had to rattle can them if you wanted something different No way Id ever put new components into a beige case retro or otherwise,mths7jr,6.0,1krufj7
comment,mthj407,mattcraft,,4,2025-05-21 15:16:53,,,,I cant speak for others but for me it was definitely a combination of lack of money and lack of access A friend let us borrow their CDROM drive to install Windows 95 when that came out but I have installed it from floppies before We didnt have our own CDROM drive until 9900 timeframe We also werent about to run out and buy a bunch of small floppies just to copy files off a large floppy when it wouldnt even fill the smaller floppy larger capacity Its inefficient use of your resources Another pretty big factor was also time Copying from floppy to floppy was sloooow,mth5kea,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mth1vk2,trickman01,,4,2025-05-21 13:51:45,,,,I really dont think theyre trying to be 100 accurate Just capture a general vibe,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mthrky8,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,0,2025-05-21 15:57:10,,,,The parent isnt complaining about accuracy its plenty accurate The turbo button was frequently next to the reset button Just like that,mth1vk2,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mtipfne,IM_DaWarez,,0,2025-05-21 18:37:59,,,,I hooked the turbo button up to the the clock speed pins for 4x on my 486 133 MHz that I built in 1995 and got 160 MHz out of it after boot wout a 25 MHz bus speed that way,mthrky8,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mtiqery,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,0,2025-05-21 18:42:40,,,,I didnt know you could do that We need more turbo buttons,mtipfne,5.0,1krufj7
comment,mtiu5r2,trickman01,,0,2025-05-21 19:00:44,,,,According to their edit they were indeed complaining about accuracy,mthrky8,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mthio65,VagabondVivant,,5,2025-05-21 15:14:48,,,,No they werent Though that said three 525s and no 35s seems like an oversight,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7
comment,mthtk26,kermityfrog2,,6,2025-05-21 16:06:42,,,,Thats what I mean and could have phrased better People might still keep them around as legacy compatibility but you wouldnt preferentially install 3 of them and not have a CD rom or 35 floppy drive Its an anachronism because people who grew up in the era would look at this case and say its not representative of a typical actual computer from the era,mthio65,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mti3s14,VagabondVivant,,6,2025-05-21 16:55:48,,,,What wouldve been really slick would be to include an optical disc drive but give it a 525 floppy faceplate Likewise they couldve included an sdmicrosdusb reader and give it a 35 faceplate that flips down Basically include modern features hidden behind retro facades,mthtk26,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mth8q5b,_Dreamer_Deceiver_,,5,2025-05-21 14:26:17,,,,Its like people think stegasaurus and triceratops hung out together in an anti trex club and thyre telling the pterasaurs that theyre not dinosaurs just dinosaur adjacent,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7
comment,mth4kcw,Sopel97,,2,2025-05-21 14:05:32,,,,Also the 525 floppy drives are an anachronism on the contrary they still provide great use for 35 HDD hot swap bays,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7
comment,mtpjkxa,Enderkr,,1,2025-05-22 19:29:50,,,,Fuckin LOVE my SSD hot swap bay Spring loaded so its basically just a floppy drive that holds terabytes Even got stickers for my SSDs,mth4kcw,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mth5zj3,kermityfrog2,,3,2025-05-21 14:12:42,,,,Not the drive bays Those are still available The floppy drives themselves that read 525 floppy discs,mth4kcw,3.0,1krufj7
comment,mthg5q9,Sopel97,,1,2025-05-21 15:02:47,,,,Right sorry I misread I see what you mean now I still disagree though they were common in the 80s,mth5zj3,4.0,1krufj7
comment,mtin1u7,IM_DaWarez,,2,2025-05-21 18:26:29,,,,You are correct and if the down voters were even around 30 yrs ago They would know that they had 2 x 35 and 2 x optical drives if they were power users Just like the 486s I built in 1994,mtgwaus,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mtgpxtb,SeanAker,,81,2025-05-21 12:44:25,,,,Since people figured out that retro was cool and they could turn a profit a beige case that isnt obliterated or covered in smoke tar will run you almost that much anyway,mtgfq2g,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mtic2sj,AbhishMuk,,3,2025-05-21 17:34:27,,,,Its a lot for sure and way beyond what I would personally consider reasonable but if you look at some cases at say rsffpc youll see that expensive cases do have niche and vocal enthusiasts Cant blame someone if they have the money,mtgat6f,1.0,1krufj7
comment,mtj5ou0,yrnst,,4,2025-05-21 19:56:03,,,,Also if youre building a computer you have to be prepared to shell out a few hundred bucks at minimum If Im spending a thousand bucks on a GPU Im probably not too worried about an extra hundred bucks for a cool case Its not for everyone but Id consider picking one up if I were in the market for an upgrade,mtic2sj,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mtimjus,Drone30389,,1,2025-05-21 18:24:03,,,,Aptiva was still a beige box and was produced until 2001 I dont remember the bubble Acers but from what I can find they had curvy style lines but were still boxy overall and drab in color The big change was the gumdrop iMacs that came out in 1998 They also popularized USB,mtgz9c0,5.0,1krufj7
comment,mtiws41,benanderson89,,1,2025-05-21 19:13:35,,,,Were not talking about beige or square but the general styling overall The case in question in the article is evocative of many 8086 clones and many 286 and 386 machines with a handful of 486 machines as well that oversquare finned grille that barely had any styling thrown at it,mtimjus,6.0,1krufj7

comment,mtm35qm,Afferbeck_,,2,2025-05-22 06:34:12,,,,Problem with cases that cheap is they tend to offer very limited features and space where you actually need it If youre building an equally crap computer for basic tasks then its fine Apart from that theyre also horrible to work on and will slice you up If youre building an actual decent PC with modern outrageously hot components then you no longer have the option of using a basic ass office case with a single 80mm fan in it,mtga85x,1.0,1krufj7

comment,mtr8an9,_Draven_,,2,2025-05-23 00:57:10,,,,Its hard to justify wasting that much space on a desk and the cooling seems less than optimal FLP01 is a Retroinspired HTPC Chassis as per their product page so I can see why theyre now gearing this new case as your typical gamingproductivity tower but Im not sure the feature set is worth the asking price I am not an enthusiast so my parts are all middle ground spec I dont have the same priorities as the demographic this is going for Regardless of any of that though I do enjoy the aesthetic of this in a modern PC case Its clear that wouldnt be as characteristic without the color and gimmicky blank panels if it were black it would look like a cheap noname brand case,mtj6w8i,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mth0bbq,spookynutz,,7,2025-05-21 13:43:36,,,,Towers arent exclusive to the 80s or 90s neither is the angular design PCs got more curvy in the 90s but Dell was still selling variants of the Dimension in 1999 that had the same rectangular beige aesthetic This case is very similar to the Northgate towers you used to see in Computer Shopper around 8788 which is probably why theyre billing it as a late80s case The turbo button and sevensegment displays are a prePentium fixture They were mostly gone by the mid90s,mtgsrrf,2.0,1krufj7

comment,mtin2dz,Bieberkinz,,2,2025-05-21 18:26:34,,,,Silverstone for the time being seems to be the option without buying and modifying an old case I really enjoyed building in the FLP01 horizontalpizza box version but the FLP02 definitely has more benefitsspace in it We just need 43square monitors to make a comeback or in the gaming case have high refresh rates and the sleeper is fully back,mtgfwlv,1.0,1krufj7
