comment,m6f1cbr,drmirage809,,298,2025-01-10 15:44:24,,,,And on top of that both chips are being made by TSMC now Intel have their own fabs but those have been stuck on an older process node due to being unable to get the newer stuff working out TSMC only has so much capacity and now we have Intel AMD Apple and Nvidia all fighting for the really high end stuff,m6f0te2,1.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6f9ayf,FightOnForUsc,,95,2025-01-10 16:23:41,,,,Crazy that they stay a node ahead of nvidia even at least for now Because Apple always had the highest margins and so could afford it Idk how long the deals last but I could see nvidia being willing to pay more Then again they dont really have competition at the moment so why would they,m6f66eh,3.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6fykzq,perthguppy,,88,2025-01-10 18:24:57,,,,From my understanding Apple gets exclusive rights to the leading node because they are basically funding TSMC to explicitly buy the equipment to produce at the new leading edge nodes,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6ggzsm,RandomlyMethodical,,48,2025-01-10 19:54:01,,,,Apple also makes about 10x more chips than Nvidia so it has the purchasing power to buy everything TSMC can produce at new nodes,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6lk64q,FightOnForUsc,,2,2025-01-11 16:48:53,,,,It still matters Better efficiency can almost always be traded for more speed if it was only efficiency iPhones and Macs wouldnt be getting faster every year It also makes a huge difference in operating costs when youre talking about 100000 H100s,m6futcj,5.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6i8lxz,Ashamed-Status-9668,,2,2025-01-11 01:31:43,,,,Not really once you know TSMC creates the low power nodepdk first Then in about a year they tweak out the higher power node Think N5 vs N5P Apple uses the lower power one and Nvidia uses the higher power one If Nvidia was making low power stuff like cell phones they would get first dibs like Apple does,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6i9707,FightOnForUsc,,2,2025-01-11 01:35:04,,,,M1 used N5 and M2 used N5P A16 is N4P A17 pro is N3B and A18 Pro is N3E So Im not sure its that simple,m6i8lxz,5.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6j1bwa,joomla00,,2,2025-01-11 04:27:38,,,,I see 2 major reasons why Nvidia cant really do this First Nvidia doesnt need as many chips as Apple by a very large amount Their investment costs per chips is much higher Second Nvidia is in a boom cycle which is going to bust at some point Theyre going to be left holding the bag when that happens Its really hard to time these things Apple on the other hand will continue to see steady increasing growth for their products for the foreseeable future Contractually its likely apple is largely funding TSMCs research and have exclusive rights on these cutting edge nodes So it might not even be possible for Nvidia unless they rework the contracts Even though they largely serve different markets Nvidia is starting to encroach onto Apples space so apple will want to hold onto their edge,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6kgqm1,joomla00,,1,2025-01-11 12:45:13,,,,If you think Nvidia will be able to sell every chip as fast as they can make them for the next decade as they comtinue to ramp up production as fast as possible you should sell whatever you can and buy as much Nvidia stock as possible Just because its going to bust doesnt mean it will bust tomorrow or next year But a decade of this or even 5 years at this pace seems unlikely,m6ke662,6.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6nojer,sithelephant,,1,2025-01-11 23:34:25,,,,Hardware sales for Apple have been basically flat for other than services and accessories since 2021 There was a big bump in 2021 but before then same story till 2015 Apple is only an uncomplicated story of hardware sales growth in the decade or so before 2015 I am splitting out accessories for obvious reasons,m6j1bwa,5.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6iiydt,dertechie,,1,2025-01-11 02:31:25,,,,Part of that is that most of Apples chips are small Its a lot easier to work around the defect rates of a newer node with a 90 mm2 A18 SoC than a 800 mm2 Blackwell die The larger M chips come later in the process,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6vyjaw,luuuuuku,,1,2025-01-13 07:28:51,,,,Compared to AMDNvidiaintel Apples margins are pretty small Apple gets the latest and greatest because theyre paying the development and buy earlylow yielding wafers to fund TSMC Without Apple neither NVIDIA nor AMD would really have the chance to get better nodes in time,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6fdk40,8day,,-11,2025-01-10 16:44:10,,,,They cheap out on VRAM which causes stutter etc even though their lower end cards wouldve behaved much better in many demanding games No way in hell they will do this wo competition,m6f9ayf,4.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6g0d00,Zixinus,,-4,2025-01-10 18:33:30,,,,If you run out of VRAM you will still get stutter as the CPU now is juggling the extra VRAM contents between the VRAM and RAM If there was enough VRAM it would simply not have to do that It would be better if there is enough VRAM on a slower memory rather than gain that overhead People ran benchmarks on the 4060ti that had a 8gb and 16gb version and the 16gb delivered better performance,m6fqb0s,6.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6g01sy,Zixinus,,5,2025-01-10 18:32:00,,,,Not in the hightier AMD practically admitted that they wont even be trying Last generation their toptier card was contending Nvidas midtier Intel is gaining ground but most looking likely be competition for AMD rather than Nvidia As someone who did a graphic card update recently I considered going to AMD but I would lose features I dont like RT but there are games that require it and then you NEED DLSS,m6fdk40,5.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6hfyf2,DonArgueWithMe,,0,2025-01-10 22:50:06,,,,Amd hasnt been directly competing on the top end for a long time since well before the 1080ti Amd has always been the budgetmid tier winner and frame per dollar winner Nvidia wins in peak performance every generation You also lose nothing with amd though it has rt and fsr is as good or better than dlss,m6g01sy,6.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6fygka,internetlad,,25,2025-01-10 18:24:22,,,,After the 11th gen Intel power issues that were literally killing their chips I havent even considered a device with a recent gen Intel chip since I do have concerns of course Monopoly is never good for the market and AMD has certainly had their flops and failures in the past I have never owned an AMD GPU that hasnt had SOME sort of issue usually driver but often bad hardware ram probably causing artifacting under load Between everything itll be an interesting next few years and i fear not in the good way,m6f0te2,1.0,1hy71ep
comment,m6gdzt5,SimiKusoni,,13,2025-01-10 19:39:20,,,,I dont think its all negative and theres some reason to be hopeful For one AMD have been ramping up RD spending for years now after chronically underspending for an entire decade note the chart is not inflation adjusted That should really start paying off in products coming out soon and we can already see dramatic improvements in their software stack They are perhaps flagging a bit in terms of hardware on the GPU side but Intel have done oddly well in that respect this gen and itll be interesting if AMD return to producing higher end SKUs around the same time Intel start pushing into that area And as for Intel everything hinges on 18A which is eh There was of course the rumour about Broadcom not being happy with it but the only actual quote is that it was not yet viable to move to highvolume production which doesnt really tell us anything as it wasnt meant to be ready at that point Theyve since confirmed a defect rate of 04 defectscm2 which they are very unlikely to have fudged so there is a fair chance thats overblown even if we dont have enough info to judge yet If Intel do pull it off we could see both CPUs and GPUs on a truly cutting edge node for the first time in a while as opposed to all of that capacity going to mobile Apple More competition for TSMC is also always good given how expensive theyve become Obviously a lot of this does hinge on Intel not fucking up again so maybe its not all sunshine and rainbows but I think theres a fair chance we might see some really cool shit come out in the next few years,m6fygka,2.0,1hy71ep

comment,m6tn2si,shmed,,0,2025-01-12 22:33:13,,,,While I agree I still dont understand the AMD naming scheme For example the AM5 RYZEN 7 9800x3d I understand am5 is the new generation chipset RYZEN 7 means 8 cores Why 7 other than this I have no idea what it means to have your model number start with 9 or to have a 8 on the second position I see some amd CPUs also have a 5 in the third position eg 9950x No idea what the x means either It also doesnt look like the numbers increment with new releases so its probably not a version number like for Nvidia GPUs,m6impt0,2.0,1hy71ep
