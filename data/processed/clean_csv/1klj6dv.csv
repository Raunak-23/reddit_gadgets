comment,ms40a6i,HanzoNumbahOneFan,,33,2025-05-13 15:58:30,,,,In the companies eyes you are getting the product for free which you would have otherwise paid money for So to them youre stealing revenue In reality most of the people pirating things would never actually pay money for most of those things anyways So the company isnt losing anything If I am incapable of pirating a specific movie lets say Cowboys Aliens my other option is to pay money for it I would just rather go my entire life never watching it The same is true for many types of media and Im sure is also true for many other people Im not going to be buying a Switch 2 The prices are too high to provide value to me when there are plenty other options If there happens to be an easy way to pirate the games and emulate them I might actually play them Otherwise I will happily go about my life never playing them,ms3kozl,3.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms8mlpq,KunashG,,8,2025-05-14 08:56:25,,,,Most of the time I pirate something its something I cant get otherwise Like its just not possible to buy unless I find it in someones ancient collection at an outrageous price So for example I pirated a Loony Tunes collection I also bought that 6 episodes thing they had but it isnt complete Finding a complete Loony Tunes collection is FUCKING IMPOSSIBLE Especially an uncensored one Why dont WB offer this I dont know But for as long as they dont theyre losing my money More to this thread I pirated the Metroid Prime trilogy for the Wii to play on my Wii U Why Because it was 250 on eBay from peoples old collection It was just not possible to buy from Nintendo They then later actually released it but honestly man they deserved that piracy And Nintendo does this all the time,ms40a6i,4.0,1klj6dv

comment,msakshd,MinusBear,,1,2025-05-14 16:20:11,,,,in reality most of the people pirating things would never actually pay money this is evident by Tears of the Kingdom sales being completely unaffected by it being available to pirate and emulate days before its official release The Switch is the most pirated current gen console of all time but you wouldnt be able to tell that by Nintendos sales,ms40a6i,4.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms6pgdm,Gfunkual,,-8,2025-05-14 00:10:38,,,,If you buy a Switch 2 its presumably because you want to play Switch 2 games otherwise why would you spend 500 on the console Nintendo makes money on all games sold If you pirate games you are stealing money from Nintendo because they get a cut of all sales Your argument dies there If youre willing to pirate games you wouldnt otherwise buy youre also willing to pirate games you would otherwise buy,ms40a6i,4.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms6t8zv,HanzoNumbahOneFan,,5,2025-05-14 00:33:19,,,,I wouldnt be buying a console in this scenario Id be using an emulator on my PC But in any case you clearly didnt understand the rest of my message If I was never going to buy the games Nintendo wouldnt get money from me pirated game or not And 99 of the time I do buy my games Its a lot less of a hassle buying them The last one I pirated was Tears of the Kingdom which was fairly recent However if I was incapable of pirating it I just wouldnt have ever played the game because I wasnt going to shell out 70 for it Before that Im pretty sure the last game I pirated was Fallout 4 right around its original release 10 years ago I wanted to see if Id like the game at the time I didnt have a lot of money And surprise surprise I own the game now as I bought it on Steam a few years ago,ms6pgdm,5.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms2prt7,Eren69,,160,2025-05-13 11:44:30,,,,You think 99 of Nintendo consumers care They are just all normal people who dont even know about jailbreaking dumping roms pirating and emulating old games,ms2nyx1,3.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2qw2j,MarianneThornberry,,117,2025-05-13 11:52:14,,,,Yup I always chuckle when I see these threads Vote with your wallet is a good sentiment but unfortunately one that fails to take into consideration that 99 of average Nintendos target consumers have already outvoted the 1 of niche hardcore gamers that care about this stuff,ms2prt7,4.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2t6zo,CreativeGPX,,22,2025-05-13 12:07:48,,,,Voting with your wallet isnt just about destroying the platform youre voting against Its about creatingimproving the market for competitors There are other platforms that do not do this and supporting those platforms with your money instead of Nintendo helps those platforms continue to exist and thrive even if Nintendo continues to exist too,ms2qw2j,5.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2uhr0,MarianneThornberry,,27,2025-05-13 12:16:25,,,,I agree with everything with you wrote but the issue isnt whether or not what youre saying is correct The issue is that your words are ultimately falling on deaf ears as the overwhelming majority of everyday consumers are simply not invested in this matter as you are To them this is a niche issue thats not at all relevant to their console gaming experience,ms2t6zo,6.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms4gric,DDisired,,7,2025-05-13 17:18:32,,,,That doesnt invalidate what they said either though If the 1 of Nintendo customers decide to buy a Steamdeck or another potable PC that is still worth a lot Just because the majority isnt reached doesnt mean that its falling on deaf ears,ms2uhr0,7.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2z7x2,CreativeGPX,,6,2025-05-13 12:46:16,,,,But my point was that it doesnt have to be an overwhelming majority or even a majority to be useful and have positive effects and it doesnt take being particularly invested at all Im a PC gamer I dont have to be invested in order to do that its pretty easy and cheap I also dont have to have some huge philosophical will to do it just a vague sense from hundreds of headlines and experiences similar to OP that the PC is more flexible affordable etc than the alternatives Its really not something I have to think about or try hard to stick to But by doing so and by a bunch of other people doing so that ensures that PC gaming is still growing and supported If I buy a two games from AAA Studio X that sound great but theyre both stupidly buggy and then I see headlines now and then about Studio X releasing super buggy games Im probably not going to believe the hype of Studio Xs next game Its not something Im invested in Its not something Im trying and sacrificing hard to impact Its not something that Im doing specifically to try to change Studio X I dont care either way about Studio X just about my own experience Its just basic common sense But as I and others do that that creates a market for Studio Y to make a competing game Maybe Studio Y is AAA too or maybe its indie but I get a game that isnt super buggy and now Studio Y is more likely to have the resources to come out with another game It also doesnt really matter if this is only reason people support Studio Y or is its just 10 of its customers thinking this ie a 10 bump in revenue In fact its a GOOD thing is this isnt the only reason people support Studio Y because presumably Studio Ys game should also be good and because we wouldnt want Studio Y to fail as soon as Studio X releases one game that doesnt suck So long story short its a pretty low effort low cost automatic thing and it doesnt have to mean work investment sacrifice etc and even if the vast majority do not do it it can still impact the market As another example local farmers markets are common Its not because the overwhelming majority refuses to shop at major grocery stores Its not because the people who attend are heavily invested in specifically and only seeking out local goods Its because enough people sometimes go there that its commercially viable to have local farmers markets The fact that the overwhelming majority doesnt go to the farmers market especially for their every shopping trip doesnt really matter What matters is that enough go enough of the time that now those farmers markets are an option for everybody,ms2uhr0,7.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3b3xr,MarianneThornberry,,6,2025-05-13 13:53:53,,,,I dont really have a response But I did want to say that your comment was extremely well written and I agree with everything Consumer choice is absolutely important and essential even if the majority of consumers are largely indifferent and oblivious to these matters,ms2z7x2,8.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3kna6,JukePlz,,3,2025-05-13 14:42:33,,,,Alternatives already exist if you think of it as just a game console but the issue with that train of thought is that no matter how you vote none of the existing or potential competitors will be able to use the IPs that people care about when they buy a Nintendo console People buy them for first party exclusives and they effectively have a legal monopoly over them,ms2z7x2,8.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms44yq6,CreativeGPX,,1,2025-05-13 16:21:34,,,,I dont really see that as an issue Obviously if you are looking for alternatives but insist on the IP of the original thing then you have decided that by definition the alternative must not be an alternative You made your choice before you started looking Or decided you were never going to make a choice in the first place Do those people exist People who simply do not want an alternative Yes Sure Thats kind of the whole point of my comment The idea that you must convert THOSE people is misguided You dont need EVERYBODY to stop using Nintendo You dont need Nintendo to backpedal Etc You simply need enough people a small minority to support other better platforms for those platforms to be viable and exist And as you say they arguably do already exist because people do this This is because many people Id argue the vast majority of people are gaming to fulfill a need relax have fun feel emotional socialize etc that can be fulfilled by many different games and do not require an exact specific IP to do so Its only a small minority of megafans that are more concerned with following specific IP than with simply finding things like fun relaxation socialization etc where many many competing games and platforms exist,ms3kna6,9.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3j017,_-Kr4t0s-_,,-2,2025-05-13 14:34:19,,,,No but it starts a chain reaction The hardcore gamers all move to a different platform the devs realize this the devs dont waste money porting certain AAA games to the switch and _then_ Nintendo starts to feel it Or maybe enough of us have friends who know were big gamers and ask us hey what console should I get And we say oh get a PS6 so you can play Call Of Duty 2567 with me and now thats more people on the other console Point is the less you worry about the politics of it the better Call it voting with your wallet call it being true to yourself or call it whatever you like just buy the devices that suit _you_ and _your_ values regardless of what the rest of the market is doing,ms2uhr0,7.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2uftw,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,7,2025-05-13 12:16:04,,,,Its why I only play PC now Sure I miss a few exclusives but thats only until the emulators come out For mobile gaming theres the Steam Deck and sure Steam isnt perfect but theyre one of if not the least bad options,ms2t6zo,6.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms340xh,Eren69,,-3,2025-05-13 13:14:37,,,,That is why they now brick the entire console People with homebrew got only online banned but that didnt stop people from dumping the games to PC to be used with said emulators that has been used for piracy Enough people bragging about playing for free or bad excuse I need 4K now switch 2 comes out they will use the excuse I need 8k,ms2uftw,7.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms34q0s,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,11,2025-05-13 13:18:34,,,,That is why they now brick the entire console For now Its always going to be a cat and mouse game There will always be a way around whatever control measures a console maker puts in place Eventually the pirates always win All the RD and control measures you spend to put in place will eventually be beaten by the pirates Valve figured this out and its why theyre so wildly successful When Valve entered the Russian market they were told it would be an absolute failure That Russians would pirate everything That prediction was proven wrong as Russia became one of Valves largest markets it was their 2 continental European market behind Germany Though recent sanctions and such may have impacted this But thats not on Valve In general we think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world 24 x 7 purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer and the legal provider says the product is regionlocked will come to your country three months after the US release and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store then the pirates service is more valuable Most DRM solutions diminish the value of the product by either directly restricting a customers use or by creating uncertainty Our goal is to create greater service value than pirates and this has been successful enough for us that piracy is basically a nonissue for our company Gabe Newell,ms340xh,8.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3jyk8,genital_lesions,,2,2025-05-13 14:39:05,,,,Lol Sure Nintendo is pretty unique in which they make their own consoles and release 1st party games but lets be real here about market competition argument A lot of competing brands are owned by the same mega corporations Unilever Proctor Gamble Johnson Johnson AnheuserBusch InBev Nestle etc The market for like the last 80 years has been an illusion of choice,ms2t6zo,6.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms4fllb,CreativeGPX,,-1,2025-05-13 17:12:48,,,,Do you not understand that console exclusive games exist Of course Thats what I was responding to I was saying that its an unnecessarily high bar to assume that everybody even the minority of people so obsessed with a particular brand that theyll buy it no matter what must change their behavior for alternatives to exist Alternatives exist when enough people choose an alternative that the producer of the alternative can sustain themselves That can even happen when its a minority market but certain when its not the entire market Most people are not so wedded to brands that theyll buy them no matter what so its easy for alternatives to Nintendo to exist which is why they do Lol I would love to go back to that delusional kind of thinking The naive delusion is thinking that you should measure winning not by whether you get what you want but instead by whether you can override everybody else corporations you dont like consumers who want things you dont like etc from getting what they want What I described is a practical approach that is about tangible effects and achievable goals rather than naive idealism and inventing reasons to be upset Yeah duh thats why I said that Nintendo was unique Okay so your comment was unrelated to the discussion then Since I was reading your comment in good faith I assumed the fact that 23 of it was ranting about how there is no true competition in the past 80 years was because you thought that applied to the current discussion Where you did say Nintendo was you unique you said unique in which they make their own consoles and release 1st party games which in context sounded like you were saying that means it is its own market since you claim others dont do that Jesus Christ youre one of those neck beards A libertarian techbro JuSt tRuST tHe frEe mArKEtss Are you okay This reads like you just pulled random words out of a bag of Reddit buzzwords when you realized you didnt have a counterpoint to what I said If you dont have a counterpoint its okay to just not respond You dont have to invent a caricature to argue with It doesnt help you me or anybody,ms453ea,9.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms3tw3r,arthurdentstowels,,1,2025-05-13 15:27:50,,,,The point that I realised that I no longer needed a switch was when I accidentally got Breath of the Wild to work on Steam OS no idea how total accident That and the ease of emulation of basically any game from pong up to present day But yes if Nintendo cages in the hardware software and user base theyre going to have a problem Even Sony are allowing their big IPs onto PC and Steam now Surely making it accessible to every platform would only increase their sales,ms35rbh,5.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms8qb5g,norty125,,1,2025-05-14 09:35:29,,,,If we assume you agreed to this when you bought it and nothing changed after Im not sure if they can change things during a prepurchase since you can cancel it then youre basically buying the hardware and a license for their software Its like buying a laptop you get the hardware from say Dell and a license for Windows which Microsoft can deactivate anytime After that you can install your own OS,ms6kbcf,6.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms8rkpr,floluk,,1,2025-05-14 09:48:09,,,,Proprietary Hard and Software is a bit different Its an inseparable part of the product There was a case regarding this And the verdict was that if there is no alternative that doesnt include hardware modifications in any way readily available the software is part of the product and access cannot be denied to it Nintendo would have to open the Bootloader and provide documentation for their Hardware and attached devices Which wont happen in a million years Because that opens the door to cfw like Atmosphere see the hardware exploit on the Gen1 Switch Hekate is a bootloader that would be compliant,ms8qb5g,7.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms32xhm,TacoMedic,,-35,2025-05-13 13:08:15,,,,Yeah Ive never understood the mental gymnastics of piracy advocates Like I used to pirate games and movies back in high school Hell I still occasionally pirate audiobooks today to try them out first If I like the first 20 minutes of it Ill go ahead and purchase it on Audible But thats because theres rarely any trailergameplaydemo of audiobooks available to watch on YouTube like there are for moviestv showsvideo games But as a high schooler I bought exactly zero media that Id previously pirated I stole that shit and no argument about oh well I couldnt afford it so its not really a lost sale anyway changes that I stole that shit blatantly and Id wager 90 of piracy today is just straight up theft too Any argument to the notion that piracy is theft is always so full of loopholes you can pretty much ignore it I hate Nintendo for other reasons not least of which because I dont find their games fun but Im still going to buy a family system so that I can play MKSmash with my girlfriend and siblings This threat of bricking hacked systems using pirated games means nothing to me Edit Judging by the downvotes and replies everyone else is a noble warrior downloading the latest Assassins Creed in order to strike back against the evil of capitalism I am just an evil pirate vs the rest of you Thank you for this important lesson,ms2pj6b,2.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3joje,LeThales,,17,2025-05-13 14:37:45,,,,I pirated as a kid fuck kids today I got mine fun already mentality there Not that your positioning is wrong but it reeks of hypocrisy and baby boomer energy You UNDERSTAND why pirate something if you did it already And the arguments why its not theft its because it isnt Different crime When you pirate you dont cause a game copy to go missing you create a new copy for your own use It is still morally wrong but several steps less wrong than going to the physical store and stealing game CDs where not only the devs dont get money store owners lose money directly,ms32xhm,3.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3mj7i,TacoMedic,,-7,2025-05-13 14:51:58,,,,Its not hypocrisy because at no point in time did I ever think it wasnt stealing I just didnt give a shit I dont begrudge a store for instituting antitheft measures why would I begrudge a company from preventing it with their own products Its not like companies allowed piracy out of the goodness of their hearts before its just that they didnt have the means to prevent it like they do now Im not dragging the ladder up behind me I just understand that the company is protecting its own interests As to your comment about how its not really stealing insert my above comment about logical loopholes,ms3joje,4.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms5c5yd,ilulillirillion,,2,2025-05-13 19:49:31,,,,I dont think I pirated purely as an act of monetary theft and therefore that is the only motivation for piracy that could be real is as strong of an argument as you think it is There are lots of motivations behind piracy and in some cases sincerely held and reasonably defensible ideological ones as well as more tangibly compelling arguments like lack of access lack of ownership onerous DRM right to repair right to modify etc To simply discard all of that as nonsense because you didnt feel that way as a teen is not the way,ms3mj7i,5.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms37cns,Demanga,,1,2025-05-13 13:33:26,,,,I think youre right obviously there are the pirates who just like having more things and dont see how that might hurt game developers but maybe people are also gut reacting to the idea that there are poor people who will never get to own these kinds of things and point that unease towards these companies when they take the reasonable business decision to make piracy harder to use a pun I think its a case of people hating the player instead of the game,ms32xhm,3.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms873zk,RO4DHOG,,4,2025-05-14 06:17:14,,,,So the first step in hacking a switch is to disable the antipiracy function This is but a mere scare tactic and doesnt prevent modification Its also completely legal in the US for owners of a product to modify their device as protected under the Educational Act Just wait until peoples devices are disabled through a falsepositive detection Corporate greed nerfing consumer curiosity YOU CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE ALLOW YOU TO DO Nintendo At age 56 Ive been gaming for over 40years and NEVER bought Nintendo products Wife got a Wii for Christmas when it came out we bowled and found nothing else of intetest that we couldnt do on other consoles and our PCs I considered hacking the Wii for kicks but we just gave it away to someone who had nothing About what it was worth Being imprisoned by a companys Terms and Conditions that they can change at anytime after your purchase is disgusting,,0.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms3oibz,Rymanjan,,2,2025-05-13 15:01:40,,,,Well its not really their job to go seek out instances of illegal behavior just to judge them when theyre brought to their attention The law has been pretty fair to consumers in the US in this respect the courts usually side with gamers but you need a competent lawyer to bring the case to court for that to happen which is a daunting task Few lawyers want the smoke Nintendo brings its often a very intense very drawnout proceeding that can take multiple years to finally get a ruling on and most lawyers dont want to work that kind of case Most want something quick and easy even if its a surething Think of injurydisability lawyers its basically free money because they get to pick which cases they represent and only take the ones they know they can win but few places specialize in injurydisability law Why Its extremely lucrative Because their potential payday is at minimum 6mo away Same deal with suits against a giant like Nintendo theyll use their infinite pool of resources to keep delaying the proceedings asking for continuances wasting the courts time with barely relevant ramblings going through precedent for as long as they can You sue Nintendo in January you get paid in May two years later Meanwhile thats gotta be one of your only cases if not the only one The amount of work its gonna take means all other cases get either ignored or put on the back burner so thats 25 years of intense work all while not getting paid beyond retainer thats a hard sell,ms2wzgx,3.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms7ar4e,Scalybeast,,1,2025-05-14 02:16:33,,,,Nobody is claiming that you dont own the hardware even with the garbage copyright laws we have here but like you said the software running on said hardware is only licensed to you Frankly this needs to be tested in court With a computer if Microsoft decides to blacklist your machine you can install another OS On a device where that is not an option can a manufacturer legally turn your property into a paperweight by nuking the OS I think not but who the fuck knows,ms5sq87,1.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms35nlq,DavidinCT,,-1,2025-05-13 13:23:51,,,,Challange accepted Nintendo is full of crap This is scare tactic Nintendo uses to try to scare people They can ban you from online but actually damaging the hardware you own is a major lawsuit waiting to happen To actually damage a system to make completely unusable from software level would be a major class action lawsuit You could take them to court and you would win in the US at least This is like buying a car and modifyingprograming the cars computer to put in a turbo or putting a new CPUGPU in the computer you got like 23 years ago GO head Nintendo dig your hole deeper The hackers were watching Now with the 80 games and now this I give it 23 months before the console is hacked once released Maybe an emulator in like 46 months Nintendo did this and these threats they deserve it To think in 68 months after release Ill be playing Mario Kart world on my PC thanks Nintendo,,0.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3allw,pogisanpolo,,2,2025-05-13 13:51:11,,,,I follow the scene The original switch hack was pretty much a fluke thats unlikely to happen again Unless they mess up again and they have a really bad track record of that to be fair its likely going to take at least 2 years,ms35nlq,1.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms3ln1x,DavidinCT,,-2,2025-05-13 14:47:32,,,,Maybe I follow it too and I know some big hackers who cant wait to get their hands on it Motivation is not high on an off the shelf console unless there are anticonsumer things like Nintendo has done here I guess time will tell To set the record straight there has not been a Nintendo console that has not been hacked Every Nintendo console to date has been hacked in some way,ms3allw,2.0,1klj6dv

comment,ms2mwb0,Nattekat,,-17,2025-05-13 11:23:25,,,,And theres absolutely nobody that even considered that there may be a good reason for that change that doesnt go against EU laws Namely if your actions result in a brick directly or indirectly through actions by Nintendo or if Nintendo blocks your account which is required for many services they cannot be held responsible Nintendo isnt going to target brick anyone why the fuck does everyone even think that makes the most sense The real garbage is that you cant do anything without account but thats an industry standard at this point,,0.0,1klj6dv
comment,ms2nu40,lirannl,,5,2025-05-13 11:30:23,,,,But thats already the case If you modify a device and the device malfunctions in any way as a result of your modification the manufacturer is not responsible for that malfunction you are The only thing this clause grants Nintendo which they dont already have is the ability to target brick devices Everything else is already builtin to the concept of purchasing a device from a manufacturer,ms2mwb0,1.0,1klj6dv
