comment,m8wy8ao,NuPNua,,237,2025-01-24 14:31:11,,,,They were still making blank Minidiscs Crazy Loved that format perfect stop gap between Walkmen and MP3 unlike CD Walkmen which were too big by necessity,,0.0,1i8whih

comment,m9187wc,cutestslothevr,,18,2025-01-25 03:24:40,,,,Japan loves its antiquated formats Minidiscs are loved for having a better closer to CD sound quality than MP3s normally do Audiophiles have moved on to lossless files though since modern storage media has made file size less important,m8wy8ao,1.0,1i8whih
comment,m95o0dk,deknegt1990,,2,2025-01-25 21:16:13,,,,My father is an amateur radio maker and he still actively uses MD because its a quick format to play jingles bumpers and other soundbites in a way thats logical and easy for him to cue up ahead of time He has a PC to record with and play actual music but uses MD amongst every other format from the past 50 years to add to the recordings in a less cumbersome way since he doesnt have access to pro studio software other than Audition 10 he bought ages ago,m9187wc,2.0,1i8whih
comment,m9au33y,73893,,2,2025-01-26 17:51:16,,,,Has he ever looked into a Roland Sp404 Lots of space what hed use it for all triggered by pressing the pads Adding sounds is just dragging and dropping via usb or you can record straight into it with a mic in or the internal mic the 404 has,m95o0dk,3.0,1i8whih
comment,m9gsiyu,deknegt1990,,2,2025-01-27 15:36:18,,,,That would be pretty cool at least from my point of view but his entire studio is cobbled together with stuff he picked up on the cheap and he learned to make it work in his system so just buying something like that is kind of out of his playbook,m9au33y,4.0,1i8whih

comment,m92n7y3,NuPNua,,3,2025-01-25 10:58:09,,,,Not surprised they still love physical media there for people who live in tiny houses I know the format flopped in the US but a lot of people had them in the UK when I was in school Web MDs were the one people were rocking those 256mb MP3 sticks and I could store three times as much on one MD with meta data and all,m92ml3s,2.0,1i8whih
comment,m94fv1q,mhathaway1,,3,2025-01-25 17:39:36,,,,Im so confused by your comment which sounds genuine when I read it Why would people that live in tiny houses that have very limited storage space prefer physical media that they have to store on shelves If I had a super small space all I would want is a super nice laptop and have everything by digital media I have so much physical media right now because I own a huge house and at some point my possessions have taken over my house and I want to just purge it all,m92n7y3,3.0,1i8whih

comment,m8za2ne,YeahMateYouWish,,4,2025-01-24 21:06:40,,,,Yeah same here and disks were still relatively expensive too Digital storage got better and cheaper before blu rays were anywhere near as usefuldisposable as CDs or dvds,m8z8d0k,2.0,1i8whih
comment,m8zbbzs,dudeAwEsome101,,3,2025-01-24 21:12:39,,,,Yeah by the time Bluray came in price a bit thumb drives had large capacity at cheap prices and cloud storage was common Compare that to the era of DVDs where a thumb drives were pricy and had sizes in MB compared to 45GB of a DVD I remember having a few rewritable dual layer DVDs that made sharing stuff with friends at school a lot easier,m8za2ne,3.0,1i8whih
comment,m8zclod,YeahMateYouWish,,2,2025-01-24 21:18:37,,,,Sounds like weve had a similar journey with media I bought a pack of 10 DVDrw and used to pass them around with stuff on until thumb drives were cheap Did you have spindles of DVDR all over the place I did with movies on I found a blank 50 spindle a few months ago and gave them to my wifes dad as hes still stuck back in the dvd age haha,m8zbbzs,4.0,1i8whih

comment,m8yvy83,iosseliani_stani,,3,2025-01-24 19:59:23,,,,Theres a little rubber ribbonband thats part of the opening mechanism and that is usually the first thing to go since its prone to decay Though sometimes its just caked in dust debris and only needs to be cleaned out to work again and even if it has decayed its easy to replace if youre OK with taking stuff apart Of course I only use my drives burning capabilities for CDs now and even then only once or twice a year for the rare friend who still appreciates a physical mix CD I havent had to burn a DVD or Bluray in over a decade,m8xnkal,1.0,1i8whih

comment,m8zl3lb,Noctew,,6,2025-01-24 21:58:31,,,,HiMDs went out of production many years ago but regular ones were still being made MD was huge in Japan so they kept them available for a long time after they stopped making new recorders I hope they still have a good supply in their warehouses even if production ceases now I got a great deal on some NOS Sony Metal XR tapes when they dumped them years after production ended maybe itll be the same with MD,m8y7mms,1.0,1i8whih
comment,m8yotyk,AeitZean,,13,2025-01-24 19:25:47,,,,As long as someone is still making burnable blu rays I can use for backups then thats fine I thought the title meant sony were stopping anyone from producing any for a minute,,0.0,1i8whih

comment,m90dhyh,bluesmudge,,3,2025-01-25 00:26:01,,,,I was amazed they still made MiniDV cassettes since the cameras stopped being relevant 10 years ago I always thought Sony made the best tapes with the fewest dropouts I do still have a camera that record in HDV on MiniDV so time to stock up so I can still have some fun with that camera The footage has a unique look with a bit of a 90s00s handycam look because of the limited color space and dated sensor but with a semirespectable 1080i resolution So it could still be a useful tool in the future Sometimes you just want something that looks different to be visually compelling not something that technically performs the best,,0.0,1i8whih
