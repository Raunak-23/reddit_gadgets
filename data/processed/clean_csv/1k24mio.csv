comment,mnrax1w,shifty_coder,,259,2025-04-18 13:45:38,,,,Not surprised The assumption is that part of their updating pricing strategy includes less revenue for each console sold to maintain the originally promised MSRP and hit their forecasted sales targets They then try to spread that loss across their entire accessory line,mnr75eg,1.0,1k24mio
comment,mnrf7az,BigCommieMachine,,112,2025-04-18 14:09:03,,,,My guess is that the Mario Kart Bundle was created to cushion the blow of tariffs because they will say the 500 bundle includes 80 of software which wouldnt face such tariffs,mnrax1w,2.0,1k24mio
comment,mnrr20w,akibaboy65,,32,2025-04-18 15:09:33,,,,True Also Nintendo already launches brand new games day 1 at a 20 discount via the voucher meaning their studios are managed and budgeted in a way that a 50 price tag at games launch is viable and profitable for all of their models so its not like theres an inherent need for Mario Kart or anything to be 80 other than just pricing elasticity,mnrf7az,3.0,1k24mio
comment,mns4wq0,BloodandThunder98,,20,2025-04-18 16:18:56,,,,Voucher cant be used for Switch 2 exclusives last time I checked,mnrr20w,4.0,1k24mio
comment,mns656v,akibaboy65,,-7,2025-04-18 16:25:16,,,,Right Im just saying that Nintendos studios for years have been set up in a way that they can immediately discount games without any downside otherwise they wouldnt do it Id wager Mario Kart packed in at 50 is just to try and move consoles as much as possible and not due to any shenanigans with tariffs,mns4wq0,5.0,1k24mio
comment,mns9t2l,nicholasjfury,,4,2025-04-18 16:43:45,,,,My point is nintendo does not really make less money via the voucher program because it cuts out the physical retailer distribution and manufacturing out Now why do gaming companies not just lower the price on all digital games is another discussion with a factor of greed and also not pissing off retail partners,mns656v,6.0,1k24mio
comment,mnvmvls,darkmacgf,,2,2025-04-19 04:30:59,,,,Nintendo made all Wii U digital games 10 off for its first year of release Shortlived but nice,mns9t2l,7.0,1k24mio
comment,mns0hxl,nicholasjfury,,10,2025-04-18 15:56:30,,,,So the voucher is 9999 for 2 games so its 10 discount per game with the exception of tears of the kingdom Plus you need NSO And its digital only I would wager that retail partners get 8 to 12 dollars on a 60 game as their mark up not counting manufacturing cost And switch cartridges cost more to manufacturer then disc games I am also thinking nintendo raises the price 10 for games above 16GB that need the 32GB card because that is the real common factor between tears of the kingdom and Mario kart world On switch there were only 4 games released on 32gb carts Tears of the kingdom Witcher 3 Final XX2 asia only and dragon quest builders Japan only I would not be surprised if going up to 32gb adds another 3 to 5 ontop of the cost of the 8gb and 16gb carts nintendo normally used And 3rd parties maybe just eat it because porting games like the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 cost far less than developing new games for nintendo switchswitch 2,mnrr20w,4.0,1k24mio
comment,mns7690,akibaboy65,,6,2025-04-18 16:30:31,,,,Yes Bottom line is that Nintendo can sell their brand new games for 50 a piece on launch day and they arent folding studios and sending devs packing like their competitors meaning their devs and budget are managed in a way that 50 games is a viable price point Im not complaining that theyre 607080 well kinda on that last one Im saying that the grounds that they have to do pack ins and reductions due to tariff shenanigans probably isnt the case Its likely just to move product and post sales just like the purpose of the voucher is get you to buy two games instead of one even if you woulda bought both at 6070 anyway,mns0hxl,5.0,1k24mio
comment,mnsl1my,stellvia2016,,2,2025-04-18 17:38:43,,,,Its more nuanced than that They expect a certain amount of the overall sales of those games to happen on launch dayweek but given the Switch1 sold 150M units their games have a long tail of sales so that isnt likely to be the lions share of those games sales They almost certainly wouldnt take a 50 pricepoint for 100 of the sales of those games,mns7690,6.0,1k24mio
comment,mns967w,PM_artsy_fartsy_nude,,1,2025-04-18 16:40:35,,,,80 is for the physical copy The vouchers just give you downloads which are consolelocked and cant be resold Physical cartridges also cost money it used to be a considerable amount of money depending on the size of the ROM chip and are subject to tariffs Theres another reason and that is simply that if you adjust for inflation Nintendo games have been consistently around 80 for roughly the last two decades I imagine they just like that price point,mnrr20w,4.0,1k24mio

comment,mnuxwlz,TheGreatBenjie,,1,2025-04-19 01:35:16,,,,People bought it and dealt with it sure but when Sony needs to warn people not to buy it if theyre just on base PS4 which is what you claimed the Switch 2 should be compared to then I think its safe to say it cant run it or at the very least its not recommended I guarantee most of the people on that sub would say the same even the ones stubborn enough to keep playing themselves Yes quality mode is 30fps and performance mode is 40fps but the base ps4 struggled to maintain 30 full stop and thats not even considering the DLC which is known to be more performance intensive,mnuwqms,11.0,1k24mio

comment,mnx3vpc,CheesyFinster,,1,2025-04-19 12:51:25,,,,Nintendo could get away with pricing things like that at first because they had no competition at the time Until the PlayStation came out they were mainly competing with just Sega With the emergence of PlayStation N64 ended up slashing fhe prices of most of their games to 60 PlayStation was able to sell cheaper games that looked better and they could price them cheaper since they were put on a disk Fast forward to 20002001 The PS2 and Xbox releases making even more competition for Nintendo who just released GameCube Now having to compete with TWO consoles Nintendo slashes their prices AGAIN for brand new games to 4050 So all the talk of inflation adjusted is nonsense Because as time has gone on Nintendo has been able to lower their prices just to have a chance in the market They cant compete hardware wise but theyve been able to hang around because of their price as well as their exclusives Now theyre pricing their games at 80 Not just the brand new releases coming out but also the 10 year old games theyre re releasing for switch 2 Adjusted to inflation or not any games costing 80 at any time period is awful and the only way to fight it is with your wallets Which has been proven to work in the past,mnvl8df,2.0,1k24mio

comment,mod6kg6,stellvia2016,,1,2025-04-22 02:27:19,,,,It had far more to do with the cost of manufacturing game cartridges at the time than any sort of presumed monopoly by Nintendo Especially since a number of games actually extended the capabilities of the consoles by including extra memory or auxiliary chips Variable pricing was therefore the norm at the time eg Super Mario Bros 3 isnt possible with only the base specs of the NES It included extra memory etc in the cartridge Sega Genesis was a very solid competitor to the SNES in the US selling almost as many total units Games were priced about the same as SNES ones as well as shown in this 1993 ad Playstation won mostly on the back of their system being far easier to program for and including an onboard audio chip Though Im sure CDs being much cheaper than cartridges helped Therefore a lot more developers made games for the PSX Something like 10x more games The actual games had a tighter spread in price but were still variable from 4055 as seen here The extreme highend prices all died with the game cartridge but the variable pricing remained to a degree even into the PS2 era Games for that were anywhere from 4060 USD It wasnt until PS3360Wii era that you really saw the overall market tighten up on pricing and really cement in that 5999 msrp on consoles for AAA Ironically enough PC is where prices were much more consistent over time 4999 for the vast majority of things until Diablo2 broke the psychological barrier by releasing at 5999 60 then was 60 just like 60 today is 60 What are you talking about Your average fast food worker when the SNES came out made under 5hr in the US and today the pay in most places is 15 that is a huge difference Lets break that down into hours needed to work to buy a 60 game back then vs today My first job was in fast food for 425hr which would be a little over 14hrs to pay for a single 60 game Fast food in my area is now offering 1519hr so lets say 15 that would be only 4hrs worked to earn enough for one 60 game So you were absolutely paying that price back then,moatrk1,3.0,1k24mio
