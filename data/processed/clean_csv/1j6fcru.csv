comment,mgtrilu,Gaeus_,,2,2025-03-09 09:03:13,,,,See steamdeck and the OG switch At the laters release players would have preferred to have the charging port on top but it wasnt possible considering how the dock work Steamdeck fixed this and after its success a dock wa smade with an awkward cable to reach the on top usbc Dual USBc gives you a clean docking solution and a better way to charge while playing handheld,mgpj47a,1.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgtuz9a,Eruannster,,1,2025-03-09 09:38:48,,,,I imagine it will be useful if you are using it in handheld mode and want to charge it and not have the charging cable wrap awkwardly in your lap and you can have it pointing out in frontaway from you Also if you have the Switch 2 standing on a table with the kickstand you can access the top port bottom port would be blocked by the table,mgpj47a,1.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgr88p2,funnyfarm299,,17,2025-03-08 22:21:30,,,,There probably wasnt any WiFi 6E chips available when they started development Nintendos product life cycles start years before release,mgqbrmw,1.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgrm9yf,SHADOWSTRIKE1,,11,2025-03-08 23:42:07,,,,I mean the WiFi 6E standard released less than a year late 2020 after WiFi 6 2019 PS5 released in November 2020 a year after WiFi 6 released and supported WiFi 6 The PS5 Pro supports WiFi 7 Its terribly surprising that Sony could pivot to support WiFi 6 within a year of its release for the PS5 but Nintendo couldnt switch to 6E five years after its release I normally give companies a break for opting for 6 chips over 6E chips since adoption of 6Ghz routers isnt huge yet but its growing Even Verizons default home router offers it With the original Switch now in its 8th year of life this seems very shortsighted of Nintendo Especially after all the efforts of Nintendo to support Cloud versions of titles on the Switch I am so surprised that supporting 6Ghz wasnt a major goal for streaming purposes,mgr88p2,2.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgykglw,gramathy,,3,2025-03-10 02:32:42,,,,Other than game downloads theres not a lot of reason to have high bandwidth WiFi on consoles and even then thats more likely to be limited by your ISP and not your WiFi,mgr88p2,2.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgvraw1,fromYYZtoSEA,,3,2025-03-09 17:24:55,,,,If I were to guess 1 6E has fairly low adoption in terms of routers that support it Generally top of range only So only smaller subset of users would actually use it 2 6Es main benefit is that it uses 6GHz band which gives much faster speeds and less congestion but at a much shorter range a problem for a handled device Those speeds are most likely not necessary for a switch since gaming uses very little bandwidth and the only thing that would be faster is downloading games which are limited by the speed of the SD card or slow internal storage anyways So Id say very little benefit for very few people Nintendos choice allow them to save costs and it makes sense in this case,mgqbrmw,1.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgpnci6,alexanderpas,,16,2025-03-08 17:20:32,,,,WiFi rollout is slow now due to everyones routers sticking around Surprisingly ISP provided routers on high speed connections usually have a surprisingly modern WIFI chip to ensure the potential Wifi speed exceeds the speed of the internet connection For example If you have a 8 Gbps connection your ISP router will usually have at least a Wifi 6 chip and at least 1 LAN port capable of 10 Gbps with the routers with older Wifi chips being assigned to customers with lower speed connections This is also one of the reasons why you might need to exchange your ISP provided router when you upgrade your connection,mgpjv3c,3.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgqgwmx,rome425,,-6,2025-03-08 19:53:25,,,,I get your point While many people are still on WiFi 5 or 6 not including WiFi 7 in new devices seems shortsighted WiFi 7 is backward compatible so even if someones home network isnt upgraded yet the device would still function seamlessly By sticking with WiFi 6 Nintendo might be aiming to cut costs potentially planning to release an updated deluxe or pro version with WiFi 7 later,mgpjv3c,3.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgqjea4,Esc777,,9,2025-03-08 20:06:49,,,,seems shortsighted Does it really Remember the tech chain in WiFi is strictly just one number increasing in percentage Its just bandwidth and latency This is not like we wont support a file format because most people dont use it yet Thats a hard barrier and locks out future use Im certain the midlife revisions will improve chipsets But is anyone going to even notice if their switch2 goes from wifi6 to wifi7 without someone telling them I know in the world of gadgets part of marketing to people is sticking as many brand new logos of bleeding edge tech on the box because consumers want to feel up to date I just dont think this one technology matters as much for this console Such is the world we live in now where lots of tech standards are pretty good,mgqgwmx,4.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgqlxgi,rome425,,3,2025-03-08 20:20:24,,,,Fair point WiFi 7 does offer a pretty significant jump in performance over WiFi 6 but like you said its probably not going to be noticeable for most Switch users It really comes down to the specific use case,mgqjea4,5.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgqmn3r,Esc777,,2,2025-03-08 20:24:14,,,,Yeah the jump is significant Im actually waiting to buy a new router just for it Along with rewiring my house with cat6 for gigabit Ethernet to support my incoming fiber But Im a weirdo and I realize most people arent like me A lot of it is over provisioned,mgqlxgi,6.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgsn16v,remnantsofthepast,,2,2025-03-09 03:26:56,,,,I think Ive seen ISPs start putting their own APs out that have it but theyre bottom of the barrel so you still arent going to get out of it whats on the sticker I have a ton of streaming and IoT devices at my house so I saw a marked jump in everythings performance when I switched to 6e from 5 but Id be lying if I said my wife noticed it as well,mgsmfw6,3.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgoj6go,rotrap,,5,2025-03-08 13:39:03,,,,Has 6e been useful for you I probably need a different AP but it pretty much switches to 5ghz once I leave the same room the AP is in Was pretty disappointed with the usefulness of 6ghz so far,mgog0fj,3.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgornx2,rotrap,,2,2025-03-08 14:32:18,,,,Well both are 80211ax just the e uses 6ghz frequencies For sure there is a big gap for me for 6e when I am anywhere but the same room as the AP On 24ghz and 5ghz I get a connection and reasonable speeds On 6ghz I dont get a connection unless I force the other frequencies off and the speeds are lousy I still wonder if something is wrong with my AP as I would not expect it to be so much worse than 5ghz,mgoqw1h,5.0,1j6fcru

comment,mgp15x2,Waffleskater8,,2,2025-03-08 15:26:17,,,,Can you explain in crayon eating terms how 6E is better than 6 Is the 6GHZ band that much better Im just an idiot,mgojcwy,5.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgp30mz,ThatLaloBoy,,5,2025-03-08 15:36:16,,,,Much faster speeds and less lag compared to 6 Also potentially more stable connections since 6Ghz is much less congested compared to 5Ghz and 24GHz This may be more noticeable in congested areas like apartments where a bunch of wifi networks are in a small area The downside is the range is slightly less than 5GHz And technically 6E WiFi chips are more expensive than 6 but not by much,mgp15x2,6.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgp6oy7,Waffleskater8,,2,2025-03-08 15:55:12,,,,Ahh Thank you I bought a 6E router a few years ago for futureproofing and I think the only device that might use it would be my pc but I use Ethernet And I still use my iPhone 12 And I dont think the ps5 has 6E So much for futureproofing,mgp30mz,7.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgp7a5i,ThatLaloBoy,,2,2025-03-08 15:58:13,,,,For what its worth 6E is perfectly fine for now and it should last you for a few years if not longer Once most of your devices support WiFi 7 years later the price of routers will be more affordable and they should still be backwards compatible,mgp6oy7,8.0,1j6fcru
comment,mgq96t2,thetwelveofsix,,1,2025-03-08 19:12:35,,,,The number of devices that support 6GHz is rather limited but some mesh routers can use the 6GHz band for a wireless backhaul leaving more bandwidth in the 5GHz band for devices,mgp15x2,6.0,1j6fcru
