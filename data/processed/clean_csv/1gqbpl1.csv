comment,lwwngoi,chrisdh79,,158,2024-11-13 12:26:18,,,,From the article Tens of thousands of exposed DLink routers that have reached their endoflife are vulnerable to a critical security issue that allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to change any users password and take complete control of the device The vulnerability was discovered in the DLink DSL6740C modem by security researcher ChaioLin Yu Steven Meow who reported it to Taiwans computer and response center TWCERTCC It is worth noting that the device was not available in the US and reached endofservice EoS phase at the beginning of the year In an advisory today DLink announced that it wont fix the issue and recommends retiring and replacing DLink devices that have reached EOLEOS,,0.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwx1bfn,50calPeephole,,114,2024-11-13 14:01:04,,,,Makes sense You cant expect a piece of tech to have service updates forever However this does open the door for a future solution for this as Im sure theres people out there running on 10 and 15 year old routers with similar issues,lwwngoi,1.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxzqsp,kiler129,,42,2024-11-13 17:08:11,,,,To be fair also this device is 1015 years old already another poster mentioned 12 The manual literally references 80211n and recommends Windows XP with IE6,lwx1bfn,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx1uzvg,liftizzle,,11,2024-11-14 06:49:48,,,,And yet Microsoft issued critical security patches multiple times for Windows XP after it reached end of life Sometimes companies go out of their way to protect their customers and this should be one of those times for DLink,lwxzqsp,3.0,1gqbpl1

comment,lx29g0u,liftizzle,,4,2024-11-14 09:27:23,,,,Theres 60000 of these bad boys around the world The bad guys are constantly scanning the internet for vulnerable stuff to take over services like shodanio for example Anyone can at any given time easily take over these 60000 devices to build a large network commonly known as a botnet The botnet can then be used to leverage the power of the total bandwidth of those 60000 hacked routers Now imagine that 60000 people go to your local bank branch today and queue outside making it impossible to enter for the bank customers The internet works the same way this is known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack DDoS Some companies want to prevent such scenarios and not get their name dragged through the media mud Those companies take responsibility and protect their customers even after the official end of warranty and support DLink doesnt give a fuck This is a threat to national security,lx28hg2,5.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx2ppx1,mdedetrich,,5,2024-11-14 12:10:55,,,,As an alternative viewpoint these routers are extremely easy to replace unlike windows do the companies using windows xp are doing so because they are likely stuck on using xp Ie their software doesnt run on newer windows,lx29g0u,6.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx2u0no,liftizzle,,3,2024-11-14 12:44:21,,,,It depends In Asia where these mostly are it is normal for ISPs to issue them and theyre whitelisted to prevent people from connecting other gear Those customers arent replacing anything until their ISPs do In the West that might breach anti competition clause idk,lx2ppx1,7.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx4av1i,notfork,,2,2024-11-14 17:43:35,,,,It is the same with ISPs in the usas an option You can use your own router on some systems like coax using CMTS or GPON on CMTS they need to be white listed All of my ISP clients have a replacement cycle of between 24 years so no they would not have 60k 15 year old routers sitting in the wild I would consider anyone using a router that old to be OOS and require a replacement And expecting security updates on a 15 year old router is just wishful thinking,lx2u0no,8.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx2ce7h,humildemarichongo,,1,2024-11-14 10:00:51,,,,Thats a fair point and thank you for the view I think the practical solution is that they have to continue support but should the customers not also have planning around something going EOL to avoid this situation arising,lx29g0u,6.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx2f62z,liftizzle,,6,2024-11-14 10:31:10,,,,The chances that most of those 60000 devices being replaced anytime soon are slim to none Most users of this type of low end home router dont understand that they are affected even if you put it on the front pages The DSL6740C is a combination DSL modem and router that was released in 2013 Most people have no reason to replace their network equipment every 10 years especially DSL modems generally only get replaced when ISPs deprecate them and issue new ones or the customer switches to an ISP that issues another one or the customer changes from DSL to fiber ISPs replacing outdated customer network gear happens mostly in the West These devices were only sold outside the US which is also probably why DLink doesnt give a fuck Most of them are in Taiwan the primary military target of a large country notoriously known for carrying out cyber attacks and probably the largest budget allocated to hostile activities by the State Yes Taiwanese ISPs should replace the devices asap But in the meantime DLink should publish a patch so at least people have a chance to protect themselves From a DLink consumer POV if you bought a router 11 years ago that suddenly fucked you up and DLink refused to prevent it Would you ever buy their products again,lx2ce7h,7.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lx4bu4b,notfork,,3,2024-11-14 17:48:28,,,,If I bought a router over ten years ago and it stopped receiving patches I would consider it EoL and retire it Routers and dsl modems do not have an infinite life span And expecting companys to support stuff for that long seems like insanity We do not expect our phones to get ten years of updates and routers are much much cheaper So if ISPs are using outdated tech that has known security issues that is on them not on who they bought their routers from a decade ago,lx2f62z,8.0,1gqbpl1

comment,lwzutq5,Programmdude,,5,2024-11-13 22:49:56,,,,Because some foreign names are extremely difficult to pronounce for english speakers and it can be less hassle to simply use two names In your example I wouldnt have bothered changing Lee to Stan but what about Shi Ting rude in english or Ng how TBH for work you should be consistent in which name you use though because otherwise it would get so confusing,lwy2114,3.0,1gqbpl1

comment,lwwzhic,RZ_1911,,89,2024-11-13 13:49:35,,,,Affected router is 12 years old even Cisco would not bother with EOS UPDATES Second that problem is not really a problem exposing router management to internet is EXTREMELY BAD IDEA Even on new routers with support Third if you are not exposed Management on internet YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED Generic deployment does not exposé management to WAN Except if user Manually enable them in wan,,0.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwy9i5z,Leafy0,,6,2024-11-13 17:57:24,,,,Is it a modem or a router Headline and article says modem its normal for a modem to be managed by the isp,lwwzhic,1.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyjv9o,OverSoft,,4,2024-11-13 18:49:25,,,,ISP managed modems are usually managed over a separate VLAN The management interface is not commonly accessible publicly over the internet,lwy9i5z,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyxuci,RZ_1911,,-2,2024-11-13 19:59:47,,,,I highly doubt that there is ANY setting require CONSTANT management by isp Usually those devices is ONE TIME configured with isp specific settings and then those devices work till they die,lwyjv9o,3.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyzfeq,OverSoft,,3,2024-11-13 20:07:57,,,,Its not that they require constant management but for example many DOCSIS cable modems have frequency updates at least once every year not to mention firmware updates for basebands and the device as a whole This isnt rare almost every ISP which rents out its devices does this,lwyxuci,4.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwz2nfn,RZ_1911,,-3,2024-11-13 20:24:35,,,,First of all we talking about DSL There is nothing to change of i remember correctly Second if ISP requires centralized settings management They uses mass provision and automated configuration When router is configured to connect internal isp server for new settings and directives at least docsis do that That does not involve web management exposed to WAN so end user unaffected by this problem,lwyzfeq,5.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwz3h8f,OverSoft,,3,2024-11-13 20:28:57,,,,Yes Thats exactly what I was saying That the management interface ISNT exposed to WAN,lwz2nfn,6.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyx5aq,RZ_1911,,0,2024-11-13 19:56:16,,,,Since affected device is VDSL It combines modem and router functionality Modem on VDSL site And router NAT between VDSL and internal EthernetWIFI So generic user is not affected Unless it have dedicated ip address and manually opened management onto internet,lwy9i5z,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwwqsyw,challengeaccepted9,,44,2024-11-13 12:51:20,,,,So two things Id note 1 Time should be a factor here I dont think anyone would reasonably expect them to issue a security patch for routers from 10 years ago But these only reached end of life at the beginning of the year 2 If companies are going to adopt a policy of not providing support for critical flaws like this past the technical end of life date they REALLY need to make it a matter of course to issue maybe a final optional patch that allows people to install open source firmware on the router if that isnt already the case If a router is perfectly usable save for one critical security flaw and the open source community is able to issue a simple security patch to fix it they should be able to I appreciate the answer to the second point and the reason itll probably never happen is but then people would buy fewer routers and any goodwill brand loyalty as a result will be outweighed by the loss of new sales,,0.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwx2c58,Mindestiny,,16,2024-11-13 14:07:27,,,,End of life is end of life It doesnt matter when EOL hit compared to the vulnerability it matters how long they sold and supported the devices There will always be a one more vulnerability past the date,lwwqsyw,1.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxdil1,challengeaccepted9,,-1,2024-11-13 15:12:44,,,,Except 1 it isnt as simple as end of life is end of life Microsoft end of life for Windows 10 is next year except youll still be able to pay money for extended support More relevantly to this they also patched Windows XP well after end of life support in order to address Wannacry ransomware Even if the exploits for this critical security hole arent as potentially disastrous as Wannacry were talking about issuing a security update for a product that hit EOL less than a year ago Wannacry was patched three years after EOL 2 None of this prevents manufacturers from making it if they so wished so that hardware could have open source firmware installed that would allow others to patch it after EOL Any required patches to allow such modifications could be made available the day before EOL if you want to be really black and white anal about what EOL actually means,lwx2c58,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxihti,Mindestiny,,10,2024-11-13 15:39:32,,,,Again EOL is EOL Microsoft choosing to make LTSC available for specific use cases has nothing to do with a company that made DSL routers 10 years ago or any other company for that matter But it was just a couple months Doesnt mean squat There will always need to be a defined cutoff where support is no longer provided And nobody is going to just open source their proprietary firmware because but muh EOL,lwxdil1,3.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxtfsl,challengeaccepted9,,-3,2024-11-13 16:36:16,,,,Again EOL is EOL Microsoft choosing to make LTSC available for specific use cases has nothing to do with a company that made DSL routers 10 years ago or any other company for that matter Youre being intentionally obtuse here Your suggestion was the end of life cutoff means literally no more support after that point I responded that it doesnt always actually and gave an example of a company patching serious issues YEARS after EOL Youre right DLink doesnt need to follow Microsofts example They also dont need to follow your philosophy The decision not to patch serious issues very soon after EOL is their decision alone and one that other companies have been better at And nobody is going to just open source their proprietary firmware because but muh EOL Yes I literally said as much in my original comment but thanks for adding a touch of dickishness in your reiteration there,lwxihti,4.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxubxn,Mindestiny,,9,2024-11-13 16:40:48,,,,Youre arguing just for the sake of argument They are under no obligation to support a decade old product thats announced EOL date has passed Thats the end of it full stop,lwxtfsl,5.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyln2j,lurkerfox,,0,2024-11-13 18:58:13,,,,No the fact they stated was that EOL means EOL and that no further support should be expected or demanded Microsoft wanting to be the exception to the rule and voluntarily choosing to offer extended support past EOLthat they charge for due to the critical infrastructure that cannot be easily migrated from those old versions is purely Microsofts business Holding Dlink or any other company to that standard of postEOL support is completely and entirely unreasonable Would it be nice if they decided to release a fix anyways Sure But absolutely nobody should be crying over it of they dont and hold it against them because EOL is EOL,lwxtfsl,5.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwwxm84,Waterfish3333,,6,2024-11-13 13:37:33,,,,Definitely agree with number 2 Knowing US laws there would need to be legislation that the manufacturer be held harmless from anybody messing their stuff up with an unlocked device but if a company ceases support for a product it should be unlocked The EOL thing though is a deadline Its not like they announce EOL for tomorrow its well known and usually indicated months in advance at minimum and typically over a year So it doesnt matter if it was the beginning of the year or yesterday Saying EOL was only recently reached so keep patching means there is now a grey area of what recently means,lwwqsyw,1.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwy9ins,challengeaccepted9,,2,2024-11-13 17:57:28,,,,Yeah fair enough on the liability point On end of life Microsoft patched XP years after end of life to address Wannacry I appreciate that if you buy something with an EOL date you shouldnt expect support after that date But at the same time companies HAVE patched critical issues after EOL and much later beyond EOL than DLink would need to in this case,lwwxm84,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwxh8lv,VietOne,,1,2024-11-13 15:32:50,,,,Except who would develop the open source firmware Most modems arent actually locked down that much to be updated to a new firmware just like most routers are easily flashed with custom firmware because its a basic version check While I dont know the exact details of this modem the article doesnt mention that firmware is locked down So if its anything like just about every other DLink device its simply a matter of someone has to take the first step to create an open source firmware All the specs look to be public so it doesnt seem like theres anything stopping someone from making an open source firmware work with the modem,lwwqsyw,1.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwybhof,challengeaccepted9,,2,2024-11-13 18:07:22,,,,Well obviously thats a key question But if you go looking for it its amazing what kinds of gizmos people HAVE made open source firmware for And I said they should issue a patch to make it modifiable IF it isnt already Im making no assumption either way L My point was one of principle I guess If you buy a product that relies on regular updates from the manufacturer to functionstay secure you should be able to modify it after end of life so if anyone wants to patch security holesmaintain operability theyre able to Should apply to phones computers smart devices routers everything Its such an obvious step towards sustainability but as I already acknowledged it doesnt suit the business model of iterative hardware upgrades to sell at EOL So itll never happen at any significant scale,lwxh8lv,2.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwydg69,VietOne,,0,2024-11-13 18:17:17,,,,In theory that would be ideal but in practice someone has to do the leg work Its why even open source hardware eventually goes EOL because theres no one that is updating it Sure you could choose to download source and update it yourself but in reality its simply easier and more practical to buy newer faster updated hardware Router firmware is a perfect example Although in theory theres so many routers that ddwrt tomato etc support if you have a really old router chances are the newest versions of the firmware arent stable Because no one is testing and fixing issues that affect that hardware due to the handful of devs working on it So in the end youre stuck on old firmware anyway and if there is a security flaw youre equally screwed as this scenario My point is open source doesnt automatically make something useful past its EOL Someone has to find it worthwhile to keep the device alive by supporting it xontinuously And unfortunately devices that get support are generally the higher end enthusiast devices with more CPU RAM and features that someone wants to keep alive,lwybhof,3.0,1gqbpl1
comment,lwyf50f,challengeaccepted9,,2,2024-11-13 18:25:47,,,,My point is open source doesnt automatically make something useful past its EOL No it doesnt But I explicitly said my point was one of principle If products are always modifiable after EOL there are none of the barriers that there are now I have a cheap smartphone from 2017 that is still receiving updates Because of the open source community and because the manufacturer didnt lock people out of doing it No it doesnt mean itll get them forever But if the open source community stops developing updates for a device 1 I still have the option to do it myself if I have the expertise And obviously security patches are a ton less work than full system version upgrades 2 I cant hold anyone responsible for the fact this perfectly functional device is no longer reliable from a security perspective The advertised EOL has passed the vendor isnt stopping anyone fixing security holes there just isnt the expertise andor motivation At the moment the second criteria isnt happening so the third is academic,lwydg69,4.0,1gqbpl1

comment,lwwqoyt,NorysStorys,,10,2024-11-13 12:50:32,,,,While I understand the sentiment but also it also unreasonable to expect free support and updates for products in perpetuity it would skyrocket buy in prices and is a big part of why business and enterprise gear is more expensive you are paying for the extended support the products have that however isnt feasible for the vast majority of the consumer market And in regards to security if thats something thats required or important you should be on a regular upgrade cadence anyway as best practice is to phase out any tech that is older as exploits are more likely to have been found and not every exploit can be patched out I absolutely agree that tech needs longer shelf lives in order to combat ewaste but support for products in perpetuity also isnt a good answer either,lwwnv1k,1.0,1gqbpl1
