comment,mcrwvnd,-Badger3-,,4,2025-02-14 18:50:06,,,,Im old enough to remember when people would say this about shaders and tessellation Were at a point where games are starting to come out that require raytracing capable hardware and soon enough its going to be the norm I bought my AMD card with the knowledge thats its a little cheaper but its not going to last me as long as the equivalent Nvidia card And it absolutely is copium If AMD announced today they found a way to get raytracing working as well as Nvidia the pssh who cares about raytracing narrative in this subreddit would die overnight Its insane that people here treat wanting a graphics card that provides better graphics isnt a valid enough reason for buying Nvidia,mcr9z5v,6.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcwafj9,Jacek3k,,0,2025-02-15 13:19:42,,,,Because it is about priceperformance ratio If you have unlimitted budget then sure getting better product makes more sense In realworld scenarios tho you need to make compromises And having to pay much much more but only having few percent better card better raytracing or raytracing at all vs none yeah I can see why some people wont choose the best option,mcrwvnd,7.0,1ion9zy

comment,mcmcvih,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,11,2025-02-13 21:21:47,,,,Havent seen this many frustrated PC folks in a long time It was widely expected that Nvidia would go above and beyond the capabilities of the 4090 with this new generation Instead the 7900 XTX maintains most of its lead or only loses by less than 10 with a damned 5080 And the 5080 has less RAM than the 7900 XTX So much of the community was making fun of AMDs 7900 XTX last year now they are pissed at Nvidia for going the way of Intels CPU division and stalling on progress and overly relying on AI to boost frame rates,mckqqy5,1.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcl2dr6,akeean,,9,2025-02-13 17:44:51,,,,508090 are underwhelming because NVIDIA knew there wasnt competition in this tier this generation as AMD had failed to bring a Zen 1 like breakthrough moment with GPU chiplets to GPUs 4090 had so much more juice compared to 3090 because they had expected the 7900xtx to be faster but RDNA3 didnt quite pan out as expected So this gen theyll juice it with just driver locked bullshit definig industy APIs Neural texture mega geometry so AMD will have to play catch up with more things than just RT 5000 super series will just come with 50 more VRAM thanks to bigger modules scheduled to become avaliable Hopefully XDNA will arrive with a bang in 2 years,mckqqy5,1.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcl5rpi,peppersge,,6,2025-02-13 18:00:37,,,,How much of that is the symptom of the situation That it was just hard to make a particular jump if both AMD and NVIDIA had problems making a leap They both have to deal with the same technical obstacles required to advance the tech and are operating on roughly similar time frames between generations NVIDIA is probably about 1 release cycle ahead of AMD I am not sure how much of their philosophies differ such as AMD tending to have more CPU cores while Intel has faster clock speed that can really change how quickly they can make better hardware,mcl2dr6,2.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcl9w7b,akeean,,3,2025-02-13 18:20:20,,,,A lot Semiconductors is a gamble of betting on something 5 years down the line and then running with the things that panned out well while downplaying those that didnt AMDs thing that panned out were cores thanks to TSMC chiplet packaging and weakness was the inter chiplet latency while Intel being stuck on their node due to fabbing issues so they really optimizd their monolithic dies even switching fabs didnt pan out for them wich is why they likely wont make a profit this year Crypto AI just distorted the markets so much that everyone got so confused with what to provision now they are trapped by older products that were so overpowerd for what the market needs Pricing and thus consumer value is just something they can tweak in the last moment with consideration on how many wafers they had ordered years ago and now need to sell and how much money they can squeeze out of each distributed between wthe different designs they can print on them choosing the designs that make the most with some weeks lead time to swap between finished designs based on market acceptance,mcl5rpi,3.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcm3v87,peppersge,,1,2025-02-13 20:39:42,,,,How does that work for GPUs With CPUs we know that there are some similarities since every company tries to go faster Intel has just run into the 5 GHz wall faster For GPUs how does the balance between parallel process and clock speed work Does that also fundamentally change how certain things such as hardware ray tracing can function,mcl9w7b,4.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcmp229,akeean,,1,2025-02-13 22:20:03,,,,Modern GPUs already offer between thousands to tens of thousands of cores I These cores support fewer functions compared to a CPU instead they do a few tasks but accelerated by hardware ie vector math thanks to the many cores can do parallelizable tasks of types they CAN process way faster than a comparable in terms of complexity CPU See Hashing in Cryptomining That many more cores mean more of the die area is used by interconnects to all of those cores and maybe even between each other In Silicon these many cores of varying types are already grouped in dozens of clusters that handle various tasks and building an effective GPU in part depends on getting the ratio right for whatever the market most needs and to connect them all together so that data can make its way to all of them fast enough and that the work of splitting up work tasks keeps all of them fed with bites of just the right size and complexity Part of this is a software driver and application specific task not just a hardware design Intel in particular is still struggling a lot with that last part in their driver and maybe even task managing hardware after changing underutilized hardware arrangement that Alchemist had Thats why we see Battlemage cards losing a lot more performance when paired with weaker CPUs than similarly powerful competitor GPUs and why Intel GPUs have some very large and expensive dies for their actual performance They are probably not using their silicon very well most of the time Maybe RT workload is a big reason why AMD gave up on their chiplet based approach for their GPUs as it didnt scale that well in terms of performance per die size and thus cost used At the moment Raytracing workload still has some centralized bottlenecks thats also why the performance hit for enabling it is so high For example a common technique in computer graphics to limit how many polygons needs shading in a scene is to give all objects level of detail states so that the objects that make up the most pixels on the screen will have more polygons and that something that is only 20 square pixels on the screen wont require up 60 of the shading cores of your chip This means some games can switch between LODs a lot especially Unreal 5 with their Nanite that automates LOD states and can cause loads of LOD switching per second In Raytracing until now chaning a LOD state of a moving object required rebuilding a key Datastructure Nanites dynamism can cause LOD switching on every single frame Thats why Unreal 5 can have serious performance issues Some of that can be fixed via drivers and application optimization see the performance boost that NVIDIA Megameshes offer on older RTX cards see latest Allan Wake 2 update by optimizing how it processes RT workload and how certain Datastructures are updated Maybe API changes in new versions of Vulcan and DirectX will allow GPU makers to overcome bottlenecks and embrace chiplets with future GPU generations This would allow for better utilization of the silicon wafers and less waste which helps the potential price floor,mcm3v87,5.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcl1yj7,DonArgueWithMe,,9,2025-02-13 17:42:51,,,,Ive been saying for months theres a big difference between not competing with the 5090 and not making any better cards but nobody around here wanted to hear that They always make more than just 2 models in a generation so its wild people were so adamant there wouldnt be anything better than the 9070,mckqqy5,1.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcm1pv4,PM_YOUR_BOOBS_PLS_,,7,2025-02-13 20:29:38,,,,They always make more than just 2 models in a generation so its wild people were so adamant there wouldnt be anything better than the 9070 Are you dense AMD themselves have announced many times to the public that they will NOT be making high end GPUs this generation That means there MIGHT be a 9080 eventually but definitely NOT a 9090 All leaks point to there being a 9070 and 9070 XT at launch Thats it Those are literally the only cards that have been leaked for AMD so far and leaks get very accurate around launch times If any other models are on the way they are many months out and will like be 9060 level cards or below Youre high on copium if you really expect anything better than a 9070 XT this generation Edit And to be clear a 9070 with extra VRAM is NOT a better card for 99 of users Most games dont hit 16 GB of VRAM usage and if you arent hitting that limit having more VRAM literally provides NO benefit The 32 GB leaker has said that specific card is deliberately targeting AI workloads and will have a much higher price to reflect that,mcl1yj7,2.0,1ion9zy
comment,mcmhtyu,DonArgueWithMe,,1,2025-02-13 21:45:09,,,,Are you dense Im talking about people who said the 9070 would be the top card AMD offered for the generation and you along with most people here are misquoting AMD The 9070xt already proves I was right and you were wrong They never said they wont have a mid tier card They never said specifically what models they will or wont compete against They said they wont compete against the top end which they never really have They will not have a 5090 level card But that doesnt mean they wont be competitive at the 8001000 range Nvidia raised the top end through the stratosphere so 5001000 is mid tier and under 500 is budget Edit to add if you guys think amd picked the name 9070 without intending to make a 9080 you are insane,mcm1pv4,3.0,1ion9zy
comment,mtzb4eq,Both-Election3382,,0,2025-05-24 09:01:38,,,,Its exactly the same as a 5070 and 5070ti its not beating a 5080 Amd always snatches defeat from the jaws of victory They had a real opportunity with the 9070xt to give it 20 or 24gb of vram at launch to really offer something more futureproof nvidia didnt but dropped the ball Its weird because the generation before it they did offer those amounts,mcmhtyu,4.0,1ion9zy
comment,mu0y612,DonArgueWithMe,,1,2025-05-24 15:53:10,,,,Because the 7900xtx was a higher tier card You dont need 24gb of vram on what is intended to he a midterm card Its trying to compete in price not compete with a 5080 or 5080 And with what theyre currently offering everyone has been slashing Nvidia prices because nobody wants them Amd prices have remained high because people are buying them That shows amd is winning this generation which will set them up to continue winning if they choose,mtzb4eq,5.0,1ion9zy
