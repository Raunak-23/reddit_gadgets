comment,n5mmp7j,irishhighviking,,4,2025-07-28 15:55:44,,,,Im glad to see another drone in this space My Neo is great but could certainly be better Id like to see better resolution in portrait mode fewer flyaways and any competitor should also have prop guards A Neo can be had for under 500 with all the accessories you need Hopefully this creates even better pricing,,0.0,1mbhg0v
comment,n5mbzn7,H_S_P,,4,2025-07-28 15:05:14,,,,Sounds cool but it sucks theyre designing it with features to prevent you from being able to modify a thing you own,,0.0,1mbhg0v
comment,n5mfiw0,nitrofan111,,4,2025-07-28 15:22:03,,,,Thats pretty much any off the shelf drone If you want to modify DIY from the ground up,n5mbzn7,1.0,1mbhg0v

comment,n5mhs8o,garyb50009,,2,2025-07-28 15:32:48,,,,they explicitly state that the first drone will not be for tinkerers which is a pretty obvious way of saying the next iteration will without explicitly legally promising it,n5mbzn7,1.0,1mbhg0v

comment,n5mo924,chrisdh79,,1,2025-07-28 16:02:58,,,,From the article On specs we dont have a great deal of information on the brands first release yet But we can confirm that it will take off at under 249 g 88 oz so pilots wont need to register the cameradrone for recreational use The true immersive capture camera will boast an 8K resolution Antigravity is promising a few worldfirsts in drone design too that enable pilots to experience and capture the world in ways that werent possible before And 360degree videography will be made simple so that beginners experts and everyone in between can get creative Clearly that means the cameradrone will include a bunch of sensors to enable automated flight modes and obstacle avoidance with a live video feed streamed to a dedicated remote or a mobile control app Antigravity drones are made for the curious and the adventurous reads the press release Creators Travelers Families People with bold ideas but with limited time to learn complex flight controls and aerial content creation Its for anyone whos ever wanted a drone but felt it would be too big of an investment for something they may never be able to use to its full potential Like upcoming models in the fleet the first drone is not for hardware tinkerers and will include smart safety features such as payload detection to prevent misuse or unauthorized modifications The brand is also setting up an online community hub where users will be able to share thoughts and experiences that could impact future product development The cocreation platform intends to reward contributors who come up with ideas that make it through to new drones Every idea is read and considered and those that inspire future products or features will be rewarded accordingly Every contribution will be helpful in understanding what matters to users Thats about all we know for the moment Is the mini flyer set to duke it our for aerial supremacy with the likes of DJI Maybe But the immersive video chops are aimed at setting Antigravitys releases far apart from the other players so a oneonone dogfight may not be possible Well bring you all the details on the brands first 360degree cameradrone when its ready for takeoff,,0.0,1mbhg0v
