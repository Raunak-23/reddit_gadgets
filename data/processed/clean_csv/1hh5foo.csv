comment,m2qk8ej,Think_Shoulder3871,,0,2024-12-18 23:12:25,,,,I am really confused right now VAT is sales tax It is either 19 or 7 The price for an Item is 100 and on top are going 19 which means that you are paying 119 The Tax is subsidized which means you are paying 100 instead of 119,m2qjihr,8.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qnlmh,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,5,2024-12-18 23:32:43,,,,VAT is sales tax That depends It is either 19 or 7 Correct The price for an Item is 100 and on top are going 19 which means that you are paying 119 The Tax is subsidized which means you are paying 100 instead of 119 You arent paying you are paying EUR is not a unit is just a factor specifically the factor 001 If the net price is 100 EUR then the gross price is 119 EUR at 19 VAT rate 100 EUR is 16 less then 119 EUR Like 1 of 119 EUR is 119 EUR 16 119 EUR is 1904 EUR 19 of 119 EUR would be 2261 EUR The gross price is 19 higher than the net price therefore the net price is 16 lower than the gross price,m2qk8ej,9.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2shsn0,scarneo,,0,2024-12-19 07:27:04,,,,The conversation didnt start like that you are more than welcome to go back and read it It was stated that you are saving the 19 VAT which is 16 of the total but that is not how you state it In any invoice when you are referring to a professional setting it is stated that you are saving 19 because you were paying the 100 from the beginning,m2sh3wv,20.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2s2th2,Asttarotina,,1,2024-12-19 05:07:31,,,,Lets have a lession How much will a 100 net item cost with different tax levels With 10 tax it will cost 110 or 10 higher than net price With 19 tax it will cost 119 or 19 higher than net price If the item has a sticker price gross of 119 how much will it cost with different discounts With 10 discount the final price will be 119 1190 10710 or 10 lower than 119 With 16 discount it will cost 119 119016 9996 or 16 lower than 119 With 19 discount it will cost 119 119019 9639 or 19 lower than 119 If you paid 100 instead of 119 you saved 16 100 is 16 lower than 119 Which is 19 lower 119 is 19 higher than 100 Which is 19 higher Because with percentages you have to keep in mind not only how many percent but also percent of what value In 2 previous lines values to which percentage applies are different,m2qna86,10.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2so3oa,flingerdu,,1,2024-12-19 08:36:51,,,,You compare it to the after tax price If you pay 100 instead of 119 which you would have to pay regularly you save 19 compared to the 119 which are drum rolls 16,m2qna86,10.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2quf91,skaterhaterlater,,3,2024-12-19 00:14:18,,,,But you arent saving 19 of the purchase price The purchase price is 119 If you purchase the item for 100 you got a 16 discount This is just how percentages work 50 of 100 is 50 But 50 of 150 is 75 Likewise 19 of 100 is 19 but 19 of 119 is 226 16 of 119 is 19 which is how much you are saving 16 off the purchase price,m2qqtgk,9.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qwd2r,None,,2,2024-12-19 00:26:00,,,,You need to be specific I feel you two are talking about different things If the net price is 100 with VAT it is 119 That is correct But if the VAT is then dropped to 0 you pay 100 instead of 119 So your paying 16 1100119 less compared to the price with tax But you are saving the 19 VAT on the net price The basis for the VAT is 100 while the basis for the calculations of the savings is the price with tax 119 Imagine VAT would be 100 you would pay 200 for an Item with a net value of 100 200 is 200 of 100 but 100 is 50 of 200 Same principle If a business is running a sale like We gift you the 19VAT as the German electronics chain Mediamarkt is doing frequently the price you pay at the Cash register will be 16 cheaper than the usual sticker price Saying I got 19 off would be wrong as you paid 16 less However saying I didnt have to pay the 19 VAT would be correct Even if technically wrong since Mediamarkt just calculated VAT based on the sale price,m2qqtgk,9.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2s2dns,samstown23,,1,2024-12-19 05:03:57,,,,Totally It was a nice incentive initially but in the mean time the price drop has been so massive that it dwarves the savings through VAT Just for comparison in January of 2023 when all things PV became tax free a state of the art panel retailed for about 150 assuming you only bought 24 a piece Currently a slightly better panel is a little over 50,m2p3mne,2.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qwuju,None,,113,2024-12-19 00:28:58,,,,Saved to date over the course of roughly 5 months BUT it really depends on the price you pay for electricity I switched providers since my old one increased the price to nearly 40 cents per kwh now I pay 25 cents The price for these balcony modules itself also decreased drastically A year ago you would pay at least 400 to 600 and the max allowed output was 600 Watt The government also got rid of the taxes on solar panels So instead of the 19 its now 0 It should take me 4 to 5 years to recoup my investment And in the end it really makes a difference how much of the electricity you really use yourself I make sure to turn on a lot of things only during the day like my dishwasher or the pool filter charge batteries for my tools lawnmower or my ebike stuff like that,m2qgwuc,2.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2rpg87,jasonisnuts,,15,2024-12-19 03:28:21,,,,For 9999999 of Americans no The reasoning is that the infrastructure is so expensive to build out and there are no guarantees that customers will sign up it wouldnt be worth the expense So instead the government gave power companies and cable TV companies monopolies that are SUPPOSED to be regulated by the local state and or Federal government The downside is these companies are still allowed to operate as forprofit institutions and use a lot of that profit to bribe government officials So every year when rates increase the companies will make up reasons why they didnt make enough money for their infrastructure and blah blah blah crap Fun fact in some areas power companies will actually charge you even if you install solar and power yourself 100 off grid And if you make enough solar power to send BACK to the grid they will still charge you a connection fee,m2rabb8,5.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2ta7ay,bal00,,12,2024-12-19 12:27:49,,,,Note that you dont need multiple grids to have competition In places where you can switch providers other power companies simply pay the local grid operator for access and metering services but they supply the power So even though theres only one grid you still get to choose who you buy your electricity from,m2rpg87,6.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2xacwy,kb_hors,,7,2024-12-20 02:36:04,,,,The power companies ie the company who you are a customer of dont supply the power They dont usually own power stations thats another company What is going on is that there is a complex artificial market where the companies that own all the power plants pretends to sell so many gWh of energy to your power company who then goes to the power grid owner and pretends to buy the right for that electricity to travel between the power plants and your house At the end of it the self described power company has the right to recoup its cost by setting a price per kWh to charge you for In reality what happens is that it doesnt matter who your power company is The electricity from all the power stations on the grid all mixes together and flows to where it is consumed regardless Changing from one company to another changes nothing about where the electricity is coming from or how it travels to you it just changes what company is responsible for collecting money from you The whole thing is completely pointless and fake and was invented purely to create new STONKS where there previously was none,m2ta7ay,7.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2v40ph,looury,,1,2024-12-19 19:02:14,,,,Infrastructure in germany is super expensive as well and because of high redundancies and other expensive investments we have to pay a lot for electricity We call it Netzentgeld Its a fee for building and repairing the energy grid and its about 20 to 25 of your cost per kwh The result is a super stable powergrid On average a german household is 15 minutes without power per year the European average is about 30 to 60 minutes and US citizens are on average 55 hours without power per year The price for 15 minutes is insanely high as you can imagine By using a fee to finance the grid your local energy provider can not claim the powerlines for himself because the consumers are paying for them as they use them So we can choose whoever we want but its still very expensive,m2rpg87,6.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2th279,samstown23,,2,2024-12-19 13:19:37,,,,Thats pretty much it The meter balances whatever you produce across all three phases so if you inverter delivers 600W but youre currently using 900W you get billed for the difference ie 300W If you produce more than you use it just goes to the grid Things can become a little more complex with very old electrical installation in very poor conditions but for 90 its no more than plugging in the inverter,m2tfnkl,4.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2z3v6u,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-20 12:50:31,,,,a Is probably because it would be prohibitively expensivethey dont have any shipper that would handle it Solar panels are huge so you cant just put them in a parcel b My guess would be that thats a matter of demand ie economies of scale But yeah you totally can just drive to Germany pick them up and resell them whereever I mean you can buy them in hardware stores its not like anyone would check your nationality before you are allowed to buy stuff Admittedly youll pay more there than the best offers you can find online though certainly no 800 EUR but in any case any of the other sellers certainly would be happy to sell them to you and if you buy a lot I would think that you probably could get a discount I mean look at it this way What is the price for solar panels by the pallet in your country Those probably will be in a similar range of 50 to 60 EUR a piece And as for the micro inverters you probably can have them shipped anywhere from shops in Germany,m2y7qug,6.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2z7cvv,Tupcek,,1,2024-12-20 13:16:45,,,,a prohibitively expensive like more than 500 per kit Really You could fly an private airplane for this price b economies of scale What does this have to do with buying kit in Germany and shipping it to any other country solar panels do cost about 100 per 500W panel in any other country about 250 for inverter 60 for shipping thats what Lidl says in their german website that it is included in that 200 price cables So at least 500 without VAT for same thing that you can buy in Germany for 200 It does make zero sense that no one imports it from Germany unless it is special price only for Germany and any business that wants to export it gets higher price,m2z3v6u,7.0,1hh5foo
comment,m30xk30,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-20 19:21:15,,,,a prohibitively expensive like more than 500 per kit Really I mean international shipping often is surprisingly expensive especially for low volume But also Id think its more a its so expensive we wont bother with even offering itwe wont even bother finding a shipping company for it b economies of scale What does this have to do with buying kit in Germany and shipping it to any other country More that your local demand is too low to have anyone put in the work to optimize things while demand here is so strong that people have bothered to work out deals with shipping companies for example and for that matter for shipping companies to be interested in working out a deal in the first place The point is that is it a bit of an unusual product that you cant just feed through the normal logistics for consumer product delivery in that it is very bulky and also somewhat delicate so you need to work out solutions for efficient logistics which only is worth it if there is considerable demand After all they were considerably more expensive here not too long ago too but the price has been dropping steadily over the last few years with somewhat of a peak when the RussiaUkraine war started solar panels do cost about 100 per 500W panel in any other country If you buy a pallet Seriously That is very surprising indeed As you can see mydealz currently lists a pallet 36 pcs of 445 Wp panels for 1985 EUR incl shipping so 55 EUR per panel With VAT that would be 65 EUR There is even currently an offer from Hornbach hardware store chain listed for individual panels for 54 EUR at the moment that would be for pickup from the store It does make zero sense that no one imports it from Germany unless it is special price only for Germany and any business that wants to export it gets higher price It certainly isnt though apart from the VAT exemption There are other subsidies available but those are paid out to the entity operating the solar system Also I just looked at one of the offers on Mydealz for a Hoymiles 800 W inverter from elektroland24de they do offer parcel shipping to EE FI GR IR IT PL PT HR LV LT SK SI ES SE CZ HU for 3490 EUR the inverter is priced at 10599 EUR without VAT and the article description even explicitly notes that a different VAT rate might apply for delivery abroad so you certainly can get one of those delivered to your door for less than 250 EUR and presumably you could order more than one for the same shipping costs Based on the article descriptoon they even seem willing to deliver balcony systems abroad but the shipping costs arent specified Now I know nothing about that shop but at least it doesnt seem like there is noone who would sell to other EU countries,m2z7cvv,8.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2r1kt6,polite_alpha,,1,2024-12-19 00:57:52,,,,Just because CATL can make cells for 50 doesnt mean thats what the systems go for That 66 is total system cost not cells The whole 16GWh battery including everything costs 1bn You looking at news articles is different than seeing multiple actual quotes per week that go to customers Im well aware that prices in the US and elsewhere are still higher than in China tariffs certainly dont help here but this was an auction in China with over 75 companies bidding and they were all pretty low the winning bid was 66kwh and chinese projects simply never accept cost overruns so this is gonna be the final price If you were in the industry youd know that residential solar is shrinking rapidly I mean Im in Germany and here its still growing rapidly as you can see by this article Im confused by this statement Not sure where on earth PV is slowing down Economies of scale are hitting hard everywhere,m2qz81r,6.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2rb0q4,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-19 01:55:41,,,,Im taking about the customers of independent generation plans the electricity distributors If a solar plant decides to charge a huge amount over their production costs then it will be undercut by a competing plant that is willing to profit slightly less per unit to get more of the business A power generator can not have more business than selling all the power they generate So why would they undercut a competing plant if they are already selling everything they are generating at the same price as the competing company There is currently a glut of solar generation capacity that will compound this too Yes bringing more cheap generation capacity is what will reduce prices because it prices expensive generators out of the market But as long as cheap generators cant cover demand prices will stay high Thats how markets work What you are describing is essentially a price fixing scheme something that is universally regarded as harmful to end consumers and often illegal No it isnt The merit order price is what you get in a free market without collusion Well there is a reason that electricity averages 015kWh over there in the US and 040kWh in Germany Yeah obviously there is a reason And what is that reason Are you saying that the problem with the German energy market is a lack of regulation No I suppose so if it really does lack basic price fixing rules but I find that hard to believe and am beginning to doubt that your entire argument makes any sense as a reason for high energy costs No it doesnt The prices are not the result of price fixing,m2r8gty,9.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2ph6es,loljetfuel,,1,2024-12-18 19:45:12,,,,If I can produce apples at 1 cent per piece while everyone else can produce them only at costs of 1 EUR a piece then I obviously will still sell my apples at 1 EUR because why would I not Thats kind of the opposite of the stated scenario if were trying to compare applestoapples sorry couldnt resist The situation is more like I produce apples at 1kg but literally everyone else can produces the apples for 001kg In most markets your expensive orchard would likely just go out of business Or if theyre savvy marketers theyd convince some small segment of customers that their expensive apples are worth it If they do the latter other producers might increase their prices _some_ because hey were not charging as much as you Still a good deal But as a general rule the market doesnt rise to the prices of the most expensive provider Energy markets though would set the price of all apples currently for sale at 1 or a bit more,m2p2vv2,6.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qgk4y,DealMeInPlease,,2,2024-12-18 22:50:58,,,,Market buyers do not care about production cost they buy value stuff worth more to each individual than the price Markets care about MARGINAL costs and revenues if we have a single price marketplace then the price will be such that the margin revenue price is equal to the marginal cost of production In the electric example if the marginal cost of the last unit of power demanded is high then the price will be high regardless of the marginal costs of the other producers Of course in the longterm if entry is possible then capitalists are incentivized to build more low cost of production capacity If enough is built then the high costs producers will fall of the supply curve and go out of business As an aside this is the problem that nuclear power faces in the USA In the good old days the marginal highest cost producer of power was a gas turbine generator which is expensive With the development of CCGTs and the low price of gas due to fracking and now solar and wind power the cost of marginal power has decreased so nuclear power plants generate much lower revenues than historically for the same power output,m2q8xqq,8.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qi8bc,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-18 23:00:37,,,,Yeah and solar has a similar effect and is a big reason why building new nuclear is probably stupid in most places as solar is so cheap when it is available that nuclear can not earn any money at that time and thus the huge upfront capital expense has to be earned back during less and less hours in a day which then prices it out of the market there too,m2qgk4y,9.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qf45f,auge2,,1,2024-12-18 22:42:47,,,,Yeah well thats what each and every single inverter from those solar arrays will do Thats part of the requirement from the german state inverters have to be approved part of that approval is that theyll shut down on power loss grid side Also limited to 800W output power on the inverter in order to not roast your local circuitry in case of an electric fault Any bigger solar installation must be approved and installed by a professional electrician,m2q67q5,6.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qen8r,auge2,,1,2024-12-18 22:40:09,,,,Yes thats what the article is talking about Most people dont use a battery but itll drastically improve your savings since you are not allowed to sell back the power with those small solar arrays,m2pu5jo,5.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qek33,auge2,,2,2024-12-18 22:39:40,,,,Yes and no 1 No you cannot sell the 800W directly when using the easy way that is Buy the panels inverter mount them plug them into any socket This is only allowed if you follow two simple rules First you have to selfregister with your state and second the state then has to check if your power meter is modern enough to not run backwards If it is theyll change it for you Then your panels power output will just stop your power meter as long as you generate enough power for your own consumption any overproduction will not be metered and youll just gift it to the power grid company This is limited to max 4 solar panels max 2kW peak max 800W output of your inverter to your socketplug 2 You can go the more difficult way and apply for a real solar array which will earn you money This could technically be the very same 4 panelsinverter combo from the previous point but with major differences First youll have to pay a professional to install and check everything secondly youll have to get a bidirectional power meter third the state will check if it got installed correctly if the local power grid can handle the overproduction etc its a lot of bureaucracy And quite expensive In the end youll earn something like 712ckWh produced and pushed into the grid Since the second point is expensive and takes a very long time to get approved people tend to install big arrays instead of small ones if going down that route The first one is a quick selfinstallation with almost no approval required but you can just lower your own consumption not earn money by selling power,m2pq0nl,4.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2ummzd,themiracy,,1,2024-12-19 17:20:38,,,,So questions are they just not commercially available or is there some reason they could not be used here Also they said a battery storage would increase cost by at least 1000 euros are there really home batteries available at that kind of cost So we have two homes in the US right One of them has a lot of tree cover and analyses have always said it just doesnt get the sun needed for solar or in any event the yield is not enough that they would finance it The other one is wide out in the open and will almost certainly get solar and a storage battery when we get the roof replaced because it almost certainly would produce more power than it uses But it seems also like there is not a reason why small installations on the south facing sides of homes could not make more sense more often even when rooftop does not I see side of home solar not on roof sometimes so I dont think there are any zoning or regulatory barriers to it,m2oj9yo,1.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2oumgk,JMGurgeh,,54,2024-12-18 17:47:34,,,,They are required to have antiislanding presumably built into the converter So if the grid goes down it shuts itself off they arent intended to be a backup option So no major safety issue assuming they work as intended but thats true of any gridtie system,m2opocx,1.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qxl1q,JMGurgeh,,4,2024-12-19 00:33:24,,,,It sounds like there is some planning required including replacing the meter if it is too old to be compatible In general no reimbursement for excess power contributed to the grid so there is builtin incentive to keep the systems relatively small basically targeting a households base load,m2qvxex,3.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2rc3sp,will7419,,1,2024-12-19 02:02:20,,,,Yeah absolutely I think its a great idea as long as it has the anti islanding that you mentioned and the meter can handle the backflow then I dont think it needs to have any reimbursement or anything since its meant to be really simple But exactly what you said is the main use case to cover your base load in the middle of the day and then just offset the rest of your usage with a quick payback period considering you dont have to pay for the installation labor Id this was available locally Id get it in a heartbeat,m2qxl1q,4.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2pahtw,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,24,2024-12-18 19:10:12,,,,Usually its standard 400 W glas panels but you can buy them with flexible panels too But other than that yeah you just plug them into a wall socket thats the point so you have minimal installation overhead Its as safe as any other appliance that you plug into a wall socket The inverters are required to have fast antiislanding so if you unplug them they drop the output voltage to zero in a few milliseconds and they are limited to 800 W output The wiring for normal wall sockets is designed for 16 A continuous load plus some significant safety margin so the additional 35 A are considered safe with any installation that is to code,m2or2cu,2.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2tpl10,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-19 14:15:38,,,,Technically that is an orthogonal question So there is nothing that would prevent you from selling back the electricity generated by those systems But the goal of the invention if you will was to create a lowoverhead option for regular people to participate in the energy transition at a small scale And in practice your average household will consume a large part of the generated electricity anyway so people usually dont bother with the burocracy to get paid for the usually pretty small amounts of electricity that they end up feeding into the grid Some see it as a donation towards the fight against climate change I guess I mean these systems under optimal conditions will generate maybe 800 kWh in a year If a household uses 600 kWh of that that would leave some 200 kWh that are fed into the grid so they could get maybe 15 EUR for that It should be noted I guess that you are only allowed to connect one of these systems per electricity meter which usually means one per household Or rather that applies for the simplified process ie plugging it in as a layperson and registering it with the national database is all you need to do an electrician in principle would be allowed to hook up as many of them as you want but then you also would need to ask the utility for permission and stuff so that doesnt really make much sense and youd rather just install a regular solar system instead,m2tbm3w,4.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2u3ozg,None,,1,2024-12-19 15:37:17,,,,I dont think this is legal in the US If you have a gridtie system its a headache and requires an agreement to sell back to the provider if you produce more than you use I love the idea of this It would be terrific to be able to offset usage At a max of 800 watts its unlikely to reverse the meter I have an off grid system on some land but also have an energy store However during the day my 1600w of panels are enough to run my cabin and AC unit entirely on solar do a couple of hours dying the middle of the day Hopefully this sort of innovation will make it here eventually,m2tpl10,5.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qhc6c,auge2,,4,2024-12-18 22:55:28,,,,Thats why only small units up to 800W are allowed without approval A couple 800W units in a city block wont hurt the grid at all Imagine a household in the evening people are cooking showering watching tv some are heating with electricity A base load of 200W up to 36kW in the evening this can spike up to 2030kW for a single household Sometimes more So lets say 5kW for now Grab 40 houses with the same load on one big block transformer Thats 200kW Now grab 20 of those houses with an 800W solar array at high noon Thats 16kW Only 8 of the evening base load Thats nothing In reality even more houses are on a single transformer the spikes are even higher and way waaaay less households have solar Those small units are still way below 1 of all households It doesnt matter Any bigger solar installation has to be checked and approved for that reason To plan it into the grid with remote connections to the grid management system And in reality this summer over 30 of the whole energy produced in Germany came from solar It doesnt make the grid unstable Its already planned into the grid,m2qc57s,8.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2tirwv,Pogman1337,,1,2024-12-19 13:31:21,,,,Yes but then it isnt cheaper in the sense of what it will cost someone to buy the amount of energy they need You claim that 60 came from renewables but then only linked a capacity Is this 60 of the total consumption or what is the actual number of produced energy vs consumed per energy source In your last paragraph where you compare energy prices you compare germany with eu when you should be comparing germany to finland and france What do those numbers look like if you do that comparison,m2tg5bg,6.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2we81b,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,1,2024-12-19 23:14:09,,,,Current prices in europe also seem to indicate that it is not cheaper with renewables atm That is misunderstanding how markets work Currently renewables usually arent sufficient to meet demand so the market price is set by fossil primarily gas power plants At times when renewables are sufficient to meet demand is when electricity is cheap When France had issues and now Germany is completely dependant on the EU market for their mistakes No Germany is not dependent on the EU market thats a propaganda myth There are by far enough power plants in Germany to meet all of Germanys electricity demand But more often than not producers in neighbouring countries offer electricity cheaper than those so thats why we buy from them Also the imported electricity is to a large part renewable power like wind power from Denmark because that is what tends to me cheap,m2saw1u,3.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2rz2lq,JohnnyKeyboard,,0,2024-12-19 04:38:04,,,,AI question Is there any truth to this statement In the USA most states have already made it illegal to have homes connected to solar power if access to a power grid is within close proximity AI response That statement is false Most states encourage solar power Many states have laws and incentives specifically designed to promote the use of solar energy No widespread bans exist There are no widespread state laws that prohibit homeowners from installing solar panels if they are connected to the grid However there are some complexities Local regulations Some local governments cities counties may have regulations regarding solar panel installation such as zoning restrictions or aesthetic guidelines Utility company rules Utility companies often have rules and regulations regarding how solar systems can be connected to the grid These rules can vary significantly Where to find accurate information State energy agencies These agencies provide information on statespecific solar policies and incentives The Database of State Incentives for Renewables Efficiency DSIRE This online database provides detailed information on state and federal renewable energy policies In summary while some local regulations or utility company rules may exist the vast majority of states support and encourage the use of solar power,m2qn93o,1.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qc022,mratkinson08,,1,2024-12-18 22:25:24,,,,You have 2 consider you get savings in a couple of ways 1 Some of these panels collect light from both sides which increase their ability to gather energy significantly just from the light reflected from the side opposite to the panel 2 They create shade which can also improve your energy usage profile jut by cooling the area normally exposed to the sun 3 You are not spending on an installation so their price point is significantly lower and you are not so worried about not sucking every penny from the sun For sure angling the panels would potentially increase their efficiency but at their price point and considering how expensive electricity is in a lot of Europe the savings are still very substantial and close to a nobrainer especially if you have a southfacing balcony,m2pjf1k,1.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qgixb,Tachyon9,,2,2024-12-18 22:50:46,,,,Thats where Im coming from though I live in Texas Putting up solar panels is a double whammy for us because it gives us shade that reduces the heat on our homes while also helping to power AC systems in the hottest time of the year Our peak energy usage coincides with peak sunlight mid summer The whole duck curve thing is a problem but we can make up for that in different ways In a place like Germany its much more likely that you want to keep the heat in while not having AC at all So peak power usage comes at night in the winter When sunlight is already limited and at a bad angle This doesnt really help you much outside of simple small reductions during low power times Again offsetting any cost at all is great Utilizing renewables is also great Im just not sold on this being a major contributor to power usage in places that need nighttime generation more than anything else,m2qc022,2.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qhnks,foundafreeusername,,1,2024-12-18 22:57:17,,,,It depends on what you mean by efficient It doesnt use the solar panel efficiently if you mean that It works because power costs have a very high tax and fees on it More than 50 is just overhead Most savings dont come from selling power generated but reducing your own tax bill on your own power consumption and as such tax and fees It also works for the entre country because the people using solar at home use the grid less and as such reduce the need to further upgrade it maintain it Solar battery power is sometimes cheaper than maintaining upgrading the power lines so this system accounts for it Otherwise you risk having shiny new power lines to places that dont actually need to buy your power edit typos,m2pjf1k,1.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2q76e8,Hendlton,,0,2024-12-18 21:59:07,,,,Yeah People here are calculating their payback periods based on perfect conditions If a solar panel claims it outputs 800W its not going to be even half that if not directly facing the sun When you account for night time and winter time Id guess that its outputting 800W like 10 of the time Itd be nice if someone who measured their output over a whole year could chime in,m2pjf1k,1.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2pwttb,gSTrS8XRwqIV5AUh4hwI,,3,2024-12-18 21:05:38,,,,Well but that includes a 96 kWh battery so the price isnt actually that bad but its still probably a waste of money in most cases I mean with 400 Wp panels youd need 24 hours at maximum sunshine to fully charge that battery from those panels So realistically youd need a few days to charge it if you at the same time had no consumption and in a normal houshold youd never fill it to even 50 and on most days no more than 20 That really only makes sense if you can charge from the grid at extremely low prices and then use the power when grid prices are much higher than the price while charging And even then 96 kWh probably wouldnt make sense for an average household Here you can regularly buy two glas panels 400 Wp per unit plus 800 W inverter as a package for 220 EUR incl delivery Add another 80 EUR or so for mounting material which isnt included as it varies a lot how you mount the panels so a total of 300 EUR,m2pq6ip,5.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2sgndr,-Basileus,,1,2024-12-19 07:14:52,,,,One reason is space efficiency A power plant can produce magnitudes more power than a walmart parking lot stuffed with solar panels yet they take up the same amount of space Another reason is difficulty in storing energy Solar works a lot better in the home since youre just using what you produce Last is infrastructure of our power grind,m2qojub,1.0,1hh5foo

comment,m2qm6zd,Swarna_Keanu,,2,2024-12-18 23:24:12,,,,Energy prices are high because fossil fuels are more expensive Costs here work via the merit order principle This means the most expensive form of electricity production sets the price which is nuclear then fossil fuels then way lower solar and wind The idea is that the cheaper forms of energy generation make more profit which leads to an increased installation base in theory Ie its a form of soft subsidy Has nothing to do with energy shortages,m2qcsl9,3.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2ri833,Scrapheaper,,2,2024-12-19 02:40:51,,,,And fossil fuels are more expensive because Russia isnt available to supply them anymore because sanctions and its caused a shortage meaning cost sensitive users of electricity Ie industrial are forced to reduce consumption,m2qm6zd,4.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2u1qlz,Swarna_Keanu,,1,2024-12-19 15:26:40,,,,That was true early in the war is no longer I mean one of the insanities behind that was that Habeck has been criticised for being pragmatic and finding alternative sources for fossil fuels Those are now secured Since then prices have normalised but as planned CO2 emissions add to the expense So again the reason for the costs TODAY after 2022 is not lack of Russian Oil,m2ri833,5.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2poj10,Presently_Absent,,0,2024-12-18 20:23:40,,,,Im not sure I understand the system looking at the Tornasol website it says you deploy the panel and then plug it in to any wall outlet Huh you cant just plug something generating power into an outlet despite the fact that it has what looks like an inverter to convert the DC to AC Thats called backfeeding and its very bad unless theres a very different grid design in germanyspainetc While they say the panel will pay itself back in 6yrs youd have to offset the cost of a battery too and thats probably just as much as the panels if not more The 400w kit plus battery is 1699EUR on sale if you assume you can average 2000kwhday for 80 of the year with no panel or battery degradation over time itd take 28 years to pay that back based on the cost of electricity where i live Its not to say there isnt a sensible solution in here somewhere but rigging the numbers like this is why a lot of people dont trust the numbers at face value myself included,,0.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2qvseu,Xath0n,,2,2024-12-19 00:22:31,,,,Those prices are ridiculous At least in Germany if you pay more than 300 for 2 430W cells plus inverter youre getting ripped off and 2kWh batteries have come down as far as 450 recently though you dont need them if you dont want the higher initial investment,m2poj10,1.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2q98n7,Hendlton,,1,2024-12-18 22:10:14,,,,These turn off when the grid goes down so backfeeding isnt a problem So yeah you do just plug them into the wall As for the numbers I agree They seem to be calculating savings based on the maximum output of a solar panel Most of the time it wont be outputting anywhere near that,m2poj10,1.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2pyw8j,sandukan,,0,2024-12-18 21:16:03,,,,You can earn them back within 6 years actually sounds like it might be worth it since the warranty for these things seem to last 20 30 years at least the ones I found my country Was kind of skeptical if they could withstand the weather since they look kind of cheap and flimsy also depends on the position of your balcony how much sun you actually get and how expensive energy is where you live Read that it is quite expensive in Germany Nuclear power would help with that but Germany for some reason insisted on closing down the last of those in 2023 and went back to burning coal,,0.0,1hh5foo
comment,m2q8aph,Hendlton,,1,2024-12-18 22:05:10,,,,The warranty on solar panels might be 20 years but whats the warranty on inverters Im guessing its the standard 2 years that it is for all electronics,m2pyw8j,1.0,1hh5foo
