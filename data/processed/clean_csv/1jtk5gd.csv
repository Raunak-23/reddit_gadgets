comment,mluvajx,trucorsair,,42,2025-04-07 13:06:13,,,,I did this with Vega 56s flashed with the Vega 64s bios That and some power management overclock undervolt was well worth the effort I used that configuration for quite a while,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlv2yj1,richterlevania3,,28,2025-04-07 13:52:57,,,,Indeed and I sold mine after that to a Ethereum miner for 5 times what I paid for it after using it for 3 years That card was a beast HBM rules,mluvajx,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlv7yu7,trucorsair,,6,2025-04-07 14:20:06,,,,Exactly Vega 5664 was an underappreciated card,mlv2yj1,2.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlw2tiu,M2J9,,3,2025-04-07 16:58:22,,,,As long as you could keep that hbm cool lol it was a beast of a card and overclocked like crazy when watercooled,mlv2yj1,2.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlxmx54,TheSchlaf,,1,2025-04-07 21:47:40,,,,And the RX 5700 and the R9 290 Seems to be common with ATI AMD stuff,mluvajx,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlwhst9,None,,25,2025-04-07 18:13:09,,,,we are so back where are my pencil mod vets at,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlwnzui,thenerfviking,,16,2025-04-07 18:44:54,,,,If you were smart you didnt use a pencil which questionably works You went to AutoZone and you bought the conductive paint they make for repairing rear windshield defoggers You then lay down electrical or painters tape so you dont spill it paint between the two points and once it dries you can break 1ghz,mlwhst9,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlwzn9t,Haelphadreous,,3,2025-04-07 19:45:08,,,,The pencil trick was good for modifying voltages you could lay a stripe down over a resistor to partially bridge it usually to increase the voltage to your CPU I always did it with a mechanical pencil and checked my values after literally every stripe so this video feels a bit haphazard but it covers things The mask and conductive paint trick was usually to enable features on CPUs or GPUs that had been disabled by simply cutting a trace on the PCB I tried to find a video of it but mostly what I got was a bunch of can you paint your motherboard DIY computer mods content,mlwnzui,2.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlx56wp,thenerfviking,,4,2025-04-07 20:13:50,,,,You can pin mod with a pencil but the paint is much more reliable,mlwzn9t,3.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlxkb9w,happy-cig,,2,2025-04-07 21:33:22,,,,As a 7th grader pencil was more reliable for me,mlx56wp,4.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlxsvtn,rpkarma,,2,2025-04-07 22:21:28,,,,Still so wild that some conductive paint would unlock the multiplier haha I miss the Athlon XP days,mlwnzui,2.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlxzbdl,thenerfviking,,2,2025-04-07 22:58:29,,,,I mean it made sense those were generally chips that didnt pass QC to run at higher speeds Back when you couldnt even assume that someone would have more than one fan in their PC that kind of thing mattered more,mlxsvtn,3.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlwp7qa,MadMaui,,2,2025-04-07 18:51:05,,,,I did that back in the day Was it the Athlon Thunderbird CPU,mlwhst9,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mm1ae6a,1911z,,1,2025-04-08 14:00:42,,,,Did it with AMD Duron too D,mlwp7qa,2.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlws7rn,Haelphadreous,,2,2025-04-07 19:06:26,,,,Ahh those were the days did you ever build tiny masks out of scotch tape and rebuild cut traces with conductive paint,mlwhst9,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlvatfw,shalol,,20,2025-04-07 14:34:58,,,,Mom can we have 9070XT at MSRP We have 9070XT at MSRP at home 9070XT at MSRP at home,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mlywako,isthisagoodname69,,2,2025-04-08 02:16:09,,,,What is the softwareeee,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mm0bc4d,mule_roany_mare,,2,2025-04-08 09:48:17,,,,Is there any ability to fine tune which cores are disabled Its really hard to say how many cards need to be binned because they have failures how many need to be binned just to meet market demand I wouldnt assume that any 9070 you buy will be stable flashed as a 9070xt but I suspect most every 9070 has some disabled cores that are functional Hopefully AMD doesnt disable the feature for consumers its bad for business if Dell OEM can get more than they paid for and make the cards appear less reliable in the process but if a consumer with a bit of knowledge and skill can squeeze out a bit extra it may well be worth the good will You just have to gate the process behind some technical skill which leaves a record to prevent warranty abuse An easily cuttable lead or resistor would do it Edit its just clocks and not cores That said what is the actual process used to disable chunks of silicon,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mm1u3fr,None,,2,2025-04-08 15:40:32,,,,Would rather just keep it stock Or spend a little more money and get a better card The time and effort isnt worth the gains,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mmfrk5m,Kajega,,1,2025-04-10 19:07:28,,,,Right its cool but I dont think anyone capable of doing this is buying the base 9070,mm1u3fr,1.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mm6a42t,Sandokan13,,1,2025-04-09 07:16:01,,,,I can push my 9070 to 3170 mhz just by turning the power to 110,,0.0,1jtk5gd
comment,mm0y9eu,dead_fritz,,0,2025-04-08 12:50:12,,,,The slight upgrade skus have often just been binned chips or nonartificially kneecapped chips This isnt anything new and the overclockability of your chip is really just the silicon lottery,,0.0,1jtk5gd
