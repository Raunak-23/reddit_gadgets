comment,mtqtjw3,other_usernames_gone,,4,2025-05-22 23:29:45,,,,Its worth noting the visible light is a lot dimmer than the infrared is Its purely to do with the physics of it not having a power source and converting lower energy light to higher energy light You end up with fewer photons The contact lenses only let you see an infrared LED not passive infrared at least in the current iteration Theyre just not sensitive enough So yeah you can see an infrared led through your eyelids But you can already see a visible light led through your eyelids Just look at a torch with your eyes closed Its definitely cool and could lead to some cool discoveries later but I cant think of many practical applications of this version Any machine will just use infrared sensors which will be cheaper than this They talk about using infrared light to send data but it would have to be decoded by a person Its something only spy agencies would do and theyd just use another method why risk someone spotting the infrared light IR can show up on phone cameras The one use case it might have is making solar panels more efficient by converting infrared light the solar panel cant usually use into visible light it can convert into electricity Also potentially using the same concept to turn visible light into UVX rays Personally Id be a lot more excited about turning visible light into UVX rays as current UV leds are really expensive and X ray leds dont exist A cheaper method to make UV leds would be great and a way to make an LED x ray source would be groundbreaking Wed be able to make an X ray machine way more power efficient and compact Although this heavily depends on the cost of the material and how efficient it is,,0.0,1ksxo57

comment,mtu8nzn,inquisitor1965,,2,2025-05-23 14:20:24,,,,Another crap title Allows you to perceive infrared light Not observe things in your environment with your eyes closed But before you get too excited though its important to note that participants wearing the lenses couldnt see all that well They werent able to make out fine details of their environment for example and could only see infrared light coming from an LED This is because the contact lenses scatter the incoming infrared light the authors wrote,,0.0,1ksxo57
