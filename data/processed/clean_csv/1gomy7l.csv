comment,lwk60el,XTornado,,142,2024-11-11 10:16:15,,,,If they get short in December then the scalpers might still come out ahead I doubt it I feel Sony themselves were a bit over their head I am sure they sell but not crazy with that price Specially for people who want to continue with physical games Plus most of the really interested people will have it already,lwjzxio,2.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwk3e6n,alexefy,,33,2024-11-11 09:46:45,,,,Youd think scalpers would be terminally online They didnt do the bare minimum research to see the demand just wouldnt be there The pro is an extremely niche product that had a lukewarm reception at best The ps4 pro didnt do massive numbers either,lwjssvr,1.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwklmpz,newsflashjackass,,43,2024-11-11 12:44:49,,,,Youd think scalpers would be terminally online If scalpers were intelligent they could contribute something of value to society instead of behaving like landlords,lwk3e6n,2.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwln8ur,ACBluto,,7,2024-11-11 16:30:00,,,,Naw at least landlords can serve a purpose Renting is a valid housing strategy for many people either because they will be living in an area for a short term because they prefer to maintain mobility or because the day to day cost of renting is less than house ownership You need landlords to allow for renters There are predatory landlords but the very fact of being a landlord does not make you wrong No one needs a scalper They are nothing but vultures But the best solution to scalpers comes from the manufacturing side stop with the scarcity Ensure supply is appropriate to demand and there is no market for scalpers,lwklmpz,3.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwmd5zv,pt-guzzardo,,5,2024-11-11 18:42:08,,,,stop with the scarcity Oh gosh why didnt we think of that We can just stop having scarcity manufacturers,lwln8ur,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwmzmml,ACBluto,,4,2024-11-11 20:36:23,,,,I know some of it is genuine shortages But there is a lot of artificial and purposefully manufactured scarcity today it is a driver of engagement People rush out to buy things they think are going to be scarce even if otherwise they would wait to buy But not everything has to be that way One example I can think of is Garth Brooks He knows he sells out arenas Scalpers were making an absolute mint off of him So he books a venue it it sells out immediately he adds another show and then another Even in smaller markets he will play 45 shows back to back Sometimes 2 a day Pretty much everyone who wants to go will,lwmd5zv,5.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwlywuf,newsflashjackass,,2,2024-11-11 17:29:57,,,,No one needs a scalper They are nothing but vultures Makes me wonder how society would function if we woke up tomorrow and all the landlords had disappeared,lwln8ur,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwm62tn,djk29a_,,2,2024-11-11 18:06:12,,,,The justifications I see from scalpers isnt that different from what I see from people in HFT Using some small set of numbers and metrics while ignoring the externalities which is precisely the problem that no system nope not even socialism sorry has solved and that everyone being critical of said activity or institution is talking about whether its Big Tech Big Pharma Big Oil or even Big Government,lwln8ur,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwndoou,billbixbyakahulk,,1,2024-11-11 21:47:45,,,,Ensure supply is appropriate to demand LOL there are PhDs right at this very moment trying to figure that out so they dont overunder order materials manufacturing tooling distribution and people to run all of it Cause when you seriously blow it you have ET for the Atari 2600 Scalpers are never going away They only thing you can control when it comes to scalpers is your own choice to pay their vig to get that thing NOW NOW NOW MINE MINE MINE I DESERVE IT I DONT WANT TO BE LAST FOMO FOMO FOMO,lwln8ur,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwmq4fm,FoolOnDaHill365,,1,2024-11-11 19:47:53,,,,There are so many industries and business that thrive off the market like this and profit being a middle man Scalpers are just the one that is obvious,lwklmpz,3.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwlnkyd,challengeaccepted9,,-2,2024-11-11 16:31:44,,,,Hey if youre a good landlord youre continuously working to keep the property maintained No element of being a scalper requires any work beyond buying something cheap and then selling it for a ripoff price Also therell always be people who want to rent rather than own maybe theyre not sure on the area theyve moved to yet maybe they want the freedom to move around etc so even if the housing crisis was fixed overnight people would still want landlords Nobody wants scalpers except the scalpers themselves,lwklmpz,3.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwmg7dd,FullAzan,,2,2024-11-11 18:57:29,,,,I cant recall if it was earlier this year or late last year but after letting my kids shop for some toys and checking out we saw a guy trying to return six or seven of the base consoles at a Walmart I dont usually delight in peoples misfortune but it felt good watching the older gentleman at the returns counter tell him no repeatedly Thats a lot of money he invested you know and now hes stuck with it Poor guy lol,lwjssvr,1.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwjwf3n,Durzel,,214,2024-11-11 08:26:34,,,,Its probably just adequate supply Were well past the chip shortage days where you had to sit in an hour long queue just to buy the original PS5 The relative lack of supply of disc drives is cursed though Sony obviously didnt think so many people would want to have that functionality back,lwjsimo,1.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwka2rc,GrE1sS,,74,2024-11-11 11:00:31,,,,Disc drive is what killed my interest I had a preorder and could pick it up But without the disc drive I cant play the games I own And enjoy the pro And if I would go digital I would rather buy it on PC,lwjwf3n,2.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwpnjmu,RevolEviv,,1,2024-11-12 06:34:45,,,,I got almost the last drive in the UK 4 weeks back at MSRP but have no regrets on buying my PRO Its def worth it and selling the OG PS5 it cost barely anything factoring in the SSD upgrade I needed FTR I have a decent PC too RTX3080 12900k but prefer the PRO by far it looks and runs awesome and its much nicer to play most games on the console than on my PC these days on my 65 LG OLED,lwka2rc,3.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwpy2n2,GrE1sS,,1,2024-11-12 08:26:50,,,,Lucky you I didnt think much of the drive to be honest until the release But I have a 4090 and a cable running to the TV But for me the PRO would bring me closer with much more easier use just start it and continue no fiddling around with screens starting the game ETC I have also an OLED monitor but the TV is a bit different experience but with the standard PS5 the difference in quality is just a bit too big,lwpnjmu,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwkafqe,Durzel,,-8,2024-11-11 11:04:14,,,,I cant be bothered and dont really have the space for a PC nowadays and I also like buying stuff digitally For the money though it ought to be included Depending on how good the PS5 Pro sales are though it might have proven to Sony that people will buy it regardless even if they have to buy the drive separately,lwka2rc,3.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwk69qh,XTornado,,10,2024-11-11 10:19:08,,,,The relative lack of supply of disc drives is cursed though Sony obviously didnt think so many people would want to have that functionality back I am yet not sure if the guy that came up with that will get a bonus or not Will they get it because it selling good and the extra cash they got with the separate overpriced disk drive or he wont get it as it wasnt expensive enough to make people to stay on digital and get even more money this way,lwjwf3n,2.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwn5v3g,Dornith,,1,2024-11-11 21:07:59,,,,Im willing to bet it was a calculated discussion and they knew the result going in Theres extra overhead to selling two different versions of the same product Extra manufacturing costs for setting up different assembly lines extra logistics costs from storing and resupplying two different SKUs etc Given that the PS5 Pro is a more niche product than the PS5 which itself is still competing with the PS4 holdouts they probably decided that the few extra sales theyd get from including the disc drive didnt outweigh the costs for extra manufacturing logistics materials Contrary to what reddit believes major companies like Sony are in the business of calculated risks,lwk69qh,3.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwnehxo,XTornado,,2,2024-11-11 21:51:53,,,,Of course two models wouldnt make sense The idea would be that a pro version that is already so expensive should be a version with disk drive not without it Like make it modular aswell with option of disk or no disk seems even more work But whatever they had they reasons of course,lwn5v3g,4.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwlm51j,Art__Vandellay,,6,2024-11-11 16:24:17,,,,Sony obviously didnt think so many people would want to have that functionality back Oh you sweet summer child They want people to buy digital copies so they limited supply obviously,lwjwf3n,2.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwpng95,RevolEviv,,1,2024-11-12 06:33:50,,,,Its not a Lack of interest its because Sony made many many units to prevent scalping amongst other things Its selling better than PS4 PRO its 1 console on Amazon worldwide and MLID reports that insiders say they are selling extremely well 80 of stock gone and they had a LOT of stock,lwjwf3n,2.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwnfaak,billbixbyakahulk,,1,2024-11-11 21:55:57,,,,Usually they dont know nor do they particularly care To some degree theyre just gambling therell be a shortage or at least the perception of a shortage such that someone will pay their price For example if youre SO SURE the local stores will run out while youre off on a family vacation you might just pay the scalper price up front because of that assumption,lwjsimo,1.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwnrw43,cyyshw19,,1,2024-11-11 23:04:00,,,,Its probably both I dont know what scalpers are thinking but PS4 Pro never sold out like midgen upgrade always have limited audience so its easy for Sony to meet demand with enough supply,lwjsimo,1.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwlrmst,USeaMoose,,1,2024-11-11 16:52:33,,,,As others have said its mostly just a clickbait title Though I think you get there by comparing it to a new gen console launch Where chip shortage or not when a console is popular it never stays on the shelves for more than a couple minutes If this were the PS6 and scalpers were selling consoles at a loss it would be reasonable to assume that the launch did not go as well as Sony would have hoped But its not that It is a midgeneration refresh and demand is going to be completely different for those Its also probably a situation where they expect sales to be more spread out These are not diehard PS fans who dont already a PlayStation 5 These are either people who never got the PS5 or people who have ne and are considering replacing it,lwjsimo,1.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwltjoy,_RADIANTSUN_,,14,2024-11-11 17:02:22,,,,They wont cuz Nintendo operates on an extremely different model They are not Sony who has 1000 other businesses and they dont have the same scale for moving hardware to them overproducing is an existential risk cuz it is relatively really easy to increase and scale up production but once youve done it manufacturing and supply contracts have been set for timescales for years and then its insanely difficult to scale it back The hundreds of thousands of units start to pile up and you have to start keeping them in warehouses with all the associated costs losses due to pilferage and warehouse conditions and have to get rid of the glut by either slashing prices like the 3DS or invest inhope for demand picking up They cannot absorb losses like this the same way Sony can Lots of people believe Nintendo does artificial scarcity they dont they are just an extremely financially conservatively run Japanese business because thats what has allowed them to exist for so long in probably the single most brutal consumer tech environment in the last 40 years Nintendo has walked through this exact boneyard and remembers the skeletons of fallen giants like Atari SEGA THQ All gone from the console hardware arena or entirely literally because they produced too much hardware they couldnt sell They fundamentally will never risk this same kind of thing happening again because they would rather have unmet demand to leave some money on the table generate some hype and maybe piss a few people off vs risking losing it all big time,lwk4id7,2.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwlzc8z,SHADOWSTRIKE1,,0,2024-11-11 17:32:08,,,,There is zero chance they are selling them for a loss this soon Scalpers can easily return merchandise that isnt selling well this close to release The auction the article linked as evidence was just starting out and they said it was going for 560 Well as of right now its up to 770 which is over retail price and still has several days left This article is nothing I dislike scalpers as much as the next guy but this is just clickbait,,0.0,1gomy7l

comment,lwpne9f,RevolEviv,,0,2024-11-12 06:33:18,,,,Its not a Lack of interest its because Sony made many many units to prevent scalping amongst other things Its selling better than PS4 PRO its 1 console on Amazon worldwide and MLID reports that insiders say they are selling extremely well 80 of stock gone and they had a LOT of stock,,0.0,1gomy7l
comment,lwklpbl,DR_van_N0strand,,-5,2024-11-11 12:45:21,,,,How did this false story manage to get so much traction Obviously thats bullshit and anyone who bought one to scalp can just return it for all their money back Any sold at a loss are obviously stolen by people who dont have that option,,0.0,1gomy7l
