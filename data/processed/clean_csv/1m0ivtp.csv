comment,n3colco,laurk,,1,2025-07-15 23:14:58,,,,My coworker does a lot of beta testing for these goggles My wife is also trying them I agree with you and they know this will stop people from purchasing but in the end from their perspective my coworker said it allows them to continue to improve and advance the app and product for longer while also keeping the same wearable instead of leaving the wearable behind as they improve Like iPhone updates maybe Idk if thats a good analogy But I agree still with you Not saying youre wrong BUT also you can get the tech without the subscription thats an option Just kind of gets washed out when its shadowed by something cooler in a way,n3a1ip8,1.0,1m0ivtp
