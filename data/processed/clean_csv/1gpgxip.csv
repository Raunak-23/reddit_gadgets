comment,lwq5c6h,celestiaequestria,,335,2024-11-12 09:50:58,,,,It essentially says were not responsible if you kill your console and burn your house down in the indemnification agreement you have to click to reach the download link Cant imagine too many people who know how to 3D print a toaster oven would be also be dumb enough to think putting a toaster oven on a PS5 is a good idea,lwq3svl,1.0,1gpgxip
comment,lwqwnms,sybrwookie,,64,2024-11-12 13:46:36,,,,Not just 3d print a toaster but 3d print a plastic toaster which is probably made of plastic thats not foodsafe and depending on what plastic you use is likely to start melting lower than the temp it takes to heat up food to safe temps to eat,lwq5c6h,2.0,1gpgxip
comment,lwsebmw,export_tank_harmful,,36,2024-11-12 18:36:50,,,,Im not even worried about the plastic melting Im worried about the slow drip of grease that will eventually seep through into the console itself Either killing the console hopefully or causing a fire,lwqwnms,3.0,1gpgxip

comment,lwurnts,PhotoSpike,,6,2024-11-13 02:27:52,,,,Its a warmer so it dosnt need to be super hot Printing a material that can handle warmer temps isnt hard That said printing something thats actually food safe is very difficult and not something many people are set up for definitely a lot less than the number of people who think they can print food safe,lwqwnms,3.0,1gpgxip
comment,lwuzpc6,sybrwookie,,0,2024-11-13 03:16:20,,,,If food is lower than 120 itll read as not hot enough If were talking being safe we need to get it up to 140 And thats the temps of the food not the warmer If the warmer is 140 or even 145 youre going to need another source to get the food up to that point first and then hold it there And thats hot enough to both be an issue for a lot of plastics Some can go higher without melting but as you mentioned at the end food safe is a whole other story,lwurnts,4.0,1gpgxip
