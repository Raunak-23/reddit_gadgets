comment,m7b5e58,4-3-4,,90,2025-01-15 18:07:30,,,,I always wondered how they can actually sell parts that is more expensive than the going retail price look at the motherboard,,0.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7bci0e,caiusto,,57,2025-01-15 18:41:21,,,,Not only is it not subsidized it also adds a profit margin on top of it If you need to replace the whole motherboard that has all the components soldered to it then you may as well get a new one but the repair option is there I guess,m7b5e58,1.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7f22d7,_RADIANTSUN_,,19,2025-01-16 07:50:01,,,,The accessibility of the repair itself matters Even if buying the repair parts new is expensive it might still benefit eg salvaging parts and swapping between units is better supported,m7bci0e,2.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7blc7i,thekid8it,,20,2025-01-15 19:23:25,,,,Holy hot damn thats a lot of for a Xbox lol Regardless I do think this is a good move to offer the other parts I hope in the US we can get more companies to do the same,m7b5e58,1.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7cf8dz,FluffyProphet,,21,2025-01-15 21:44:01,,,,Different supply chains and scale The supply chain to make an Xbox is very optimized the supply chain to get individual parts to people will have more overhead and the scale of it will be smaller That adds costs Plus consoles have basically no markup,m7b5e58,1.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7cvk8c,JabbaDuhNutt,,1,2025-01-15 23:05:27,,,,I guarantee you the parts come in a plastic bag and a Very simple box I bet iFixit is getting the bulk parts just like the factorys receive them Then iFixit is packaging it for the consumer For sure some added cost but some of these items a Reza Outrageous,m7cf8dz,2.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7f2exr,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2025-01-16 07:53:31,,,,It has to be worth doing the extra steps with iFixIt involved otherwise why would they do it unless compelled I guess,m7cvk8c,3.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7dv4f7,Butthole__Blaster,,-12,2025-01-16 02:26:03,,,,I dont believe that for a second Could Microsoft be selling the Xbox wholesale to Walmart with next to no markup Maybe But make no mistake Walmart absolutely does have margin on that item and its somewhere between 3060,m7cf8dz,2.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7epqhx,accidentlife,,7,2025-01-16 05:53:46,,,,A 60 margin is absurd Ive heard of restaurants with lower gross margins Where the margins come in for a retailer is selling the games and accessories,m7dv4f7,3.0,1i23e2m
comment,m7eyosx,FluffyProphet,,2,2025-01-16 07:15:59,,,,Retail margins on consoles are around 5 at most usually a bit lower Microsoft also takes somewhere between a 100 and 200 hit on each console they make up for with game sales and subscriptions Thin markups are common across the retail space on higher priced electronics I worked in a sort independent Apple Store in high school wasnt actually an Apple Store but it was like an apple authorized retailer that only did apple stuff and we made 20 on the most expensive macbook in the store half of that was given as commission All the profits came from accessories,m7dv4f7,3.0,1i23e2m

comment,m7dhbnk,Flaky-Gear-1370,,16,2025-01-16 01:06:38,,,,I assume this is more a way of trying to skirt right to repair laws look we offer stuff and nobody bought it even if it was twice the price of buying a new one,,0.0,1i23e2m
