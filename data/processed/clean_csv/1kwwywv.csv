comment,mukqoiz,yetAnotherLaura,,141,2025-05-27 20:04:17,,,,Anecdotal evidence but just last night I was looking at prices for 5090s in Germany and saw quite a bit of ASUSMSI ones at around 2225k and actually in stock at mainstream retailers While that is not quite MSRP it is very close to the expected price for partner branded boards,,0.0,1kwwywv
comment,muksfun,HiddenoO,,46,2025-05-27 20:12:45,,,,The ASUS cards immediately sold out and are back to 2579 The cheapest right now are Inno3D cards at roughly 24k,mukqoiz,1.0,1kwwywv
comment,mukto0b,yetAnotherLaura,,16,2025-05-27 20:18:32,,,,Yeah figured it wouldnt last long That said though It is still an improvement in price form a while ago Still sucks though,muksfun,2.0,1kwwywv

comment,musp7f6,yetAnotherLaura,,3,2025-05-29 00:14:34,,,,And cars shouldnt cost the same as a small apartment and yet they exist A 5090 isnt for regular gamers or hardcore gamers Its for the people with money to burn or for professional use cases If you use your computer for gaming theres no reason to buy one other than because I can Same with pretty much any high end item on any hobby,mus4h6q,4.0,1kwwywv
comment,mv2szk5,acornSTEALER,,1,2025-05-30 14:51:39,,,,Realistically a 5090 isnt for gamers its for 3D modeling and other GPU intensive tasks,musp7f6,5.0,1kwwywv
comment,muue64a,Gaeus_,,0,2025-05-29 07:20:54,,,,I did not mention the 5090 If you wanna know I was referencint the 3070 that card cost around 1300 for a while which would be 300 more than afirst year student rundown car for a midrange GPU,musp7f6,5.0,1kwwywv

comment,mul5whw,mickeyPijamas,,3,2025-05-27 21:17:24,,,,Whats the difference between the same cards from different vendors,mul1lzd,2.0,1kwwywv
comment,mul90dq,randomIndividual21,,16,2025-05-27 21:33:21,,,,main different is the cooler more expensive model has vapor chamber and bigger cooler so its quieter and run cooler they also then to have better bined chip so bigger OC potential they also has different pcb design with different component used like capacitors but no idea how much actual different it makes,mul5whw,3.0,1kwwywv
comment,mun2wtt,anonymousbopper767,,8,2025-05-28 03:50:12,,,,None of the regular retail cards are binned Only specialty ones like Galax HoF are binned The main difference is the cooler but they dont really matter much Nvidia has stuff locked down so hard all models are pretty much the same performance,mul90dq,4.0,1kwwywv

comment,muoer0r,log-off,,1,2025-05-28 10:54:52,,,,They essentially select the best performing GPU silicon to put on the board eg ones that are most stable at high frequencies So the best ones are reserved for the high tierspecialty cards,muoawj6,6.0,1kwwywv
comment,mur1hex,anonymousbopper767,,1,2025-05-28 19:10:52,,,,Which are usually only available for sponsoredpro overclockers and maybe a handful will get sold at retail and then never again,muoer0r,7.0,1kwwywv
comment,muq1glz,yetAnotherLaura,,1,2025-05-28 16:17:02,,,,Take this with a bit of salt but it goes something like this Chips like GPU and CPUs are made in round wafers The ones closest to the center tend the be the best ones and as you go to the edges things can vary in quality That difference of some chips performing better than other is actually how you get the different tiers like i3i5i7 A chip might be good enough for a tier but not reliable for the upper one A binned chip usually means specifically selected from the best pool of candidates,muoawj6,6.0,1kwwywv
comment,mur1rh4,anonymousbopper767,,3,2025-05-28 19:12:10,,,,Fun fact its really the doughnut of silicon that is best Center is mediocre edges are bad,muq1glz,7.0,1kwwywv

comment,mulaas7,CryptikTwo,,2,2025-05-27 21:39:55,,,,Not a lot Each vendor generally has a cheap reference model theyre all pretty much the same The more expensive models will have custom pcbs with improved power delivery and betterbigger coolers etc Theres still little difference between them though It generally comes down to whos customer services and reputation for not cheaping out on components like caps etc you trust more and these days theyve all had issues so whatever buy the cheapest,mul5whw,3.0,1kwwywv

comment,mum2g66,Nope_______,,4,2025-05-28 00:13:24,,,,I dont get it Yes the stock improves if people stop buying them provided theyre still producing them at the same rate Are you thinking stock improves means production is ramped up,mukqefe,1.0,1kwwywv
comment,mum7mc3,rundownv2,,9,2025-05-28 00:42:50,,,,I think both The article doesnt say why theres more stock But even if its just the former I think my point was more that saying stock improves is a positive way to phrase things and skims over the reason why theres more cards available,mum2g66,2.0,1kwwywv

comment,mum7dvl,jaweinre,,11,2025-05-28 00:41:29,,,,Kids and PC enthusiasts I know I was too are like addicts to this stuff I too spent dumb amounts of on graphic cards throughout childhoodadolescence Some years ago sold my 1070 when GeForce now became a thing and I realized how ridiculous this spending was on top of the increasing power draw heat noise generation Not gonna pour one more dime on onsite PC gaming only subscription on and off depending on time available Modding games will be missed but clearly not justifies the insane prices shady business practices from manufacturers and scalping I mean theres literally guys in this thread worrying about rising temps in their rooms through the upcoming summer and talking about te melting power plugs on a product that sets them back 2500 usd and up I tell you these companies get away with this and laugh,mulx1vs,1.0,1kwwywv
comment,mume45f,supreme_blorgon,,18,2025-05-28 01:19:54,,,,This very small group of idiot consumers with way too much disposable income has disproportionately affected the entire industry and really ruined the hobby Its absolutely insane how much money people continue to throw at Nvidia and similar companies Same problem in gaming with preorders and whales Same problem with phones The sheer scale of utterly mindless consumption of all this stuff is really depressing Its absolutely an addiction and I wish more people were talking about it,mum7dvl,2.0,1kwwywv
comment,munuvyz,jaweinre,,1,2025-05-28 07:49:09,,,,Actually not way too much disposable income in many cases I sure hadnt way too much disposable income growing up rather I hustled and saved through the year fixed computers etc sold the previous card and put money on top for the next thing For fucks sake now looking back if my father had blocked me from wasting it away on ATI and Nvidia and put it towards investments or Bitcoin lol instead I would be writing this from my yatch Parents educate and keep tabs on your kids,mume45f,3.0,1kwwywv
comment,mumpfjo,MrNerd82,,-8,2025-05-28 02:24:35,,,,hate to break it to you about the world but thats how it is in any high end niche market where theres high demand low supply and near zero alternatives BugattiPaganikoenigsegg for example Why so expensive its just a car right because its been proven over the decades the level they play on and people with disposable income willing to buy the best of the best Your comment of mindless consumption can be drilled down to the every day stuff we all buy not just GPUs or the high techrare stuff People can buy what they want with their money I personally dont care The more stupid aspect of what you describe are the people going into debt for these things Paying cash and owning something even its its frivolous is still lightyears better than the idiots who carry 2050100k of credit card debt at 30 APR These are usually the same people who will turn around in 6 months and complain about not being able to afford food or rent,mume45f,3.0,1kwwywv

comment,muo5q7x,soulsoda,,3,2025-05-28 09:36:36,,,,The cable melting thing is definitely an issue though Thoughts and prayers Can always setup an undervolt It wont run as hot nor draw as much juice if you limit it Mine wont take more than 475watts still getting 98100 stock performance although this is highly dependent on your luck in the silicon lottery Even if you dont fine tune the undervolt you can probably get 9095 of the performance for 80 of the power,mul7lc0,2.0,1kwwywv

comment,muljdm5,wolfiasty,,1,2025-05-27 22:28:04,,,,Reason why I went for 4060 instead of something more powerful or team red 8GB vram is indeed creating barriers fe Space Marine 2 says straight up no ultra graphics because of not enough vram but 601080p and very high which gives barely any difference compared to ultra btw is what I play so Im good,mukt0ad,1.0,1kwwywv
