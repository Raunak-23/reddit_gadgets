comment,mkobclh,gchaudh2,,112,2025-03-31 12:32:46,,,,TCL haa long known to be a cheap brand Their phones and TVs both use the standard Chinese manufacturing concept of lower prices which is seen in their feature laded but poor performing and poorly manufactured products Had a TCL 55 TV for a year Not only did it have terrible backlight bleed I had to disable its wifi as it kept sending location data without my consent to some random location It was only 199 though and I was starting a new job with not much money Tldr its TCL Dont expect them to not lie,,0.0,1jo1vap

comment,mkpbqzn,gchaudh2,,27,2025-03-31 15:52:28,,,,Of the many things I did was opt out of their location sharing Turned off smart tv experience and then a tech buddy of mine who set up a pihole for me came in to help me fix wifi security issues He said he looked at packet data to determine if location was being shared or not He looked at the device IP address and then pinpointed that it was the TV I am sorry I like computers but I am not a network specialist so do t have more info Eventually I just changed TVs disabled wifi on them and also blocked them from the router I also switched to an apple tv for all my smart tv needs,mkojwzx,2.0,1jo1vap
comment,mkruv2r,IchBinMalade,,12,2025-03-31 23:41:40,,,,When it comes to privacy and tech I am firmly in the guilty until proven innocent mindset Its just too lucrative for them not to do it so just assume your data is being collected no matter what and work under that assumption if you care,mkpbqzn,3.0,1jo1vap

comment,mkt4cj1,mk0aurelius,,3,2025-04-01 04:42:37,,,,Not really think about it as a status check is it online and available Later on you identify a juicy target and hit the backdoor activation of the tvs built in microphone etc if the location datas route back to home is good and transmitting audio data only for a brief burst the target may not ever know and your bug is good until you need it next time or it stops reporting back to home,mkrxhsh,5.0,1jo1vap

comment,mkzwwhk,SolidOshawott,,1,2025-04-02 09:30:11,,,,In my experience the tough part about using a PC is ensuring the HDMI outputs 4K HDR 120Hz properly plus stuff like DolbyVision and DolbyAtmos if you care I use my TVs smart apps for Plex and Netflix but they feel slower after each update Soon enough Ill just go back to using my Xbox for streaming,mkr0c8l,3.0,1jo1vap

comment,mkukdt5,pcor,,1,2025-04-01 12:57:39,,,,Every civilized society which emerged as a major industrial power has undermined intellectual property and engaged in industrial espionage The founding father of the American Industrial Revolution Samuel Slater owed his success to stealing British textile production technology and designs postwar Korea and Japan reverse engineered western technology to produce worldleading electronics and semiconductor industries etc etc Criticise China for it all you want but youre criticising them for failing to hold their industries to a higher standard than other societies,mkubd47,2.0,1jo1vap
