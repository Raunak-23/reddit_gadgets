comment,m8xl43p,Firstprime,,78,2025-01-24 16:22:25,,,,Everyone should be aware that If a product is sold through eBay then the seller can only decline returnsrefunds if it is for change of mind If you receive a damageddefectivedeceptive product you can ALWAYS pursue a returnrefund on eBay regardless of what the seller writes in the listing If you have a valid reason and the seller declines to accept the return then eBay will step in and force a refund You should also have similar protections any time you purchase a product using PayPal to process the payment as long as you dont use the Friends and Family option This is also the case for many other vendors and payment platforms You might need to jump through some hoops to file a claim but you will get there Be aware of your rights as a consumer and dont let dishonest sellers take advantage of you,m8x2057,1.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8y3y2t,alidan,,6,2025-01-24 17:49:02,,,,there is some stuff you can doinfo you can get there are some youtube channels that go into rare games and ebay screwing them but they tell you how to get the info you need to go after the people wire fraud seems to not have a dollar amount associated with it going after them for it would be difficult but not undoable especially because you could easily prove they damaged it in my brothers case ill be honest the headphones were 800 value but were simbalant as hell painful to listen to certain songs I would not have paid more than 100 for them especially at the time because I also had blessing 2s and realistically even 20 salnotes zeros sounded better not as clear but tone wise better if I bought them and put them on my head and they sounded like that I would have severe buyers remorse as well but my brothers problem isnt with the buyer he fully understands why someone would send it back and want a refund his problem is with ebay not refunding the commission or paypal fees,m8y15fa,4.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m91s3vl,homanagent,,1,2025-01-25 05:47:19,,,,Its true they usually side with the buyer and for good reason But this is not universal or in all cases Ive had eBay and Paypal side with me in a dispute because I provided the documentation to prove I was right and because I had a decently old account 2001 I think,m8xtmef,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m95fq35,theycmeroll,,1,2025-01-25 20:34:11,,,,Yeah this is the main reason I quit selling on eBay because of the general idiocy of buyers and the me getting penalized for it I think people have gotten so used to just impulse buying off sites like Amazon and Walmart and just retuning it if it isnt right they are taking that mentality to eBay now and it screws over sellers Then you got the ones that fully intend to defraud the seller I have never tried to defraud or mislead someone and put all the information possible in my listings but it never fails someone will buy something with no clue what it is and then get upset because its not what they wanted When I finally threw in the towel was when I sold a PS4 on eBay they buyer got it and said it didnt work I know damn well it worked of course I said send it back they sent me a tiny padded envelope with a picture of a smiley emoji in it eBay said it shows the item was delivered to me so thats that You can see the idiocy in Amazon reviews as well Like you can read the items description that clearly says what it does it doesnt do and gives important details and inevitably you will see multiple 1 star reviews complaining about something that was clearly stated in the description,m8xtmef,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m98x1ui,alidan,,1,2025-01-26 10:44:13,,,,Im going to be fair on the amazon side given some underwear I bought fruit of the loom I measured my waist bought the right size they shipped it every pair fit perfectly they they went through the wash the grey ones shrunk a bit but are still wearable the blue ones shrunk to the point they barely fit with about 15th a crack showing this is acceptable but going from perfect to acceptable was a major blow when the shit cost 40 the dark blue ones shrunk to the point that it covers barely half my ass or my crotch is exposed and 13 of my ass is showing they shrank to the point they are panties even if you correctly label everything the person who gets it may expect a hell of alot more or just put up with what they get I found natural feelings as a replacement these are perfect and didnt shrink by a noticeable amount after being washed got 7 pairs for the same price also with amazon you have to take into account people completely changing store pages after the fact or in the case of electronics not actually getting what you paid for this has worked out in my favor of getting something higher end and worked against me in the passed when I got a mouse that was obviously a counterfeit there is a fun video on youtube by I forget who about this it was a fun video where it took 3 or 4 attempts before they got an actual product you also have cases where the factory workers themselves swap the products or cases like samsung sd cards where they get counterfeited to the point even retail gets counterfeit versions without knowing it its really hard to say consumer stupidity for everything its one of the reasons I really like smart usbc charging I remember barrel jacks I remember wal warts that god knows if it supplys enough or too much the sooner we move to usbc everything with a smart charger so it knows how much to deliver to whatever is on the other end the better hell there are projects that replace barrel jacks for usb c granted its not one size fits all sadly now on the ebay side I honestly wonder if there is money to be made in a third party seller that can verify something works and function as the middleman in sales the problem with that would probably be the risk of that becoming used as a fence but its possible that this kind of a service where confirmed working goes in confirmed working goes out and could probably institute a no return policy of sorts,m95fq35,4.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8zrynm,Fredasa,,2,2025-01-24 22:32:29,,,,Gotta wonder how that hard protective policy pans out for people buying from sellers in China,m8xl43p,2.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8zz6d1,Firstprime,,1,2025-01-24 23:09:16,,,,At least for eBay it shouldnt make a difference The buyer protection policies will be based on whichever regional eBay site you use to make the purchase The location of the seller doesnt matter If youre buying directly through a Chinese vendormarketplace it would probably be a very different story,m8zrynm,3.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8xu7fr,MattyIce260,,3,2025-01-24 17:04:04,,,,They definitely can be denied Usually on a package delivery over a certain dollar amount a signature is required which is very hard to overcome in a chargeback review,m8xtsmr,4.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8z8owo,alidan,,1,2025-01-24 21:00:06,,,,a chargeback is effectively a battle of fuck around and find out because what comes after it is going to court if you push it and I can tell you this now given how often I have ordered crap over 500 only to get it left on a doorstep or never even asking for a signature from fedex I dont think its a hard requirement or the people delivering by me have stopped caring at all but I did have something 10 once require a signature,m8y2zod,7.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8xzzyp,CyberneticFennec,,14,2025-01-24 17:30:48,,,,Scalpers are beneficial to retailers they dont care whether people are happy they just want the bag It doesnt matter whether it sells in 30 seconds or 30 days they get paid the same but if its instant that means its off their shelves much faster and they get paid much faster Theres literally no reason why they would act any differently some negative feedback isnt going to stop people from continuing to shop from them,m8x5f6m,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8y2fg9,LotFP,,9,2025-01-24 17:42:05,,,,It actually matters a lot if it sells in 30 seconds compared to 30 days If its sitting on the shelf for 30 days thats space being used that could hold something else waiting to be sold In a perfect world shelves would be empty at the end of every day and restocked at night for sale the next day A retailer can only dream of that sort of turnover,m8xzzyp,4.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8yt3zy,Numarx,,2,2025-01-24 19:45:54,,,,It hurts sales as well if you sell out of GPUs then people wont buy the new motherboard the new CPU the ram SSD etc that goes with the GPU upgrade Just selling one part of a system is nice but better if you can get them to buy an entire system with that new GPU Its a huge benefit to companies to limit the sales to increase sales in other areas,m8y2fg9,5.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8zhr0j,Baalii,,3,2025-01-24 21:42:48,,,,Thats true to a degree but NVIDIA of all companies has a particular reputation for not giving a fuck about even partners like Apple So I doubt their sales strategy includes the effect on the bottom line of some other companies,m8yt3zy,6.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8y4lnd,CyberneticFennec,,1,2025-01-24 17:52:00,,,,Thats exactly what I mean they get paid the same regardless so it doesnt matter holding onto it longer doesnt give them anymore money If its cleared out instantly they make their money and get their storage space back right away which is obviously beneficial to them thats a huge win for retailers but not for their consumers,m8y2fg9,5.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8zcldc,sybrwookie,,3,2025-01-24 21:18:34,,,,Hell retailers are happier with scalpers Scalpers arent returning items or trying to get supportrepairs and once theyre resold the store is 100 off the hook for everything and now the customer has to go to the manufacturer instead And either way they get their money,m8xzzyp,4.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m90aaih,Arthur-Mergan,,1,2025-01-25 00:08:35,,,,Its sucks but scalpers really are a net positive on the business side of things Drive up price demand and create artificial scarcity that then feeds back into those first two things,m8zcldc,5.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m9gpixy,Sock-Enough,,1,2025-01-27 15:21:37,,,,This is completely and totally wrong Economic models do not just consider the MSRP the correct price The market clearing price is clearly higher than that given that people are willing to pay it Scalpers are obviously not hoarding since they are scalping They are not removing supply There is no manipulation If retailers simply charged much higher prices then the outcomes would be the same except with retailers making the profit that would have gone to scalpers otherwise,m9gndw1,16.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9gsv1d,StarWarsTheLastJedi,,0,2025-01-27 15:37:56,,,,Of course retail is not always set at the market clearing price for various reasons such as game consoles being sold at a loss But the natural clearing price is determined by the actual balance of supply and demand Profiteering resellers artificially reduce the supply by removing a chunk of stock from the market inflating the market price beyond the natural clearing level Scalpers are obviously not hoarding since they are scalping They are not removing supply This is fundamentally flawed Scalping inherently involves hoarding and scalpers purchase the products to disrupt the retail supply chain Remember resale is not an instant process When scalpers buy up stock they remove them from retail circulation Until those products actually sell they are effectively withheld from the legitmate supply chain Each unit a scalper purchases blocks a consumer who otherwise would have bought that unit for the intended consumption purpose at the regular price By its nature each purchase for scalping purposes is a factor that amplifies the scarcity beyond what is generated by actual demand for the product Scalping is manipulation carried out by those who wish to profiteer and add nothing of value,m9gpixy,17.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m9kp1u5,StarWarsTheLastJedi,,1,2025-01-28 03:06:57,,,,Let me give you a simplified example to help you understand this concept and where you are misunderstanding economics Start with a hypothetical balanced market where a new product is launching for 1000 initial inventory is 100 units and since the manufacturer researched the market well there happen to be 100 consumers willing to buy at that price They start taking preorders Now imagine that scalpers intervene using bots or other tools and secure 50 of those 100 units There are still 100 consumers willing to buy the product at 1000 but now only 50 units are available at retail A shortage of 50 units has been artificially created by the scalpers where previously there was none Then scalpers reintroduce the products on the resale market forcing prices above retail This is a distortion of the market because it entirely created a scarcity that didnt exist Scalpers added no value they blocked legitimate buyers disrupted the manufacturer and retail business models all in order to withhold stock to artificially command higher prices You cannot explain how this is not an artificial shortage generated directly by scalping And the same mechanism works when the market is already supply constrained In other words whatever shortages the market is experiencing by the time scalpers have intervened those shortages are amplified,m9kjgtv,23.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9kplfn,Sock-Enough,,1,2025-01-28 03:10:03,,,,The simple explanation is that buying something and immediately posting it for resale wouldnt allow the scalpers to charge any higher than the initial 1000 They would lose money Your hypothetical wouldnt actually happen In the real world a good is only scalped when the market clearing price is above the retail price Thats your error Scalpers are actually getting the market to the equilibrium Thats the only reason it works at all,m9kp1u5,24.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9l04na,StarWarsTheLastJedi,,0,2025-01-28 04:14:02,,,,Youre misinterpreting both the hypothetical and realworld mechanics of scalping Let me address the realworld scenario You seem to be floating the idea that in a situation where the market clearing price is above the retail price scalpers merely unlock the natural market clearing price allowing supply and demand to function naturally without being constrained by the retail pricing model However the act of withholding stock artificially raises the equilibrium price by distorting the markets natural supplydemand balance Let me show you how Without scalpers Supply 100 units Demand at 1000 retail 150 buyers 50 unfulfilled Demand at 1200 100 buyers natural MCP achieved market balanced With scalpers Supply 50 units in retail circulation 50 hoarded by scalpers 50 buyers purchase at 1000 retail 100 buyers remain but only 50 scalpercontrolled units are available Remember 100 buyers were willing to buy at 1200 retail but there are now only 50 units To clear this new imbalance prices rise further until demand drops to match supplyeg 1600 While there can be overlap where wouldbe 1200 buyers are among the 50 who manage to buy at retail even if only 90 or 80 remain the scalperdistorted MCP will still exceed the natural one Scalpers dont unlock market forces they distort them forcing consumers to pay inflated prices while adding zero value This is market manipulation not equilibrium,m9kplfn,25.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9l0cd1,Sock-Enough,,1,2025-01-28 04:15:27,,,,But they dont withhold anything Thats what you dont understand A scalper scalps They sell what they buy and they want to sell it fast Your entire model relies on an assumption that isnt just wrong Its backwards,m9l04na,26.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9l2dz6,StarWarsTheLastJedi,,0,2025-01-28 04:29:08,,,,You are completely misunderstanding the argument If a scalper wanted things to sell quickly they would step out of the way to allow retail transactions to take place unfettered The core act in scalping is to divert stock from retail circulation to drive up prices in a secondary market Even if they resell relatively quickly the damage is already done because that stock is removed from retail and they have created artificial scarcity It is that scarcity which they created that they rely on to demand higher prices Scalper prices on secondary markets can be much higher than market clearing prices otherwise would be That gap is illgotten gains from market manipulation,m9l0cd1,27.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9l4miz,Sock-Enough,,1,2025-01-28 04:44:29,,,,No the goal is to make money and they make money by selling to willing buyers But they want to do that quickly because keeping stock on hand is risky and expensive If they are reselling quickly there is obviously no hoarding Hoarding means not selling There is no driving up of prices beyond the market clearing price If what you were saying were true then people would scalp everything mattresses onions buildings but people only seem to scalp things with very strong demand and limits on supply I wonder if simple supply and demand explains that perfectly,m9l2dz6,28.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m9l5qt7,StarWarsTheLastJedi,,0,2025-01-28 04:52:19,,,,Hoarding means not selling Scalpers dont need to hoard indefinitely Even temporarily removing availability from retail channels disrupts the demand supply balance There is no driving up of prices beyond the market clearing price Their intervention has already driven up the market clearing price Scalping pushes up the market clearing price beyond what it would be without scalping plain and simple I wonder if simple supply and demand explains that perfectly Spoiler It doesnt Scalping doesnt recreate or restore a perfect market it disrupts simple supply and demand by creating artificial scarcity They manipulate the supply curve to engineer a rapid increase in prices to profit from the scarcity they themselves have manufactured,m9l4miz,29.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8zgjr0,Dangthing,,2,2025-01-24 21:37:10,,,,The legal intervention required is honestly not very difficult We just need stronger price regulation laws and license requirements for bulk purchase On a product like a GPU a nonlicense cap of 3 of them would easily fit the vast majority of the populations requirements while making scalping substantially more difficult Once you have a license you are given a resale restriction cap which limits the total markup you can resell the item at Obviously breaking this limitation comes with a stiff penalty Make that limit similar to average for normal commercial stores such as Walmart IE cap of 30 markup Failure to put regulations in place is why the market can create artificial scarcity so easily There are likely expansions required to ensure such a law is less vulnerable to exploitation etc it needs more cooking but for a basic comment you should get the idea The purpose is to stop someone from buying the entire stock of an item and then selling it at 200300400 markups These people are essentially just parasites and offer no value to anyone Youve also somehow mistaken me saying that rich people are the problem for saying rich people are the scalpers That was not what I was saying Im saying there are enough rich people that scalpers can be profitable which is at its core the problem I dont support punishing the rich for being stupid with money or for being rich I support making it impossible for the parasites to exist,m8z7hq2,6.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8ygvxw,karlzhao314,,5,2025-01-24 18:48:50,,,,Ironically it seems like weve returned to the COVIDmining era where buying GPUs in prebuilts is cheaper and more reasonable than buying GPUs alone According to PCPartpicker today 1242025 the cheapest 4090s are 2500 Meanwhile Dell has a 14900KF 4090 32GB DDR5 2TB NVMe Alienware on sale right now for 2900 which is less than the extra cost of a 14900KF alone Sure the motherboard and case are proprietary and pretty junky but Steve GN had pretty good things to say about the Dell 4090 and you could just as easily move the 14900KF RAM and SSD over to your own build and probably come out on top I gave up on getting a 5090 for now and just went for this Alienware instead Managed to wrangle a student discount too which brought the price down to 2600 tax I probably would have had to spend that on a 5090 anyway even if I went the route of camping overnight outside a Microcenter,m8x0tlk,1.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m90cszf,geoelectric,,1,2025-01-25 00:22:16,,,,Yeah I bought a Lenovo Legion 7i Gen 8 tower in late 2023 because I couldnt find a reasonably priced 4090 for a BYO Prebuilt system with a liquid cooled 13900KF 64GB RAM and a 2TB SSD along with the admittedly vanilla 4090 GPU ended up costing me 3000 minus the 200 I got back from RetailMeNot For 2800 I regret nothing The 4090 wouldve been 2000 of that easy at the time if I could even find one Its a standard case and mobo etc so its all swappable anyway My only real limitation is they left exactly enough length behind the radiator for what looks like a FE 4090 with a three fan cooler so I probably cant fit most of the new cards without changing cases andor reverting to air for CPU cooling Since Id probably upgrade to a Ryzen anyway at the same time its all been upside for me,m8ygvxw,2.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8xjlki,aaahhhhhhfine,,-7,2025-01-24 16:15:31,,,,I know this drives reddit off the wall for some reason But this is a pretty basic thing economically The original companies or the best buysAmazons of the world should drastically raise their prices Scalpers exploit the case where MSRP is drastically below the real value of a good The simplest way around that is to have the seller raise the price and price out scalpers But everyone loses their shit when that happens for some silly reason Scalpers make things worse for everyone and lead to the same outcome as wed have if stores just prices things better Doing that also incentivizes the people who actually control production basically the sellers to produce more,m8x0tlk,1.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8xmnp7,shaky2236,,6,2025-01-24 16:29:26,,,,In curious since you think 2 grand is too low for the 5090 what should it be priced at How drastically would you like them to raise their prices If scalpers are selling it for double should nvidea sell the 5090 for 4000 Maybe even 5000 Would that be reasonable to you,m8xjlki,2.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8xqwf4,suicidaleggroll,,3,2025-01-24 16:48:48,,,,They should sell them for whatever price allows them to sell everything they produce That naturally wont be a constant over time maybe it would start at 4k and only the most diehard people would buy them then as that market dried up they would lower the price to draw in more and more people always setting the price at whatever was required to keep up with production Thats effectively the same thing thats happening now just with scalpers sitting in the middle,m8xmnp7,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8xojqt,microwavedave27,,0,2025-01-24 16:38:05,,,,If they cant scale up production to meet demand they should price it at the point where scalping becomes unprofitable If thats 4000 then price it at 4000 If some people are willing to pay that price might as well cut out the middleman Then just gradually lower the price as demand goes down,m8xmnp7,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8yuhzw,DeadNeko,,1,2025-01-24 19:52:26,,,,Youre objectively correct and it shouldnt even be a question If Nvidia was absorbing the extra money from pricing higher originally they could also scale down prices faster as demand drops because they are hitting their margins quicker But they cant because the hit they would take to their to image isnt worth it and if they did this consumers would see no reason to buy at the high price knowing it will drop Ie consumer behavior is not optimal for maximizing profit in the space and to do so would likely result in lower profits Right now the scalpers eat the brunt of the hate and NVIDIA likes that Although the consumer argument is why would they drop prices if they can sell at 4k they will just never drop them and the issue is they have severely less demand at that market price and eventually they are just leaving money on the table for no reason that no business savvy investor is ever going to be okay with It would be different if they were a luxury brand but they arent,m8xojqt,4.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8zj0ed,microwavedave27,,1,2025-01-24 21:48:44,,,,Yeah I guess that makes sense If doubling their prices made them more money they would have already done it anyway,m8yuhzw,5.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8xvldu,aaahhhhhhfine,,-1,2025-01-24 17:10:33,,,,Youre thinking of price as some abstract thing But its not Its just whatever youre willing to pay and theyre willing to sell And it changes a lot If you were almost out of gas Youll go to the more expensive station thats closer right If you were really thirsty on a hot day youd pay more for water Price isnt some magical fixed number And remember it goes the other way too If Nvidia tries to sell a card for 10k Few people will buy it,m8xmnp7,3.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8xm1l2,dzyp,,-2,2025-01-24 16:26:37,,,,Correct Scalpers exist because there is more demand than supply With no scalpers the cards just wouldnt be available to most people at all The real blame lies with nvidia And I cant really blame them because its more lucrative to sell compute to ai companies It sucks as a gamer first we had to deal with bitcoin miners and now the AI hype train Theres too much easy money still floating around and that money has been chasing bubbles that require compute Bad luck for us,m8xjlki,2.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8ydi23,rabouilethefirst,,2,2025-01-24 18:33:08,,,,They already create false hype by marketing nonexistent FE cards at MSRP to get people interested Then people say oh what the heck when they spend a few hundred more in reality You can probably count the number of 1999 5090s on one hand from each manufacturer They know what they are doing,m8y8e87,2.0,1i8wrcp
comment,m8yms01,MetalstepTNG,,1,2025-01-24 19:16:10,,,,Because they can artificially rig supply to create scarcity so that the hardcore enthusiasts pay more upfront than the average hobbyist would Basically if you can get a small to medium group of people to pay you more than a large group of people would you will cater your efforts more to the smallmedium size group of people because that makes you more money So its sort of supply and demand but in a disingenuous kind of way where they can halt production of cards and use market psychology via naming schemes and dishonest performance results to get their core audience to pay considerable amounts of money for their products,m8y8e87,2.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8xkeri,audigex,,9,2025-01-24 16:19:14,,,,The 40 series will drop in price right Economics supply and demand are still a thing right Kinda but supply and demand has two parts and youre only really considering part of that equation 40 series production has already ended so probably not really Sure the demand dries up when the new gen releases but so does the supply Whether the price drop therefore depends on which dries up first Chances are it will be hard to get hold of a 50 series card so there will still be demand for the 40 series and prices probably wont drop massively Its possible that there are enough 50 series cards to go around in which case sure the 40 series cards could drop in price a little as retailers try to offload their inventory but I think this is probably the less likely scenario and if it does happen it wont be for long or probably by huge amounts If retailers had loads of cards lying around then yeah prices would drop sharply but I doubt many retailers are gonna be sitting on a pile of them,m8x188u,1.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8yue8e,Shibbystix,,-4,2025-01-24 19:51:56,,,,OoOOOOr not every game people play is made to tax 4k boundaries Im sure it COULD matter to some but that wasnt my point now was it My point is that the PROBLEM with scalpers is largely contributed to by massive numbers of gamers desperate to address is my number bigger as opposed to does it impact my game performance and experience Those are people continually willing to pay above market prices to have the latest and greatest because its new Shiney not because they are filling the need To that my point still stands as i didnt claim i have the highest fps I stated that I run every game on Max with no performance hindrances I worked for a mobile IT company in a major city for almost 2 years right when the 3000 series came out and them immediately after the 4000 series and I cant tell you how many calls I had to swap out perfectly good 2080s in exchange for 3080s and then even had some return customers that hadnt even utilized the 3000s have me swap out for 4000s I was able to take home a number of 1070s 1080s 2070s 2080s and 2080tis from these people who were convinced they HAD to have the newest or their games wouldnt work well I gave em all out to people who had way older shittier cards who played games on my discord and everyone I gave upgrades to are having fun playing games on higher settings now and having a blast without wingeing over i cant game without a new 5080ti And myself on a 2080ti as well as the others that still run em that I play with all look at the newer cards and drool over how cool it would be but everyone has discussed this each time a new card comes out and pretty much everyone agrees theres no game with graphics so intense that were over here struggling to run at max graphics For the 2080tis at least And games have such varied art styles that even the 2070s are unaffected most games,m8ykl5b,4.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m91y4km,wolfiasty,,1,2025-01-25 06:40:39,,,,Great I just hope those are not big amounts Otherwise if there are idiots buying 5000s for double the MRSP sales managers from Nvidia will for sure take a note and you can be sure that prices for 6000s are going to be very much near what scalpers ask currently I cant wait to see 6060s if it will ever comes out for 1000 MRSP,,0.0,1i8wrcp

comment,m8xtq8p,ThatGuyFromTheM0vie,,0,2025-01-24 17:01:49,,,,Is the 32gb VRAM even a selling point for pure gamers If you do workstation type stuff or AI stuff or content creation on the side sure maybe And I get wanting to future proof your card for longer But 16GB of VRAM seems like its plenty for games today and probably for the next 5 years Because the major selling point of the 5090 besides being the best new card is the 32 gigs of VRAM And I dont see why you would ever pay 2000 4000 scalped for that Is there something Im missing A 5080 despite appearing to be like a 4080 Super still needs confirmation of course seems to be a much better deal if you can get one at MSRP If you can get lucky and find a used 4090 toothat also seems pretty good for pure gaming performance cost wise I just dont get any reason why youd even want a 5090 for gaming reasons,,0.0,1i8wrcp
