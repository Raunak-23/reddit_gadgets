comment,m7afzyx,dertechie,,97,2025-01-15 16:04:20,,,,Im guessing either N3 was too expensive or they couldnt get the defect rate acceptable when NVidia was taping out Blackwell I think Apple is still buying all of the N3E wafers and N3B had some issues,m7achic,1.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7j901b,Inquisitor2195,,-2,2025-01-16 22:55:49,,,,I am guessing you game at 1080p or 1440p For those resolutions yes complete overkill At 4k they need every DLSS and Frame gen trick in the book still to get consistent FPS above like 90 with high settings in a lot of games my 4070 Super struggles in some titles just to give me a solid 60 without having to drop some settings,m7dkynl,2.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7kms8z,CiraKazanari,,1,2025-01-17 03:42:31,,,,DLSS and Frame Gen are great and keep getting better so whatever Of course its gonna struggle in some titles Not all games are made well You dont need a 50805090 because of games that arent made well,m7j901b,3.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7ko973,Inquisitor2195,,0,2025-01-17 03:51:51,,,,Bare in mind I am talking about specifically 4k most modern games struggle with 4k even with DLSS hell I cant get a consistent 60 fps in Warthunder on high settings and that is not a graphically intensive game 4k requires an exponential increase in processing power and VRAM My point is for 1080p gaming I think cards 23 generations behind are fine and in 1440p you can probably get a very playable experience in modern games on lastgen hardware,m7kms8z,4.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7ait1j,RBS95,,133,2025-01-15 16:18:28,,,,If youre spending a lot of money on a camera in 2025 it should be for a mirrorless camera not a DSLR Unless youre just using that term to generally mean high end camera,m7a8snr,1.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7dcm00,user11711,,20,2025-01-16 00:40:07,,,,In simple terms Mirrorless has less moving parts and is able to capture exactly what you see on the view finder DLSR is very mechanical and has lots of moving parts To the point where shutter count is something to take into consideration when buying a used one As well since the viewfinder is a reflection on a DLSR it might not capture what you see exactly,m7ck6ws,3.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7eqd8a,TechSupportTime,,12,2025-01-16 05:59:13,,,,Thats all well and good but can mirrorless cameras make the kachunk noise when taking a photo Yeah I didnt think so,m7dcm00,4.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7fdr2u,pinionist,,4,2025-01-16 09:53:44,,,,They dont play it they have a moving shutter which you can turn off and shoot silently Which is very desirable for a lot of professionally working photographers Also the whole thing about not having mirror blocking sensor is that camera can process what lens sees all the time and be ready or even shoot photos before you actually press the shutter button It can use AI to focus better and more organically on minutia details like peoples eyes,m7exk75,6.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7fdjjc,styx66,,2,2025-01-16 09:51:31,,,,The majority of mirrorless cameras still have a mechanical shutter Still less parts than a flipping mirror shutter combo but still would have a shutter that can wear A few cameras like the Nikon z9 have no mechanical shutter at all and some let you turn on an electronic shutter for silent operation but with some drawbacks,m7dcm00,4.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7c1tge,Dirty_Dragons,,12,2025-01-15 20:41:36,,,,You might want to consider used 3080 4070ti etc Im sure there will be plenty of people trying to sell their cards so they can buy 50 series,m7awv05,2.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7bgl7b,Kortesch,,-5,2025-01-15 19:00:41,,,,Well as someone with semiUltrawide 1440p so 3440x1440 4090 already isnt enough for PvP games 175hz People will always tell you 4090 is more than enough even for 4k and that might be true for SP games But for PvP games thats just not true I simply cant play on max settings because I of course want 175 fps and I dont even have 4k more like 3k So depends on how many frames you want and how bad the games you play are optimized D But the general consensus is that my opinion mind thats not an opinion its how many frames I objectively have is bullshit lol,m7awv05,2.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7cht38,lxs0713,,6,2025-01-15 21:56:06,,,,Dont people who play pvp games competitively turn settings down anyways I thought running games on max wasnt common And even then those games usually arent very demanding I know Marvel Rivals isnt that optimized but then again what UE5 game is,m7bgl7b,3.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7cyocg,Kortesch,,2,2025-01-15 23:22:15,,,,Yea but because the performance isnt good enough at least in my case,m7cht38,4.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7c5trr,ExaltedCrown,,2,2025-01-15 20:59:52,,,,Know the feels The sub for my country says a 4070 super is good enough for all games and future games for 144hz 1440p many even claim 4k gaming I get super downvoted when I say thats not true,m7bgl7b,3.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7gderd,twigboy,,3,2025-01-16 14:28:20,,,,Because tech prices used to drop over time and the new gen releases too the place of the old gen at release Now we have prices that either stay MSRP or go over and people are somehow ok with that NVIDIA is taking you all for a ride as planned This was in their leaked notes to control market pricing,m7gaepc,5.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7adbrw,Airanuva,,11,2025-01-15 15:50:56,,,,Used to be tech jumped every 2 years such that a powerhouse machine one year was another years minimum But Im only now upgrading my PC after 6 years on a Dolphinlevel machine and the upgrades are only now actually somewhat substantial but not by a lot such that the only changes are that my CPU wont run hot when playing certain games,m7aad2j,2.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7bu2b6,CookieKeeperN2,,6,2025-01-15 20:05:03,,,,I got a 1080ti in the summer of 2017 I upgraded to a 3080 on launch lucky enough to get one in the fall of 2020 I was thinking this over 800 MSRP was crazy and I cant believe I didnt upgrade my GPU for 3 years Now its 2025 and I have no intention of upgrading at all,m7adbrw,3.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7fbs5s,SpeedflyChris,,1,2025-01-16 09:32:28,,,,Yeah I also got a launch 3080 2000 series to 3000 series was the last really decent generational improvement Also the gap between the 3080 and 3090 was tiny really and the pricing made no sense but now weve swung too far the other way I think with the 5090 being the only really interesting card in the new lineup and the 5080 delivering barely over half the performance,m7bu2b6,4.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7g0bxh,MrMahavishnu,,2,2025-01-16 13:09:52,,,,I really think the 3080 will go down in history as a legendary card similar to the 1080 Ti Crazy performance leap over the previous gen likely doesnt need to be upgraded for 67 years and of course the insane demand and infamous scalping,m7fbs5s,5.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7an5ii,okram2k,,5,2025-01-15 16:39:48,,,,while were not at the theoretical limit of chip technology yet I think weve reached a stagnation point because any improvements are exponentially more expensive to achieve So we have been seeing a focus on other areas to improve that are less flashy but still nice like more efficient power usage cooler temps bigger memories and storage capacity more parallel processors and better coded features And if youre really honest with yourself most consumers probably dont need much more power to meet the demands of what they ask of their devices unfortunately companies have built their entire business model off of a new product at a regular basis and its getting harder and harder to convince people to spend on a new phone and computer every other year,m7aad2j,2.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7i8dz6,kennystetson,,1,2025-01-16 19:56:27,,,,The 4090 was a pretty significant improvement over the 3090 in pure raster performance compared to earlier gens These new card feel like 2xxx series all over The 2xxx offered little raster improvement and relied on Ray tracing which was a bit of a gimmick at the time to carry the sales The 4090 is banking on DLSS4 to do the same thing,m7aad2j,2.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7bm7cm,PainterRude1394,,-7,2025-01-15 19:27:33,,,,Wild thats your takeaway Maybe you dont understand what is being released Folks who have been around for a while recognize this is the most innovation in graphics rendering weve had in decades The whole a little bit faster at the same stuff was boring imo,m7aad2j,2.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7bqnuj,PainterRude1394,,-3,2025-01-15 19:48:49,,,,Seen this is the problem People dont even understand the basics of what they are talking about they are just parroting talking points to whine Yes dlss4 transformer model noticably increases dlss upscaling quality solidifying dlss upscaling as the best upscaling product available And this is being updated for all rtx cards ever made all the way back to 2018 Yes dlss multi frame gen now allows for 3 generated frames per individual frame while adding maybe 10ms latency Yes the new frame gen also reduces memory consumption Then we turn to other features they are releasing Nvidia reflex 2 further reduces latency of camera movement Brand new features that can be stacked with reflex RTX Neural Shaders RTX Neural Texture Compression RTX Texture Filtering RTX Neural Materials RTX Mega Geometry can all be used to greatly increase visual fidelity andor decrease resource consumption Since youre totally unaware of all of this I highly recommend reading a bit or at least watching a video to get the basics Yes these are innovative despite you not understanding what youre talking about Yes this is a lot more innovation than just switching to a new node and throwing more transistors on the chip Neural shaders are already being implemented in directx to support many of these features,m7bmhh3,4.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7bt1x0,positivcheg,,5,2025-01-15 20:00:08,,,,As a guy who actually programs graphics and writes shaders I would say that only half of that feels like might be of use The other half might just be a marketing stuff The problem is that all the neural blablabla are simply math models that transform something into something And those transformations usually give something but sacrifice something sacrifice is usually in accuracy compared to precise algorithms Ray tracing in real time was a nice thing But using AI for faking frames and also altering stuff to me doesnt look like a right path to go to progress To me its an insanely LAZY way to provide increments However it gives huge marketing space as simply doubles FPS reduces memory but hello loses precision and stuff like that Its not a progression towards something good Its just using buzzwords and workarounds to achieve better pure metrics like FPS,m7bqnuj,5.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7dpogr,Carefully_Crafted,,2,2025-01-16 01:54:22,,,,Maybe I mean its possible its not a true hardware limitation but honestly I wouldnt be too sure They havent locked DLSS behind hardware before when possible And even here the only thing not coming is MFG Its entirely possible the new chips were designed for MFG somehow and that didnt play well with old chips The real competition is between them and amd for gpus It helps them to add this type of tech to older cards Just like adding DLSS originally to older cards was a jump in performance,m7d837h,4.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7acl3f,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,4,2025-01-15 15:47:14,,,,This is a deliberate design choice here They have foregone increasing the raster and even RT performance in favor of doubling the AI performance I guess it remains to be seen whether the AI frame warp will make the AI frame generation more generally usable and whether the new AI model for the AI upscaling is significantly better,,0.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7agr4p,Noxiuz,,7,2025-01-15 16:08:09,,,,What I dont understand is why they didnt teach the AI how to bring back SLI and make it far more efficient than it used to be years ago or how to make GPUs significantly more powerful instead of being stuck with just a 15 to 33 percent performance uplift with each release lunless you use DLSS I know its easier said than done but didnt they just show us impossible graphics by using DLSS Yet Im still sure they could have done far more than just DLSS,,0.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7amk62,KingKapwn,,24,2025-01-15 16:36:53,,,,SLI loses you performance because the cards need to sync up and that often loses your performance as the cards need to ensure theyre insync before they do anything adding latency that a single card just doesnt have and thats just the reality of why SLI went away Closest you can get to bringing SLI back is adding an Intel ARC card just for AV1 Encoding,m7agr4p,1.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7bkqqy,ThisFreakinGuyHere,,-9,2025-01-15 19:20:34,,,,Youre just explaining why SLI has drawbacks Nothing they said indicates they didnt know that All they said was AI should be being used to overcome the drawbacks Not every reddit comment you come across is an excuse to try to look smart,m7amk62,2.0,1i1zm1n
comment,m7copy3,Thandor369,,5,2025-01-15 22:30:02,,,,AI is not a wizard that can grand wishes Machine learning is great for making assumptions based on existing information or finding patterns and a lot of data But it cant just create new ideas SLI was quite questionable thing for gaming even back in the day you was lucky if you got 50 more performance for adding another cart And lot of games just did not support it because it was hard to implement properly What the guy above said and you failed to understand is that having two separate cards nowadays just cant be feasible there is just no such port that will not be a bottleneck in such setup It is much better and cheaper to just squeeze more cores into one GPU Every GPU producer ditched that idea not because they cant do it but because it proved to be a dead end,m7bkqqy,3.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7fxgpw,Thandor369,,1,2025-01-16 12:50:37,,,,Yeah and they did this for a reason not because they were just lazy Having more cores on one die will always be more performant and cheaper solution The technology itself isnt dead there are still cases where some communication between multiple GPUs required this is why they still have NVLink But for gaming it proved to be useless you cant just get around sync it has to be in place and any way of syncing will be cause performance degradation modern GPUs are just too fast for it to give any advantage,m7fw985,5.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7bc19d,kawag,,8,2025-01-15 18:39:09,,,,This is why they are investing so much in AI for graphics rendering Mark Cerny said the same thing Basically the only way left to improve traditional raster performance is to make bigger and bigger GPUs bigger in the sense of cramming more compute units in there Thats made possible by manufacturing advances but its not going to last forever Instead we need to look at different approaches to achieve better graphics and RT and AI seem like they could be paths for massive gains in fidelity DLSS has already been hugely successful so the concept seems sound Yet people at this early stage dont seem too impressed by the reliance on AI from what I can tell,m7b3r4e,1.0,1i1zm1n

comment,m7crxj1,Thandor369,,1,2025-01-15 22:46:23,,,,They obviously faster than previous generation but it is unclear how much faster really because they use benchmarks with generated frames in their graphs And if you compare with super models that came out later and replaced original 40 cards prices apr pretty much the same So it is not a revolution you just get 25 more performance for the same money People just expected more,m7bwmz1,1.0,1i1zm1n
