comment,n6lfq5e,master2873,,1,2025-08-02 21:53:14,,,,If theres anything I learned about Switch if its a third party game without cross play its the fastest community to die first for those games That or they forcibly would because of archaic Nintendo policies that limit you on your in game purchases of premium currency for games For example Warframe has a premium currency called Platinum You can trade this platinum with other players but Nintendo policy prevents users who paid or traded for this currency to be locked to the platform and you cannot trade platinum via cross platform with other players either because of this archaic policy Only with other Switch users To add more context to this Warframe didnt get cross play until a few years ago and has already been out on Switch since 2018 or so Also if you were gifted Platinum either with a new account at the time like I did or from winning it via raffles its labeled as gifted platinum and cannot be traded as well This effects all platforms and not really an issue as theres ways to still spend it for cosmetics and other items and the rule is evenly applied It also only effects that amount and is tracked on their site as well and can be seen fairly easily Now players have the option to finally get off the Switch as many were begging to especially since when the Switch port came out you had a limited time if you wanted your PC save transferred to Switch It also creates an issue where the Switch version is the worst version to play not just from poor performance at times and lower quality visuals if you care you cannot interact with the game in the same capacity as everyone else Sure you can trade item for item still but thats an EXTREMELY rare occurrence The iOS version is out and Android is in closed beta currently and they too feature universal Platinum wallets while Switch is sitting alone and the devs have yet to still see a Switch 2 dev kit to make a proper Switch 2 port that doesnt crash a lot via backwards compatibility from what Ive heard Not to mention the community at times would basically bully Switch users and got more aggressive when Cross play came out To even go as far to block you despite cross play is out because you cant trade with them further pushing users away from the platform,n6dsas2,6.0,1mercz4
comment,n6ljl2g,CrazyCoKids,,1,2025-08-02 22:15:36,,,,The sad thing is limiting the amount of currency you can purchase on games is a good thing even if Warframes one of the few good F2P games ie shutting down monetization methods because they made too much money Games need LESS Whaling mechanics not more I find it quite hilarious people do that since it became such common practice to harass whales on other games to thep oint where some game studios have been removing emotes used to harass them or even removing ingame chat due to people being shitnozzles As an aside I also find it hilarious that whenever people complain at Nintendo having not enough third party support they always give a resounding Meh at 999999 third party games on their platforms and if it is a good game say Hey its also on PCPSXbox and shame you for daring to buy it on Nintendo Then mock Nintendo fans for feeling bullied,n6lfq5e,7.0,1mercz4
comment,n6eo0e3,Impossible_Front4462,,1,2025-08-01 19:46:14,,,,Thats actually really interesting to me because Ive seen this a lot in this thread but it still is extremely common for me to see switches in public here in SoCal Even my friends who barely ever game have one from how handy it can be for random hangouts,n6dsas2,6.0,1mercz4

comment,n6et6ve,CrazyCoKids,,2,2025-08-01 20:12:08,,,,Yeah theres a lot of I personally jave never seen them so theyre not really this popular Im giving my experience Even when my sisters school had a special late start for things like standardized testing and ACT day where students were allowed to bring those nobody brought a switch When I had some downtime last year atthe college campus I sat in thr student centre with a switch lite and people looked at it like I had some kind of alien tech No I dont like in Wyoming or Tlaxcala before you ask,n6eo0e3,7.0,1mercz4

comment,n6eerxo,AugustEpilogue,,2,2025-08-01 19:00:28,,,,First switch was an affordable 300 dollar gadget This switch 2 is like 550 dollars Id never take it outdoors In fact I wish they made a cheaper console version that was just a box without a screen,n6db0zo,5.0,1mercz4

comment,n6dei98,ChaseballBat,,-1,2025-08-01 16:06:43,,,,Looks like the original switch sold 91M in the same time period for the US And Switch 2 sold 18M so far in the US percentage wise I guess its nearly the same amount Just weird I dont know anyone with one or seen many people in public with one I am not saying its a conspiracy just weird lol,n6db0zo,5.0,1mercz4

comment,n6dzm1a,Duskflight,,1,2025-08-01 17:47:01,,,,I find its just really unwieldy as a handheld Its actually very big compared to the 3DS and 3DS XL and you need a backpack to carry it around Cant just put it in a pocket or a purse like you could with the DS The battery life is also worse and for a short play session on your commute or something most people find a smartphone to be more convenient Youre already carrying it the games on it are more built for short play sessions etc Switch is still a good console and incredible technology dont own a Switch 2 so I cant comment on it but I find its best handheld mode use is for playing video games in bed or in your hotel room while on vacation,n6dei98,6.0,1mercz4
comment,n6eymwe,The-student-,,-1,2025-08-01 20:39:07,,,,Thats just how numbers work Of course youll know people with something that sold 10s of millions in the US versus something that sold less than 2 million,n6dei98,6.0,1mercz4
comment,n6ezw3t,ChaseballBat,,1,2025-08-01 20:45:19,,,,Im just annecdotally recalling the first quarter or so of switch 1 compared to switch 2 How is that how numbers work if I recall seeing more switch 1 users in public when they have sold half as much as switch 2,n6eymwe,7.0,1mercz4
comment,n6f1d0j,The-student-,,0,2025-08-01 20:52:37,,,,Thats how anecdotes work In the first few months of the Switch 1 I saw no one else with the console outside of myself and my group of friends And I was going to university at the time But if we want to look deeper into it I dont know what the demographic different between the consoles is at this time Dedicated video game hardware leans older and older these days and more expensive hardware could mean less younger people buying the Switch 2 at this time I would argue younger people are more likely to be seen in public playing games Could also be that less people find it novel to take the Switch outside or that the Switch 2 is so big that more people are keeping it at home Who knows,n6ezw3t,8.0,1mercz4

comment,n6dculg,josega572,,-1,2025-08-01 15:58:43,,,,Yeah I have noticed its almost an age group thing 30somethings with disposable income quickly gobbled up the Switch 2s without much worry about the 500 price tag Without the game library it really is a frivolous upgrade Especially when you can get a homebrew capable switch 1 with thousands of free games still,n6d2p2b,5.0,1mercz4
comment,n6dezxg,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,5,2025-08-01 16:09:07,,,,If youre gonna get one at all theres no particular reason not to get it now Its a Nintendo product so its not like it will go on sale at some point,n6dculg,6.0,1mercz4

comment,n6dnnts,CaptainStabfellow,,2,2025-08-01 16:50:49,,,,Volume of early sales is not really a great indicator for comparing the two consoles because Nintendo was much more prepared for the Switch 2 launch than for the original Switch as far as supply goes You dont know just how high demand is if your supply cant meet it It was pretty hard to get a Switch for an extended period post release,n6cwn9n,2.0,1mercz4
comment,n6dozta,ChaseballBat,,1,2025-08-01 16:57:15,,,,Its completely annecdotal but I can recall on the bus seeing several people use the switch two while commuting I now take a train which has thousands of more passengers and have only seen someone use the switch 2 once Is there indication that the switch 2 cant meet demand Target can deliver a switch 2 in a week,n6dnnts,3.0,1mercz4
comment,n6dzlvu,CaptainStabfellow,,3,2025-08-01 17:47:00,,,,No its the opposite The original Switch did not have nearly enough supply to keep up with demand when it launched in 2017 It would have been impossible for the original Switch to match the Switch 2s 583 million sold by the end of the first month because there werent 583 million Switches available to purchase at that point,n6dozta,4.0,1mercz4
comment,n6evxg5,CrazyCoKids,,1,2025-08-01 20:25:44,,,,Not only that but you could order it from Nintendo directly I literally preordered mine and figured hey if I find it early I would just let the invite expire After all its not like you had to put a down payment on like some stores require I think some still do I got the invite last Friday and had it by wednesday Last time I had to get lucky,n6dnnts,3.0,1mercz4
comment,n6dt64d,TwistedBrother,,2,2025-08-01 17:17:05,,,,I suspect I was one of many people who 1 Didnt think WiiU was much of anything 2 Thought the 3DS was a sort of tacky version of the wonderful DS and especially the DS lite Thus this point Nintendo were really in fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me territory A lot of people were rightfully skeptical of a mobile system that is good as a console it _is_ a console But it worked and thus we have such great numbers for the Switch 2 Having had mine since launch I can say Mario is fun too many complain about it but the actual launch slate has been a bit underwhelming It was nothing like the face melting changes that came with Nintendo 64 and Wii But it is definitely a better console than the original so much cleaner in many ways but ultimately it currently feels like a nice Switch not a new experience So I consider those numbers really representative of how much goodwill the Switch bought Nintendo And similarly the Switchs numbers reflecting how much they lost with the prior generation,n6coo3m,1.0,1mercz4
comment,n6edln9,alidan,,1,2025-08-01 18:54:44,,,,the wiiu was more or less bringing nintendo to 360ps3 graphics but the naming made it sound like a perfieral rather than a console the switch was basically a consolidation of handheld and console the obvious way to go the 3ds was a fantastic concept but the problem was useing it as intended would halve the already crap framerate I cant tell you how much I love playing games in 3d but the tech never took off because movie studios screwed us over hard with crap 3d conversions so there was never worth while content for them,n6dt64d,2.0,1mercz4

comment,n6ce104,SmokelessSubpoena,,-53,2025-08-01 13:06:57,,,,Is it being miserable when you point out the predatory nature Nintendo takes Id argue its actually the complete opposite of miserable and being realistic with the options placed before us _Gee I cant wait for the Nintendow Switch 2 OLED model what a first great big step in technology that would be_ oh wait they could have just done that from the beginning since the technology was already adopted for the Switch 1 Nintendo couldnt be gatekeeping tech for future iteration releases to MAKE MORE MONEY could they Its not being miserable when video games have just become another area for the rich to make money off the masses Growing up video games have been an integral part of my learning development and entertainment What happens when the entertainment goes in place of revenue and shareholders profits Its still being negative and miserable when pointing out facts,n6bw2e6,1.0,1mercz4

comment,n6eiz5b,Goadfang,,10,2025-08-01 19:21:08,,,,Are you taking the piss I cant tell First Im 49 im closer to being too old to remember games sold whole at launch than I am too young I remember the first games that even had expansions when you had to buy those expansions on discs because there wasnt any such thing s downloadable content We were pretty excited about those expansions because they expanded on games we love which is what happens with a lot of expansions today Second its super rich that someone who plays Raid Shadow Legends is lecturing anyone on falling for abusive microtransacrions Perhaps the reason you think the video game industry is so predatory is because youve slathered yourself in butter and leapt into the jaws of the woest of its predators Dead or Alive 6 is absolutely an instance of abusive microtransactions but there is no one holding a gun to your head and making you or anyone else buy into that bullshit and we have a term for those people who do buy into that bullshit and its the same term we use for people who play Raid Shadow Legends Idiots Nintendo coming out with a new console is not an example of predatory game design but even if it were it would be the Idiots that make it possible Quit being an idiot,n6efake,4.0,1mercz4
comment,n6eu418,alidan,,-3,2025-08-01 20:16:41,,,,raid has a horrible reputation for a deserved reason however the shocking thing about it is in spite of that bad reputation its a relatively fair free to play experience the only parts of the game that are pay to win is the arena crap they tend to force you to play but they even made that aspect less abusive with recent updates I wont say its the best game to play but i like having an idle style game I can use as a controlled distraction and raid definitely fits that bill and expansion packs for games its a fucking treat when we get one anymore im trying to think of the last ones we got and im just able to think of everquestff14wowwitchercyberpunk and 3 of those have cash shops in game and monthly subs so no matter what you think its a shitty move to pay on top of a 120240 a year sub 4080 for an expansion only other games I can think of would be racing games putting out a track an 4 cars and if you really love sim racing that will get you your moneys worth but most modern publishers are perfectly ok with selling me 4 hours of content for a 20 hour long game for an extra 6080 day one as for doa6 its a fantastic example of selling you crap that takes very little effort to make but also stripping a fairly important aspect of a game out to sell to you later the unlocking of new cosmedics in doa 5 and 6e case they never consolidated the dlc into a single package at eol like nearly every other game does people always say if you dont like it dont buy it and sure you are technically correct how are games that took 100 million to develop able to sustain themselves on cosmedics if they dont matter they seem to me at least to matter quite a lot now on nintendo being predictor or not they have stick drift issues still they could have put hall effect sensors in them and fixed that but they didnt their policy would see them brick your console if they find out you modded the controller to use an aftermarket hall effect sensor but they will sell you replacements for 100 they will sell you a tech demo that should have been included in the console as an intro to the system for what was it 10 or 20 and then to do everything in it you need to spend is it 90 more dollars or was it higher than that then they put honestly the shittiest lcd panel they could find into the switch 2 and they will sell versions with better panels over time effectively double dipping on the console sales and with their used market and heavy handed bricking policy their was a massive cooling effect on used sales then lets not forget the 8090 new game cost the game is not on the cartridge its a drm for the digital version the pretty damn bare bones launch game and then the palworld lawsuit which while it isnt part of the console itself shows how shitty nintendo is and we can go back to when the nes first came out and how if videogames were illegal to rent in any country it was because of nintendo and them sueing world wide to make rental for games illegal and just to preempt a potential palworld copied nintendo look at some of the absolute bullshit nintendo is trying to throw at them like riding a mount all while nintendo copied Digital Devil Story Megami Tensei which predates pokemon by almost 10 years nintendo gets absolutely 0 credit or benefit of the doubt after all their shitty things they have done their decisions are made with maximizing profit the person who actually cared about the product died a while ago sadly,n6eiz5b,5.0,1mercz4

comment,n6dfz4v,Dan_Felder,,3,2025-08-01 16:13:49,,,,Saying well games sell more copies now and distribution is cheaper overall does not let you ignore the other realities of the market The cost to develop games has gone up far more than the cost of the games The dev team for the original Zelda on the NES was like 10 people It sold for about 50 at launch if I remember correctly The first castlevsnia dev team size was similar and took much less than a year to make Breath of the wild took about 10x as many people across multiple years For a while the prices could ignore inflation because the market grew faster than inflation and the distribution costs went down too However games have been mass market for a while now and distribution costs arent getting dramatically lower anymore now digital downloads are a standard The teams are still getting more expensive too because their salaries need to keep up with inflation Price increases are inevitable Meanwhile if you are satisfied with small team games that can be made much more cheaply there are endless great indie games out there for 15 There are also tons of discounts on older games and you can get great titles for 75 off or more regularly or get them as part of some humble bundle Its a pretty good time to be a gamer,n6cwoht,2.0,1mercz4

comment,n6f2hn3,hollow114,,0,2025-08-01 20:58:12,,,,From my post below The cost of manufacturing a cartridge insane compared to a CD Its why a PS1 game was almost half the cost of a N64 game The added profit from switching to CDs allowed more investment into development You also still still still need to factor in economies of scale as well Its not a simple 11 comparison No matter how hard you want it to be Does it cost more to develop yes Does it cost less to make also yes Mario 64 sold 11 million copies 1130 means 300 million of the 600 million revenue was all put towards making the physical thing Equivalent to the development cost of a AAA title today If you can refute this Be my guest Im happy to be corrected,n6do3bv,4.0,1mercz4
comment,n6hcjp3,Dan_Felder,,1,2025-08-02 05:34:46,,,,I already corrected you You seem to assume that because some things went up and some things went down they will be in equilibrium forever That is obviously not correct The market size went up and distribution costs went down for a long time even more than the skyrocketing dev costs but that trend stopped a while ago Its hard to keep cutting distribution costs when digital game distribution has been mainstream for well over a decade now Digital distribution also means there is now far more increased competition for game than ever before As for the dev costs theyve continued skyrocketing Theyre not slowing down at all Mario 64 was made in about 2 years by about 20 people Miyamotio said 1520 Mario Oddyssey required well over 200 peopleand was in development for about 4 years The same team apparently made Donkey Kong Bananza which just came out and was in development for 7 years With salary of the team also having to keep track of inflation Bananzas development would have cost somewhere beteen 30x to 50x what mario oddysseys dev did Marketing costs increased with inflation too as did many other costs The factors increasing revenue no longer outpace the factors increasing costs including inflation So with all those factors youre getting a much more polished game that cost like 40x as much to make for even less than what you used to pay once you adjust for inflation Thats just true,n6f2hn3,5.0,1mercz4

comment,n6jsko0,hollow114,,0,2025-08-02 16:30:44,,,,So which part of the it cost 30 per cartridge did you either ignore willingly or mistakingly Or did the words in that order confuse you I can dumb it down Mario sell 119 million units Cartridge sell for 60 Cartridge cost 30 make Now What you do Is you take 30 and you multiply it by 119 and you get the Physical manufacturing cost of the game NOW TAKE THAT NUMBER AND COMPARE IT TO THE COST TO DEVELOP THE ENTIRETY OF GTA 5 JESUS CHRIST AND THATS NOT EVEN FACTORING IN FUCKING INFLATION Whats hard here to understand What part is so confusing bro Whats the struggle I can use pictures if you need You literally shit out a bunch of guesses without listing a single dollar value,n6jrr1t,8.0,1mercz4
comment,n6jvzq3,Dan_Felder,,1,2025-08-02 16:48:56,,,,So which part of the it cost 30 per cartridge did you either ignore willingly or mistakingly I referred to distribution costs falling in the second paragraph I referenced how Digital Distribution became mainstream which dramatically lowered the average distribution cost You cant get much cheaper than digital distribution For a long time revenue grew faster than costs inflation rose due to a mix of market size increases lower distribution costs Im including the price of manufacturing in the distribution cost since digital distribution was a major factor in lowering those costs too As long as that happened prices could stay at about 60 However that trend stopped a while ago and the rising dev costs inflation in addition to more competition for gamer has not stopped Continuing to type in allcaps about 30 cartridges is irrelevant Things change and you cant reduce distribution costs forever Mario 64 was also a megahit the bestselling N64 game The average game even today doesnt get 11 million sales Only 21 games on the Switch have sold 10 million copies or more on that platform Even major switchexclusive hit titles like Metroid Dread only sold 307 million copies You cant price games assuming youre going to get 10 million sales Even if it now cost 0 to distribute games full digital with no physical copies inflation would keep rising and force price increases eventually You cant lower costs below 0 You can keep raising inflation and dev costs though Thats what happened,n6jsko0,9.0,1mercz4
comment,n6k26yh,hollow114,,1,2025-08-02 17:21:49,,,,3011 million is 300 million 300 million adjusted is 600 million Go ahead and find me a game that cost 600 million to develop today Ill wait Find it and Ill literally pay you money Ill drop to my knees and give you an old fashioned even To save you time You cant And again I gotta bring up the point Mario 64 sold 12 million copies GTA 5 with a 300 million budget sold 215 million copies Lots and lots and lots of factors that To my point You cannot just point to a N64 game and say lol that was 60 we should pay 100,n6jvzq3,10.0,1mercz4
comment,n6kiytj,Dan_Felder,,1,2025-08-02 18:51:35,,,,1 Its not relevant to my point because most games dont come close to generating 600 million in total revenue but yes there have been games with total dev costs above 600 million in todays dollars The call of duty series is infamous for it in particular Some are estimating the new gta 6 is going to cost over 1 billion dollars by the time its done too I dont need your money but feel free to donate to a deserving charity in my name I like Doctors Without Borders 2 You continue acting like 10 million plus sales is normal when even a 3 million is a huge hit by modern standards Metroid dread was a huge success at only 3 million sales the best selling Metroid game ever and topping preorder charts A game can sell 13 of what Mario 64 did and still be a hit game in modern standards The market hasnt increased as much as you think for most new games 3 Many games lose money too Publishers fund a bunch of games hoping some will be hits and theyll pay for the ones that arent as well as make back their own investment Concord cost over 200 million some estimate closer to 400 million all in for Sony and sold 25000 copies 4 Youre objectively getting 100x bigger games for a lower price than you used to pay when you account for inflation Games made by simple size dev teams to Mario 64 1520 people over 2 years often cost much less than 60 too even in todays dollars Youre already getting a much better deal and your anger comes off as entitlement Im not going to bother responding to you anymore,n6k26yh,11.0,1mercz4
comment,n6dkcoj,hollow114,,0,2025-08-01 16:34:50,,,,Has it Do we have any data suggesting that games cost more now or are we guessing Again my point which keeps getting downvoted is VHS tapes also used to cost 60 Its because you have to factor in that games were priced for the video store Its not a easy calculation to make to just say oh inflation Youd need raw profit data which for Nintendo is kinda hard to find Edit found an answer to back up my claim at least a little The cost to manufacture a Nintendo 64 N64 cartridge was significantly higher than that of CDs which were used by competing consoles like the PlayStation Reportedly N64 cartridges cost over 30 to produce Switching to a CD digital or a lil SD card has saved a ton That money was then reinvested into development So still not an easy comparison Oh and demand absolutely matters when supply is technically unlimited Movies are the closest comparison They can also cost 300 million to make A blu ray is what 40 Add in a 20 movie ticket and you get 60 Based on recent release thunderbolts And its only that high because no one buys blue rays but afficionados So realistically much less But higher demand for movie seats,n6dfz4v,3.0,1mercz4

comment,n6cp213,longstoryrecords,,2,2025-08-01 14:04:46,,,,That said and Im not a big gamer these days but DLC has just gotten insane to me 90 of the games I still play require no internet connectivity let alone some account to maintain financially I really dont know first hand how costly it is to have a modern gaming habit but from a genx perspective it just seemed like too much after the sale costs that games I grew up with didnt have,n6cmflh,4.0,1mercz4
comment,n6cwc53,Queenspence2,,3,2025-08-01 14:40:07,,,,Tbf that is very true for gaming as a whole however Nintendo isnt known for that really its very rare games get dlc and when they do its something like doubling the amount of tracks in Mario kart 8 I definitely agree that its an issue though Ive always just been into Nintendo consoles really but my brother had an Xbox and the amount of money he would spend on fifa after buying it for 60 would drive me insane,n6cp213,5.0,1mercz4

comment,n6bta1m,Xanthon,,-7,2025-08-01 10:51:44,,,,I bought the Switch Lite when it was cheap but for the Switch 2 Ive decided not to even if it goes on discount Nintendo has always been anal but recent events that led up to the release of the Switch 2 has crossed a line for me Prices banning of consoles increased litigation against games like Palworld and worst of all going after youtubers who are just reviewing 3rd party consoles essentially ruining their livelihood All of the above are going after their own fans I dont think this is a company worthy of any support in the state its currently in Im not a Nintendo fan so its definitely easy for me to stay away from them I support Stop Killing Games so Im not gonna support nintendo for making so many of their old games inaccessible just because its Nintendo Way too many people are defending them by virtue of their brand and that is pathetic Many will be touting a different horn if the Switch 2 is a console by EA or Ubisoft,n6bl9ww,1.0,1mercz4
