comment,m6d2nna,NyuQzv2,,6,2025-01-10 06:17:00,,,,And the power consumption What HP pro mini do you mean I found one for 65W and a raspberry pi5 has around 12W means almost 5 times the energy cost Edit yes of course I know its max Depending on what you do I would say its not really an alternative it depends on your use case simple as that,m6bjqu9,1.0,1hxkb42
comment,m6ddovv,Jacek3k,,7,2025-01-10 08:02:09,,,,It is max What is important what is their idle power consumption The beefier x86 mini pcthin client will use up more power when doing intensive tasks yes but it will finish the tas faster Then it is going back to doing minimum And below 10W is totally doable with some systems I think Futro users claimed around 58W idle consumptions While the rpi lately rarily go below 5W also it is what I heardread I use rpi3b which is bit more low power,m6d2nna,2.0,1hxkb42

comment,m6dgjfq,simon132,,3,2025-01-10 08:32:06,,,,I got this one PC HP EliteDesk 800 G4 SFF Intel Core i58500 this is a SFF and not Mini The SFF can take 2 full 35 HDDs and has a bunch of pcie expansion slots If you want something simple and small the Mini version is much smaller not as small as a pi5 but really tiny This CPU has a quick sync capable GPU which means 4k hardware playback without lagging and will have much more performance than the pi5 Mine was 180 The pi might look cheaper but you still need a housing for it,m6dg1h0,4.0,1hxkb42
comment,m6dvb5h,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,2,2025-01-10 11:07:01,,,,Most of the mini PCs come with a power supply case fan and storage By the time you add that to a raspberry Pi 16GB your probably approaching 170 or more and the storage on the raspberry Pi is limited to SD cards unless you get even more expensive add on boards The raspberry Pi just isnt worth it unless you need the very small form factor which almost nobody does,m6dgjfq,5.0,1hxkb42

comment,m6bvf72,Fheredin,,24,2025-01-10 01:34:53,,,,If you can afford it I have generally found it better to over spec RAM because it reduces the stress SWAP causes on your storage This is often what causes microSD cards to fail That said I have a hard time imagining the time I would want a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB If I want that much RAM in an SBC I am reaching for something in the Orange Pi 5 lineup which costs slightly more but has a generally better processor and more PCIe lanes Thats a better balanced ARM device And of course switching to x86 is a whole different can of worms because your software compatibility is higher but your loaded power consumption is probably 4X what an ARM SBC would be,,0.0,1hxkb42

comment,m6bnqr6,alexanderpas,,20,2025-01-10 00:51:59,,,,That was mostly a problem with the Raspberry Pi 4 due to the pandemic disrupting the supply chain less than 1 year after release They chose to essentially sacrifice the consumerhobbyist market in favor of the industryeducation market for the Raspberry Pi 4 during the pandemic as that way they could prevent people from losing their jobs in industries that used the Raspberry Pi in their designs as well as keep it available on the market it was originally created for education The downside of that decision was that it fed into the hands of scalpers on the consumerhobbyist market even after the initial shortage was over since there was an artificial increased demand from the scalpers without enough supply to overwhelm the scalpers With the Raspberry Pi 5 this is not that big of an issue as there is enough supply to make scalping not really viable,m6bd9z8,1.0,1hxkb42

comment,m6hvw45,draconicpenguin10,,3,2025-01-11 00:19:49,,,,IMO 16GB is excessive for a singleboard computer of this sort and so is the price Ive been using a 4GB RPi4 as a jump server for my home network for the last few years with plans to upgrade to an 8GB RPi5 But 16GB Im not sure what application for an Arm SBC would genuinely require that much memory,,0.0,1hxkb42
comment,m6dmf2z,alman12345,,4,2025-01-10 09:35:30,,,,This is an awful product at that price the Radxa X4 has a full N100 that trounces the puny ARM cores and a GPU that actually handles encodes and decodes as well as 16GB of RAM at that same exact price Unless theres some motivation for extremely low power draw then I dont know why anyone would consider something that runs less software more slowly,,0.0,1hxkb42
comment,m6bibfp,ledow,,10,2025-01-10 00:22:15,,,,16Gb has been my minimum for servers for nearly 20 years and for basic computers for the last 10 or so at least 16 years ago ironically I started at a job and was given a 16Gb laptop without anyone raising an eyebrow Ive never used anything less since I was holding off on an RPi 5 even though it would neatly complete my collection of a firstbatch RPi 1 that I betatested an RPi 2 3 and 4 which I have loaded into a 5bay 19 rackmount for Pis Each of my Pis has a job each of them is basically a server for halfadozen services and each of them is limited most by the RAM So I have ordered one of these 16Gb versions now that they exist and I hate that these things just appear on the market without warning how many people are now looking at an RPi 8Gb that they splashed out on for Christmas Its going to run my Wiki my VPN my TV and Plex NVR my Flightaware and SDR my HomeAssistant etc The reason I had to split those services between RPis before RAM I probably wont be buying the RPi 6 when it appears theyve changed the way they operate to be entirely commercial now and theres almost no service Im interested in offering to my local network that would need more than a Pi 5 speed But I would hope that it would START AT 16Gb RAM Currently sitting on a 4yearold laptop that has had 64Gb all that time and even that is Kingston Fury RAM so it doesnt become a bottleneck You dont need 16Gb for minimal PC usage but the second youre actually using it 16Gb should be the absolute minimum nowadays Just Chrome alone can suck that up in an extended session But if you intend to actually use the machines for anything proper RAM is far more important than CPU speed once you hit a certain point PS work servers that I manage are currently using 256Gb each and I still dont think thats enough,,0.0,1hxkb42

comment,m6esy2d,ledow,,2,2025-01-10 15:00:59,,,,I have three RTL2832U and R820T tuner a basic generic device I picked up years ago and 2 x Nooelec RTLSDR v5 Each are connected to a Moonraker Skyscan Mobile Scanner Antenna The antenna are on a shed roof on the end of maybe 5m of extension cables with the SDRs in the loft and the Raspberry Pis in a network cabinet in the room below With pretty clear sky but not being highup at all just shedroof height and being in the middle of a valley my FlightAware stats show 50100 miles of aircraft reception in almost all directions except the one where the house is in the way but even that gets a good 50 miles They operate 247 and Im on my 300something day of consecutive operation without issues I live near an RAF base and it picks up all kinds of local flights international flights going overhead helicopters mainly Chinooks and private flights from local airfields It is literally as simple as connecting the antenna to the RTLSDR device and running the FlightAware software package mine runs on basic Ubuntu installs on a Raspberry Pi and letting it talk back I use a Nooelec for the FlightAware stuff but the other ran it fine for years too The other antennae SDR are there to run RTL433 to pick up a bunch of random devices temperature sensors weather stations car tyre pressure sensors I use the local FlightAware web interface to browse the data for myself and obviously it feeds into FlightAwares main dataset The only other thing I did was add in a decent GPS dongle VK162based USB GPS Receiver an IPX6 GPS receiver with 1 to 5Hz update rates that can receive GPS GALILEO and SBAS WAAS EGNOS MSAS GAGAN signals This lets me add in MLAT data into FlightAware and because I use it via GPSD other things can also query it eg for time synchronisation or location,m6ef8o2,2.0,1hxkb42
