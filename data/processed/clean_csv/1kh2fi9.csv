comment,mr43e1q,francescomagn02,,709,2025-05-07 18:51:43,,,,Everyone shit talking the specs when all i want to know is what this means for the chances the console has of a day 1 exploit,,0.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4j3p4,shavin_high,,300,2025-05-07 20:08:02,,,,100 percent I used the hell out of my day one switch 1 exploit,mr43e1q,1.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4qepl,alxrenaud,,163,2025-05-07 20:42:22,,,,Just give me a stable emulator like Ryujinx and Im fine I bought many switch games but I mostly play them on my emulator because the performance is so much better,mr4j3p4,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4ve3f,shavin_high,,90,2025-05-07 21:05:38,,,,Hopefully whomever comes along with a switch 2 emulator doesnt shout it from the rooftops like the last guys,mr4qepl,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr5zzru,StarZax,,58,2025-05-08 00:50:52,,,,They didnt especially Ryujinx devs What made so much noise was mostly the repackers uploading the new Zelda as if it was a PC game Fitgirl and stuff like that That gave way too much attention I had a friend who was playing BoTW in front of my eyes and when I asked which emulator he was using he asked me what an emulator was It was THAT easy I dont see why I should blame the emulators devs for doing that You could blame the Yuzu devs for making too much money with their patreon because theyd lock the early access versions behind a paywall but Ryujinx were square Its just bound to happen when piracy becomes THAT easy and mainstream History told that over and over again stuff like LimeWire eMule megaupload and so on,mr4ve3f,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6dv6e,Mehhish,,24,2025-05-08 02:10:00,,,,If you read the Discord the moderatorsdevs were being total dumb asses bragging about pirating TOTK before release and helping people get it running even providing download links That shit made me facepalm so hard Nintendo has spies everywhere its pretty obvious they would have spies in a Switch emulator Discord,mr5zzru,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6ga82,kayyeh,,10,2025-05-08 02:24:35,,,,What discord were you on The Ryujinx discord was pretty stringent on even mentioning the leak before the release While Yuzu was a bit more lenient I highly doubt anyone explicitly talked about running the game prerelease there,mr6dv6e,6.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6mx3j,ItsAMeUsernamio,,14,2025-05-08 03:06:56,,,,Its what got them in trouble in the end Yuzu had a paid early access patreon the whole point of which is to get patches for the newest games and for the ones in the later half of the Switchs life that meant games before release since people were able to upload roms of leaked physical copies due to the console being cracked wide open,mr6ga82,7.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8w6nu,StarZax,,0,2025-05-08 14:03:55,,,,No they didnt a lot of headlines tried to paint it like that At worst you had some moderators reaching out in DM to help unofficially like anyone else could but there was no piracy talk even less leaks,mr6ga82,7.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8vtlq,StarZax,,2,2025-05-08 14:02:00,,,,I heavily doubt youre talking about any official Discord It was very well known that leaks werent officially supported you needed to actively find unofficial patchesbypasses by yourself often available on github because the devs on both Yuzu and Ryujinx were clear and had rules about their software not being updated for leaks they would start to work on games after their official release With ToTK it just happened that because the game is coming near the end of the consoles life cycle it was running pretty well already Ive heard some things about the Yuzu discord like they were supposedly sharing some links on DM on something like that but it wasnt openbar piracy like some headlines tried to paint the situation to be But Ryujinx again they were square They werent making too much money because nothing was locked behind a paywall and thats probably why Nintendo never tried to sue them they just knocked on someones door and threatened Thats what they do And honestly even in Yuzus case I dont think they were cooked on the matter of whos right but they were definitely cooked on the matter of Nintendo having time energy and resources to spend on court,mr6dv6e,6.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr7b17r,hybridfrost,,1,2025-05-08 06:21:51,,,,Honestly Nintendo kind of showed their cards that the Switch 2 will likely have a similar vulnerability as the first Switch by absolutely stomping out the emulators of a 7 year old console at the time But yes the dev team basically throwing it in Nintendos face that they were pirating their brand new Zelda probably didnt help either,mr5zzru,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4w199,alxrenaud,,20,2025-05-07 21:08:45,,,,I would not be surprised if some guys just pick up Ryujinx and update it for Switch2 The architecture may not be much different if its so easily backwards compatible unless they run the Switch1 games on an internal emulator,mr4ve3f,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6djml,Mehhish,,6,2025-05-08 02:08:08,,,,Its more similar to Wine than an emulator,mr4w199,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr5f9jt,dire_bedlam,,14,2025-05-07 22:51:20,,,,ModernVintageGamer confirmed its emulation not native BC So I wouldnt expect an exploit or emulator any time soon,mr4w199,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr5j907,Slight-Coat17,,17,2025-05-07 23:14:08,,,,Its not emulation per se Its translation more akin to what Apple does with Rosetta to enable Intel apps to run on their custom CPUs If someone were to dump the translation layer from an exploitable Switch 2,mr5f9jt,6.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr66ipe,funguyshroom,,7,2025-05-08 01:28:03,,,,Rosetta is translating instructions from x86 to ARM Both Switch 1 and 2 are ARM so I wonder what is even needed to be translated,mr5j907,7.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr7e8i1,Phoenix__Light,,5,2025-05-08 06:53:35,,,,The API calls in the GPU changed between the tegra x1 and the more modern ampure generations,mr66ipe,8.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr7u0l6,SaintLouisX,,3,2025-05-08 09:39:32,,,,It doesnt change in any meaningful way either for the Switch service point of view or for the GPU itself The service that devs use to interact with the GPU doesnt have that much in it really ref cause there isnt a lot you need from it Allocating memory sending the command buffers and some synchronisation is mostly it which is just the address space channel and syncpt sections of that reference The rest dont really matter From the actual GPU side the architecture will be the same Graphics drivers ultimately just exist to turn the graphics api commands into a string of instructions to be sent to the GPU The process by which this happens pushbuffers doesnt change its the same in Maxwell as it is in Ampere and was introduced before Maxwell but I dont remember which architecture it came in on Maybe Fermi nVidias open docs dont list all architecture manuals unfortunately but you can compare the oldest they have volta with ampere for the pushbuffer stuff volta vs ampere Theyre identical and I promise its the same format for Maxwell on Switch 1 as this was implemented in Yuzu and Ryujinx And then you can look at the engine methods themselves like the 3d engine for example since thats what people usually care about most maxwell vs ampere and yeah they obviously differ in offsets but all of the basic stuff we care about is pretty much the same Old and new still of course have setting the type of vertices if transform feedback is used in the geometry shader tessellation config stuff setting the rasteriser config like viewportscissordepthclip planesstencil blend settings for fragment shader output etc etc Which shaders are active their program pointers and bind groupings I see there is some new stuff like the mesh shader methods in Ampere but as far as I know mesh shaders arent used very much currently so theyre not going to show up in a large percent of games anyway So yeah its a bit different but its not all unheard of for basic operation to get Switch 2 emulation going everything that already exists in the Switch 1 emulators can be reused there The way you interact with the GPU via the nv serivce will for sure be almost identical the way you read the commands and send them off into the engines is all the exact same The engines themselves are the only things which differ but theyre very similar overall nVidia dont entirely redesign their entire GPU architecture every new series its iterative development I think Switch 2 emulation if the console was day 1 hacked again could show up within just a few months It wouldnt be a basic emu only running the basic launch titles like Puyo Puyo Tetris for Switch 1 either it would be a pretty mature emulator That is if people werent afraid of a Nintendo lawsuit,mr7e8i1,9.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8oo7h,funguyshroom,,2,2025-05-08 13:23:26,,,,I think how hard Nintendo went after both Switch emulators one after another at the very end of the consoles lifecycle tells us everything we need to know about how difficult its gonna be to emulate Switch 2,mr7u0l6,10.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr953ti,SaintLouisX,,2,2025-05-08 14:48:31,,,,Yeah I think thats why Nintendo went after them because of how similar the architectures are Its the same kernel the whole services infrastructure will be the same Thats why I said I think it would only take a few months to get games running if another exploit was found,mr8oo7h,11.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mrd862v,JustMikesOpinion,,1,2025-05-09 04:17:17,,,,I appreciate the detailed explanation Helps me understand how it all works much deeper,mr7u0l6,10.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6j396,whut-whut,,6,2025-05-08 02:42:00,,,,Its for piracy protection The PS4 and PS5 do a similar thing running games in a virtual machine that only runs signed and encrypted data for games so its much harder to jailbreak the system,mr66ipe,8.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr5kgo6,NecroCannon,,-3,2025-05-07 23:20:54,,,,Thats the shit that irks me about modern piracy Shut the fuck up already you guys somehow fueling egos from this are fucking shit up for the people that just want to play games Its like the what are you going to do stab me of piracy YES THEYRE GOING TO GET IT REMOVED Piracy so well worked before because companies hardly knew how we were doing it now some dude emulating Mario Wonder on a Steam Deck can hit the front page of Reddit sharing it everywhere just to brag about running a game that would have of course run,mr4ve3f,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6jayz,TheMilkKing,,0,2025-05-08 02:43:21,,,,Companies hardly knew how we were doing it Bro you have no fucking idea what you are talking about You figured out how to pirate games and you dont think the companies which have an interest in the sales of those games could Besides most reliable sources operate out of countries that are legally untouchable We can yap about them as much as we like,mr5kgo6,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6jjd5,NecroCannon,,-1,2025-05-08 02:44:52,,,,Surrre thats why Switch emulators on Android keeps dropping like flies,mr6jayz,6.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6l4n5,TheMilkKing,,2,2025-05-08 02:55:03,,,,I was talking about modern piracy in general but regarding switch emulation specifically No shit thats gonna get blammed from official app stores Theres plenty of Android Switch emus on GitHub tho innit,mr6jjd5,7.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4vz1x,Jubenheim,,22,2025-05-07 21:08:28,,,,The performance is only better after years of tweaking and optimizing and you STILL dont have full compatibility for all games without varying amount of tweaking on your part Considering the Switch 2 is backwards compatible and way more capable than the Switch 1 Im completely hyped to buy the new console and never even so much as connect to the internet without an exploit posted online Itll be my goto handheld along with my Steamdeck if it means I can play all Switch 1 games with better compatibility for free,mr4qepl,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4wr00,alxrenaud,,3,2025-05-07 21:12:13,,,,And all the power to you I barely ever use my switch in portable mode I really cannot play comfortably on any portable console I use them almost only on flights I get that most people enjoy the portability a lot more as it suits their lifestyles better and that was the homerun the switch made,mr4vz1x,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mriqkyq,CatProgrammer,,1,2025-05-10 01:39:51,,,,The Switch 2 has also explicitly been stated to not be backwardscompatible with all Switch games,mr4vz1x,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mrizfr6,Jubenheim,,1,2025-05-10 02:37:27,,,,Misleading Nintendo explicitly stated that MOST Switch 1 games will be backwards compatible In fact you can even check out the list of Switch 1 games not compatible with the Switch 2 and how small it is,mriqkyq,5.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr5a2af,alman12345,,6,2025-05-07 22:21:51,,,,Why the fuck would I want to pay Nintendo again for doing 0 work porting it to the switch 2 and just running it at a higher resolution and frame rate Modders figured that out for free on the OG switch with overclocking Im not paying Nintendo full price to do essentially 0 work for the same Zelda experience Once theres a hardware exploit Ill buy the console and hold my middle finger to Nintendo as I do it,mr5860v,7.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr6klsa,TheMilkKing,,1,2025-05-08 02:51:40,,,,The amount of shit is a couple of mouse clicks over the course of a half hour and it saves potential thousands of dollars I have a 3DS loaded up with hundreds of games most of which are either unavailable for purchase digitally or insanely expensive physically Have fun paying 120 for Mario Kart tho,mr5860v,7.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mrahubl,Oops_I_Cracked,,1,2025-05-08 18:44:38,,,,Right To get the last game I pirated working the process was 1 Visit website 2 Find game I wanted 3 Click download 4 Launch game How is that so much shit It is genuinely no more difficult and honestly sometimes easier than getting a legitimately purchased game running on my PC,mr6klsa,8.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr9ex7g,homer_3,,0,2025-05-08 15:36:25,,,,the performance is so much better Its not though Like at all Performance is significantly worse in YuzuRyujinx,mr4qepl,3.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr5u4iy,AlexHimself,,3,2025-05-08 00:16:25,,,,I just ordered a switch 2 and Ive never owned a switch one What can you do with an exploit,mr4j3p4,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6614t,jackerypigeon,,13,2025-05-08 01:25:38,,,,The original switch shipped with a hardware vulnerability accessed by shorting two pins on the joycon rail that allowed you to load custom firmware homebrew games etc Later hardware revisions fixed the vulnerability but could be modded with a hardware modchip to boot similar software My launch switch is still going strong custom firmware and all Hoping for a similar exploit for the new one but wouldnt hold my breath haha,mr5u4iy,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6fb4g,AlexHimself,,8,2025-05-08 02:18:39,,,,Ah so you could bootleg games if you wanted to And other things of course but that makes sense,mr6614t,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mriqvlu,CatProgrammer,,2,2025-05-10 01:41:45,,,,accessed by shorting two pins on the joycon rail This is as silly and even easier than the PSP battery exploit what the fuck,mr6614t,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mwdiwj4,Kylemsguy,,1,2025-06-06 20:04:27,,,,This is different from the PSP trick That was how Sony implemented a way to reimage the console for repairs This was a leftover of when the Tegra X1 was being used in Android devices The low level recovery mode APX was triggered by holding two buttons probably volume updown and home and one of the buttons lived on the joy con rail I have no idea why they felt the need to do that Perhaps they had a debug jig that plugged in to the joy con rails for debugging,mriqvlu,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mwehcsc,CatProgrammer,,1,2025-06-06 23:12:00,,,,The low level recovery mode APX was triggered by holding two buttons probably volume updown and home That seems way too easy to accidentally do A bunch of phones still use volume buttonpower button for screenshot even,mwdiwj4,6.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mwfgv8c,Kylemsguy,,1,2025-06-07 02:53:14,,,,This button combination only triggers this mode on boot up A lot of Android and iOS devices have used these combinations to boot into recovery modes,mwehcsc,7.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr6nlar,jackerypigeon,,2,2025-05-08 03:11:28,,,,No evidence that anything similar will be possible on the Switch 2 yet although talented hackers will soon find out,mr6jrrp,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6oc4y,Eurynom0s,,8,2025-05-08 03:16:33,,,,I meant that Ill be more willing to fuck around with modding my OG Switch once I have the Switch 2,mr6nlar,6.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr5l6ie,Fredasa,,11,2025-05-07 23:24:54,,,,Hopefully they find it sometime in the next year so the emulator can be ready for when Froms game drops Im certainly not champing at the bit for an almostPS4looking _Mario Kart_ that continues the 20 year tradition of failing to hit 60fps in its party mode four player splitscreen,mr43e1q,1.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6dme9,DuckDatum,,1,2025-05-08 02:08:34,,,,Can you help me understand this What are we saying that theres a high probability of there being an exploitable hardware vulnerability to install your own firmwarelike with the switch1 What about the hardware being used would give away the idea that theres a high probability of that happening,mr5l6ie,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6iky3,Fredasa,,3,2025-05-08 02:38:46,,,,Hmm Its less about the hardware being likely to have an obvious vulnerability and more about the extreme desirability and therefore impetus for hackers to find a way Due to A portable console being inherently more useful to own in an unlocked capacity than typical consoles Nintendos properties being platform exclusive Nintendo reenteringor more accurately catching up tothe core gamer market _willy nilly_ not because the Switch 2 represents an unexpected leap in power not hardly but more because core _console_ gaming has been slowing down gen by gen until weve reached the point where From Software is willing to develop a AAA game for Nintendo That all said the Switch 2 _is_ roughly on par with a Steamdeck while having a larger and higher resolution screen That makes it a _de facto_ choice for emulators and the like Speaking of From Software their next Soulslike game is going to be exclusive to the Switch 2 Come hell or high water somebody _is_ going to do something about that Id rather not pretend that the combined genius of the hacking community is no match for a hardware market that has a history of being caught with their pants down,mr6dme9,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr7bd38,DuckDatum,,1,2025-05-08 06:25:03,,,,Yeah no argument against thatwhere theres a will theres a way and theres a whole lot of will no doubt Im just wondering why then thered be a priority for the first generation of devices I guess so that you can get a modded system as soon as possible makes sense I didnt understand what was changing between these generations and why Im noticing this prioritization Is there less will to mod the models that come after initial patches Like fewer people are working on it overall because theres now the option of just going on eBay to find a vulnerable model,mr6iky3,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8ki25,uzishan,,2,2025-05-08 12:59:19,,,,first generation usually tends to have these exploits a lot of them can be fixed simply by sw andor firmware updates and in some cases even hw revisions fix these exploits,mr7bd38,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8ke1l,uzishan,,0,2025-05-08 12:58:39,,,,By all metrics Switch 2 is noticeably above Steamdeck and thats the steamdeck oled 120hz screen hdr 1080p a chipset thats less power hungry while delivering slightly better handheld performance than the steamdeck battery lifeadvertised at least and way better size while also benefiting from games that will be optimized like crazy exclusively for it and with a more user friendly interfaceaccesibility,mr6iky3,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr91474,Fredasa,,1,2025-05-08 14:28:48,,,,When I brought up the comparison to the Steamdeckand I promise I was not attempting to be ambiguous about thisI was offering its value as an alternative to said device ie in what capacity it could potentially fulfill one of the Steamdecks most popular functions I was not repeat not trying to step on somebodys toes,mr8ke1l,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr697ev,SupremeDictatorPaul,,1,2025-05-08 01:43:03,,,,Ill get it but as the release title game its pretty underwhelming I know they just released Tears of the Kingdom like a year ago and a few Mario and Kirby games relatively recently but Im really surprised they dont have a Zelda or Mario game ready for launch I suspect they had all of the timelines set to release the games and Switch 2 a year or two ago and COVID screwed up the hardware timeline But it still feels disappointing I have to pay 20 to make Total look a little nicer on Switch 2 Really,mr5l6ie,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6h1jn,AnRealDinosaur,,2,2025-05-08 02:29:16,,,,Yeah very underwhelming Dont get me wrong I like playing Mario kart I am human after all but not enough to pay more than say 30 for it Not saying thats the value of the devs work just that its not a franchise Im super into I did order a switch 2 but only because Im worried about US pricing and availability and because I know there will eventually be new Zelda 3d Mario and Pokémon games Ill want to play Im not into any of the launch titles except the DK one That looks incredible but Im balking at the price for now I also have zero interest in physical releases that require downloads so I guess well see how that develops Ill just buy the game from the eshop if a game key is the only physical option,mr697ev,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6xnhp,SupremeDictatorPaul,,3,2025-05-08 04:23:50,,,,In general I only buy digital games and I only buy those using gift cards from Costco that I bought at 1020 off And I typically only buy the games if theyre already on sale Honestly I have no idea who is buying these games at 70 Those prices are ridiculous,mr6h1jn,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr8jlpl,uzishan,,2,2025-05-08 12:53:59,,,,A lot of people Games are behind in having prices updated for the inflation of the last 15 years Its all about the value each sees Like is that game gonna bring me x hours of enjoyment yes okay Ill get it eg for me Mario Kart 8 ended up bringing 300h of entertainment for 60euros Thats 300 goddamn hours for something that costs as much as 2 nights of partying And in general if its a game I judge can bring me at least 20h of actual enjoyment for 60euros then its a steal 70 euros at least 35h and 80euros at least 50 hours and some digital extra goodies Granted for nintendo games except for Mario Kart 8 I never paid more than 50euros per game because I had NSO and Id always get that 100eur eur for 2 tickets to redeem 2 nintendo exclusives,mr6xnhp,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6jxom,Eurynom0s,,2,2025-05-08 02:47:23,,,,I dunno if Switch 2 was impacted by COVID but Switch OLED was almost certainly supposed to be a Switch Pro and not just a Switch with a better screen before COVID hit,mr697ev,3.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mrmrfqj,rathlord,,1,2025-05-10 19:01:42,,,,They made active changes to their terms to explicitly state they would be trying to do just that so I dont think the worry is unfounded I cracked my old switch and am familiar with the DNS changes and stuff to avoid account bans but thats a big difference between an account issue and an actually bricked device Granted in most cases blocking network access might work but they could also build checks into the firmware to brick the device without communications which is the major difference between this and their old accountbased punitive system This would likely impact the people on the forefront of testing cracks and exploits the most with the majority of users waiting for presumed safe methods but that ultimately still isnt an argument for supporting Nintendo or writing off how seriously anticonsumer intentionally bricking peoples owned devices is,mrmnjxa,3.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr4wwzw,Cutebrute,,9,2025-05-07 21:13:01,,,,Pascal was not very different from proper Maxwell architecturally The general CUDA structurelayout was very similar to Maxwell The Pascal generation was a big generational uplift because of the manufacturing change to 16nm finfet process That was one of the greatest single node jumps in recent history which carried that generation in terms of power and efficiency Blackwell is on the same manufacturing process as Lovelace and the general architecture is pretty mature at this point so the improvements are minor and targeted to specific use cases Nvidia has to move from 4nm to 23nm manufacturing to get much more power at this point,mr44smx,4.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mrc95x1,rnw10va,,1,2025-05-09 00:26:01,,,,The Switch 1s hardware being old when the console released doesnt mean you can change what it is compared to If the Switch 2 used a 5 year old GPU we shouldnt compare it to 2020 GPUs The competitors to a product is what alternatives exist during its approximate life cycle The Switch came out in 2017 so you should compare it to 2017 GPUs The Switch 2 is releasing in 2025 so you compare it to 2025 GPUs Sorry if Im misunderstanding what youre saying To me it sounds as though youre giving Nintendo a pass on performance issues on the Switch 1 because they used old hardware inside of their new hardware launch,mr44smx,4.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr63dnf,sali_nyoro-n,,2,2025-05-08 01:10:37,,,,The Nintendo 64 was pretty advanced tech for when it was designed ca 1993 the problem is that actually getting the console out the door took longer than it had any right to Even so its in many ways entirely capable of matching the PSX mostly just being held back by 1 Cartridges being far smaller than CDROMs forcing sounds and textures to be compressed significantly compared to those on the PSX and making Final Fantasy VII style several hundred megabyte prerendered FMVs a nonstarter and 2 the ridiculous latency of the systems Rambus memory which requires programmers to take a very different approach to their work compared to other systems where moving data from one part of the system to another is generally quite fast between solidstate components,mr5xq0v,3.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr6ljqz,sali_nyoro-n,,1,2025-05-08 02:57:48,,,,Not in hardware terms no It got blown out in _sales_ but the actual hardware performance between the two is reasonably competitive with the Nintendo 64 having things like a Zbuffer so you dont get the characteristic warping of most PS1 and Saturn games and a much faster CPU but you also have memory latency from hell that forces you to write code to minimise readwrite operations between parts of the system even when in theory it would be more cycle efficient Overall if the PSX could do it you could probably get an N64 to do it with sufficient knowledge of how to code for the platform and vice versa storage medium limits notwithstanding Its not like comparing either system to something like the Dreamcast where its a clear and undeniable slaughter for the fifthgen hardware,mr6kl9g,5.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mu0qzog,None,,1,2025-05-24 15:15:45,,,,Thats a fair point but I would also say to consider docking The Switch 2 obviously comes with a dock and one that will boost performance Whereas the Steamdeck dock must be purchased separately 80 for 1st party and prices vary for 3rd party and the Steamdeck docks dont change the performance of the system,mtyyw1n,7.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr6qrwm,Bootychomper23,,1,2025-05-08 03:33:12,,,,The comment was saying that for the price point switch is a good deal the argument here is that actual games etc make that price point much higher then the alternatives of course they can not play switch 2 games which is why Im buying one but saying its price point is a selling point when Nintendo is one of the most expensive platforms to game on if you actually pay for your games Is funny to me,mr6ppmt,7.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr65p7y,sali_nyoro-n,,1,2025-05-08 01:23:54,,,,Sony did still have a year and a half functionally unopposed in the 5th generation Sega having blasted both of its legs off with a shotgun with barrels labelled 32X and early Saturn launch They also had far more permissive terms for publishing software than Nintendo who were still imposing various strict requirements on publishers at the time On top of this the PlayStation had an existing install base room to cut console prices if needed from cost savings and a pretty decent library of titles by the time the Nintendo 64 came out Nintendo probably wouldnt have run into the severe issues they did in getting third parties to support the console though which would help their performance in the west Though the managements prejudice towards 2D games would still lose them sales in Japan where ironically the Saturns design legacy making it a spritedrawer first and a polygondrawer second made it an ideal platform for things like scrolling shootemups 2D platformers and traditional fighting games In turn that wouldve stopped the GameCube from being a total bust since it wouldve given them a better chance of actually having games for the damn thing to launch with and allowed it to come out closer to the PS2 though theyd have to use fullsized DVDs to avoid losing half of their developers to Sony,mr5toxz,4.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr5f34b,r31ya,,6,2025-05-07 22:50:19,,,,i was thinking that NSwitch2 slightly less powerful than PS4 but Geekerwan standin benchmark noted that the GPU is slightly more power than PS4 in Handheld and nearly twice more powerful in docked the CPU is easily 5x more powerful than olde Jaguar in PS4 not to mention the 1gbs speed of the Storage compared to PS5 50mbs it follow tradition of a new handheld that is slightly more powerful than last gen,mr3qmun,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr68c9f,sali_nyoro-n,,3,2025-05-08 01:38:06,,,,To be fair the Jaguar CPU in the PS4 and Xbox One was a complete dog even for the time Eight sluggish 16GHz in the PS4 175GHz in the Xbox One tablet processors provided by two quadcore modules sellotaped together and the total lack of performance is part of why games are so damn big now as audio had to be stored uncompressed to allow those pieces of shit to run games without choking on realtime decompression Five times that is still frankly not a lot,mr5f34b,3.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6ey3f,r31ya,,1,2025-05-08 02:16:29,,,,Nope While GPU is competitive with current onboard graphics at least on docked mode The CPU is lagging behind mobile latest Showing that it is 4 years old tech But that tester noted that the CPU is enough to run things like cyberpunk 20,mr68c9f,4.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6gqux,sali_nyoro-n,,3,2025-05-08 02:27:26,,,,The _GPU_ is fine yes Its somewhere in the region of a GTX 1050 Ti but with the benefit of newer technologies like DLSS that enable it to get a lot more in the way of functional results than its raw performance would otherwise suggest Wouldve been more impressive in 2023 seeing as its running on a 2020 architecture Ampere The CPU being a relative weak point isnt surprising given that most games are primarily GPU driven Luckily Cyberpunk 2077 was designed to work even on the decrepit and CPUlimited PS4 and CDPR were able to make The Witcher 3 run on the Switch so I can believe it has the capacity to run the improved Version 20 with some systemspecific optimisation work It should be good enough for the next few years in any case,mr6ey3f,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6jj6b,r31ya,,2,2025-05-08 02:44:50,,,,Yeah one particular issue is that current gen game is freakin happy with ps5xboxseries cpu upgrade and have raised the minimum required cpu for newer game And now well see whether switch 1ghz 8 thread cpu could keep up or not,mr6gqux,6.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr59lfh,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,1,2025-05-07 22:19:16,,,,For folks that like to tinker like the Digital Foundry folks and a rather large proportion of PC enthusiasts the gameplay is secondary to the fascinating aspects of new technology being demonstrated A game a merely a medium for them In fact many of them find tech demos to be just as entertaining as games themselves Then again I think its because theyre more interested in codingengineering than they are in just having fun Seeing the technology work is their version of fun Like I recall a lot of focus by PC gamers on that UE5 The Matrix Awakens tech demo that ran only on PS5 and Series X consoles for a long while These are the same folks that actually really enjoy their day jobs as software engineers or computer engineers lol,mr47ug0,5.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr78knk,xondk,,1,2025-05-08 05:58:23,,,,Oh it definitely is a point for sales of games using the latest tech and such and I get that being a tech guy myself it is great to see But it just doesnt translate to the game being good and often the focus on tech and graphics at least in my mind is at the detriment to gameplay and story Course if it causes more sales even if there is low retention as in people dont play the game for long or dont complete it it still means they got a sale so I get it,mr59lfh,6.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr51fb2,Madnoir,,0,2025-05-07 21:35:45,,,,Youre misinterpreting what Im trying to say What do either Xbox or Sony do that should get me to buy their consoles If games play identically on the consoles andor PC then I dont need more than one of them Like I said Sony does get timed exclusives but they eventually get to PC so I could just wait Xbox games are just immediately on PC On the other hand Nintendo has countless titles and series that wont get ported Going further with the uniqueness of the switch for example having a touchscreen and of course the Joy Cons theyre able to create experiences that cant be matched on the other platforms Unfortunately console exclusivity and unique experience kind of go hand in hand That being said I do think to the push to multiplatform is bad for the industry and arguably a large part of why AAA are so stagnant Theres no reason to innovate the games Instead Sony and Microsoft are in a technical arms race to make slightly better hardware than the other that marginally improves graphics over the other,mr4nw0s,6.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr4vhwu,m0rogfar,,7,2025-05-07 21:06:09,,,,The chips should be largely in the same ballpark The most noticeable difference is probably going to be that the power of the Z1EZ2E can be adjusted up or down by the handheld manufacturer depending on the battery and cooling so it can run better in thicker and heavier systems Nintendo seems to have gone for a thinner and lighter profile which means that itll probably fall slightly short in handheld use but has gone with the fairly novel idea that the new dock is designed to actively cool the Switch 2 so that it will likely take the lead when docked to an external display,mr4guwg,3.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr56vah,master2873,,3,2025-05-07 22:04:15,,,,Most of the Switch 1 issues stemmed from memory bandwidth issues which the Switch 2 is remedying Also Game Freak honestly shouldnt be used as a form of judgement for hardware capability not exactly saying youve said this Theres a lot of first party titles that look and run pretty great within reason TotK is nothing short of a miracle it looks and runs as well as it does in comparison to BotW I would agree though it definitely needed a bit of a refresh especially in the last few years but with everything going on now with tarrifs and etc it seems like bad timing but nothing any of these companies are able to do about it really,mr4uzt3,2.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr5q08x,DOndus,,1,2025-05-07 23:52:01,,,,Yeah but its not 1 to 1 It has the benefits of modern chipsets despite running around that same power in handheld In docked its gonna push a lot more Its got more ram and faster storage So despite being similar to ps4 a game like Cyberpunk for example can actually be playable with the expansions that ps4 couldnt FF7 remake is a downscaled port of the ps5 verison And in the case of street fighter 6 it actually looks better than the Series S version thanks to DLSS But overall I think it would have been slightly more impressive had it released a year or 2 earlier like it was allegedly supposed to,mr3okus,1.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr6edqm,sali_nyoro-n,,0,2025-05-08 02:13:05,,,,This wouldve been a pretty decent console if it released this time in 2023 but its definitely behind the curve this late Ampere is five year old technology already and the GPU isnt even RTX 3050 Mobile level GTX 1050 Ti performance docked puts it somewhere between the original PS4 and the PS4 Pro _GTX 750 Ti_ performance in handheld sounds like it might be worse than even the Steam Deck which ouch Again wouldve been fine in 2023 but launching at the price it is in 2025 thats not great Feels like the hardwares best years are already behind it which lends credence to those delay rumours,,0.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr6iqpj,geminijono,,7,2025-05-08 02:39:46,,,,This is the essence of Gunpei Yokois philosophy of Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology He created the Gameboy with old tech and it sold like hotcakes unlike Xboxes that sell at a loss historically Same principle applies here If Switch 2 can give a steady 3060fps with intense games or have performance and graphical modes this is fantastic for them even with tariffs baked into the pricing,mr6edqm,1.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr4bgv8,mschuster91,,12,2025-05-07 19:30:56,,,,They need to make a docexternal GPU That involves USB4 aka Thunderbolt PCI Express over USBC if you want Works but the chips and cables required to pull that off are expensive And so is signal routing At the point you want to resort to this you might just want to buy a PS5 What I wouldnt oppose is a revival of the Gamecube Basically the same support for games and controllers the Switch has just with way more GPU horsepower and more storage The only thing that such a thing cant play is anything using the touchscreen,mr3vumi,1.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr557l8,jayzz911,,1,2025-05-07 21:55:24,,,,This just isnt gonna happen not because i dont think it should i would preorder an 800 euro gamecube tomorrow but because every time nintendo tries to compete on the power of consoles they straight up lose The snes is the last time this wasnt true The n64 cpu clocked 3 times the speed of the ps1 had double to quadruple the ram but got out innovated on the disc v cartride Gamecube time comes around again a more powerfull console but loses due to being out innovated again with the dvd and dvd player functionality of the ps2 They took the lesson learned here and made the Wii a less powerfull console the cell processor on the ps3 stomped it pretty severely and won the generation because they out inovated the competiton Wiiu is a nightmare on all fronts switch comes out this thing has 3 gigs of ram and is about as powerful as a mobile phone from a few years prior Still wins its generation Now i doubt the switch 2 is going to do anywhere near as well for some reason they thought the eyetoy was gonna be a defining feature like not even kinect which was impressive but the fucking eyetoy But the lesson for Nintendo seems pretty solidfied as doing our own thing is a better way to go this all is of course heavily speculated by me as I am not the famous John Nintendo owner of Nintendo,mr4bgv8,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4es3j,TheBoBiZzLe,,-1,2025-05-07 19:47:06,,,,Whelp Time to for Nintendo to invent a new connection type Lol imagine the chips that connect the joycons had that type of connection So when you plug your device into the dock you have to take off the joycons and put two connections on Ultimate jacking in Feel,mr4bgv8,2.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr41r0r,hardy_83,,-2,2025-05-07 18:43:52,,,,Not a bad idea I mean 5060 is a bit much but if this device is the equivalent to a 1050ti then a docked GPU equivalent to say a mobile 4060 4050 or something If it was a 5060ti Nintendo would probably charge over 1k lol,mr3vumi,1.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mr4euze,ChucklesInDarwinism,,1,2025-05-07 19:47:30,,,,Its equivalent to 1050ti if docked if not its around 750ti as per the article Even a 3070 docked would be huge,mr41r0r,2.0,1kh2fi9

comment,mr9d2h9,hidazfx,,0,2025-05-08 15:27:27,,,,Im really not sure why people are complaining here about graphics and I dont expect it to keep up The Switch 1 still runs quite a few of the best titles on that platform which look great for how small it is And its from 2017 and definitely started development earlier than that Nintendo clearly isnt prioritizing top level fidelity and raw horsepower anymore Theyre prioritizing an experience something only they can offer I personally still think games like Mario Kart BotW and Portal 2 look great to this day Yeah theyre no Cyberpunk but they dont look terrible at all,,0.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mrasw8k,albastine,,1,2025-05-08 19:39:20,,,,The specs of the switch 2 are cool for now but what happens when the next gen comes out People are pretending Switch 2 is a current gen console It is not Its an early Next Gen console Nintendo sat on the Switch 2 for YEARS just so the CSuite could chase the Most consoles Sold trophy Sucks for anyone that bought a switch within the last few months or got one for Christmas and were not in the know Now the real problem happens when next gen comes out one or two years from now and the consoles can actually handle a mature UE5 game using RDNA45 Meanwhile Nintendo will be on 3 generations old tech that can barely run the raytracing demands of a future title with its 12 RT Cores Lets put it this way When Nintendo cheaps out on hardware you get 1st party titles that look like Pokemon Nintendo use to be known for their highly optimized high performance titles Now everyone just settles for playable from them Dropped frames be damned The real question is will the Switch 2 be viable when it hits near end of life around 2031 2033 if Nintendo keeps the 8 year cadence instead of the six year console release They had an excuse when they released the switch because the Wii U bombed so hard they were turtling up and being cautious Why are they being cheap now after the meteoric success of the switch They are shooting themselves in the foot for no reason outside of fans will buy it regardless Edit Nintendo hasnt prioritized graphics since the GameCube Also forgot to mention Nintendo cheapest out on RAM with the switch 2 only having 12GB of shared RAM which will age very poorly,mr9d2h9,1.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mraxc4z,hidazfx,,1,2025-05-08 20:01:07,,,,Developers will continue to optimize their games for the Switch 2 just as they have managed with the Switch 1 whether or not they were initially optimized on release is up for debate though I really dont see any switch games utilizing any sort of ray tracing at all or at least not the full fat thing How many gamers actually only game with RTX or equivalent on in every game I cant imagine its many I never did when I had my 3080 and I still dont with my 6950XT Yes the switch 2 will be less powerful than an Xbox or PS5 but thats fine Its not a speed machine Nintendo will use it to sell Mario Zelda and Pokemon just as they always have,mrasw8k,2.0,1kh2fi9
comment,mrb6o9r,albastine,,1,2025-05-08 20:46:55,,,,You are missing the point You keep on comparing the switch 2 to PS5Xbox Series It will be far less powerful than the ps6next Xbox Games are now starting to make RT mandatory You can only optimize so much The Storage being severely slower lack of AI the RAM being 12GB instead of 16GB minimum Ampere instead of least Lovelace the overall mediocre specs for 2025 it all leads to poor optimization down the line You think the 3050 level of power will last even with God tier optimization till 2031 Then again whats the point of arguing with it doesnt matter people will buy it in a debate on whether the Switch 2s specs will age well People will deal with Pokemon level of optimization,mraxc4z,3.0,1kh2fi9
