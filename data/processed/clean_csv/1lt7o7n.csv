comment,n1qwk2h,alidan,,5,2025-07-07 03:13:59,,,,thinkpads and their nipple its a defining characteristic of the laptop personally what I would love is for the back of the monitor and the plasticmetal on the keyboard side to be removable so they can easily be painted I personally loved the old falcon northwest pcs that had custom airbrush work on them and it may just be me but there is a massive difference between vinyl sticker feeling and automotive clear coat hell you could make the laptop thicker and put an actual mechanical keyboard into it even low profile switches are better than the shit most laptops get and that extra girth could accommodate a better battery or better cooling,n1os4yq,1.0,1lt7o7n

comment,n2wec0p,CatProgrammer,,1,2025-07-13 14:05:11,,,,The 16 has some issues due to overambitiousness but the 13 is great Dont know about the 12 though The only real downsides are the cost and less options for CPUscreens but thats what you get from a small manufacturer focusing on a more modular system rather than allinone manufacturing with the pull to get all custom parts affordably,n2wdysu,3.0,1lt7o7n

comment,n1p75ru,ChoMar05,,5,2025-07-06 21:06:42,,,,Its too big for a convertible and it rather lacks an USBA port than a C I mean the CPort mostly is for the Dock But many peripherals still use A Some like Keychron deliver their Mouse and Keyboard with a CAdapter in addition to the A but the C is too long to leave it in comfortably when throwing it in a bag Sure you can also use Bluetooth but still on many windowslaptops one APort is constantly occupied,,0.0,1lt7o7n
