comment,mqjj2ya,AutistcCuttlefish,,38,2025-05-04 14:36:46,,,,Probably being optimistic and tech positive about has been proven to be pure naivety at this point Every positive way tech can be used will be gatekept and priced out of reach of the average person Every dystopian use will be pushed upon us by corporations and governments whether we like it or not Theres nothing to get excited about anymore Star Trek is nothing more than a pipedream Reality is much more reflective of a hodgepodge of every cyberpunk and dystopian novel people have read than anything even close to resembling a hopeful future,mqjghhi,2.0,1kekflt
comment,mqjpxng,annoyed__renter,,8,2025-05-04 15:12:51,,,,Science fiction is about exploring the pros and cons of human interactions with technology to pose interesting moral ethical and philosophical questions Given the exponential rate of advancement its inevitable that humanity will rapidly begin to achieve what was merely science fiction in past So we see increasing numbers of this looks like that horrifying concept from PKD or Black Mirror a lot,mqjghhi,2.0,1kekflt
comment,mqjorv0,gargravarr2112,,9,2025-05-04 15:06:47,,,,Because most of those fictional movies have sprung into reality Technology has not been used for the benefit of the common person its used to profile us and either sell us stuff we dont need or rank us on the likelihood of breaking some law Facial recognition is bad enough police are deploying that without oversight and just dragnetscanning public places The right to anonymity in public is being eroded if you walk down the street minding your own business and dont meet anybody you know you should be forgotten not have your exact movements logged in a database for years and brought up by a random warrantless search Because this is what actually happens Even my local store has implemented facial scanning on entry which makes me feel like a criminal every time I walk in there because theyre automatically suspecting me as a shoplifter Technology is not our saviour it has become our oppressor,mqjghhi,2.0,1kekflt
comment,mqm6dd8,lkn240,,0,2025-05-04 22:56:40,,,,The idea that technology has not be used to benefit the common person is completely fucking insane You must be very young I grew up before the Internet and smart phones and I can assure you that technology has brought countless benefits during my lifetime Its certainly true that there have been negatives also but its much much more nuanced than you imply,mqjorv0,3.0,1kekflt
comment,mr456yh,cubert73,,6,2025-05-07 19:00:20,,,,You must not have actually worked in technology My first software development job was in 1993 the same year the World Wide Web was launched The benefits you see are for two reasons only to fuel capitalism and to protect the people in power As such tech impacts have been incredibly uneven as the digital divide erupted into existence then expanded quickly Today the surveillance state has grown to such a degree that as the previous commenter said you are tracked almost everywhere and the footage is stored and can be processed years later As one example I just spent six months doing digital verification on a case for someone who has been wrongly jailed for two years so far I went through hours of footage and an exhaustive amount of work to prove the video did not show what the prosecution claimed it did A motion has been filed to submit this new evidence but there is no guarantee a judge will review it A man who is absolutely not guilty is sitting in jail for an unknown length of time because of the false belief that the camera doesnt lie ignoring the fact that people do The surveillance state is not in the publics best interest,mqm6dd8,4.0,1kekflt

comment,mqjolbu,UPVOTE_IF_POOPING,,2,2025-05-04 15:05:50,,,,It uses the blockchain and multiple like 10 corpos would need to be infiltrated at once in order to obtain the full set of information Dont get me wrong I aint doing the eyeball scan But it does seem to have some basic security behind it,mqjdquf,1.0,1kekflt
comment,mr8cl61,Sweet_Concept2211,,1,2025-05-08 12:09:48,,,,Their security sounds impressive until you realize it is a series of tall poles with no fence between them All I need is a decent resolution digital pic of your eyes with that I can create a colortexture map for a 3D model If I can get that verified with Altmans startup before you then your Altman ID is mine This hack could really fuck with some tech illiterate politicians executives and influencers,mqjolbu,2.0,1kekflt

comment,mqm4pyk,sucobe,,2,2025-05-04 22:46:58,,,,Specifically that biometric scan is encrypted and sent directly to your phone to be converted into that unique identity token after which the info is deleted on the Orb itself the project says As an incentive the World app is credited with Worldcoins worth a little over 16 in realworld money That token is then used later on when logging into things to prove you are a unique genuinely real human Emphasis mine Its not deleted Dont kid yourself Look at 23 and me I get the idea of what they are going for on paper but execution is Minority Report in disguise Despite all the scrutiny the startup claims to have 26 million people using its app around the world with 12 million people having added their biometric data Absolutely insane I wonder why During our store visit an assistant said the amount of traffic for the Orbs had been very high but we observed only a handful of people giving it a try in the 15 minutes in the shop One man a visitor to the RSA Conference happening just down the road said hed heard about it at the show and free money is free money We hope hes right Ah there it is,,0.0,1kekflt
