comment,m6esdv5,klorophane,,210,2025-01-10 14:57:59,,,,Wasnt this already widely known AFAIK they were pretty upfront in saying it was an inhouse model of the switch 2 not an actual switch 2,,0.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6ex6r6,blacksoxing,,62,2025-01-10 15:23:14,,,,Ill admit that I was never informed of that I think though I can easily pinpoint what has happened Leak happened Genki goes whoa this is unofficial You comprehend that Millions of blog posts come across my Google News the flood of social media posts which never imply this news I read this article and find out that this was unofficial and not provided by Nintendo I then read your comment and go how the hell you already know this And this is how information passes through on the net where its old news to you and others but new news to me and others,m6esdv5,1.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6h20z9,AuroraFinem,,9,2025-01-10 21:37:37,,,,Its rare that any early test devices are directly given by the manufacturers other than specific circumstances Nintendo likely provided spec sheets so that developers and 3rd party accessory providers can begin design around the performance and form factor Its not like they hand them an actual prototype those are usually made inhouse Most of this is speculation but the chances of anyone having an actual official prerelease version of the switch 2 outside a very select few instances is very slim This is pretty standard for devices in general unless theyre a brand new line of devices where theres no previous context to go off of Like the original switch probably had more prototype devices because it was a completely new device with new form factor and new internals everything The switch 2 is a modular update with better specs modified form factor but thats about it,m6ex6r6,2.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6uj744,ArtOfWarfare,,2,2025-01-13 01:24:55,,,,Im under the impression Nintendo is already well into mass production of the Switch 2 Theyve said on several occasions that millions of units will be available on launch day,m6h20z9,3.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6v57an,AuroraFinem,,1,2025-01-13 03:34:44,,,,True but the model was not from mass production and you could tell It wasnt even properly serialized iirc It was either early commercial copy for 3rd party creators or an inhouse one of those,m6uj744,4.0,1hy5zf0

comment,m6hnyed,TitleVisual6666,,5,2025-01-10 23:34:37,,,,Yep same For me it was their gradeA journalism on Bayonetta 2 there used to be several more but I swear theyve deleted them or I cant find them maybe it was the writers personal blogs or something Then of course they published the article claiming a Persona 5 song contains a slur and when corrected by the voice actors of Persona 5 they doubled down and did not correct the article before eventually apologizing Just sloppy baiting journalism all around,m6hbnw2,4.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6u8frg,NeverComments,,2,2025-01-13 00:26:35,,,,Kotaku started under Gawker Media so they were a clickbait rag from the offset The couple years where they managed to appear credible was an anomaly in their overall history,m6hnyed,5.0,1hy5zf0

comment,m6hhjmv,Gram64,,2,2025-01-10 22:58:43,,,,Fun fact Nintendo has completely blacklisted kotaku because they wrote an article about Metroid Dread getting leaked early on emulators and the original article was very pro leaking and emulating their games,m6ffzrs,2.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6g6jq5,Top5hottest,,6,2025-01-10 19:03:02,,,,We are pretty much done with the switch At least 10 different controller breaks at 70 bucks a pop That is just extortion Shame on Nintendo,,0.0,1hy5zf0

comment,m6thxwa,Jonny511,,1,2025-01-12 22:07:25,,,,I ended up buying 3rd party joysticks that use magnets instead of mechanical connections That solves the problem of any future drift problems It cost about 20 and took maybe 20 minutes to swap them in,m6g6jq5,1.0,1hy5zf0

comment,m6jbjax,Jeremy64vg,,3,2025-01-11 05:47:41,,,,I mean yea it sold well cause of its capabilities at the time it still outsold Switch and so did the DS I am not saying the switch wasnt wildly successful Crazy to get downvoted for saying a verifiable fact lol,m6fau8l,4.0,1hy5zf0
comment,m6kzmcm,byOlaf,,2,2025-01-11 14:56:02,,,,Yeah ignore the downvotes You are correct the switch wont outsell the ps2 for another year or so in absolute units But there were a lot of ps2s that were sold mainly or exclusively as a dvd player since it was the cheapest dvd player at the time So in terms of gamers the switch is ahead In reality the iPhone is the biggest selling gaming device of all time no contest,m6jbjax,5.0,1hy5zf0
