comment,mpn7irf,WraithCadmus,,37,2025-04-29 11:54:49,,,,I always feel a bit bad for the ST it wasnt a bad machine by any stretch but it felt like the A500 immediately ate its lunch I know it had some success in music production even into the era of dubstep because of the MIDI ports but that was niche People will also be looking at this as some sort of scam because of the monstrous extra hardware but hey thats how the SNES did it and noone gives that grief,,0.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpndgds,flcinusa,,16,2025-04-29 12:34:00,,,,This video of Norman Cooks home setup where he produced Youve Come A Long Way Baby using CLab Creator on an Atari ST that was already pretty old by 1998 standards is mindblowing,mpn7irf,1.0,1kalyeg

comment,mpqs1ks,speculatrix,,4,2025-04-29 22:46:44,,,,The Motorola 68060 processor was the last of its line It was a thing of beauty Apple switched to PowerPC chips then x86 and are now on Arm A strange path and one which involved CPU emulation but they could afford to invest in that Commodore failed to evolve and also dropped the ball in failing to create new versions of the custom chip sets Once PCs could support dedicated GPUs and sound cards the Amiga line was too far behind to catch up As an owner of an A500 and A3000 and having written GUI programs for it I feel sad because its become a bit of a footnote in history I also had multiple generation of palm pilot units and those too are lost in history And I had a few of the Nokia internet tablets And Sharp Zauruses Sigh,mpoxsgi,3.0,1kalyeg

comment,mpta9oe,WraithCadmus,,1,2025-04-30 09:46:51,,,,Ive been trying to understand the timeline one whatif thats rolling around in my head is what if the AAA had released with all features in 1991 I mean Commodore would probably have still messed it up but I wonder if this Early 1200 would have stood up better,mpqs1ks,4.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpyp5pd,BigLan2,,1,2025-05-01 03:55:08,,,,I think they might be a UScentric view In the UK the Amiga was the most popular home computerconsole until the SNES launched the Mega driveGenesis was fairly popular too Lemmings Sensible Soccer Kick Off were huge in the early 90s Said as a kid who had an Atari ST The Amiga could be argued to have paved the way for the Archimedes the sequel to the BBC Model B which led to ARM chips and their dominance today,mpqs1ks,4.0,1kalyeg
comment,mq00u30,speculatrix,,1,2025-05-01 11:21:29,,,,when I was university too many years ago to think about a couple of friends bought A500s and I quickly realised I just had to buy one for myself Got the RAM pack and second floppy drive immediately and then later bought a hard drive a whopping 30MB I recall being stunned by it compared to the eight bit machines with monochrome characterconsole displays I previously had I made an ADC and a midi interface and was pretty smug about it compared to the Atari owners,mpyp5pd,5.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpsc0ed,AkirIkasu,,2,2025-04-30 04:18:45,,,,Its weird that that that feature was all it took to get musicians on board with it MIDI was basically just serial and in many cases computer MIDI interfaces were just passive adaptors that attached to the computers serial port and werent terribly expensive because of that,mpn7irf,1.0,1kalyeg

comment,mpn9n5e,Oiggamed,,13,2025-04-29 12:09:24,,,,I had this Bought it with money I saved up working my after school job I bought it mostly for the MIDI interface MIDI was brand new and this was the only computer that had it built right in I may even still have it in my parents basement,,0.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpnghps,ledow,,2,2025-04-29 12:52:36,,,,The ZX Spectrum 128 2 3 had MIDI ports around the same time and you could get MIDI addons for the 48K It even features in a famous music video and was used for productions but Ill be damned if I can remember which one But certain things fill certain niches better than others even if theyre not the first or the best for that Its why I still constantly hear that people have to have Apple computers for photoshop or video editing Because at one point people believed that that machine fitted that niche better but theres no reason for that to be true any more or personally I would say ever,mpn9n5e,1.0,1kalyeg

comment,mpqxxfy,None,,1,2025-04-29 23:19:07,,,,BOOOOOOOO I literally said to myself I know its not a pc but I dont care so well done The best part about this system was when my Dad was upgrading it with some 3rd party hardware but it didnt fit properly so he just sawed a few mm off and it worked Midnight Resistances was the best game ever I think there was also a game about a clown and a red ballon And the Simpsons Fuck what a cool system,mpqk3hr,2.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpsqdj8,Fyfaenerremulig,,2,2025-04-30 06:19:25,,,,A buddy of mine had an ST and i was amazed at the resolution of the screen I dont recall quite what the resolution was but it was very sharp His dad used it to produce music so they had lots of audio equipment connected to it Hell yeah it was a cool system I remember he used to rave on about the Atari Falcon which apparently was even cooler,mpqxxfy,3.0,1kalyeg
comment,mqhza2b,TenMinJoe,,1,2025-05-04 06:58:11,,,,You could plug it into a monitor rather than just a television If you bought a monochrome monitor it could drive it at 640x400 which did look amazingly sharp by contemporary standards,mpsqdj8,4.0,1kalyeg

comment,mpoxk96,cobaltjacket,,1,2025-04-29 17:20:16,,,,Doom was developed on NeXTs with 25MHz 68030s Its not that much of a stretch that some optimization would get it to run on 8MHz 68000s especially since the Atari ST has some level of hardware coprocessors,,0.0,1kalyeg
comment,mpsddj3,AkirIkasu,,1,2025-04-30 04:28:54,,,,It really is very much a stretch Not only are we talking 13rd the clock speed the 030 offered between 60100 faster performance at the same clock speed And on top of that the NeXT computer had an additional FPU and DSP This was a real accomplishment,mpoxk96,1.0,1kalyeg
comment,mqhrpwm,_WhatchaDoin_,,2,2025-05-04 05:45:43,,,,Plus the pixel format was shit on the ST 16 bits for bit 0 of 16 pixels Then 16 bits for bit 1 of the same 16 pixels Same for bit 2 and 3 Then back to bit 0 of the next 16 pixels Etc Just writing the proper pixels on the screen was very inefficient,mpsddj3,2.0,1kalyeg
