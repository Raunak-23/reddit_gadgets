comment,mhzanyb,afcagroo,,1,2025-03-15 20:42:33,,,,It was a controller for Spotify You connected your phone to it via Bluetooth and the Car Thing would connect to your cars infotainment system also via Bluetooth The screen buttons and large scroll wheel made it much easier to control Spotify while in the car rather than messing around on your phones interface I have one and it was rather handy Before they bailed on it and turned it into a brick,mhpx659,2.0,1ja0q9a

comment,mhzcr4e,afcagroo,,1,2025-03-15 20:53:41,,,,Thats not completely true They have some of the best sounding WiFi speaker solutions available and at one time they were easy to use and fairly reliable BUTThey are overpriced The technology is largely proprietary And they did totally fuck over a significant fraction of their customer base in a pretty impressive manner It will eventually be a case study in business schools if it isnt already Just an amazing confluence of greed and incompetence They eventually admitted they fucked up then finally got rid of the shit CEO and CTO too IIRC The new CEO appears to be trying to right the ship It remains to be seen how well he will do Killing this product is a good sign I would love to find a WiFi sound system thats as good as Sonos used to be Or maybe an open source software solution that would allow me to continue to use the Sonos hardware Ive invested in but not be fucked over by horrible software Or for Sonos to get their shit together,mhibni0,1.0,1ja0q9a
comment,mhjkwzx,stoneyriver,,4,2025-03-13 10:42:22,,,,my wiim ultra and Fosi audio amps and dac alongside my vintage KEF speakers blows the absolute hell out of any of the Sonos gear in terms of sound quality clarity detail all aspects And I paid less than the cost of one or two Sonos speakers I also have full streaming and wifi and Bluetooth and analog connections too and it works continuously from room to room as I move around Sonos got greedy the shafted their customer base and were too expensive for what they were,,0.0,1ja0q9a

comment,mhzefv8,afcagroo,,1,2025-03-15 21:02:46,,,,Not historically But last spring they rolled out new and improved software that is required to control the speakers This software was needed to integrate their new uncompetitive Bluetooth headphones into their ecosystem The problem is that it was totally halfbaked Not only did it not actually run the Sonos speakers for a large fraction of the customers it also cut out features that were previously present As far as I know theyd never removed significant features before They have since fired the CEO worked on fixing the app and putting back the old features and shitcanned yet another new product that was unlikely to be competitive It remains to be seen if they will completely turn things around They do seem to recognize that theyve managed to alienate many of their users who previously were mostly pretty happy with the products and in many cases avid proponents,mhmz678,1.0,1ja0q9a

comment,mhzffz5,afcagroo,,1,2025-03-15 21:08:13,,,,Lack of competition There really arent many places you can find good quality WiFi speaker systems that are easy to setup and use and are reliable Its a product niche that is ripe for someone to do well and dominate the market Im kind of amazed that Apple hasnt stepped up and stolen this product category,mhotixt,1.0,1ja0q9a
comment,mpym2w2,darksparda4,,1,2025-05-01 03:33:17,,,,I think the streaming box was a bad idea but some of the alleged functions like the wireless soundbar connectionhdmi switch would be useful as a separate device especially for those TVs with only 2 hdmi 21 ports and multiple hdmi 21 devices,,0.0,1ja0q9a
comment,mhi4vyk,adilly,,1,2025-03-13 02:53:10,,,,It would be nice if they removed app functionality from the cloud and made it run locally again,,0.0,1ja0q9a
comment,mhy859k,Blunttack,,0,2025-03-15 17:21:34,,,,I think the whole problem with Sonos is they try to do their own streaming and voice recognition Just let Alexa run the whole thing all the time Act like a Bluetooth speaker Not like this sort of different entity I have to bypass to allow Amazon Music to play via Alexa or the laughably bad Sonos app I think the speakers sound decent and like that I can take the Move to different parts of the house or away Mini sub is pretty great in a larger ish kitchen If everything worked all the time I couldnt be happier Its doesnt And I attribute that to the constant app issues and ridiculous first party streaming and voice control efforts,,0.0,1ja0q9a
