comment,m1igy55,Brandunaware,,255,2024-12-11 12:09:42,,,,Love this era where you buy electronics and then they stop working arbitrarily when the company decides they should LOVE IT Who wants to own things when you can instead pay ownership prices to rent them for an undefined period Yes you can repurpose the device if you know how but what percentage of owners actually know enough and are willing to put in the not huge effort to do that,,0.0,1hbrw6k

comment,m1jnkox,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,12,2024-12-11 16:35:53,,,,I mean functionally when you buy a single purpose device that links to an online service thats what is going to happen eventually The Car Thing is really more notable for how short lived it was,m1igy55,1.0,1hbrw6k
comment,m1jox99,Brandunaware,,4,2024-12-11 16:42:52,,,,Except that companies do have the option of officially supporting opening it up and letting it run on third party services or officially supporting continued fan development When Google discontinued Stadia it provided official support for using Stadia controllers with other platforms They just extended the amount of time to activate that feature Official support for that kind of switch over is possible just a lot of the time companies prefer to brick the devices,m1jnkox,2.0,1hbrw6k
comment,m1k8uq1,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2024-12-11 18:23:37,,,,They can but they have no incentive to do it Its nice when companies do it but youd be foolish if you expect them to,m1jox99,3.0,1hbrw6k
comment,m1nb0l1,ungoogleable,,1,2024-12-12 04:48:22,,,,Its very common that devices like this are built using software from third party companies that the device company doesnt have the rights to release The software is still being sold for other devices so the third party companies are not going to approve giving it away for free It may not even be practical to separate out just the code they own if its deeply intermixed What they could publish may not be functional by itself Reimplementing the dependencies might be a bigger effort than developing the product in the first place All for something no one is paying them for anymore,m1jox99,3.0,1hbrw6k

comment,m1qp8og,drfsupercenter,,1,2024-12-12 19:40:21,,,,While I normally agree with this sentiment what did people expect a Spotifyonlydevice that does nothing else besides play Spotify to do once it can no longer play Spotify Its not like your refrigerator maker killing your refrigerator because they went out of business This car thing literally did nothing but play Spotify I dont understand why anyone even bought one to begin with considering you still needed a phone If it had a cell modem in it with its own data connection that might have been something,m1igy55,1.0,1hbrw6k

comment,m1jkgjj,Usernametaken1121,,-5,2024-12-11 16:19:34,,,,Are you salty you bought a product that was destined to fail because people either have Bluetooth on their phone that automatically connects when the vehicle turns on or are too poor to afford a BT equipped vehicle and use an aux cord instead,m1igy55,1.0,1hbrw6k
comment,m1k9061,ModsRTryhards,,5,2024-12-11 18:24:21,,,,Not sure why it matters if its a stupid device Buying it should allow you to use it Failing to sell in the past and tanking meant you had the device but they just werent making new ones We are in a different age And I think the point is this can happen with lots of modern tech Even if its useful Google loves killing their projects etc,m1jkgjj,2.0,1hbrw6k

comment,m1kn7xc,tacoheadbob,,3,2024-12-11 19:33:56,,,,Look at Mr Moneybags here buying a new car when new Bluetooth standards are released This little device made older vehicles somewhat more enjoyable for music options along with trying to keep the phone out of our hands while we drive I get it though this was probably a dead end gadget upon delivery I liked mine while it was working and now I will have to spend my kids college funds on a new car so you feel better about your comment,m1jkgjj,2.0,1hbrw6k
