comment,mfznwqp,None,,1,2025-03-04 17:07:53,,,,Name a single time you can recall from your memory where a tariff was lifted and prices stayed the same or went up You simply conflate general inflation with your concept of tariffs What you likely meant is that tariffs dont bring down prices if the industry has to relocate to the import country to avoid the tariff This specific action does indeed cause prices to stay up because it simply now costs more to produce in the import country,mfzmmxc,4.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg2reds,i8noodles,,3,2025-03-05 02:13:56,,,,basically all economists agreed tariffs are a terrible choice there are better options to promote goods productions in a country subsidies are the most obvious ones which is what alot of agricultural goods get investment into an industry to make it more efficient and cheaper even if tariffs are implemented a blanket ban is highly inefficient it just raises the prices of goods with no substitute the reality is when businesses can increase prices they do tariff would increase imports but it will also more then likely increase goods locally the steel in washing machines is increasing from tariffs so it makes sense the end product also goes up tariffs need to be highly specific and target end products not blanket tariffs and raw goods because that spirals out into all end goods too,mfz73rl,5.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg0gp4b,BrewtusMaximus1,,2,2025-03-04 19:21:05,,,,As I stated in another post I was an engineer working for a large US manufacturer when the 2018 China tariffs took effect While most of the result was sourcing to other low cost countries like India some of the result was still sourcing from China but by way of Canada Because of how ineptly the tariffs were targeted if any value add work like say painting was done after a part had left China but before it entered the US the tariff didnt apply This meant that we would work with a Canadian supplier who would source 95 of the value added work in China so the remaining 5 in Canada and call it good,mg0bro0,6.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg1v5dk,LordBiscuits,,2,2025-03-04 23:19:16,,,,Its similar to the light truck tariff you guys have Its meant to encourage manufacturers to build them locally but what actually happens is theyre imported with extra seats so they class as a minivan or something and the seats are removed before the thing is sold Pointless makework People WILL find a way around this shit,mg0gp4b,7.0,1j3c6go

comment,mfz2g45,enjoyinc,,34,2025-03-04 15:28:51,,,,What tariffs ended Biden kept most of the original Trump tariffs in place and added more This isnt a slight against Biden tariffs are notoriously difficult to undo once theyre implemented and often stay around for decades This is because entire industries adapt to changes caused by tariffs including opening new plants and facilities hiring new workforces etc and theres very little reason for the government to upset the economic responses to the original tariffs So they get left in place None of that is accounting for the downstream damage affiliated industries that are not the protected ones that is caused by them though and in 2025 the fallout will be extreme because all the above means that these tariffs will likely be around for a long time,mfyudwb,3.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg97841,enjoyinc,,1,2025-03-06 01:36:48,,,,Its really not All of those industries adapted to the tarrifs Trump had put in place and by that I mean invested millions if not billions of dollars into infrastructure and facilities to produce materials and goods for a domestic market The damage had already been done in terms of downstream industries and employment being decimated and the rest had already adapted Undoing the tariff policies all at once would have caused significantly more damage to those very same industries that had just a couple years prior spent enormous sums of money and resources to adapt and make the domestic market even more unreliable to put roots into This is of course not universally true when Biden removed Trumps washing machine tariffs prices dropped domestically because it was a dumb tariff and caused dryer prices which werent even affected to go up And business leaders in many industries did pressure Biden to remove the tariffs on China but the administration found that the tariffs having already been in place for so long would be too difficult to dismantle unilaterally So he dismantled them piece by piece like with aluminum and steel sanctions etc,mg91b9h,5.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg13vry,Doug-Glatt,,1,2025-03-04 21:08:04,,,,I want to preface this with the fact that I believe the tariffs being implemented today are absolutely ridiculous and have virtually no benefit to either country A complete loselose That being said as someone in manufacturing this isnt necessarily true The retailers consumers and manufacturers all know the tariffs are happening and what they will cost If a tariff is rescinded the retailers are going to ask for a price reduction They also want to actually sell through the product so its likely the price will come down as well This is a lot different than material costs going up because it is significantly less transparent in the end costing In some limited cases the price may remain high but if the retailer wants to remain competitive in their market they will reduce the price to meet their target margins when the tariff is removed,mfyspqy,1.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg2qwoi,Qweesdy,,1,2025-03-05 02:11:13,,,,When everything gets more expensive because of tariffs everyone complains and wants higher wages so manufacturers are going to increase their profit early to counter the eventual wage increases If you compare the posttariff price to the pretariff price you have absolutely no idea how much of the difference is tariffs how much is to cover future wage increase how much is extra profit The price can also remain exactly the same with the manufacturer making less profit because they dont want to lose business and think the tariffs will be temporary The pretariff price tells you nothing useful,mg09951,3.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg1txul,skaterfromtheville,,2,2025-03-04 23:12:58,,,,If Im now being charged 24 per dildo the 4 increase I can directly contribute to the tariffs Im confused what you mean or am I missing something The retailer is independent of the tariffs the manufacturer is incurring they will just pay a higher per item cost when buying from them That new price increase would directly be tariff induced unless maybe it was a yearly inflationary increase as well or something The manufacturer will likely have inventory costs per assembly item and will directly see as an aggregated total how much more they are paying per item The retailer would likely just see the increase in price and I guess it would be their respectable and understood prerogative to assume that entire difference is tariff based and to include that in the price breakdown,mfz7qdy,2.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg2opqo,Qweesdy,,1,2025-03-05 01:58:53,,,,If the retailer buys for 20 and sells for 24 then the 4 increase is the retailers markup and that has nothing to do with tariffs What Im saying is that to keep track of how much is tariffs youd have to literally keep track for every single piece through the entire production pipeline and when any tariff changes itll ripple through in blobs with different parts changing at different times so youll have some dildos with 2 of tariffs from Monday and some dildos with 25 of tariffs from Tuesday and some dildos with 3 of tariffs from Wednesday Then the retailer will have to change most of their systems to keep track too Eg when a box of 20 dildos arrives theyre going to have to sort it into 12 dildos with 2 of tariffs and 8 dildos with 3 of tariffs and enter the details into their inventory management system have separate bar codes for them separate them on the shelves Then someone is going to say Consumers should be told all the costs of doing all that tracking and itll be like Dildo 32 total 2 for various unspecified tariffs 6 for working out how much the tariffs were and everyone will complain about the 6 cost of living increase caused by useless idiotic petty bullshit while not having much reason to care about the tariffs,mg1txul,3.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg3k3rs,skaterfromtheville,,1,2025-03-05 05:05:55,,,,No I meant if the retailer is now vs the day before tariffs seeing a 4 increase in the cost of the item they are selling not their markup Their upfront cost Tariffs are not new no one is scratching their head doing the math on how to work it out we are just seeing a tariff equivalent price increase in the products we export from said tariff inflicted countries,mg2opqo,4.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg3rtm3,Qweesdy,,1,2025-03-05 06:04:25,,,,Yeah that cant work at all The first problem is that youll see price increases on products that dont have any tariffs at all The second problem is that theres little stockpiles everywhere for finished products for parts for new products etc and the tariffs are applied when things are imported so a manufacturer could keep selling not tariffed products from their warehouse for 2 weeks then sell 1 part was tariffed products for a few days then sell 2 parts were tariffed products for a few days then Of course the same manufacturer will probably just increase their price randomly charge what the market will bear ignore the actual costs 3 weeks after the tariffs began,mg3k3rs,5.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg4yorr,escapethewormhole,,1,2025-03-05 12:43:38,,,,The real answer is that your scenario assumes all the tariffs are paid at the end This isnt the case This is a bad example as it would just be tariffed by its point of origin likely Chinese so itd just be 20 flat on the whole thing while whoever imported the components would only pay a tariff if its made in a country thats tarrifing the originating country as well But lets take something made in the US like a F150 Lets say seats are made in Canada Electronics are made in china The plastic components from Mexico And the rest is made in the US Ford would pay the 25 on the seats on import Ford would pay the 20 on the electronics on import Ford would pay the 25 on the plastics on import Ford would pay the 25 on the aluminum and steel on import You would pay likely 30 more for the vehicle as theyre is an opportunity cost to having the tariff cash tied up while manufacturing is happening and administration attached to dealing with it Now Ford exports a lot of F150s so Mexico and Canada have applied tariffs to them too So Canadians or Mexicans assuming Mexico applies 25 tariff consumer prices go up 60 because now the whole vehicle gets tariffed again on import to canUS Now F150s are 115000 base price and Canada and Mexico consumers stop buying them So now fords demand drops in both the US Can and Mexico because theyre unaffordable so the factory scales back production and lays people off As a result they also start losing some of the economy of scale so the price of the vehicle rises even more Meanwhile Canadians and Mexicans just buy Toyotas now because theyre significantly cheaper compared to something made in the US,mfz7qdy,2.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg58hh3,Qweesdy,,1,2025-03-05 13:46:11,,,,Ford would pay the 25 on the seats on import Ford would pay the 20 on the electronics on import Ford would pay the 25 on the plastics on import Ford would pay the 25 on the aluminum and steel on import Right This is essentially the same as the tariffs paid on import scenario where foreign parts are used in a product thats assembled and sold locally that I already had except youve completely ignored the entire point of the discussion which was whether or not its easy to keep track of all the tariffs so that the retailer can display an accurate how much was tariffs on price tags and receipts as suggested by the comment I was replying to,mg4yorr,3.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg09yic,Mr_GigglesworthJr,,1,2025-03-04 18:49:52,,,,And what about the other 50 of consumer spending Do you think those consumers will absorb a 25 price increase on a large portion of goods with no impact to their total consumption Will the top 10 of earners increase consumption to offset declines for the other group Thats just the macro picture but many businesses have outsized exposure to middle and lower income households and will have to take that into when deciding how much cost to pass through to consumers,mfzrhcx,3.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg019t7,YouStupidAssholeFuck,,0,2025-03-04 18:09:30,,,,But the selloff isnt about business pricing power Not yet anyway Prices are going to go up because of what amounts to essentially a tax Purchasing power goes down when prices go up so naturally people are going to sell shares because there is going to be an instant if not temporary drop in purchasing as people buckle down The market selloff is because anyone with a brain knows the tariffs are going to hurt the economy so theyre getting out before their investments tank Otherwise they can keep their shares and the market stays relatively steady until the next quarterly earnings reports and then watch their shares tank But eventually people are going to start buying things again and theres going to be a balance companies figure out where they can raise prices and lose some consumers but still make massive profits off the difference Look at all these media streaming companies raising prices twice a year Yeah theyre pricing some people out but who is left is more than making up the difference There might not be a guarantee that prices increases will offset demand but theres no guarantee they wont Corporations will ensure increasing revenue and profits as well as they can though so if some people can no longer afford their products theyll make the difference up on the people that still can,mfz3srp,2.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg0ifg1,Mr_GigglesworthJr,,0,2025-03-04 19:28:59,,,,Thats because steel buyers will shift toward domestic manufacturers Further downstream use of steel is not entirely discretionary If youre a retailer of discretionary goods that same logic doesnt necessarily apply in your favor,mg0f2p4,5.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg0nt0b,YouStupidAssholeFuck,,0,2025-03-04 19:53:50,,,,What evidence is there that buyers have shifted to domestic manufacturers Seems to me domestic steel manufacturers are closing plants more than opening them Yet profits remained high in the short term following the initial tariffs of 2018 and we see now that those figures are on the downturn showing that tariffs hurt consumers in the short term and ultimately domestic manufacturers in the long run,mg0ifg1,6.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg0spu4,Mr_GigglesworthJr,,0,2025-03-04 20:16:37,,,,Buyers will shift toward domestic manufacturers to avoid tariff costs Also profits can still increase without businesses passing through the entirety of the tariff burden to the consumer Your assertion that tariffs hurt domestic manufacturers in the long run is questionable Substitution effects become more pronounced in the long run and would benefit domestic producers Some producers would have negative effects from lower total growth,mg0nt0b,7.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg1agai,Mr_GigglesworthJr,,1,2025-03-04 21:38:32,,,,Its simple logic and is the pretense for tariffs in the first place Domestic steel producers are not subject to tariffs and become more competitive with imported goods Domestics would gain business assuming the new tariff is enough to overcome their higher relative cost to produce The net result for the consumer is still negative because the post tariff price is still higher even with domestic substitution Like what data are you expecting Think it through,mg17yex,13.0,1j3c6go

comment,mg00bzq,Mushroom_Tip,,4,2025-03-04 18:05:09,,,,No it wouldnt They would just go through the Caribbean like they do with cocaine Why do you think they absolutely need a land border and it would be the next logical pathway,mfzzrac,3.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg00uiz,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 18:07:32,,,,A rural unguarded land border is the path of least resistance,mg00bzq,4.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg01b3i,Mushroom_Tip,,6,2025-03-04 18:09:40,,,,Youre thinking like its still 1995 These days they all have drones You dont even need to have a person smuggle it across Have a read,mg00uiz,5.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg02hnf,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 18:15:02,,,,We share the longest international border in the world with Canada Good luck with patrolling that with a thousand drones There is no reason that Canada cant be a partner in preventing Fentanyl smuggling,mg01b3i,6.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg02tq7,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 18:16:34,,,,BUT if you want to claim to have a better idea feel free to pass it along to the Feds Reddit doesnt need it as much as they do,mg01b3i,6.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg034zo,Mushroom_Tip,,3,2025-03-04 18:18:01,,,,What The feds are aware of it I linked you to an article about the Homeland Security secretary saying cartels are using drones Youre the one claiming they absolutely needs to go all the way to Canada,mg02tq7,7.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg06avr,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 18:33:02,,,,Im saying if you have a better idea of influencing Mexico and Canada nonviolently then feel free to offer your solution As is if all Fentanyl traffic is stopped coming through Mexico you appear to deny that it could ever come through Canada But since Im the one who keeps being downvoted it appears that many share your opinion that theres no problem here except that Trump is the President,mg034zo,8.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg06ond,Mushroom_Tip,,3,2025-03-04 18:34:43,,,,You really didnt need to go through this silly roundabout way and claim cartels need a land border to justify calling Canada out You could have just admitted you only put Canada there because orange man yells about Canada,mg06avr,9.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg0c9im,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 19:00:29,,,,I would except thats not the case I have no problem believing the President believes the Canadian border could be used for smuggling just as easily as the Mexican border And its in everyones best interest to cooperate in preventing it And as far as anyone knows he has the informationintelligence to back that up,mg06ond,10.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg0czee,Mushroom_Tip,,3,2025-03-04 19:03:50,,,,As far as the data goes Canada should be the one complaining that the US isnt doing enough to stop drugs flowing into Canada not the other way around I have no problem believing the President believes the Canadian border could be used for smuggling Okay so its not a problem now but lets pretend its a problem and ruin our relationship with our closest ally Yeah that makes sense,mg0c9im,11.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg16vjc,rangerm2,,1,2025-03-04 21:21:57,,,,Just as it makes sense to think nobody would try to take advantage of a 5500mile border,mg0czee,12.0,1j3c6go
comment,mg17nwu,Mushroom_Tip,,2,2025-03-04 21:25:37,,,,Has been fine for hundreds of years The second orange man screams about it its suddenly a problem Except not really a POTENTIAL problem because those drone flying cartel groups are going to journey up north and set up camp Lmao,mg16vjc,13.0,1j3c6go
comment,mfz5vrj,None,,3,2025-03-04 15:45:11,,,,Most illegal fentanyl is imported by Americans Trump just wants to put the hurt on Americans because he lost 2020,mfywjbz,1.0,1j3c6go

comment,mfz9csd,None,,3,2025-03-04 16:01:18,,,,Right with Americans on this end assisting them so Donalds attempt at painting it as strictly a foreign problem doesnt really work outside of MAGA But it does seem to provide an effective excuse for his followers while hes intentionally driving up cost of living and inflation,mfz6jru,3.0,1j3c6go
comment,mfzaq51,rangerm2,,-4,2025-03-04 16:07:39,,,,People will sell out their fellow Americans for money Thats very true But as Id said to another person who apparently thinks this an entirely Trumpimposed problem unless were prepared to violate the sovereignty of Canada or Mexico theres not much the US can do to prevent Fentanyl or the chemical precursors from reaching the shores of North or Central America The only force we can impose is financial ie tariffs,mfz9csd,4.0,1j3c6go
