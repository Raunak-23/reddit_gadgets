comment,ms0edz4,mqtgew,,217,2025-05-13 00:42:33,,,,These price hikes are just NVIDIA flexing while they still can They know theyve got the market cornered for now but Intel and AMD are catching up Classic move to milk the cash cow before competition catches up Either way were the ones paying for it,mrzde3a,1.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0nwra,postedupinthecold,,107,2025-05-13 01:38:42,,,,Gaming GPUs are now an incredibly small portion of NVIDIAs market share this segment is no longer the cash cow AI compute is,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms1qsau,ArseBurner,,24,2025-05-13 06:14:28,,,,Far as I can see Nvidia hardly cares about the gaming segment anyway Were getting the take it or leave it price treatment If nobody buys theyll just produce fewer 50 series GPUs and make more B200s,ms0jkkd,3.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms3cm46,joomla00,,0,2025-05-13 14:01:46,,,,Jensen doesnt seem like the type that wants to lose But they have a complete monopoly of the higher end and up And their products have headroom to be cranked further if AMD puts out something wicked thats actually a threat to their market share Combine that with enterprise cards that they cant sell fast enough they literally have no incentive to do better People complain like they always do and Nvidia will still have 80 of the gaming market,ms1qsau,4.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms27f1m,Curse3242,,1,2025-05-13 09:03:09,,,,Well with GPUs theres that issue where regardless of how good a new iteration is theres people with old hardware that waited planned for a certain time frame to upgrade their piece 5000 series will end up being the best option Same as phones No reason for the iPhone to keep costing samemore than previous year theyve been the same for a decade But people want to upgrade the hardware,ms0jkkd,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2oknk,meistermichi,,1,2025-05-13 11:35:49,,,,Well with GPUs theres that issue where regardless of how good a new iteration is theres people with old hardware that waited planned for a certain time frame to upgrade their piece 5000 series will end up being the best option Im still rocking a 2070 and was thinking about upgrading for a few years now but fuck no I aint paying what they call for the 50s For now its still adequate for my use case so Ill just stick with it instead of buying Probably gonna be an AMD once I really have to upgrade,ms27f1m,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2pvrl,Curse3242,,1,2025-05-13 11:45:16,,,,2070 is still recent IMO I have a 1060 And I am looking to upgrade to enjoy GTA6 So if 60 series RTX cards are out by the time GTA6 comes to PC regardless of how shit they are Id buy one Itd be 10 years since my last GPU Thats what Im saying They will always have customers that want an upgrade Take my own self again when it comes to phone I was pretty happy with my OnePlus7 until it broke I had no choice but to buy a new phone I wanted a cheaper option but the family urged me to just go for a better one now that Im older so I got the S25 Many would say its a pointless upgrade over S24 But it was the latest hence I got it,ms2oknk,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2rkd0,meistermichi,,1,2025-05-13 11:56:49,,,,2070 is still recent IMO 7 years its been so not that recent And I am looking to upgrade to enjoy GTA6 So if 60 series RTX cards are out by the time GTA6 comes to PC regardless of how shit they are Id buy one Itd be 10 years since my last GPU Thats what Im saying They will always have customers that want an upgrade Personal choice though you dont have to get the newesthighest tier of graphics card to enjoy GTA6 Unless the 60 series has the best value for money on the market at the time therell be other better options Thats like saying Ill upgrade to a Lamborghini to enjoy the new road when an Audi or whatever would do the trick as well That being said to each their own its your money do with it what you think is best for you Have a nice day mate,ms2pvrl,6.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2slyc,Curse3242,,1,2025-05-13 12:03:54,,,,Atleast its a RTX card XD Also a xx70 level which is quite good I wouldnt have to buy a 60 series I could buy a 50 series although usually the newest cards end up being the best deals because especially now Nvidia does the whole limiting features thing The fact is the same A lot of people with old cards that already felt the prices of early RTX cards were a joke Who now might give in anyways All we can hope for is a genuine competitor Nvidia is expensive but if it has all the features then its worth getting that because GPUs are a one time purchase But yeah its all personal opinion,ms2rkd0,7.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms32loz,Naxirian,,1,2025-05-13 13:06:20,,,,I havent bought an Nvidia since the GTX 600 series on principle Theyre a greedy company I bought an AMD 9070 XT this upgrade cycle and very happy with it for the price,ms0jkkd,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms43s8k,i81u812,,1,2025-05-13 16:15:44,,,,Nope each card comes in it lower power consumption in total draw And depending upon what card youre getting and where youre coming from is up to a huge potential Improvement finally the fourth generation was bullshit Improvement The cards are still preposterously overpriced now but we should be honest these cards are cutting edge Like you and other mentioned its not their business soon enough so they wont care It will be left to Intel and AMD soon enough,ms0jkkd,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0qr8b,Phantomebb,,28,2025-05-13 01:55:11,,,,They are catching up Even with the 50 series paper launch Nvidia is around 90 of the market and last time it was even close to 60 was Q4 of 2011 So maybe in a decade,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0wik5,Qulox,,18,2025-05-13 02:27:52,,,,Intel is in terrible shape now I wouldnt be surprised if they abandon the GPU market and AMD gave up in the highend segment The only real hope of competition is if China comes up with something decent but that may take decades,ms0qr8b,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1r2lb,ArseBurner,,4,2025-05-13 06:17:11,,,,Intel knows it cant just pull out of GPUs if they want any part of the AI accelerator market It was their lack of GPU expertise in the first place that prevented them from being ready with their own chip meanwhile AMD needed just one generation after the initial A100 launch to have an H100 competitor,ms0wik5,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0yjk5,Phantomebb,,13,2025-05-13 02:40:17,,,,We as gpu consumers have to face the facts Theres no real money in normal gpus anymore Data centers are the present and future Just look at Nvidias earnings and you will see why they are making crappies products for more money every generation If you dont know in Q4 nvidia revenue was 28 billion for gaming and 184 billion for data centers,ms0wik5,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1b236,jert3,,9,2025-05-13 04:04:58,,,,28 billion dollars is real money And if you are developing cutting edge gpus its not much of a big deal at all to make a video card for gaming version and a data center AI coprocessor card Its just a different configuration of the same technology,ms0yjk5,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1hs1q,Phantomebb,,7,2025-05-13 04:55:45,,,,Its really not when you factor in everything Driver support marketing packaging shipping dealing with 3rd parties card sellers etc Everything takes a chip out of revenue Its much easier to be Ferarri than Ford And Data centers are massive right now Everyone wants one two hell twenty if they could find the power You can sell directly to large construction companies you know are good for it We are talking hundreds if not thousands of H100 GPUs or equivalent per data center design dependant And those things are 30k a piece Thats real money and it comes with more demand than regular GPUs and higher profit margins by far Take a drive by Nvidias HQ You will see a bunch of data centers and construction companies nearby Theres over 70 in Santa Clara alone and over 150 in the bay area In fact there so many data centers SVPSilcon Valley power is out of power for years with no new major power consumption projects bring approved,ms1b236,6.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms6c6j3,Bloody_Sunday,,0,2025-05-13 22:54:41,,,,I hope you dont actually mean or think that Nvidia will ignore its yearslong leading position in GPU sales and its considerable associated revenue and prestige Or that it has any intention of giving it up to its competitors,ms0yjk5,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms6p0hu,Phantomebb,,1,2025-05-14 00:08:02,,,,What does this even mean They have a monopoly therir quality has dipped considerably and make less than 15 of there revenue from normal consumers gpus,ms6c6j3,6.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms7dk8l,Bloody_Sunday,,1,2025-05-14 02:33:34,,,,What it means is exactly what it says For a variety of reasons including these theres no way this market position and revenue can be considered to be either negligible or even worse one to simply give up,ms6p0hu,7.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms33dcd,Naxirian,,2,2025-05-13 13:10:51,,,,AMD pulled out of the high end this gen Its not the first time theyve done it 5700XT was mid range and the top AMD GPU of its generation they resumed high end in the 6000 and 7000 series It doesnt necessarily mean they wont do high end again especially when theres a big price gap between Nvidias high end 7900XTX competed just fine with the 4080 and the 5080 is a pretty bad deal for priceperformance Theres plenty of room there for AMD to do high end again next gen,ms0wik5,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2claz,Speedstick2,,1,2025-05-13 09:55:48,,,,There is no evidence that AMD has permanently given up on the high end market,ms0wik5,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,mse6lik,splerdu,,2,2025-05-15 04:01:08,,,,I think around end of 2004early 2005 ATI was actually ahead of Nvidia This would have been built on the incredible good will from the 9000 series of the time The 9800 Pro was beast,ms0qr8b,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1b7h6,colin_colout,,-6,2025-05-13 04:06:02,,,,And AMD Intel have bad driver and platform support for the money making high end mainly ML data science AI workloads AMD Intel are PowerPC and Nvidia is x86 They have market share and platforms support and that doesnt seem to have changed,ms0qr8b,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2cxk4,Speedstick2,,1,2025-05-13 09:59:03,,,,Have you seen Blackwell drivers,ms1b7h6,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0qvzl,No-Bother6856,,15,2025-05-13 01:55:58,,,,We are only the ones paying for it if we actually buy their product Buy the Intel and AMD product Having a few more frames in the latest game isnt something you actually need and supporting competition pays off in the long term,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms16olf,_mannen_,,-3,2025-05-13 03:33:42,,,,I did I bought the Intel A770 It was terrible Inference was a nightmare with very limited support in the open source field especially for their own branch of Ollama Linux drivers were poor no way of controlling power draw or fans that got stuck at 100 Had to return it and get a Nvidia card and everything just works out of the box Edit Thanks for the downvotes guys Its not my fault Intel lags behind and doesnt step up to make their stuff more compatible with Linux and LLM,ms0qvzl,3.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms2o4aa,_mannen_,,1,2025-05-13 11:32:30,,,,There was a good deal to be had on the RTX 3060 The RX 7600 XT was about 50 more expensive and has worse memory bandwidth The RX 7800 XT was more than double the price of the RTX 3060,ms2d1fd,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0q8jw,Neriya,,10,2025-05-13 01:52:10,,,,I just ordered myself a 9070 XT Itll be the first time I primaried an AMD GPU since a R9 290X Though other systems in my home have featured an RX470 RX480 5700XT and still has a 6600XT all of which have been excellent AMD has had a decent option at almost every point just not headlining and not always with a fully matching feature set But theres never been a game that my wife or kid wanted to play in my house that their AMD GPUs couldnt handle,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms10jj2,Omophorus,,5,2025-05-13 02:52:54,,,,Hell the 7900XTX is an absolute raster monster It does not go blow for blow on RT Dynamic Scaling DLSS FSR or GPGPU tasks but it absolutely hangs strong in any situation where rasterization is the main factor Some games like Cyberpunk 2077 look better on my old 3090 than my 7900XTX but most of the time games look every bit as good and just at a higher average FPS by some margin Very helpful for keeping 100 FPS with settings cranked up at 1440p,ms0q8jw,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2yft9,Edarneor,,1,2025-05-13 12:41:33,,,,Hey I had a 290X Played Witcher 3 on it and then some Got it used and it eventually died after several years still great value Between the prices and the ridiculous 8gb cards in 2025 screw nvidia,ms0q8jw,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms3haxa,Neriya,,2,2025-05-13 14:25:47,,,,Heck yeah The RX480RX580 cards were insane values for 1080p gaming both at release and immediately after the mining crash I picked up several of them for 60 each at a time where they landed somewhere between a GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 in terms of latelife performance but a GTX 1060 was selling for 100 and only had 6GB of RAM They made great little Fortnite cards The RX5700XT is sort of in that position now You can find them as cheap as 100120 and they have the nonRT performance of an RTX 2070 Basically if a PS5 can play it so can a RX5700XT with the exception of the newest titles that require RT capabilities looking at you Indiana Jones and Doom DA,ms2yft9,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms3xaly,Edarneor,,1,2025-05-13 15:44:08,,,,There are games that require RT now Instead of it being optional,ms3haxa,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms47s4m,Neriya,,1,2025-05-13 16:35:17,,,,A few yes Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and as of tomorrow Doom the Dark Ages Thankfully the RT load on these games is relatively light and they run fairly well on even lowerend RT capable hardware,ms3xaly,6.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms58fwl,Edarneor,,1,2025-05-13 19:31:14,,,,Yeah I was wondering since it should run on PS5 and it has an AMD gpu and not the newest at that Was it rdna 2,ms47s4m,7.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms59mdl,Neriya,,2,2025-05-13 19:37:08,,,,The PS5 and Xbox Series is AMD Zen2RDNA2 based It doesnt have an exact dedicated GPU equivalent but its somewhere in the rough ballpark of a 6600 or 6600XT The 5700XT is RDNA1 and is similar in raster performance to the 6600XT but lacks the RT capabilities For most games that dont require RT the 5700XT can play at PS5equivalent settings if youre comparing it to the PS5 performance mode in most games and especially so if youre targeting 1080p or an upscaled 1440p The 6600XT is similar and the RT is weak but its technically capable of handling the RT required games,ms58fwl,8.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1m8vw,Mehhish,,5,2025-05-13 05:33:27,,,,A Volcano could erupt in Washington State and NVIDIA would raise their prices and blame the eruption Honestly pretty much every company would probably do that lol,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2onva,Zedrackis,,2,2025-05-13 11:36:28,,,,Catching up is a matter of opinion AMD is putting specs where it matters to gamers at a lower price point Now a much lower price point If ray tracing or AI frame gen dont matter AMD is already a better card at a better price,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms4tdo1,BlackSecurity,,1,2025-05-13 18:18:32,,,,were the ones paying for it Wellno one is forcing youus Unless you have some job or work that requires the most top of the line GPUs theres no real need to pay 2000 for one,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,msfm53a,None,,1,2025-05-15 11:49:45,,,,As much as I want to believe for as long as Nvidia and AMD have been fighting people have been saying AMD is catching up But it always with value because thats the only way they can stay alive when you have to catch up For all we know nvidia has tech waiting on the shelves for when the gap gets too close,ms0edz4,2.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms13r5z,noJokers,,17,2025-05-13 03:13:46,,,,I dont really buy that at all AMDs offerings are competitive this year in fact for most people they are better value But people claim its not good enough and buy Nvidia anyway for some reason and then wonder why the next generation doesnt get any better Vote with your wallet,mrzvxwz,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1rxgb,TheBoBiZzLe,,1,2025-05-13 06:25:21,,,,Just feels that a smart move to follow up the Nvidia drama would be to undercut and flood the market with AMD The fear I have now is that so many new games look like garbage without their upscaling junk So if a game only supports one and not the other a game company would be pretty stupid to not support DLSS But if the market floods and shifts to AMD they could turn the market to start an upscale battle A competitive price isint going to switch people and developers over Theyd need to make a move But they wont Especially with the switch taking on Nvidia and focusing on dsll AMD had their window shrug,ms13r5z,3.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms27qki,noJokers,,3,2025-05-13 09:06:34,,,,AMD did undercut nvidia The 9070 and 9070xt are both cheaper than their rasterised performance nvidia counterparts Yes upscaling will indeed be important and fsr is included in 99 of games with dlss the only exception that I have seen is clairObscure Customers wont switch over night no matter how good AMD is it took ryzen 6 generations straight of dunking on intel to even get to market parity The switch 2 was always going to be nvidia because the switch 1 uses nvidia and they wanted compatibility Every other console excluding the msi claw uses an amd based APU including the ps5 xbox steamdeck legion etc AMDs window is the same as it was with ryzen and like ryzen it will take time for them to build market share UDNA is meant to be a continuation of these improvements and is likely AMDs ryzen 3000 moment,ms1rxgb,4.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms1y0u9,cgaWolf,,2,2025-05-13 07:25:10,,,,AMD dropped the ball this year to get its spot back in the market Damn Considering they have nothing to rival a 5080 even i think they played a bad hand of cards really well,mrzvxwz,2.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms05urh,JoostinOnline,,14,2025-05-12 23:53:35,,,,Honestly they have This is the first generation since Polaris the RX 400 and 500 series where I think AMD has a really strong product They finally have a decent hardware upscaler and their encoders arent shit anymore meaning Twitch streaming on one isnt embarrassing Theyve also ironically ended up with more stable drivers than Nvidia Its embarrassing that it took them this long to actually address the many issues they had and I wont say all their features are as refined as Nvidias but theyve hit that key good enough point to pass scrutiny Edit I should specify Im saying theyre a good alternative for gaming For content creation there are still some downsides,ms01o8t,2.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0twiy,NickCharlesYT,,10,2025-05-13 02:12:47,,,,Honestly they havent because theres still no viable alternative to CUDA If you game and only game fine But if you do literally anything else ie CAD complex photo editing video editing AI etc then its essentially Nvidia or nothing OpenCL is terrible if its supported at all by your program of choice and I havent heard anything about ROCm since they announced it what a decade ago They need to do better for the rest of us,ms05urh,3.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms23h6m,alidan,,2,2025-05-13 08:21:37,,,,I have never been in a store that sells computers or computer parts and not seen amd they sponsor games and get ads in them and at the very least if you barely pay attention you know they have the best cpus currently but way its meant to be played god damn was that good marketing as for intel yea uphill battle there apparently they are extreme value for the money like if the game properly works with the gpu they are a full tier higher performance for price wise than even amd when they arent being stupid with pricing Amd are likely making some big moves soon to kill off the mid range to lower high end gpu market entirely with future processors if they put out a console like apu for pc there goes that market entirely and I think they are moving toward that,ms21xnq,6.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms2rv89,TehOwn,,1,2025-05-13 11:58:51,,,,but way its meant to be played god damn was that good marketing The biggest part of this is simply the amount of time and money that NVIDIA spends working with game developer partners helping them to improve performance The only game I can think of that got that treatment from AMD is Civilization And thats rarely GPU limited,ms23h6m,7.0,1kl47hu

comment,mrzx6g5,SerEx0,,-7,2025-05-12 23:06:03,,,,Selling to market at the price that demand suggests Thats capitalism not a monopoly You can choose to buy an Intel or AMD GPU but gamers typically want the best which NVIDIA makes Hyperscalers also want the best for their AI data centers which means individuals have to compete with Google Amazon Microsoft etc who have a lot more money,mrzi5x4,3.0,1kl47hu

comment,ms07612,slut,,-7,2025-05-13 00:00:50,,,,If they make that much better of a product than their competitor that doesnt make them a monopoly They essentially invented the market and theyre the only one moving the needle on all the software improvements happening You can still buy graphics cards from other manufacturers they just arent producing anything worth buying Thats more on Intel and AMD than it is NVIDIA,ms00l66,5.0,1kl47hu
comment,ms0gauc,lordraiden007,,5,2025-05-13 00:53:46,,,,They can still be considered a monopoly even given those circumstances Also they are engaging in anticompetitive ie monopolistic behavior on several fronts by artificially restricting hardware and forcing others to use software that exclusively works with their hardware in order to stifle competition You can very much be a monopoly if your competition is worse especially if you are directly responsible for keeping people away from their products through unscrupulous means,ms07612,6.0,1kl47hu
