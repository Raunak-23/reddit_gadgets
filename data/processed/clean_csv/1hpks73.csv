comment,m4iaugq,DUNGAROO,,563,2024-12-30 11:20:03,,,,Unfortunately there are plenty of idiots who would be eager to buy such a product Really need to pass regulations at the national level to prevent the inside of our homes from becoming commercial billboard galleries,m4i90lv,1.0,1hpks73
comment,m4ickk1,Millennium1995,,208,2024-12-30 11:37:26,,,,Its also because of the ads that theyll sell the product at the lower end tricking those who cannot afford more and dont know what theyre buying into,m4iaugq,2.0,1hpks73
comment,m4ivbcj,audigex,,82,2024-12-30 14:07:53,,,,Yeah thats what it comes down to If this is the cheapest available microwave then there will be people who have to buy it because they cant afford something more expensive,m4ickk1,3.0,1hpks73

comment,m4ks4i4,audigex,,8,2024-12-30 20:15:33,,,,I think thats probably their intention people who want high end devices are unlikely to be willing to pay a premium for someone to run ads in their home and cost them 50 a year in additional power consumption Maybe Im wrong but the only way I see this working as a product is if they offer discounts for having it and make the money back with ads,m4kkreh,5.0,1hpks73
comment,m4tywei,FblthpphtlbF,,1,2025-01-01 10:39:40,,,,Which by the way is insane If you think people wont immediately either find a way to hack it break the screen in some irreparable way or just literally turn it around when theyre not using it youre crazy This will be a massively failed product whether people buy it or not because within seconds of it being released tiktok would get flooded with TV delete tips and this just becomes a 60 microwave And LG probably loses their ad buyers because who wants to advertise on a network everyone knows how to turn off and chooses to as well This is different from a TV because people dont want to fuck up their 346900 hundred dollar TV But if all it takes to get rid of the ads for this one is tape its gonna be a pretty fix,m4ks4i4,6.0,1hpks73
comment,m58001w,frustratedfartist,,1,2025-01-03 18:30:20,,,,My take on this is that average consumers will not even know its possible to disable such a feature The basis for my hunch is that most consumers do not know aboutlet alone how to set upad blockers for their internet browser which is extremely simple to do,m4tywei,7.0,1hpks73
comment,m58tp23,Soggy_Property3076,,1,2025-01-03 20:58:37,,,,I could see it selling as there is a fairly large number of the population that want a TV in the kitchen This would be a solution ti that without taking up more counter real estate Especially for homes apartments townhouses etc that has limited counter space with no reasonable way to increase it,m4ks4i4,6.0,1hpks73
comment,m4vk762,Seal481,,1,2025-01-01 17:45:36,,,,Possibly since they can theoretically make up the difference via ad revenue Make it cheap so the economically vulnerable will need to get it and then reap the benefits by being able to run ads to all those folks The question would then be whether or not the ads would provide a good enough ROI for the advertisers to shell out for,m4kkreh,5.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jkrik,good2goo,,17,2024-12-30 16:33:56,,,,I think it goes deeper than that There can be a bit of shame in spending more on something than you should I think a lot of people who can afford to buy a better product still buy the cheaper one,m4ivbcj,4.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jrx54,MadroxKran,,32,2024-12-30 17:10:40,,,,There can be shame in having the cheapest crap that shows ads though Anyone that comes over and sees ads playing on the microwave will judge that person,m4jkrik,5.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jttc2,VRNord,,4,2024-12-30 17:20:33,,,,Most buyers dont do any research though other than maybe ask the salesperson a question somebody told them to ask how many watts maybe And you better bet the retailer will have a magic code they use on display models that prevents ads from appearing on that pretty screen Until the buyer gets it home of course,m4jrx54,6.0,1hpks73

comment,m527dym,mysteryliner,,1,2025-01-02 20:02:58,,,,Sadly for many this is beyond their skill level and with only an ISP supplied router lacking hardware I love to break shitty services and layer by layer peel back restrictions to find the sweetspot where you have service but no ads But I also know many would greatly struggle to even change their wifi password,m4oxc4t,10.0,1hpks73

comment,m4kxsky,mak484,,1,2024-12-30 20:44:23,,,,No one knows how much money you spent on your microwave unless its obvious If it has a dedicated setting for warming up your pocket pussy then yeah everyone knows you spent way too much on it If it has ads everyone knows youre cheap as fuck Literally everything in between is just a microwave If you feel actual shame for spending more than the bare minimum on things no one could possibly judge you for thats on you,m4jttc2,7.0,1hpks73
comment,m4kegi2,fgnrtzbdbbt,,1,2024-12-30 19:05:27,,,,But a 27 inch screen is pretty big and will consume 30 watts easily probably more when on This has to be added to the price,m4ivbcj,4.0,1hpks73

comment,m4mfzn1,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2024-12-31 01:41:34,,,,I could see them disabling or if it doesnt have internet or doesnt have it for a certain time In that case you can leave it connected and disconnect the screen internally It wouldnt be hard Im sure someone would mess with it and figure out how to hook up an SBC to make it play whatever you want Maybe set up a dashboard to display Home Assistant smart home monitoring That would be kinda cool In either case it shouldnt be able to tell it wasnt playing ads,m4kvec7,5.0,1hpks73

comment,m4jirid,Hail-Hydrate,,54,2024-12-30 16:23:26,,,,Youre right but I wouldnt use a commercial signage display as a comparative option Those devices are designed to much higher usage standards in particular uptime theyre meant to be on 247 and they typically have a business premium price to boot Source used to work for a business that sold them in bulk to other vendors Reps would always be complaining about the price of digital signage try to cheap out and buy a bunch of standard TVs instead then come back to us complaining 3 months later because the TVs were having issues the digital signage wouldnt have had,m4j2062,4.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j81pw,rocketmonkee,,13,2024-12-30 15:25:18,,,,This is pretty much the right take I paid decent money for a solid midtier television It allegedly has smart features and apps but I wouldnt know because its never been connected to my network Ive never seen a single ad on it If the microwave is cheaper than the other options and if the quality is still good then Id get it and do the same thing,m4j2062,4.0,1hpks73
comment,m4j9wxc,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,1,2024-12-30 15:35:41,,,,I dont think a lot of reddit remembers or is old enough to know what Big Screen TVs used to cost Yes as technology improved manufacturing costs came down but at the same time a good chunk of your Roku TVs price is in ads They can sell you the TV cheaply because they make it back on ads They are incentivized to lower your buyin price to sell more units Because that means more ad revenue But in the end youre saving hundreds or thousands of dollars on the TV compared to what a nonad TV would charge And again you have the option of NOT connecting it to the internet These TVs have HDMI ports Hook up an old computer to use as a streaming station If youre more techsavvy you can block the ad traffic at your router or get a piHole Its similar to the PS3 Sony sold the PS3 at a loss They lost money for every PS3 sold But what they were doing was putting BluRay players into homes cheaply And then they made it back on BluRay licensing because in the battle of HDDVD v BluRay well people bought PS3s just to use as BluRay players In a similar move Roku is selling their TVs at lower profit margins than other companies and betting they will make it back serving ads I dont see this as a bad thing People can afford better luxuries at lower prices And with a bare minimum effort can completely avoid the ads Here Ill give you proof Samsung 4k 75 UHD Smart TV 79800 on Amazon Samsung 4k 75 UHD Commercial Signage Display aka Dumb TV 149428 on Amazon Its the same fucking thing But one is Smart and presumably has ads The other does not You can buy the TV without ads but are you willing to pay for it Survey says No,m4j81pw,5.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jko8b,notfork,,11,2024-12-30 16:33:28,,,,I have seen a couple recently that will not let you change off of the home page of the TV you now the one with the ads until it is connected to the internet so no changing input til you can verify that you can download its ads I would rather pay 34x the cost of tvs now then deal with that bullshit,m4j9wxc,6.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jpx90,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,9,2024-12-30 17:00:22,,,,If I bought one that didnt let me use it until I connected it to the internet Id be returning it the same day as non functional,m4jko8b,7.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jra09,notfork,,6,2024-12-30 17:07:22,,,,But thats where all the smart TVs are headed because as you said Why pay more for not having the feature People will just choose the cheaper option I would be willing to place a bet that with in 10years or sooner you will not be able to buy a smart tv that does not require an always on internet connection to function And it will phone home enough that even if you disconnect it after putting it on the right source it will kick back out Already saw that sort of on brand new Sony last week every 6 minuets it gives a pop up that says you are not connected to the internet and kicks back to menu it will still let you change sources with out internet Issue was the tv was connected to the internet the person had just blocked it from phoning home to Sony,m4jpx90,8.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jrxov,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,1,2024-12-30 17:10:45,,,,it will still let you change sources with out internet Then I dont care Because my TV exists as an output for my media PC Thats it I dont use any of the apps Ill change it to Input 1 and be happy you will not be able to buy a smart tv that does not require an always on internet connection to function I highly doubt this Believe it or not there are many MANY Americans who live in places without high speed internet or without stable internet connections There will be a market for such for a long time Or I can fork over the extra dough and buy a digital signage Dumb TV,m4jra09,9.0,1hpks73
comment,m4ju3eb,notfork,,4,2024-12-30 17:22:02,,,,But those people in the areas are the ones that are buying these tvs en mass And the tv manufacturers do not care I have listened to more then a fair amount of call recording that go like this Hi I just got a new tv but it does not seem to work it keeps saying it is not connected to the internet even though I am Sir you have a 5mb dsl connection that on a good day gets MAYBE 2mbs If you have anything else using the internet will cause issues with this device But I cant use itset it up figure it out with out internet Sir you will have to call RokuAmazon about that The tv manufacturers are already causing issues for these people and they are not stopping the train for them And this is not some grand conspiracy theory This part of the plans they all lay out at the tech shows And as you said because it is the cheapest option people WILL buy it Hell people spent 23 grand on a stationary BIKE that required an always on connection So if they can save 200300 dollars on that big screen they are not gonna look at the part where it says it requires an internet connection,m4jrxov,10.0,1hpks73
comment,m4juppx,AlphaTangoFoxtrt,,1,2024-12-30 17:25:13,,,,Then they should do some basic research before making a purchase They are grown ass adults its not the governments job to be in loco parentis I am not interested in shielding grown adults from their own mistakes Return the TV buy a different one Not hard I dont want the government which for the next 24 years means The Trump Administration Nannystating what kind of TV I can buy You can still buy Dumb TVs they just cost more If they really went to Always online TVs Id just buy a dumb one and spend the extra dough,m4ju3eb,11.0,1hpks73

comment,m4jws94,sCeege,,5,2024-12-30 17:35:50,,,,I understand what youre trying to convey but that example is horrible Youre just cherry picking the most extreme examples Commercial signage is just that commercial a household TV isnt the same thing Its like saying a Tacoma is cheaper than a 18 wheeler I mean yeah but theyre completely different categories Once you get into the 65 or QOLED panels theyre not really cutting you much breaks The 55 is for sure saturated with ad supported models all around the 300 range in the US,m4j2062,4.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jmhzh,matrix801,,2,2024-12-30 16:42:53,,,,This doesnt really prove anything because these TVs are not the same Maybe they use similar panels but the hardware is otherwise different when comparing commercial to consumer displays The QET series is IP5x rated designed for 16 hour daily operation includes MagicInfo player support and has a full onsite 3year warrantee Many companies wont even honor a comsumer display warrantee if it is being used in a commercial application Commercial devices are also priced higher because of their expected target audience When you are designing a commercial space and spending 100k or more paying an extra 500 for a display is not likely to break your budget And you are buying a more reliable device for an application where downtime and service calls can cost you significantly more in the long run,m4j2062,4.0,1hpks73

comment,m4jktj7,CaptainDouchington,,0,2024-12-30 16:34:14,,,,Ads can be written off by corporations and have been allowed for many years now I cant remember the term used specifically but you can sell 10 million in ads and write that 10 million off at the end of the year Gifts given by the company with their logo on it qualify as ads bypassing the cap of gift giving a company is allowed to write off Gifts are capped at like 50100 bucks in terms of tax benefits for the company There is no cap on ad write offs Which is why you have seen so much ad spam over the years Just throw out more ads so you can get your tax burden down and keep that stock price a little higher,m4jii8r,4.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jnphf,DUNGAROO,,2,2024-12-30 16:49:07,,,,I mean I do believe businesses have a right to advertise for their products and I also dont have an issue with declaring the expenses associated with advertising as a normal business expense no different than the costs to develop manufacture or distribute products Advertising isnt inherently evil But like all things it needs to be properly regulated to preserve individual quality of life Many local jurisdictions dont allow businesses to erect massive billboards because of their impact to a neighborhoodarea Allowing businesses to broadcast advertisements on household appliances seems like it can be harmful for the same reasons and should be regulated similarly,m4jktj7,5.0,1hpks73

comment,m4jiig7,Freedomismyreligion,,1,2024-12-30 16:22:06,,,,Unfortunately thats not really the case anymore with appliances There is definitely built in obsolescence in modern day Appliances because of the connected features They have become as much computer as they are machine Circuit boards go and can be hard to replace or install without a tech making the repair less appealing than just replacing the unit This is why I have held onto the 2006 whirlpool appliances that came with my house They have been pretty damn reliable and when something does go finding parts are easy and the repairs are simple Contrast with my mother in law that has gone through a Samsung washerdryer an oven and a dishwasher that all came new with her house in 2017 I should mention I use to sell appliances and TVs was the supervisor at a Best Buy for those departments and the biggest thing that kills these new appliances is power surges And where I lived and worked was an older and more affluent area Baby boomers would have a brand new house constructed only to completely remodel and replace the appliances a few years later There was a lot of keeping up with the Jones mentality,m4jdawa,4.0,1hpks73

comment,m4kmqkp,Freedomismyreligion,,1,2024-12-30 19:48:02,,,,Yup Putting it in game mode helps by turning off all the extra picture processing that increases the latency but gotta go oled if you want 4k HDR and low latency Im still rocking a 2018 LG OLED C8 and for retro systems I have a 15 year old Panasonic plasma still running strong,m4kkzui,4.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j5lj1,Remy0507,,2,2024-12-30 15:11:26,,,,Well off the top of my head there was an issue with some of the recent LG OLEDs mine is a C2 but it might have affected other models too where the autodimming was too aggressive and would kick in with movies that had extended darker scenes noticed it when watching Evil Dead Rise That was fixed in an update Im sure there were other fixesimprovements made since I got the TV I think issues with the WiFi and some other stuff UI improvements as well Of course you dont NEED to leave it connected at all time for these updates Could just connect and do the updates and then disconnect For me the built in apps are fast enough and its more convenient than having yet another device connected,m4j1nfm,6.0,1hpks73
comment,m4oa255,HeKis4,,1,2024-12-31 10:35:44,,,,Thing is you need to agree to their TC to get the updates and it includes an agreement to process your data out of the EU for TVs which is corporate lingo for please waive your rights to GDPR and were going to abuse your PII Im not going to waive my rights for a TV,m4j5lj1,7.0,1hpks73

comment,m4ixawq,kerbaal,,3,2024-12-30 14:20:52,,,,Which makes perfect sense when the volume measurements are 141 ratio Clearly they are not the same by volume by a lot,m4itp82,6.0,1hpks73
comment,m4j87ws,Jonesdeclectice,,2,2024-12-30 15:26:16,,,,IMO volume measurements ONLY makes sense for gasses and liquids Solids dont fill their container leaving lots of unoccupied air space meaning no volume measurements for solid are created equal eg 1 cup of popcorn will not be equal to the next cup of popcorn,m4ixawq,7.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jd1ep,kerbaal,,2,2024-12-30 15:52:45,,,,I fully agree but I wouldnt expect most people to actually understand that Most people who cook use volumetric measurements for a lot of solids However it still doesnt adjust for density Pretty sure I can eat more pasta by weight than I can popcorn by weight 1 cup of popcorn kernels is according to google searching 128 grams This is about twice what my wife and I together can eat and we can easily share it with a third person The same amount of pasta by weight Definitely not going to satisfy two of us certainly not 3 and definitely not twice over,m4j87ws,8.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jdrb1,Jonesdeclectice,,1,2024-12-30 15:56:37,,,,Yeah Ive found that Americans tend to do that especially with recipes Im used to European recipe books which are all generally either volume for liquids only or even many measure in mass for both solids and liquids Thats pretty wild about popcornpasta And I think it makes sense I guess popcorn must absorb all the liquid or something adding density while you eat it Im not really sure LOL,m4jd1ep,9.0,1hpks73
comment,m4jigd2,kerbaal,,1,2024-12-30 16:21:48,,,,Well for most cooking there is no need for much accuracy Precision is much more important Frankly its super dish dependent whether I measure anything I weigh my coffee in grams every morning I weigh flour in grams when I bake bread Meatballs Eh I round off the amount of meat to the half pound a cup measure for dry panade ingredients and a 13 cup measure for roughly grabbing the right amount to form into a generous ball Tomato sauce Closest thing to a measurement is the ratio of cans of tomato to whole onions The rest is eyeballs,m4jdrb1,10.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j21kl,RodneyRabbit,,1,2024-12-30 14:50:26,,,,I bet unpopped corn is about the same as dry pasta In any case if youre going by volume not weight then Id say its pretty easy to eat 1415 cups of popcorn so its probably very similar calories in the end,m4io2d5,5.0,1hpks73
comment,m4ldw31,Jaquemart,,1,2024-12-30 22:06:30,,,,By weight Per ounce popcorn is 106 calories I highly doubt that 1 ounce and something of corn would produce 75 cups of popcorn,m4io2d5,5.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j1p05,christoskal,,-2,2024-12-30 14:48:19,,,,If it lets you show your calendar some notifications from your phone information about the weather etc it would actually be amazing And considering how well LG TVs handle that part it will probably be just as well done I get it that the post is mostly about spreading misinformation and random lies but a screen on a microwave is perfect People pay good money for devices like amazons echo or googles nest hub etc why not combine that functionality with the front of the microwave and avoid the extra clutter and cables Its not like you need to watch the food spinning inside Its going to be at perfect eye height too Its a touchscreen as well not just a simple screen You can control your smart house through it change lights monitor devices etc The more I think about it the better it gets,m4in0vw,2.0,1hpks73
comment,m4j2vi9,saintash,,3,2024-12-30 14:55:24,,,,But seriously why does a microwave need a screen You can make the argument that a fridge having a screen means you can write notes on it check a calendar date things that people use the fridge currently for And if youre looking for a smart screen fridges hould do everything like changing the lights and stuff like that,m4j1p05,3.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j0s68,BushWookie-Alpha,,1,2024-12-30 14:42:43,,,,Imagine if you wanted to warm up your lunch and your microwave says You need to watch 2x 1min unskippable ads before I start Now picture needing to get something warmed up as part of a bigger meal plan where timing is tight and it just blocks you Now your main on the hob has overcooked while you are forced to watch an advert for Raid Shadow Legends,m4ixg8w,1.0,1hpks73

comment,m4j2qoa,BushWookie-Alpha,,2,2024-12-30 14:54:36,,,,So my microwave will now be using power while it is not being used Big skipperino from me Ill stick to my Catering grade microwave until it dies on me I have enough ads being blasted at me that only makes me want to not buy the products being advertised from other sources If I pay for a product to do a specific function I dont want it trying to do things I dont want it to do How much are they charging for it Because I can pick up a professional kitchen grade microwave for under 200 and a standard consumer grade one for under 100 easily,m4j1ald,3.0,1hpks73
comment,m4j3iae,None,,-1,2024-12-30 14:59:10,,,,Its all about choice Consumers will decide what they wantbut given how addicted we are to cheap consumer goods I think the vast majority of people will just buy the cheaper microwave And Im not sure most people are that concerned with paying less than 2 a year more for electricity costs,m4j2qoa,4.0,1hpks73
comment,m4j4nht,BushWookie-Alpha,,2,2024-12-30 15:05:54,,,,Its not about the cost of the electricity for me Its about it being wasted energy that is not put to an actual beneficial use for my household So it shows ads when idling Mint But that does not benefit me because I dont sit and stare at my microwave unless it is being used to warm stuff up,m4j3iae,5.0,1hpks73
