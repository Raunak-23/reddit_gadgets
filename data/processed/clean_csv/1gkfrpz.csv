comment,lvpygry,FlarblesGarbles,,2,2024-11-06 15:01:01,,,,Not necessarily it seems like American phone prices are often subsidised by extreme monthly rates on your actual phone plans But also in the UK the base iPhone 16 Pro is 999 including tax which is 1198 not 1300 Apple Irelands price is 1239 including tax not 1300 Sales tax in the UK and Ireland is 20 Sales tax in california is a third of that at 725 So an iPhone in the UK pre tax is 832 An iPhone in the USA pretax is 999 which is 776 There will obviously be a few extra fees duty etc but the actual difference is quite low,lvolbms,9.0,1gkfrpz

comment,lvlyd6h,JustAnotherLamppost,,2,2024-11-05 23:24:24,,,,Im not trying to sound snarky at all But I really think you should be able to think of these things yourself Having marginal barely noticeable upgrades year over year because theres no competition and thus no incentive to improve Having the bare minimum of software support Apple in this regard has been really good in the past providing software updates to their phones many years after release Most android companies used to provide only 2 or 3 years though that has changed recently Samsung and Google both promised 7 years on their latest phones Again just because I praised Apple doesnt mean its a good company They lost the lawsuit to open up their phones to 3rd party app stores and only followed through on doing that in European countries where said law applies Android on the other hand is very open about 3rd party stores and app installation in general But while they do have that theres privacy concerns on android phones though Im not too well versed in this as I havent done much research Theres tons more and going through them all one by one would take all day,lvluuux,9.0,1gkfrpz
comment,lvm0aw1,HHegert,,-1,2024-11-05 23:35:19,,,,Im not trying to sound snarky at all But I really think you should be able to think of these things yourself No because when you have such an extreme take and somebody questions you on that then it means this person questioning you does not think the way you do so youd have to explain your POV Hence the question Simple Nothing you mentioned is screwing the average folk though I mean its more of a question about preference rather than screwing people over Tech has gotten so far that any minimal advancement requires more and more power from something and somebody else Its not Apple specific nor is it phones specific either Its everywhere Diminishing returns When it comes to 3rd party apps as a lifelong Apple user I was and am against it Mainly because it gets messy introduces security risks and essentially it lessens the value security comfort etc of a closed system Imagine a private school with strict rules They set the rules for everything teachers students what not That means that they dictate the level of education there Now if that school goes public it most probably will lose at least some of this high level So the TLDR is that you did not give a single example of Apple screwing the average person,lvlyd6h,10.0,1gkfrpz
comment,lvm521e,JustAnotherLamppost,,1,2024-11-06 00:02:03,,,,Fair enough about the security risk of the 3rd party apps and stores but I believe consumers should have the freedom to take such risks if they want Just having the ability to do it doesnt mean itll immediately allow hackers access to your phone So if I want to download a random app from a sketchy looking site I should have the ability to The consequences of that should fall entirely on me yes but I still want to be able to do it It also opens the market to other companiespeople loosening Apples grip on their software market Im an iPhone user too but not being able to install 3rd party apps or older versions of apps which is somewhat important to me is really annoying They dont even allow 3rd party browsers on iOS and iPadOS Every browser is just a copy of Safari with a different skin Not being able to run my Firefox plugins on my iPad pro really makes it annoying to browse the web on Plus theyre already allowing it in the EU Region locking such a thing that is based purely on software shows that they dont want anyone to be able to do it And that theyre only allowing the few people that they are because they are being forced to Also I dont know what you mean when you say that my take is extreme Would appreciate it if you explained yourself there And as for the tech improvement statement youre right But Apple makes their own chips which might I add are super super powerful I know their m4 chips in their iPads trade blows with desktop level CPUs so they dont really have to really on other companies like android companies do But again I do understand the diminishing returns for these things So you have a very good point But without competition they would undoubtedly stagger as Intel did with their chips until AMD came out with Ryzen Yes its comparing apples to oranges but the point still remains that without competition they would have no reason to improve If you want a specific example of Apple screwing over its customers I dont remember exactly what it currently is but buying a Mac and the same mac with more memory storage will change the price by 2x So if you want 32gb ram 1tb storage that would cost the same as buying two units with 16gb ram 509gb storage But you wont be getting the cpu and the other components obviously Again I dont know the details of this but I saw a post on the mac subreddit I believe a few days ago Just in general limiting users and then charging ridiculous prices for upgrades that would otherwise be really cheap or at least cheaper,lvm0aw1,11.0,1gkfrpz

comment,lvmwdo6,RadicalMeowslim,,7,2024-11-06 02:44:28,,,,Whats funny about Samsungs marketing is that the best deals are at launch Then they sprinkle okay deals throughout the year But at launch you can trade in a 7 yo Samsung for 500 even if its broken I actually bought the s24u on launch but it was because Samsung offers so many discounts and trade in bonuses Paid about 60 of the MSRP That goes back to my original comment Apple offers very poor trade in offers and the price is either MSRP or their lower educational price When people buy theyre paying much more for the iPhone Re cameras it depends on the releases S23u and S24u are basically the same The improvement is incremental if you go for the same tier of phone But if you go up from a base to a plus or plus to ultra there are more cameras and sensors,lvmsxfg,5.0,1gkfrpz
comment,lvmyu4c,kiwipo17,,1,2024-11-06 02:59:00,,,,That is a crazy good deal I would have taken that one too Sure if you upgrade to a different tier phone theres a significant improvement However you could wait for half a year and usually get a much better deal I suppose it also depends on your location I received a brand new phone from work but otherwise Ive reached a point where all the technology I have meets my requirements If my Mac were to die tomorrow I would likely purchase the M2 Pro or M3 Pro again Theres no advantage in having the latest generation based on my current needs,lvmwdo6,6.0,1gkfrpz

comment,lvrb5gm,chasonreddit,,1,2024-11-06 18:39:08,,,,Well are we talking materials or parts Because lets face it the actual phone the radios the memory the speakers etc are all manufactured and then integrated I believe the number you are looking at is for parts Each of those companies is making their own profit on the part itself Google or whatever part of the Alphabet makes Pixels could Massively reduce that by vertically integrating but that makes them much less flexible And if you bring out a new model a couple times a year that is important,,0.0,1gkfrpz
comment,lvvuf6s,JoeKanoAus,,1,2024-11-07 12:11:14,,,,Im a little surprised that its that high I must admit Ive never researched it I just assumed most phones had a bigger overall margin in between materials costs and sales cost Theres still advertisingmarketing youve said materials do not inclusive of manufacturing Then distribution etc etc Yeh just a little surprised Huh Not a good surprise or a bad surprise per se just huh surprise,,0.0,1gkfrpz
