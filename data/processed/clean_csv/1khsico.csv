comment,mrdi1e8,Quithelion,,-13,2025-05-09 05:40:36,,,,Not defending nVidia through my research before buying my new GPU the correlation between price and performance is pretty much on scale As in my local shop is selling RTX 1650 for about half the price of a RTX 4060 Through various benchmarks comparison I watched on YouTube the performance of RTX 1650 is about half of RTX 4060 Any games can be played on either GPU The problem though is AAA game developers are pushing out more unoptimized higher graphic fidelity that most average players didnt asked for and nVidia is just cashing in on this All the players need to do is to stop buying overpriced GPU and to demand for optimized AAA games on day one,mr9sr5d,1.0,1khsico

comment,mr9e0wk,treehumper83,,53,2025-05-08 15:32:06,,,,The 4060 also had 8GB There is definitely a 3060 6GB card I guess its like they beat out the 6GB and said ok done,mr9awgi,1.0,1khsico
comment,mrcp1y1,SheepWolves,,2,2025-05-09 02:04:18,,,,wasnt the 6gb 3060 never part of the original desktop 3060 line up and just nvidia capitalizing on people buying any GPU they could during the cryptocovid period cause crypto miners would buy all the good gpus and gamers couldnt pay what crypto miners would so theyd buy any affordable gpu they could Pretty sure they just slapped mobile GPUs on a gpu board cause the knew they coukd sell way more as desktop gpus than gaming laptops,mr9e0wk,2.0,1khsico

comment,mraim6x,WeekendHistorical476,,5,2025-05-08 18:48:25,,,,And the 3060ti was an 8GB card It makes no sense to me at all,mr9awgi,1.0,1khsico
comment,mrcqddr,SheepWolves,,2,2025-05-09 02:12:33,,,,They couldnt make the 3060ti more than 8gb cause then theyd have give the rest of the 30 series more vram and then more people would be less likely to upgrade in the 40 series 3060ti 3070 3070ti all 8gb A 10gb or 12gb 3070ti would probably still be very useable right now,mraim6x,2.0,1khsico
comment,mrcvc2t,blubs_will_rule,,3,2025-05-09 02:44:24,,,,I cant help but concur every time the 3070 ti is mentioned on what an absolute waste of a card it is It is BONKERS they only gave it 8gb two generations later with the 50 series uplift being extremely minimal its already double that for the 5070 ti They knew how bad they were hamstringing that card Its existence was purely an upsell for the 3080,mrcqddr,3.0,1khsico

comment,mrgs99i,CorruptedArcher,,2,2025-05-09 18:58:02,,,,I mean as an industry standard ya know Khazan did it recently and that easily made me pre order the game and the extra 20 to play it early lol I dont normally shell out for those practices but that game has easily become my game of the year so money well spent all cause of the demo,mrgoa2d,3.0,1khsico
comment,mrjm7gc,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,2,2025-05-10 05:31:44,,,,Nvidia has just given AMD and Intel just a massive opening to do something Its almost as if theyve given up and are looking at exiting the consumer desktop GPU market Like they completely forgot how to compete,mrdvsg1,1.0,1khsico
comment,mrjeyvp,ironroad18,,1,2025-05-10 04:31:20,,,,Unfortunately all the not so savvy and newbie PC gamersbuilders will be the ones that get screwed simply because of the name Nvidia being attached to the product,mrdvsg1,1.0,1khsico
comment,mrjmjtg,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,2,2025-05-10 05:34:52,,,,I mean can you really blame them For more than a decade Nvidia has been the absolute best GPU brand to buy that would last for longer than anything AMD put out This 50 series rollout has honestly just shocked the entire market at how horrible uninspiring and complacent its been The only card worth the money seems to be the 5090 their other cards have little to no improvement vs the 40 series,mrjeyvp,2.0,1khsico

comment,mrf1zjl,Ninebun,,3,2025-05-09 13:39:35,,,,Meanwhile Intels Battlemage might actually undercut both If their drivers improve a 250 card with 12GB VRAM could make the 5060 irrelevant before it even drops,,0.0,1khsico

comment,mrbbrpj,Pitoucc,,-2,2025-05-08 21:12:37,,,,8gb is the basic display adapter for pcs now a days with all the Windows bloat and junk on websites,,0.0,1khsico
comment,mrdtr4a,cbarrick,,15,2025-05-09 07:36:26,,,,Window management and web browsing use a negligible amount of VRAM And when gaming in fullscreen neither windows nor browser tabs need to be loaded into your VRAM You can still say 8GB is too little for your use case but Windows bloat and junk on websites are not the reasons,mrbbrpj,1.0,1khsico
comment,msamzvy,i81u812,,1,2025-05-14 16:30:47,,,,It is super nuanced you are correct People know the 3060 TI 8 GB as a problem but I have that card it is an animal there is more to it than the ram in some circumstances The 1080 TI was similarly beastly and had long life despite having people initially talk smack,mrdtr4a,2.0,1khsico
