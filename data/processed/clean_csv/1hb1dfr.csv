comment,m1cr7y8,rnilf,,4,2024-12-10 13:16:19,,,,Tip for anyone who still uses an iPhone with the Lightning port you can use Apples Lightning to USB Camera Adapter to plug in USB flash drives and access files on it Its called a Camera Adapter but it definitely works with other USB devices Ive even used it to access files on a SATA SSD drive by daisy chaining with a SATA III to USB adapter although I had to plug in the power adapter because the Lightning port didnt provide enough power by itself Very useful for me years ago when I spent a lot of time flying so I loaded up an SSD with movies and TV shows and just plugged that in without using up storage on my iPhone and having to use a laptop in economy class trays,,0.0,1hb1dfr
