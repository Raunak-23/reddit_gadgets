comment,n3pt0cj,Tangled2,,0,2025-07-17 22:37:20,,,,Apple usually has tighter controls than Google does when it comes to their respective app SDK largely because Apple only has to support iPhones whereas the Android device ecosystem is the wild west Id bet the default for legacy apps is to maintain the original aspect ratio and allow multitasking on the side with updated apps being able to expand to fill the whole screen or only take up half or only a quarter,n3ng057,3.0,1m24iic

comment,n3n3qf5,UpsetKoalaBear,,4,2025-07-17 14:54:53,,,,This sub and rhardware most likely have a 90 crossover rate in terms of people subscribed to them Realistically these subs could be turned into one single sub and youd probably notice no difference It doesnt help that on subs like this and rhardware 99 of comments when someone criticises something is almost always about the software rather than judging something for what it physically is which is the whole point For example Headline The new iPad Pro has a M4 chip people respond with Yeah but its still shit because its held back by software Headline The Switch 2 hardware feels underwhelming for the price people respond with Yeah but people dont buy the Switch for the hardware Headline The foldable iPhone is going to have a 78 inch display and cost 2k people respond with Yeah but its still shit because you cant sideload and iOS is a walled garden Those are genuine points to be made dont get me wrong but probably arent suited to a discussion around the hardware of what theyre talking about If the moderators made a concerted attempt to kill conversations around software in hardware based discussion then it would probably be better However as it stands there is practically no difference in any discussion between this sub and rhardware,n3m3nhp,1.0,1m24iic

comment,n3m4pkb,thelionsmouth,,8,2025-07-17 11:48:45,,,,I really wish theyd overhaul Siri to have actual ai functionality Could you imagine the power of having Siri as an actual AI assistant that has base level access to your phone I dont care about writing emails or summarizing text messages I want to organize my day with an assistant that knows my highs as lows throughout the day using heath data from my watch notes from my journal my calendar my emails and everything I give Apple This is aside from the obvious privacy concerns but I feel like this is true overlooked advantage to ai functionality I like the IDEA of Siri controlling the phone but if it could access all areas and synthesize the info like a true llm thatd be great Privacy is totally a concern tho Edit Im imagining this being run locally theres some very lightweight open source models out there that could come close to handling this I have an llm on my raspberry pi ffs Im sure Apple could theoretically do it Im just saying its possible to have some semblance of privacy Obv thatd never happen though,n3lzinr,2.0,1m24iic

comment,n3mb6gn,reformedmikey,,15,2025-07-17 12:28:49,,,,The issue is less affordable vs luxury there are plenty of affordable alternatives on the market The issue is the most common phones on the market are becoming more expensive without actually innovating them They add AI and folding screens with weak points and call that innovation or bloatware and more cameras which admittedly is nice but besides the point Theyre now becoming more expensive than desktoplaptop computers with far less functionality than one Still people will buy them because they have to have the latest and greatest The cycle will continue to cycle,n3m8brl,4.0,1m24iic

comment,n3ua9ro,reformedmikey,,1,2025-07-18 16:20:03,,,,Making something everyone uses prohibitively expensive every year by releasing a new version without innovating or drastically improving functionality or adding new features is ridiculous Lets use Apple as an example Every year they upgrade the camera and chipset They discontinued their true budget phone the SE in favor of the 16e The SE 3 started at 429 was released in 2022 Now these SE phones used some parts from older phones such as the camera and shell but they tend to use newer chipsets so it ran similar to the numbered iPhone it release alongside I have the 2nd generation SE released in 2020 at 399 and it was a solid phone until it started showing its age this year Its a 5 year old phone I should expect that I cant buy a new SE 3 released 2022 at 429 from Apple but I can shell out 599 for the new 16e budget phone Thats not a terribly large price difference but for people who cant afford a new phone it can be since the difference might be one or more phone payments about 25 of mine Apple hasnt necessarily raised their prices of their phones at least since I bought my current phone base models start at 799 and pro models start at 999 However they raised the price of the SE two years after reintroducing it then killed it Granted they raised the price by 30 but raising is still raising Except now that they killed the SE model they opted to raise the price further by calling it the latest release number followed by an e and raising the price to 599 What is inherently different Is it different than the iPhone mini another model that they killed The mini was just a smaller sized version so Im not sure Id call it a budget offering considering the last mini was the 13 and the price difference between the 13 799 and the 13 mini 699 was a whopping 100 Neither the mini nor the 16e are much of a savings when you consider previous savings for budget offerings was closer to 400 difference To answer your stupid fucking shitty rhetorical question no I cannot manufacture a phone Or I can you dont know me But what I can say is creating something new that isnt adding new features and charging new prices for them every year is ridiculous A new camera and chipset isnt new unless you add features that are innovative Companies used to do that with phones then the market got lazy and stopped caring about that Myself included in this Just because weve normalized it doesnt make it any less ridiculous I remember a time when the Razr was released and its biggest selling point was how thin it was compared to other cell phones at the time Today it seems we care about minuscule camera differences adding AI and foldable screens with weak points that will likely break after multiple years of use I used two different razrs over the course of 78 years only replacing them because I broke them as a reckless teenager Phones actually lasted back then but today theyre made to be replaced every year either through failure of the phone or vanity of the buyer And imagine spending 800year just to have the newest phone which works exactly like your last phone apart from differences you will never notice Just to replace it next year over differences youll never actually notice,n3u0kuu,4.0,1m24iic

comment,n3nmaiu,Nicinus,,0,2025-07-17 16:20:55,,,,Im just saying that many or most of Apples products are clever refinements or combinations of existing technology and sophisticated packaging of sorts whereas an invention would be to create something completely new The iPhone for example is a superior product compared to what was before especially in terms of software but there were some products like the Ericsson P800 that was similar And if you shrink an iPhone and wrap it on your wrist is that an invention or innovation I agree that it becomes fuzzy Im probably nitpicking but I kind of look at it from a business strategy perspective and innovative companies tend to have sizable RD where companies that focus inventions have fellowships and collaborate with universities etc,n3nh4es,5.0,1m24iic

comment,n3m5v8z,mr_miggs,,0,2025-07-17 11:56:08,,,,lol you cant be serious with this Apple may not have directly invented new technology but there are some major products that they made into something massively popular Just take the original iPhone There were smartphones before then and even capacitive touchscreen ones But no one really remembers them Thats because Apple innovated with improving the touchscreen multi finger gestures and scrolling were huge had an intuitive UI and a musicfocused ecosystem with iTunes They took existing technology and made a packaged product that did most everything better than whatever else was on the market It took years for others to catch up The only other real competition at the time was blackberry because of the security messaging and physical keyboard,n3lznr7,2.0,1m24iic

comment,n3lz3fk,diacewrb,,12,2025-07-17 11:09:19,,,,Apple initially considered pricing the device between 2000 and 2400 However the company has since implemented aggressive costcutting measures that could bring the price down slightly to between 1800 and 2000 Considering how much they charged for a set of wheels for the mac pro I have my doubts if that will charge 2000 or less for their first foldable iphone,,0.0,1m24iic

comment,n4iab8w,SilverCarbon,,1,2025-07-22 11:35:38,,,,I also have my doubts Why would they even do an attempt at costcutting towards the consumer on a new format Theres definitely a larger audience for these kind of devices than the Vision Pro theyll want to shell out a price with a clear premium compared to the Pro Max I imagine something more to 2200 and then trade in values Almost the price of 2 Pro Maxes as justification,n3lz3fk,1.0,1m24iic
comment,n3m3c0y,Edward_TH,,-9,2025-07-17 11:39:32,,,,Theyll do what they always do launch it starting from 1999 but the base price is for a model with garbage specs no accessories and maybe even requiring a packeted service to even be purchaseable like a 12 months iCloud subscription or a top tier apple care insurance The first price for the model they actually intend people to flat out buy will instead be something like 24002500 4000 if financed EDIT its funny how people feel the need to somehow defend apple from my wild hypothesis of them employing the marketing strategy they always use and even pride themselves with at investors meetings Dont worry guys this time for sure apple will offer the cheapest option with specs that the majority of people actually are going to purchase For sure,n3lz3fk,1.0,1m24iic
comment,n3m5fc7,NotRonaldKoeman,,14,2025-07-17 11:53:19,,,,this is such a weird take literally what iPhone can you buy today requires any of that the base iPhone X years ago had great specs literally only difference was storage same goes for really any of the flagship models None of them required any subscriptions Theyve never cheaped out on their top of the line models which the Fold will be,n3m3c0y,2.0,1m24iic
comment,n3m6cg4,Edward_TH,,-7,2025-07-17 11:59:12,,,,Its not that weird its a marketing strategy well consolidated from apple selling a product with increasing tiers of prices and specs and offering the cheapest one with ALMOST the specs most of their costumers look for but not quite too guide them towards more expensive and profitable options Its called price ladder,n3m5fc7,3.0,1m24iic

comment,n3m7out,NotRonaldKoeman,,1,2025-07-17 12:07:40,,,,i understand what a tier is my point is on Apples flagship phones pro models upcoming fold the only thing you could upgrade was the storage thats it thats literally what every other manufacturer in the history of electronics has done You couldnt upgrade the processor the RAM yeah you could choose the nonflagship models the screen etc So the argument that Apples going to release a fold and force it to need upgrades pushing it to 2400 has no basis in history I personally have purchased the X the 12 and the 14 Pro all base models and got 999 of the functionality of the highest end phone they sold Edit to add nor did I need to purchase any subscriptions at all to make the phone usable,n3m6cg4,4.0,1m24iic
comment,n3mbvmy,Edward_TH,,1,2025-07-17 12:32:57,,,,Dude The Pro IS a step in the ladder The last one Apple literally has a single phone product the iPhone and never had anything else Most other manufacturers have different products that each have their own options but are not comparable one to the others Apple has no flagship phone as of now because their ONLY phone is already in the flagship category The price ladder works because you CANT upgrade specs after the purchase so they always have the lowest tier specced just below what most people look for to guide them a step up towards more profitable configurations Why do you think the best selling iPhone configuration is almost never the base one but the step after that Most companies use this strategy in some way apple is just the company that use only that because they offer much much less products a single phone a couple of tablets a couple of laptops a couple of desktops etc,n3m7out,5.0,1m24iic
comment,n3mdixx,NotRonaldKoeman,,1,2025-07-17 12:42:26,,,,what youre failing to realize is that ifwhen apple releases the fold it wont be marketed priced specd like their base nonpro models it will be promodel adjacent Sure you will be able to upgrade the storage but itll most likely just be the pro but with folding features processor RAM Your original thesis which your now stepping away from is that the base fold will be 2000 and youll be forced to upgrading it to be usable like upgrading from base iPhone to the Pro But history tells us that this is already a Promodel with most likely the Prochip RAM display technology so the argument kinda falls flat,n3mbvmy,6.0,1m24iic
comment,n3mf85m,Edward_TH,,1,2025-07-17 12:51:57,,,,Are you living in an alternate reality Apple never offered an upgradeable phone Like never since the OG iPhone came out Theyre actually a company with a rich history of resisting even against repairs up until they had been forced to accept them Im not saying apple products are shit Ive said it before that theyre flagship But you guys should stop drinking corporate koolaid and try to show how wrong I am about their pricing strategy that they literally explain themselves during investors meetings,n3mdixx,7.0,1m24iic

comment,n3mlwry,green_link,,2,2025-07-17 13:28:03,,,,They literally do the cheap unuseable hardware specs all the damn time Fuck for the longest time they kept the 8gb storage option in phones in a world where literally everyone else moved on to 32 or 64 GB defaultstarting storage options Fuck their laptops had 8gb of RAM for the longest time with 128gb or storage For the cheap starting at price of 1000 To do any real work on any of them you had to buy the more expensive models because you literally cant upgrade the storage or RAM in a MacBook,n3mdxkc,3.0,1m24iic
