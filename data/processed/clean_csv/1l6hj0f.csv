comment,mwp11g3,nguyenm,,1408,2025-06-08 18:10:05,,,,Microsoft doesnt load the full Windows desktop or a bunch of background processes in this fullscreen Xbox experience putting Windows firmly in the background and freeing up more memory for games It took decades but at least Steam OS had finally pushed Microsoft to do what they didnt want for the longest time inadvertently admit Windows 11 is unnecessarily bloated,,0.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwpezh3,XalAtoh,,344,2025-06-08 19:19:54,,,,Microsoft always knew classiclegacy Win32 environment is bloated and chaotic They tried to move away from it with Windows 8 creating a streamlined consistent GUIUX from ground up but it was touchscreen focused and Microsoft made huge mistake by pushing it to everyone to people without touchscreen on desktop This time time it is different only gaming handhelds get the new Xbox GUI not every PClaptop what they did with Windows 8,mwp11g3,1.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwpkqpu,Better-Train6953,,46,2025-06-08 19:49:45,,,,I think the head of Xbox complaining about how much ass Windows 11 was on his Ally and Legion Go as well as MS Gaming becoming large enough to trade blows with Windows in terms of quarterly revenue following the completion of the ABK purchase gave them a lot more leeway in what they can demand from Windows Then you add in Steam OS to show that it can in fact be done and there you go,mwp11g3,1.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwpa55l,Kinetic93,,60,2025-06-08 18:55:22,,,,Ill be looking forward to side by side comparisons of Vanilla W11 and this new OS would this be considered a fork or branch for lack of a better term in testing to see how much of the fat theyve been willing to trim Im not optimistic but its at least a step in the right direction My guess is theyll get rid of the more obvious inyourface bloat the average user recognizes but the litany of background shit and excessive data collection is something I very much doubt MS will get rid of Hell if Edge stops opening up every fucking time it updates despite not being my default browser at all Ill give them half a point a full point may even be in order for being able to remove Edge all together If theres anything outside of a negligible improvement ie a few percent whether its memory CPU load total processesservices active etc Ill be shocked I feel like something á la TinyXPTiny7 anyone remember those days is needed for there to be a noticeable difference Whether thats something achieved by MS or the community depends entirely on how well MS delivers on this project,mwp11g3,1.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwq9lrv,ABetterKamahl1234,,20,2025-06-08 22:00:19,,,,Im not optimistic but its at least a step in the right direction Its likely the Xbox OS with some addons Which itself is a stripped down Windows OS IIRC This is likely separating it from being a console exclusive OS,mwpa55l,2.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwqy3dd,NLight7,,11,2025-06-09 00:22:45,,,,It is reported as being W11 with an Xbox app running on it with the console style navigation So no it is not the Xbox OS running on it,mwq9lrv,3.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwqns5t,Fate_Creator,,8,2025-06-08 23:21:29,,,,Xbox OS is a modified version of Windows Server,mwq9lrv,3.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mxletzp,Velgus,,1,2025-06-13 17:06:10,,,,new OS would this be considered a fork or branch for lack of a better term Few days late replying to this but its not a new OS or fork or anything like that as far as Ive understood from what Ive read but rather a mode that will be bootable Likely something you can toggle on and off in the settings as something Windows 11 boots into or you can manually enter it from the standard Windows 11 desktop So basically the same idea as SteamOS with its Gaming Mode vs KDE Desktop They claim substantial resource improvements but Id take it with a grain of salt Its likely just an extension of the alreadyexisting Game Mode toggle in Windows which claims to disable background apps when running a game but doesnt really have much effect The bigger news is mostly just a fully supported controllercentric UX whereas currently using controllers to navigate Windows is like pulling teeth,mwpa55l,2.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwpx2zc,NecroCannon,,13,2025-06-08 20:53:21,,,,I just want a console PC at this point like at these prices give me something with console usability but I can still do school work on Im pretty sure theres a good sized market for that considering that building a PC is a massive hurdle and the average person isnt going to know what a 4060 even is but is interested probably because of streamers and lets plays Or people like me where Im not into gaming enough to justify spending 1k on something just to future proof for a generation,mwpek5o,2.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwq0lq5,NecroCannon,,11,2025-06-08 21:11:51,,,,MAN what I keep saying that we need a new Steam Machine it really came too soon with the amount of chips now specifically made for handhelds slap one of those in a box optimize Steam OS and with how much I love the Deck its a definite preorder from me The main reason I dont just get a mini pc is because theyre pretty damn expensive for what you get The Steam Deck still has yet to be beat in value,mwpzx79,4.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwqgl7j,Tsuki4735,,5,2025-06-08 22:40:19,,,,The main reason I dont just get a mini pc is because theyre pretty damn expensive for what you get The Steam Deck still has yet to be beat in value I dunno you can nowadays find a mini PC with a 6800u for 330 USD and that is noticeably more powerful than a Steam Deck Throw on SteamOS hook it up to a TV and you got a modern day Steam Machine Meanwhile the cheapest Steam Deck is 399 for the LCD model,mwq0lq5,5.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwqlih4,NecroCannon,,0,2025-06-08 23:08:32,,,,Its actually more at 429 And just think how cheap it can be with larger manufacturing and the same cost eating the Deck has along with great optimization specifically for that device It would still be a better value even at the same price as that without a Prime membership support on most of those mini PCs are lackluster its why Im eyeing a MacBook Mini for a mini PC I could actually reliably daily,mwqgl7j,6.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwqm4c6,Tsuki4735,,3,2025-06-08 23:12:01,,,,Hrm I was seeing the Amazon Prime price which is 330 USD Fair point but even at 430 its only 30 more than a Deck for better performance etc,mwqlih4,7.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwtc2cu,NecroCannon,,1,2025-06-09 11:41:08,,,,Youre kinda losing the whole point of me saying console PC pushing a regular mini PC Yes you can even build computers that are slightly more than whatever console youre targeting that still leaves out the console experience that still leaves out a device that can have games optimized for nearly a generation So value per dollar a steam machine would do a lot better than a shady company with reviews mentioning how theres a lack of support Conversations like this is why its hard to pull console players to PC think simple its like trying to get CEOs to understand that people dont care about the stuff they talk about when they just want their stuff to work Its not about well price and chip wise Id get this do you get the Steam Deck experience thats pushing Linux forward as a platform with this no name mini pc,mwqm4c6,8.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwtsjo8,Tsuki4735,,2,2025-06-09 13:25:15,,,,that still leaves out the console experience Err and thats why I said you can install SteamOS on it For more context official SteamOS is actually using standard Linux open source drivers theres no special sauce that Valve is doing in that department SteamOS adds a fancy UI up front but everything else is standard open source stuff So if the hardware is compatible SteamOS will run on it just like a Steam Deck So you can absolutely get the exact same console experience on a compatible mini PC I only say this because I already run SteamOS on nonDeck but Linuxcompatible hardware and I can tell you right now the experience is the same as the Deck I have a Steam Machine right now hooked up to my OLED TV that has completely replaced my PS5,mwtc2cu,9.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwu1qn5,NecroCannon,,1,2025-06-09 14:15:10,,,,Err and you just lost the casual market you gotta think outside of the tech enthusiast bubble dude the whole industry thats building up is and knows theyre not caring about installing things outside of games not wanting to have to tweak constantly or deal with the same hoops and hurdles we know about Like Im trying to explain the market theyre appealing to and youre still going well just do hobbyist stuff,mwtsjo8,10.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwu35ld,Tsuki4735,,1,2025-06-09 14:22:24,,,,Err and you just lost the casual market you gotta think outside of the tech enthusiast bubble dude Note that I didnt say a single thing about the casual market The entire time I was responding to your original comment The main reason I dont just get a mini pc is because theyre pretty damn expensive for what you get The Steam Deck still has yet to be beat in value All I was saying is that mini PCs are competitive with the Deck in terms of value especially if you factor in SteamOS into the mix,mwu1qn5,11.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwu4bvd,NecroCannon,,1,2025-06-09 14:28:20,,,,Yeah I want something with good support and an actual quality product those mini PCs on amazon all have iffy reviews on the lower end,mwu35ld,12.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwu59x0,Tsuki4735,,2,2025-06-09 14:33:01,,,,I think you wanting a more reputable brand is perfectly reasonable Again I was just saying that there are mini PCs on the market already that are competitive with the Deck in terms of value If the brand is not your preference thats fine But thats different from saying competitive options dont exist,mwu4bvd,13.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwtahc4,ToMorrowsEnd,,2,2025-06-09 11:29:37,,,,you can have one now itx motherboard and some of the very small cases are console sized buy the parts and build it Its how I have a dedicated steam console in the living room,mwpx2zc,3.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwtcgrw,NecroCannon,,1,2025-06-09 11:44:00,,,,Still not the console experience until I can just buy a box and play on it Think prebuilt but actually optimized for with decent specs I get this is the gadget sub but not everyone wants to get into hardware like that which is the appeal of an official steam machine I got hobbies that take that time over,mwtahc4,4.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwuf2ce,Kycrio,,3,2025-06-09 15:20:19,,,,I have a rog ally that came with windows 11 installed Windows 11 is a flaming dumpster fire for a gaming console Every time I pick it up to play some baldurs gate 3 windows pesters me about setting up copilot and onedrive No windows I dont need copilot and onedrive to improve my productivity on my game console It also forces me to use a pin or password to log in to the device but the os is so trash that sometimes it just hangs forever on the log in screen and I have to reboot it I really dont need to protect my game console from unauthorized users windows its not like I do my taxes on it I really really hope that the new Xbox os is available for the previous rog ally consoles,mwp11g3,1.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwsdg7x,OlorinDK,,10,2025-06-09 06:23:53,,,,4 key takeaways for me 1 Its running Windows but with a new fullscreen launcher mode that also kills a lot of background processes 2 It frees up 2 GB of memory for games 3 It uses one third of the power in standby mode when activated while in launcher mode compared to to normal desktop mode R Its coming to other handhelds at the beginning of next year Im wondering if itll come to normal desktop laptop and even tablet PCs too at some point Who wouldnt want that extra performance Might not be for everyone but would be good to have the choice And honestly would have liked to see something like it for tablets where youd be able to run tablet apps without the extra bloat of unnecessary background processes but you could always switch to desktop and have the full experience,mwplej3,4.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwq03p7,JoviAMP,,13,2025-06-08 21:09:13,,,,Yes but this would be an official shell replacement so what I want to know is if they plan to try keeping it exclusive to authorized handheld OEMs or if Id be able to utilize it on a custom mini ITX PC paired with an Xbox controller and connected to my TV without having to resort to workarounds,mwpw9vf,5.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwsa4e7,Dt2_0,,2,2025-06-09 05:53:26,,,,It depends If there is a native PC version on the Xbox store it should be in the Play Anywhere program and you should be able to download the native PC version If there is no PC version or the publisher doesnt allow Play Anywhere for whatever reason it would need to be streamed I fully expect Microsoft to require any game on Xbox that also advertises a PC version must be in the Play Anywhere program to make sure this becomes less and less of an issue over time Its already not a huge issue as most Xbox games with PC ports are already Play Anywhere titles,mwq81rs,1.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwoud75,MultiMarcus,,84,2025-06-08 17:36:53,,,,I think the biggest disappointment here are the lack of FSR 4 since this is a Z2 chip and not some sort of RDNA 4 chip and it not being OLED I still think that the steam deck two is what Im going to be looking at in the future and one of these products but Ive really been liking the work Asus has been doing so far I just really hope we get better screens and a better chip eventually but that might just be something I have to wait a couple of years for,,0.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwpgq67,MultiMarcus,,12,2025-06-08 19:28:51,,,,Sure but Valve and Microsoft or exactly the type of companies I think would be able to get a custom APU from AMD That might be a way for Valve or Microsoft to distinguish themselves from the rest of the handheld competition Or arguably catch up to Nintendo since they have DLSS now,mwpd796,2.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwphb04,NiteShdw,,10,2025-06-08 19:31:53,,,,Valve and Microsoft both already have custom APUs from AMD But custom APUs take many years and are basically built from existing technology with some tweaks Im certain that AMD is working on an APU with RDNA4 but it could be a while before they are ready,mwpgq67,3.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwpielz,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-06-08 19:37:41,,,,Sure which is why I mentioned that I might have to wait a couple of years The PS5 Pro has PSSR and can supposedly run some form of FSR 4 and that is obviously already out I dont think it would be ridiculous to see an FSR 4 capable handheld early next year or so,mwphb04,4.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwqgls7,NiteShdw,,1,2025-06-08 22:40:25,,,,I had to search up PSSR Its possible that their custom GPU included some tech similar to what AMD included in RDNA4 Maybe it was something they were already working on or maybe they leveraged the work they did for Sony for bring it to the masses,mwpielz,5.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mws9nfq,Dt2_0,,1,2025-06-09 05:49:15,,,,Significant performance boost at a price similar to the current Deck ASUS has the Ryzen AI MAX 395 in the Flow Tablets That chip is an absolute monster but is hella expensive AMD claims it can beat out a 4070 in raw Raster Performance but I think they are talking about Laptop 4070s not the Desktop card Still beating out well specd gaming laptops with a chip like that is great It just is way too expensive right now to be feasible for the Deck,mwp5yb8,3.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwsiuww,Critical_Impact,,3,2025-06-09 07:14:49,,,,Id say if you want to play the latest AAA unoptimized games then yeah you might be out of luck but its surprising what you can actually play on it If you really want to know if the games youre thinking about playing are playable pop on over to protondb and look up the game and filter by steam deck Example These are basically user recommendations on what to do to get the best performance but I find once you have protonGE installed and set as your default you can just fire games up and theyll work fine 95 of the time,mwrolio,2.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwsj9eq,Critical_Impact,,1,2025-06-09 07:18:41,,,,Coming from someone on the valve side of the fence I would assume the primary benefit is the ability to use gamepass Would mean a high initial commitment cost but a low monthly cost if you dont expect to being gaming a huge amount The downside is that gamepass does have a sliding window for games so some do get rotated out of the catalog Performance as well this is 45 years after the SD was initially released so youll have a potentially better time on newer games Also it runs windows so kernel level anticheat is more than likely more supported If you arent playing AAA games and dont have any games with kernel level anticheat I still think the SD is the better price proposition and experience,mwqzf1w,1.0,1l6hj0f
comment,mwp8fzt,Onetimehelper,,3,2025-06-08 18:46:56,,,,From hx370 handhelds that have the same 890 GPU Im expecting on average a 10 increase over the current best Z1E implementation which is the Ally X Not bad if youre coming from steam deck or the OG Ally But I would wait on reviews The design is iffy too Like a wider portal Too much space between the edges to the actual screen Portal is actually a good balance If my opinion matters usually doesnt would get an open box Ally X and wait and see what the next gen has Personally waiting for OLED HDR VRR 8inches RDNA 4or DLSS 3 hour battery life on intensive games like Cyberpunk and easy dockability greater than 30 improvement on Z1E at 1080 or 1200p 60fps locked Ray tracing High Cyberpunk with quality upscaling Under 1000 Feel like were almost there From seeing what GTA6 can look like on a base PS5 have a feeling that devs will start optimizing for current gen hardware a lot better now to stay competitive and that may prolong the life of Z1EZ2E and can mean that Z3 or Z4 might actually be console replacements like the switch is for Nintendo Time will tell Feel free to criticize or add to this,,0.0,1l6hj0f

comment,mwp64p5,Fredasa,,-5,2025-06-08 18:35:16,,,,A few things First Nintendo is knocking on their door willynilly Core consoles as epitomized by MSSony stopped offering anything over PCs by the end of the Xbox 360 era and have depreciated conspicuously with each gen since Nintendos Switch 2 is now very nearly a competitor in a space Nintendo deliberately abandoned with the advent of the Wii and this is underscored by the likes of From Software making their next major game exclusive to Nintendo The two audiences are officially recombining thanks entirely to the everdiminishing relative power of traditional core consoles Second Microsoft has understood the path forward quite well and they have been taking advantage of their unique position as the merchants of Windows to establish the only kind of platform that makes sense in a world where consoles can never again catch up with PCs Third Sony exclusives are increasingly anomalous and one would have a hard time arguing that a large proportion of console users buy a Playstation specifically and only to play games that are exclusive to the platform Capcom and others are leading the charge to the inevitable and the payoff is obvious with more than half of Capcoms revenue generated from PC sales Within this context the entire point of a non portable console unavoidably blurs and the biggest remaining appeal of anything nonportable is how it stacks up against PCs as a value prospectwhich itself gets strained by the reality of how much more can be done on an open platform including upcoming devices that support SteamOS If Sony were to make another traditional core console without portability they would realistically have no choice but to allow SteamOS and Gamepass on their device On that note I also fully expect them to establish their own Gamepass clone that works well on Steamdeck and Windows,mwp2guq,2.0,1l6hj0f
