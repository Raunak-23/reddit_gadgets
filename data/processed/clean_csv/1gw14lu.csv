post,1gw14lu,Sariel007,Neuromorphic Camera Helps Drones Navigate GPS-free. High-end positioning tech comes to low-cost UAVs.,1057,2024-11-20 22:51:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1gw14lu/neuromorphic_camera_helps_drones_navigate_gpsfree/,42.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,ly6uzor,None,,27,2024-11-21 02:44:31,,,,Pretty interesting but Id like to see its implementation The general consensus of the article seems to be accurate I researched positioning systems for my uncles prototype grass printer that can print images like on the end zone of a football field and came to the same conclusion Getting three dimensional millimeterprecision positioning is expensive and generally needs two or more outer reference points This would reduce it to one source point and if they are able to reduce the cost while maintaining accuracy were about to see a crap ton more drones,,0.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly7zmt5,danielv123,,10,2024-11-21 08:05:45,,,,Mm level is hard but for grass printing wouldnt 2cm do That can be achieved with a 500 gpsrtk kit,ly6uzor,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly809wg,None,,10,2024-11-21 08:12:39,,,,We were using 1 sq inch cym dots for the pixels and a of 5cm skewed the image too much We were wanting to compete with the traditional model of using stencils so emphasis on clean lines and the traction on the wheels accurately positioning required something a bit more accurate We checked out the gpsrtf kit but it was out of budget and deemed not to fit the engineering reqs lol,ly7zmt5,2.0,1gw14lu

comment,ly8m00m,Option420s,,-7,2024-11-21 11:59:38,,,,Right since it was developed by the brits itll be used to explode Palestinian kindergartens instead of Ukrainian ones,ly6cafw,2.0,1gw14lu
comment,lyacohj,paradoxbound,,2,2024-11-21 18:46:41,,,,Possibly but not likely the Israeli government and military get most of their arms funding from the USA in the form of tied aid so most of their military spending from foreign countries goes to the USA Though again there is a lot of cross technology licensing between allied countries so again maybe Though most of Israels hostile neighbours lack the ability to jam gps,ly8m00m,3.0,1gw14lu

comment,lyanc6f,paradoxbound,,0,2024-11-21 19:39:49,,,,Neither do the Hamas soldiers using them as shields which is why gps guided artillery and glide bombs and mass starvation are the right choice for Israels goals in Gaza,lyaef0g,5.0,1gw14lu
comment,lyem3mv,Option420s,,0,2024-11-22 12:34:11,,,,Israel literally has a drone that follows hamas members to their homes so their families can be killed too They specifically target children Theyre not being used as human shields as you say theyre being used as target practice by israelis Youre fucking insane if you think mass starvation is the right choice Theyre human beings,lyanc6f,6.0,1gw14lu
comment,lyfa7ah,paradoxbound,,1,2024-11-22 15:07:19,,,,Why are you getting so mad at me for stating the facts dispassionately Russia and the Ukraine are at war The state of Israel and enclaves of the Palestinian people are at war This article is about a development of new missile and drone technology that allows them to operate when gps is unavailable You then stated that because it is British it is going to be used to target Palestinian children I dont follow the logic there but I can extrapolate from the article my own knowledge and knowledgeable comments on it that it is unlikely but possible that it would be a tool that the Israeli military would need in their arsenal against Palestinians As I stated their current weapons are more effective tried tested and economical Stating this information doesnt in any way imply approval or disapproval of any side of any military conflict or their tactics My conversation here is a discussion about a technology and its deployment in theatres of operations not the morality or justification of given sides in a conflict,lyem3mv,7.0,1gw14lu

comment,lydnwyz,Huckdog720027,,2,2024-11-22 06:49:43,,,,War is a major way that technology advances unfortunately or not Aircraft design advanced by leaps and bounds as a direct result of their effectiveness world war 1 and 2 if those wars hadnt happened modern day aircraft probably wouldnt be as advanced as they are And there are TONS of other examples of things we take for granted in the modern day that only got developed because of their uses for the military war The Internet is another huge example and so are computers arguably Sundowner unfortunately had some sort of a point in Metal Gear Rising as terrible as war is it technically has done a lot for us Its just that the negatives of war outweigh the positives for most people even if they dont realise how much they would lose if wars were never a thing,ly5w7jc,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly69e5g,DenormalHuman,,41,2024-11-21 00:35:15,,,,Neuromotohic camera sounds like a fancy name for a basic principle of video compression if its as simple as the article suggests Only generating data from pixels whos values change beyond a given threshold,,0.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly79f3m,anders987,,32,2024-11-21 04:15:27,,,,Theyre usually called event cameras if you want to read more about them Heres an explanation from one of the main experts in the world And heres a fairly long tutorial by another expert on how they work Basically they have a wider dynamic range much lower latency so no motion blur and send changes in the image asynchronously instead of one frame at the time,ly69e5g,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly6lnst,New2ThisThrowaway,,31,2024-11-21 01:50:09,,,,Its similar but the difference is efficiency In the classic method each uncompressed frame is transferred to a separate processor for compression In a neuromotohic camera this is all done on a single chip at the point of capture The process is far more efficient resulting in a lot more image processing per watt with lower size and weight,ly69e5g,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly6q1jn,Chagrinnish,,12,2024-11-21 02:15:40,,,,Thats my understanding as well but it still sounds crippled An optical mouse performs the same type of optical flow recognition albeit on a small 100 pixel scale with the movement being readable from the chip without ever seeing the picture And hobby quadcopters already implement that type of sensor,ly6lnst,2.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly82chq,charlesdarwinandroid,,4,2024-11-21 08:35:52,,,,The difference in efficiency largely comes from not having to send a full frame at the desired frame rate The pixels still use a very similar amount of power in fact at the pixel level the neuromorphic likely takes a bit more However because youre only sending the difference pixels it can be really efficient Im using them for a project at work and they are going to be very useful for quite a few things,ly6lnst,2.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly93uql,sanjosanjo,,3,2024-11-21 14:04:17,,,,The article links to a description of that term which I had never heard before The first image on the page gives an example of what it does Later in the article they explain how the circuitry to do this is being optimized for power,ly69e5g,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly7mamm,Agouti,,6,2024-11-21 05:54:24,,,,This is a good change if it makes it to low cost drones as predicted Usually how you pull position and orientation data from cameras is by tracking edges through looking for contrast changes and tracking with a Kalman filter or such but processing the images is often pretty computationally costly Its pretty easy for a proper SoC though theres still tradeoffs for fps but even you quickly run out of processing power on most cheap ATMEGA style chips Being able to get edge detection straight out of the camera would trivialise it,,0.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly944dw,sanjosanjo,,1,2024-11-21 14:05:56,,,,This article has a quick example of this type of camera It definitely looks like edge detection and they explain how the circuitry is optimized for low power,ly7mamm,1.0,1gw14lu
comment,ly97ukb,Agouti,,2,2024-11-21 14:28:16,,,,Oh that image up the top is just perfect its everything you could want and in low light conditions to boot You can even infer 3d information from it for mapping,ly944dw,2.0,1gw14lu

comment,ly6l5jf,OutInABlazeOfGlory,,-7,2024-11-21 01:47:12,,,,NILEQ a subsidiary of British missilemaker MBDA based in Bristol UK makes a lowpower visual navigation system that relies on neuromorphic cameras This will now be integrated with a fiber opticbased INS developed by Advanced Navigation in Sydney Australia to create a positioning system that lets lowcost drones navigate reliably without GPS Imagine what could be done with this sort of thing and then realize its going to be used to kill civilians in genocidal campaigns the world over,,0.0,1gw14lu

comment,ly98krj,Xendrus,,0,2024-11-21 14:32:32,,,,Makes you wonder if a LLMAI could replace basic GPS by acting like rainbolt Oh that type of grass and bush and sign are only in this area together the suns location based on shadows and etc and know where you are and need no satellite communication,,0.0,1gw14lu

comment,lyaz7u4,ilyich_commies,,1,2024-11-21 20:40:22,,,,I should also add that this problem is widely considered unsolved and that the same neural network architectures used for LLMs can indeed be used to improve SLAM models,lyaj5vi,3.0,1gw14lu
