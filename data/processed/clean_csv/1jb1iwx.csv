comment,mhvgox2,NorCalAthlete,,1,2025-03-15 04:37:12,,,,What model specs What are the biggest differences that you think dont measure up to actual screens What do you mainly use it for Id love to have something where I can hook up my PC and couch game do work and watch TV movies all in one but I know thats kind of like asking for a unicorn and theres always tradeoffs,mhvfpt0,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhvhlin,IGingerbreadman,,2,2025-03-15 04:44:39,,,,Its a Dell S718QL Projector Got it second hand for 35K Its been a blast The only thing I wish for is being better in lots of light New home has tons Also its great that you can just place it on an entertainment center and dont have to mount it but it also always there and in the way sort of speaking The screen is what makes it amazing The cancelling of light from above and the sides It only throws back the image from the projector Its a giant matte screen I may miss that May hate glares once I move on to just a tv Dont game too much but Im sure you can find reviews measuring lag This particular unit is super bright The fan kicking on wont be missed Its the screen that makes it theatre like Would recommend under low light to no light A normal projector only in no light The other thing is that ust arent getting vastly better This is a 4k unit and it is amazing I dont think the processors on these have been getting better as quickly Some 4k units are only up scaling 1080p somehow These need to get smaller and quieter to keep warranting a purchase TVs will eat up the xxl market soon,mhvgox2,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhvi6p0,NorCalAthlete,,1,2025-03-15 04:49:32,,,,I had a 1080p projector back in the day and yeah the fan was super annoying if there was a quiet scene in a movie or something I wonder if you could mitigate that somehow Additional cooling system or something or build a case for it that exhausts into a wiring closet atticand relocate the fan to like a heat pump fan that pulls way more CFM,mhvhlin,7.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhvjrdj,IGingerbreadman,,2,2025-03-15 05:02:56,,,,What I used to do to pcs is put bigger fans that were quieter Even if they werent variable theyd run cooler at any given time Can add ducting haha Its not bad at all in eco mode this one Only spins up with hdr where it uses max brightness,mhvi6p0,8.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhvl4yq,NorCalAthlete,,1,2025-03-15 05:14:58,,,,I was thinking step 1 is swap out the usually shitty and cheap internal fan for a noctua or something then splice in an additional larger fan Ducting optional after that But also even just giving the whole thing some dense rubber padding around the top of the entertainment center might help Sound deadening,mhvjrdj,9.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhsb0te,Freodrick,,6,2025-03-14 17:54:37,,,,I just feel comfortable with 55 in the space i use it in It works well so its the size I like to view things by myself or as a group Idk I just really dont see a reason for anything larger than 65 for home use maybe cause my home is limited in space,mhs6stz,3.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mht6srr,edvek,,1,2025-03-14 20:36:13,,,,I dont follow any of this tech but if thats true maybe they figured out the costs Im sure it will be expensive but maybe inline with what you would expect Plus if this goes forward it might drive OLED prices down to get people to buy that,mhssqbg,4.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhtnjw6,FoodExisting8405,,1,2025-03-14 21:59:00,,,,Im still not sure I understand the concept tbh Cuz like imagine a Lisa frank image Youd need the backlight resolution to be on par with the LCD itself At that point just use OLED,mht6srr,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhqgdag,VampyreLust,,109,2025-03-14 12:09:13,,,,Could be sooo OLED is still the go to then I remember bout 5 years ago now when I was buying a tv everyone was convinced that OLED was going to be usurped by MicroLED panels the next year telling people to hold off of OLED and they werent going to be crazy expensive etc Yah still waiting for that to happen,,0.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrqmfd,LurkerPatrol,,41,2025-03-14 16:17:19,,,,Yeah I bought an OLED TV when it was on a deep sale at Best Buy and have never looked back Everything looks so good on it from YouTube to full fledged HDR and Dolby vision movies and TV shows Its unmatched,mhqgdag,1.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhrxm8z,VampyreLust,,9,2025-03-14 16:50:49,,,,It is definitely one of those technologies that ruins you against other tech technologies I bought a C8 for my home theatre about five years ago and I can never go back I do however still use an IPS display for my desktop because although I tested OLED and QDOLED displays I just couldnt get past the text phasing,mhrw62m,3.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhsavq7,er-day,,5,2025-03-14 17:53:55,,,,I just upgraded my parents from a C8 to a C3 and the difference is pretty stunning Modern oleds have come a long way as well Their old oled however had some seriously bad burn in,mhrxm8z,4.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhsjl3w,VampyreLust,,1,2025-03-14 18:41:10,,,,Thats interesting because mine has no burnin whatsoever I fully expected it to happen when I bought it and spent the money anyways but none I guess it heavily depends on how you watch it I use it for streaming no cable tv so very few logos like CNN and such,mhsavq7,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhyqxm6,er-day,,2,2025-03-15 18:58:03,,,,Yeah it was the long hours of logo tv They loved the today show every morning and the music channel at night with strong bars of color that didnt move Mix up what you watch and it likely wont be a problem,mhsjl3w,6.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhsg9ym,North_South_Side,,3,2025-03-14 18:23:56,,,,Had ours for 2 years now No symptoms of burn in or anything else Best looking tv weve ever seen We maxed out our space with a 65 inch but in our dedicated tv room it is spectacular Im not ruling out that it will not be surpassed by some new technology eventually But half of what we stream is lower than 4k and I just dont see widespread adoption of 8k anytime soon,mhrqmfd,2.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhvssd7,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-03-15 06:26:07,,,,Its unmatched in ideal conditions Too much light and an OLED is no longer so great I just recently moved my Sony A90K out of my living room and replaced it with a mini LED because I got tired of the constant glare from the windows,mhrqmfd,2.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhqoia3,Heightren,,12,2025-03-14 13:01:20,,,,It just sounds like OLED with extra steps,mhqgdag,1.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhqwpmc,VampyreLust,,48,2025-03-14 13:48:29,,,,Its not because its the best of both worlds infinite contrast like OLED but also 5000 nits of brightness like an LCD its the same tech they use for outdoor displays in places like Times Square but in a much much smaller form factor so each pixel is its own very small LED as I understand it Shows like The Mandelorian are filmed on a sound stage with a huge curved one instead of greenscreen because its just that lifelike and theyre modular so theyre easily fixed like this Buuuut the last time I saw a price was at CES in Feb and it was a 75 one for around 90k so realistically were still years away from those being in homes if they actually ever are,mhqoia3,2.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhr0b55,iouli,,-2,2025-03-14 14:07:47,,,,By the time this technology will become mainstream OLEDs will surpass 95 of every cinephiles needs Heck this year alone OLEDs have reached 2500 nits in peak brightness Every year the OLED technology is evolving so I expect in 5 years time to be significantly cheaper than Sonys new tech and with no obvious drawbacks,mhqwpmc,3.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhr0lm6,WFlumin8,,35,2025-03-14 14:09:18,,,,OLED is expensive to produce and it will continue to be expensive to produce because of the nature of its manufacturing MicroLED WILL replace OLED as it advances because it has none of the drawbacks burn in manufacturing cost low brightness and all of its advantages,mhr0b55,4.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrlhbv,VampyreLust,,11,2025-03-14 15:52:36,,,,MicroLED is much more expensive to produce than OLED each LED pixel has to be placed by robots individually which is what the current and past high cost of them has been from Just like 5 years ago there were people convinced that MicroLED would replace OLED but I dont know they havent yet and technologies that reduce burnin have gotten a lot better Its mainly the brightness and the degradation of the organic matter in OLEDs that MicroLED solves but if they cant reduce the manufacturing cost by over 90 it will never compete,mhr0lm6,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhucaa2,hope_it_helps,,1,2025-03-15 00:16:23,,,,I recently read up on porotech and what they seem to have achieved with microLED sounds like were about to stop having to place pixels via robots Although they dont seem to be targeting the monitor and TV market but rather micro displays and such,mhrlhbv,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrn36a,ElectronicMoo,,-1,2025-03-14 16:00:14,,,,Organic matter Oled doesnt also need robots placing led individually Not facetious actual questions I know nothing of the latest formats I buy cheap roku enabled tvs in 4k and not a cinephile that notices the specifics,mhrlhbv,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrp3zj,Powerful-Parsnip,,19,2025-03-14 16:10:02,,,,Organic is what the O stands for,mhrn36a,7.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrsjp9,VampyreLust,,16,2025-03-14 16:26:35,,,,No they actually print them onto the substrate in a similar way to how inkjet printers work so it can be done quickly and cheaply vs a robot placing each individual led And as the person below or above me said the O in OLED is Organic Organic polymers are used in several if the layers that make up each OLED pixel,mhrn36a,7.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhtpuqp,ElectronicMoo,,2,2025-03-14 22:11:29,,,,Interesting Ill do some reading this weekend Thanks for the cliff notes,mhrsjp9,8.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhtjn6n,HaMMeReD,,4,2025-03-14 21:38:21,,,,I dont think Ill ever be convinced that OLED has the lifespan of a LCD I expect that everyone who buys a OLED today will have some level of burn in or nonuniformity in their display in 5 years But I guess if you plan on replacing your screen every 35 years OLED is great,mhr0b55,4.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhtstol,CatProgrammer,,2,2025-03-14 22:27:39,,,,Depends entirely on usage habits panel settings and what content you display,mhtjn6n,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mi1frdx,orangpelupa,,1,2025-03-16 04:35:49,,,,Uniformity changes quickly happens tho It does gets better every time the TV did its self maintenance thing But between the self maintenance sessions the uniformity changes At least thats in my LG CX OLED 55 Oh and in around 2 years its edges starts to have dead pixels No other issue No noticeable burn in too,mhtstol,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mi81vrm,iouli,,1,2025-03-17 07:17:53,,,,Ive had my LG OLED for four and a half years without any issues whatsoever I primarily use it for YouTube and streaming movies with mixed content If youre watching a news channel 247 with rolling text then yes youre likely to experience some burnin However the reality is that 90 of OLED users are wellinformed about the strengths and limitations of the technology and purchase them without any problems Im active in OLED forums where gamers use their displays at high luminance for HDR gaming without issues as well As for lifespan you can comfortably use a modern OLED display for ten years without concern The technology has advanced significantly and most burnin issues from early generations have been largely minimized Unfortunately these socalled issues are often exaggerated in the media by nonusers leading people to believe that OLEDs are still plagued by burnin and low luminance drawbackswhen in reality they are not,mhtjn6n,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mi82hif,HaMMeReD,,1,2025-03-17 07:24:28,,,,You can say that to me but I literally have a ton of burn in on my C1 Which is only about 3 years old now at least since I bought it The taskbar teams my IDEs they all have commonstatic elements If I only played gamesvideos maybe Id think different but they have really started scorching some areas of my screen Its still usable but its very apparent especially in the task bar area I was aware of the limitations when I bought it also largely because people are like its a nonissue and the screen cleaning makes it like new Yeah until it doesnt,mi81vrm,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mi8dimi,iouli,,1,2025-03-17 09:26:59,,,,sorry to hear that can you post a picture whenever possible to show it to my friend who alos has a C1 and playing a lot of HDR gaming on PS5 with no issues Thanks,mi82hif,7.0,1jb1iwx
comment,miansvs,HaMMeReD,,1,2025-03-17 17:49:14,,,,But you can see pretty clearly the pattern teams taskbar reddit Then the big blob in the center Like I do acknowledge as a living room TV I would probably not be complaining because the TV is for dynamic content But if static content is expected in your day to day you will eventually burn in just like this So personally not a huge fan of OLED for Monitors When this gets replaced itll probably be a LCD of some kind However when I upgrade my living room TV I may very well go some variant of OLED,mi8dimi,8.0,1jb1iwx
comment,miego31,iouli,,1,2025-03-18 07:38:03,,,,Wow thats nasty I just bought a sh Asus Zenbook with an OLED display and it is clean as a whistle But I thing its luminance limited and hides some other tricks for not getting burnin given its monitor purpose first,miansvs,9.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhsfc7o,fvck_u_spez,,3,2025-03-14 18:18:16,,,,Not all TVs but many I have had IPS TVs before And from data I have seen on RTINGS while it can be a problem on VA panels it is much more noticeable on OLED Edit Looks like I was thinking of TN VA does indeed have flicker too So maybe not as relevant for TVs but definitely a consideration for monitors I frequently notice flicker on my new OLED display whereas I never once noticed flicker on the 170hz IPS display that I upgraded from,mhscpv1,5.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhsgc31,Successful_Way2846,,0,2025-03-14 18:24:17,,,,I bet if you turned the brightness up on your OLED to match the black levels of your IPS panel you wouldnt have any flicker on it either,mhsfc7o,6.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhr24rh,WFlumin8,,37,2025-03-14 14:17:19,,,,Low frame rate stutter isnt a con its actually just a side effect of having perfect response time Standard LED smears frames together motion blur which is why it looks smoother but inaccurate,mhqmtbd,3.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhrew0x,proanimus,,24,2025-03-14 15:20:52,,,,Is this why 30fps games look harsher and more stuttery to me on my OLED TV compared to LCD I noticed it immediately but could never really describe what I was seeing,mhr24rh,4.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhw6j2c,whilst,,2,2025-03-15 08:54:54,,,,Youre using quotation marks but youre not quoting me or even paraphrasing Generations of filmmakers can be in love with an art form as it exists and making great art within the language and limitations of that art form And still limiting themselves because better technology exists but does a thing that isnt what gives them joy and exists within their tradition and because the industry is built for 24fps Peter Jackson tried and still many theaters couldnt play his Hobbit films at his preferred 48fps And a lot of moviegoers hated it and about them I can easily say its because its not what theyre used to I continue to hold that a generation could grow up only having seen 48fps or higher and hate the old 24fps films and produce a new crop of directors that felt the same,mhur3vk,6.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhw96my,Realistic_Condition7,,1,2025-03-15 09:24:10,,,,But why is what youre used to an irrelevant argument Less frames has a visual effect the same way more frames has a visual affect I feel like a generation of gamers where fps is directly tied to how responsive a game is and thus how well you can perform at it has trained people to think that there is nothing to gain from lower fps Again go and watch the actual filmmaking content out there It boils down to a lot more than just limiting themselves because of tradition see there I quoted what you actually said,mhw6j2c,7.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhw9pvo,whilst,,1,2025-03-15 09:30:03,,,,I didnt say it was an irrelevant argument I said the reason that filmmakers wont try higher framerates is its not what theyre used to Less frames has a visual effect certainly so So why isnt it used as a visual effect ie something used some of the time rather than simply being how all films are made Its not a choice if its everything I feel like a generation of gamers where fps is directly tied to how responsive a game is and thus how well you can perform at it has trained people to think that there is nothing to gain from lower fps Im not a gamer But it sounds like we agree a generation is growing up finding low fps visually unpleasant Hopefully that produces the film directors who feel similarly with time It boils down to a lot more than just limiting themselves because of tradition see there I quoted what you actually said Okay What is it if not tradition Because if its a stylistic choice its certainly not a choice Its what every movie with almost no exceptions does Youd think an art form would at least sometimes vary the parameters of its medium and the fact that this one is sacrosanct smacks of tradition and dogma Especially since the few attempts to change it have fallen flat because of industry inertia,mhw96my,8.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhwcm1u,Realistic_Condition7,,1,2025-03-15 10:01:07,,,,In gaming fps affects your performance that was meant to explain why it is not a 11 comparison As for the rest Im just not even going to bother youre clearly making some off handed points and need to actually go do some research go tell filmmakers to only lower fps as a visual affect see what they say I agree that there actually should be some more variance to framerates in videos but there is a reason it hasnt caught on as some superior standard If it was seriously just flat out superior there would be a bubbling force of filmmakers trying to make HFR film the norm rather than just the odd experiment or specific attempt at a different style of shooting a la the Hobbit,mhw9pvo,9.0,1jb1iwx
comment,mhxyn3f,whilst,,1,2025-03-15 16:32:41,,,,I hear you re going and doing some research But it would have been nice if youd named even one reason why 24fps is inherently preferable in all of this Its like boxing a ghost Im responding to my own experience of 24fps hurts for me especially when theres a pan and it looks like a slideshow It always has Every once in a while theres higherfps content and its like a breath of fresh air So there are some advantages and there is basically nobody catering to that at all and that seems weird And Im very curious if given a real choice for an extended period of time the viewing public would find it preferred 48fps and never look back Right now were not being given a choice and just being told what we should like EDIT And it should be noted that modern TVs tend to insert extra aigenerated frames anyway Cinephiles all know to turn that functionality off because it ruins the directors intent but tv manufacturers wouldnt include that functionality in the first place and leave it on by default if it werent selling TVs Its a suggestion at least that the quiet majority buy it because they think it looks better even if they dont know why Thats signal that it seems like creators should be paying attention to,mhwcm1u,10.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mht1rnp,TheNorthComesWithMe,,5,2025-03-14 20:11:21,,,,OLEDs tick basically all the boxes except they have big longevity issues and lower brightness than competitive LCDs They also have issues with text rendering and a black ghosting effect but those can be solved with drivers and arent exactly problems with the displays themselves LCDs still have all the normal LCD issues The current thing is HDR For most people this means displays that can compete with ambient light while still maintaining contrast and also not having color banding in dark low contrast scenes Also your TV can flashbang you I guess Wide color gamut is the other thing that displays still havent managed to cap out on Id also expect 3D to come back once someone figures out how to make a glassesless 3D display Also collapsible TVs might be a thing at some point since big TVs are kind of an eyesore when you arent watching them,mhrljsr,1.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhutgdn,ICantBeliveUDoneThis,,3,2025-03-15 01:57:15,,,,Somewhat of an expert in this area This isnt really new The reason this hasnt been commercialized has always been cost and scale The article doesnt really talk about the technology but presumably they made some improvements to the manufacturing process It is just another incremental step Nobody has found an easy way to place millions of LEDs in a way that is cost effective enough consumers could afford it yet Sony has shown earlier versions of this I believe it was called Crystal LED and was shown at CES Samsung similarly has been showing The Wall microLED TV for years Believe it or not this tech has been around even longer than that The massive displays you see in stadiums Direct RGB LEDs just like this It has just been prohibitively expensive to scale for general consumers The way in which the image is generated is actually much simpler than LCD This is also the same thing as microLED technology by some definitions I like that they arent using the term microLED because there are actually 2 very different types of display that have both been called microLED and it gets confusing They are differentiated by their manufacturing process This display and Samsungs The Wall marketed as microLED transfer millions of microLEDs from a wafer and spread them out over the display Apple was also working on microLED displays for their devices sadly no longer and their tech would also fall under this first category The second type of microLED display which I personally think should retain the microLED name leaves the microLEDs tightly packed on the wafer and directly bonds them to a backplane This second type of microLED is for very tiny displays even smaller than a watch that will likely be used in future AR glasses There is no official definition of how small the LED has to be before it is called a microLED Even relatively small microLEDs only a few microns wide are plenty bright for a TV The main thing that dictates the microLED size in these large format displays is cost not performance Bigger LEDs use more material and thus cost more There are some papers out there that estimate based on cost even large TVs like this will probably need to use microLEDs about 10 microns wide or less to be meet the bottom line Performance wise it will beat or tie LCD and OLED in just about every way Brightness contrast efficiency lifetime viewing angle refresh rate etc will all be better Color purity is debatable and really depends on the LEDs used But it will cost you,,0.0,1jb1iwx

comment,mhv0kdc,slickrasta,,2,2025-03-15 02:41:00,,,,QDOLED is incredible in terms of brightness and colour I cant see how any brighter would be useful since I already have to turn down my Samsung S90C or else my eyes hurt QDOLED is also a highly scaleable technology so within 5 years itll be one of the more affordable OLED options on the market While this RGB tech does look very cool I wonder how scalable it is for manufacturing and what the end cost will be to consumers,,0.0,1jb1iwx
