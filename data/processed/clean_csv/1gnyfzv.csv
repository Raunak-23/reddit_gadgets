comment,lwfvrp4,tndaris,,20,2024-11-10 17:34:05,,,,I wonder if with enough practice you could figure out a timing where you start throwing paper for example get the robot to assume that and go scissors but then you change to rock Or maybe thats just sort of cheating too,lwfgh2i,3.0,1gnyfzv

comment,lwj9afj,RetailBuck,,1,2024-11-11 04:47:28,,,,Thats a tactic in human vs human too Its not all that hard If its just over who buys the next round of beers its no big deal but competitively you start to get mushy throws A rock that on the slam becomes paper for instance If youre not watching your opponents hand and you dont have a judge for mush you arent really playing RPS,lwfvrp4,4.0,1gnyfzv

comment,lwf9i9j,rtb001,,32,2024-11-10 15:37:29,,,,And as soon as you flatten out your hand it will extend two fingers to make rock into scissors and now you are stuck I would try starting out with rock to force it to make paper and then sticking out two finger at the last slip second to make scissors and the machine would have to turn paper all the way back to rock which would look awkward and fully illustrate its cheating ways,lwf5ywl,2.0,1gnyfzv

comment,lwqkeiy,ditchedmycar,,1,2024-11-12 12:19:24,,,,You wouldnt be able to change your throw multiple times in rps the game is not decided on who is last to finally stop moving and decide on a choice its based on the first throw you made Unless you found a way to cheat if the robot was tricked to making an obvious flip of its choice back to something else it will lose by default via referee The only reason rock is the common use to cheat with is because it can be flattened into paper on the final throw changing it at the last moment If you faked the machine with a rock and it flashed paper it would be impossible to retract two fingers and make scissors without it being noticed no matter how fast it does it because the before is 4 fingers and the after is two less fingers,lwgfnt2,5.0,1gnyfzv

comment,lwgdi7t,Caridor,,1,2024-11-10 19:02:08,,,,I think you can beat it by turning your hand upside down Its probably watching the index and middle fingers primarily If theyre curled inwards youre playing rock so it will throw paper But if youve turned your hand upside down then your upper fingers are actually your pinky and ring finger Youve just throw scissors using your middle and index fingers theyre just on the bottom of the hand,lwecuca,1.0,1gnyfzv

comment,lwhiozz,cutelyaware,,1,2024-11-10 22:29:12,,,,How can it be cheating if its only using the same information that its opponent gets Truth is that AI should still win in the long run even if both sides commit to their moves before they are revealed So it may only win 10 more often than the best human but if matches are scored based on say 50 trials it will still consistently win That just requires a very different bot but thats the kind of thing AI is good at,lwecuca,1.0,1gnyfzv
