comment,mh7zkko,Knubbelwurst,,10,2025-03-11 15:54:56,,,,Typical dust puriciers are a small fan with a filter The fan takes around 15 W depending on the size Typical monitors with 27 go from anywhere 30150 W So it really is marginally small,mh7s4bk,1.0,1j8swar
comment,mhcbslo,MWink64,,2,2025-03-12 05:57:11,,,,Those numbers are a bit off A 15W air filter would be really small and probably not very effective A modern 27 LCD monitor runs in the ballpark of 1030W depending on the brightness,mh7zkko,2.0,1j8swar
comment,mhcz5qz,Knubbelwurst,,1,2025-03-12 10:04:01,,,,rough estimation As said a modern 27 monitor takes anywhere from 30150W Its a wide stretch depending on type features and manufacturer your 1030W is just off A typical 120mm or 140mm computer case fan takes anywhere from 110W usually under 4W Thats more than enough suction power for a filter,mhcbslo,3.0,1j8swar
comment,mhh7v8m,lukasff,,1,2025-03-12 23:48:54,,,,No modern 27 monitor requires 150 W of power Even the site you linked lists a power draw of 50 W for a 30 LCD screen with LED backlighting Even with that power draw it would fall into the worst category G of the EU energy label A quick market research shows that most monitors fall within the categories E and F of the EU energy label In category F a 30 screen is allowed 30 W of power consumption A 27 screen can draw up to 26 W In category E the values are 25 W resp 21 W As an air purifier has to overcome the air resistance of the filter it draws significantly more power than a case fan The values of 3070 W of uelmo85 seem more appropriate here In the end I would argue that the actual ratio is not of importance but rather the additional cost for running the air purifier If we assume the rather low end of the power consumption of 30 W for the air purifier and assume an average usage time of 1 hday of the monitor it will take 11 kWh of additional energy consumption per year With typical electricity prices from Germany that would be less than 4 per year Obviously if you use your monitor more it will be more expensive but youll also have more filtered air And the other way around,mhcz5qz,4.0,1j8swar
comment,mhm1rgx,MWink64,,1,2025-03-13 18:45:13,,,,Were not talking about CRT or plasma displays As I said a modern 27 LCD monitor generally runs in the ballpark of 1030W My numbers arent off Ive literally measured the power draw of more than one,mhcz5qz,4.0,1j8swar

comment,mh7y1a9,Askymojo,,80,2025-03-11 15:47:41,,,,Ionizer purifiers user to be popular in the 90s and early 2000s think Sharper Image but later the research showed they were basically useless at purifying air unless they were powerful enough to produce ozone also which is more damaging to your lungs than anything the ionizer might purify For that reason they are banned in California and no longer popular elsewhere But what an interesting combination a purifier and a monitor Asus really can do anything except stand behind their warranties s,,0.0,1j8swar
comment,mh9oj64,Chaotic-Newt,,11,2025-03-11 20:40:26,,,,My folks used to sometimes run one of those older ionizer purifiers back in the day and I remember it would burn the shit out of my lungs and made me cough like crazy whenever it was on For some reason I was the only person in the house that seemed to be bothered by it but it was bad enough that they finally stopped using it altogether,mh7y1a9,1.0,1j8swar

comment,mhbt5bx,ChiefStrongbones,,6,2025-03-12 03:27:06,,,,Ive been using an electronic air filter for over 20 years and swear by it I plug it in when allergy season starts in March and leave it running continuously until June My filter still uses the original steel filter cell I wipe down the wires and filter plates every couple days to clean off the dust but it works great as an allergy filter Basically there was a big scare in the 1990s over the very small amounts of ozone produced by these filters order of magnitude less than what you breath just by living in a city and that scare caused these products to no longer be manufactured,mh7y1a9,1.0,1j8swar
comment,mh7ppdv,chrisdh79,,13,2025-03-11 15:07:02,,,,From the article Have you ever wished that your monitor contained an air purification unit Probably not but this seemingly niche product has become a reality thanks to Asus which is making three of these displays measuring different sizes and priced from 130 to 359 Asus says its new VU Air Ionizer series is designed to enhance users wellbeing The main attraction is the air ionizer found in each of the monitors Asus claims it effectively removes pollen allergen and other pollutants and reduces 90 of airborne dust in just three hours,,0.0,1j8swar

comment,mh97zf8,CocodaMonkey,,-11,2025-03-11 19:23:31,,,,I wouldnt say a dedicated one will do a better job Theres no reason one built into a monitor cant be a good air purifier Id need to see how it performs but Im not against the general idea It could also be quite nice in a office cubical setting where space is limited and employees are banned from plugging in extra devices,mh7s08y,1.0,1j8swar
comment,mha3x7l,Pineapple_Assrape,,3,2025-03-11 21:52:46,,,,I mean if you look into it for more than 2 seconds you will be crushed by evidence why a dedicated one will do a much better job starting with this being an ionizing purifier and taking just 3 hours to reduce 90 of airborne dust no bacteria or virus reduction either A purifier is as good as its filter and this has none HEPA filter air purifiers need 30 minutes for that with its much higher throughput while removing a ton more stuff from much bigger areas without potentially creating additional irritants ozone in the process This type of confident ignorance fueled matter of fact posting is what is shitting up the rest of the internet that isnt ruined by bots and AI,mh97zf8,2.0,1j8swar

comment,mhbh0ye,livebeta,,4,2025-03-12 02:12:22,,,,Another interesting feature of these monitors is their packaging Asus says that rather than just throwing the cardboard boxes away for recycling as is the norm they are designed to be folded into different shapes and repurposed as desk accessories The packaging for the smaller models can be folded into a phone holder desk organizer and a small laptop stand while the larger monitors box can turn into a phone holder desk organizer a laptop stand and a file holder The laptop stands and phone holders have been designed to promote proper posture and reduce neck and back strain according to Asus I would buy a new monitor from them just for these foolish yes,,0.0,1j8swar

comment,mh7uaxd,Sylanthra,,2,2025-03-11 15:29:37,,,,I think this would make more sense for a very broad interpretation of sense on the PC itself The PC needs to be actively cooled and so has fans and heatsinks and often dust filters so adding more filters wouldnt be too difficult,,0.0,1j8swar
comment,mh8417m,frezzaq,,1,2025-03-11 16:16:11,,,,You need to clean filters so this subtracts a point from the foolprofing Ive seen a lot of PCs with literally rolls of dust inside or on filters so I think its better for most users just to use just two separate devices because its easier to service two separate less complex devices with distributed risk of something going wrong,mh7uaxd,1.0,1j8swar

comment,mh9km50,hetfield151,,1,2025-03-11 20:22:21,,,,Every company is trying to make monitors flatter and flatter Why would I want it bulkier to have an air purifier in it I also highly doubt that it will be doing much purifying or it would have to be a humongous monitor,,0.0,1j8swar
comment,mha7lxn,Gloriathewitch,,1,2025-03-11 22:10:42,,,,why not more points of failure if i want a purifier ill buy one this is going to be a nightmare when the monitor bricks because the filter is clogged or something is dependent on being able to detect the feature,,0.0,1j8swar

comment,mhb95uh,Kwaipuak,,1,2025-03-12 01:28:06,,,,Here in Northern Thailand the air quality can be the worst in the world Feb to Apr so I constantly have air purifiers However as others have pointed out it has no filter I doubt it would outperform the purifier in my office anyways so I feel this is a gimmick but one that may work in Asia,,0.0,1j8swar
comment,mhbgls9,thatguy01001010,,1,2025-03-12 02:10:00,,,,I think that as with most xinone things its not gonna be as good in effectiveness or value as just getting a comparable standalone purifier and monitor Maybe theyll be awesome though if they turn out well then I guess I wouldnt be opposed to getting one,,0.0,1j8swar
