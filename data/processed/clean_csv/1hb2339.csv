comment,m1dq1eg,OffbeatDrizzle,,64,2024-12-10 16:42:26,,,,Proton works its anti cheats that are the problem Plenty of games over the past few months have just been broken from working states due to developers publishers getting mad at the Linux crowd Were all cheaters apparently,m1cyy5r,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1f4zu0,Stingray88,,25,2024-12-10 21:06:09,,,,Theres so many incredible games available today particularly from indie developers Its very easy to just ignore any game that uses anticheat thats not compatible with Linux,m1dq1eg,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1fwsh4,OffbeatDrizzle,,11,2024-12-10 23:36:37,,,,and what happens if youre a kid and all of your buddies want to play fortnite or roblox I get that not being able to play a game isnt the be all and end all and those games actually are cancer but being excluded from a game that your group of friends plays will just make you go back to windows added to this is the fact that games youve been playing for years are not safe battlefield 1 and 5 stopped working GTA5 now you can only play single player Valve are also refusing refunds to a lot of people on the basis that the game has been in their library for more than 2 weeks completely ignorant intentional or not to the fact that the software has been substantially modified from when you purchased it,m1f4zu0,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1fx5kn,Stingray88,,6,2024-12-10 23:38:47,,,,Itll suck in the short term but in the long term if people just stop buying games that dont work on linux game devs will stop developing games that dont work on linux As far as the refund issues go thats well beyond Valves purview and responsibility GTA 5 has been out for over a decade If people cant play the game anymore thats not Valve letting people down its Rockstar Just stop buying from developers who are shitty like this,m1fwsh4,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m1g01w8,OffbeatDrizzle,,-7,2024-12-10 23:56:01,,,,Valve sold you the game it is totally their responsibility especially when they advertise on their own store page that the game runs on linux and then silently change it when support is removed Thats great for new purchases but not good enough for the people whose money theyve already taken Do you really think linux users boycotting rockstar is going to change anything GTA5 was one of the most top played steam deck titles and they didnt give a fuck Its highly suspicious that 10 years after PC release they all of a sudden need noncompatible linux anticheat,m1fx5kn,5.0,1hb2339

comment,m1hnvrz,Thwitch,,1,2024-12-11 06:57:26,,,,This thing wont gain anything close to traction if COD and Fortnite dont work on it Period And if it doesnt gain major traction Valve will eventually drop it Deck had the luxury of being a unique product class,m1f4zu0,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1d59th,TheyCallMeMrMaybe,,25,2024-12-10 14:47:49,,,,Proton really was the missing link with making Linux gaming work Throughout 2013 the launch of the PS4Xbox One Valve released SteamOS and added native Linux support to Steam and all of their games hoping PC developers would quickly do the same but it didnt pay off the way they wanted Part of the problem with SteamOS 10 and 20 was the fact it was Debianbased SteamOS 30s move to Arch Linux remedies this issue And now Valve is supposedly releasing brand guidelines for other hardware manufacturers to be able to use SteamOS on systems that are built to compete with the Steam Deck This is a higher level of regulation than what the 2013 Steam Machines were going to have but if licensing costs are 0 this will help reduce costs for handhelds like the ROG Ally since theres no need for customers or the manufacturer to have a licensed Windows OS installed,m1cyy5r,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1h7esl,noJokers,,4,2024-12-11 04:34:24,,,,Why is a debian base the issue The real issue is that nobody wanted to spend pc money on a console experience where they were unable to play most of their games Proton works great on arch debian redhat etc With the steam deck valve subsidised the product launched it in a unique formfactor for pc and proton meant that 95 of games were playable I think for steam machines to succeed valve really need to price them under comparable windows devices and in line with console costs,m1d59th,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1eaucd,Tigeire,,-11,2024-12-10 18:30:25,,,,Part of the problem with SteamOS 10 and 20 was the fact it was Debianbased SteamOS 30s move to Arch Linux remedies this issue,m1d59th,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dx0mz,None,,18,2024-12-10 17:18:52,,,,Dang not sure if I want to buy a steam deck now or just save up to see what they have planned The deck is pretty cool but theres also some games it cant play and its hardware is only slightly better than my laptop so Im worried itll become outdated before too long Ive been hoping they would put out a console but now Im kind of in the predicament if I want better specs or easier transportability Guess Im going to have to do some pondering gifgiphy13R4gPwPpLHQwU,,0.0,1hb2339
comment,m1epems,Cute_Commission_8281,,11,2024-12-10 19:45:37,,,,Steam deck serves a very specific purpose and its pretty heavy and bulky tbh Its awesome but I dont use it nearly enough to justify buying it No hurt in biding your time,m1dx0mz,1.0,1hb2339

comment,m1hmqtp,ZennyRL,,2,2024-12-11 06:46:06,,,,Chances are whatever theyre building here will have the same game compatibility as steam deck anyway That fact probably isnt worth considering This product is probably gonna line up with the steamdecks OS being released for other hardware which has been planned for a while but still not executed,m1dx0mz,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1livhu,Narcofeels,,2,2024-12-11 22:11:45,,,,Buy a used one I preordered mine played it for 6 months and then dropped it once I got a gaming laptop and now touch it maybe twice a year Im sure plenty of people have used SD just taking up space,m1dx0mz,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1pqq70,Magiwarriorx,,2,2024-12-12 16:43:03,,,,A Deck 2 is probably still a ways out The Deck will likely remain a benchmark for compatibilityperformance for a while longer For the other options Id wait for just a hair Game Awards tonight CES 2025 in January then make the call Anything longer than that and theres no telling how long the wait till be,m1dx0mz,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m303n4t,ZigZagBoy94,,2,2024-12-20 16:35:54,,,,I personally think if its slightly more powerful than your current gaming laptop just get it now I just got a steam deck OLED this year in late OctoberEarly November and Im very very happy with it I was considering waiting because of the rumors of a possible hardware upgrade but decided to buy it for two reasons 1 Most hardware rumors that are this fuzzy usually means that were anywhere from 1218 months away from a release AT THE EARLIEST In the case of the Nintendo Switch 2 those rumors have been floating around for almost half a decade and we dont even have an announcement 2 Valve said that there wont be a Steam Deck hardware upgrade until theres a meaningful and significant power difference that they can offer so even if they did release a new Steam Deck soon judging by the fact that the cheapest Steam Deck OLED is 549 USD the cheapest Steam Deck 2 would probably be around least 1199 and I wouldnt pay for that when I could probably get a comparable or potentially more powerful gaming laptop for that price,m1dx0mz,1.0,1hb2339

comment,m1i31me,Stumpyz,,1,2024-12-11 09:46:29,,,,Which is why I said it was a design ahead of its time not the hardware itself In the same vein Steam Links were a design ahead of its time as is shown by the newer trend of remotecloud gaming Steam Decks literally created a new era of mobile hardware because the design and concept were just that good Even the Valve Index controllers have a better design than almost every VR controller out there and theyve been out for years,m1hurug,2.0,1hb2339

comment,m1dlr33,Exceed_SC2,,16,2024-12-10 16:19:49,,,,The one thing I would really want from this would be making sure using discord while in console mode is easy While you can multitask in SteamOS it requires going to desktop mode If they can integrate using discord with it in someway then I think it would be perfect as a console,,0.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ebd6o,Spicy_Taco_Dude,,5,2024-12-10 18:33:07,,,,It already works in game mode You just launch discord then hit the steam button and library or home to launch the game and you can quickly switch between them via the steam button,m1dlr33,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1elt5d,Exceed_SC2,,3,2024-12-10 19:27:01,,,,Can you control the discord UI with a normal controller though Its still the desktop UI,m1ebd6o,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1eptkf,Spicy_Taco_Dude,,3,2024-12-10 19:47:45,,,,Yes youll have to fiddle with the control layout of course Works great for me with the touchpads but you could set it up,m1elt5d,3.0,1hb2339

comment,m1elcoy,Exceed_SC2,,-3,2024-12-10 19:24:39,,,,Ok explain a step by step how to easily do this through the Steam Big Picture UI If at any point you say something that requires an input device other than the controller or requires you to go to desktop mode Im going to slap you If you are able to give this step by step in a way you would be comfortable giving it to someone that is technology illiterate over the phone like your mom I will suck your dick okay Im completely aware and have used it on my deck but it is not a console like experience,m1ehksa,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1eokr3,thejoshfoote,,1,2024-12-10 19:41:19,,,,You setup discord as non steam game then u launch it in gaming mode then click the steam button and launch a game click steam button to switch screens as needed,m1elcoy,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1evzk0,Exceed_SC2,,-2,2024-12-10 20:19:55,,,,How are you getting discord on the SteamOS how are you controlling it with a standard controller Im aware of the current measures to do so Im saying give me the equivalent experience as on PS5 Youre skipping a lot of steps here and assuming a steam deck for control device,m1eokr3,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m1exo10,thejoshfoote,,4,2024-12-10 20:28:41,,,,How dont u understand lol I control it with my steamdeck in my hands,m1evzk0,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m1f5qtk,Stingray88,,3,2024-12-10 21:10:03,,,,Im with the other guy I think the person you need to slap is yourself Ive had no issues using discord on the Steamdeck You have to install it in Desktop Mode but after you add it to Steam its ready to be used on the Game Mode No external peripherals required,m1evzk0,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m2g2w99,Dotaproffessional,,1,2024-12-17 04:21:58,,,,On the contrary I wouldnt mind if this shipped and everyone moved to steam chat Im tired of discord,m1dlr33,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dnq9o,BMCarbaugh,,0,2024-12-10 16:30:18,,,,Agree Though I will say you can now do voice chat in Steam chat and its not bad,m1dlr33,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dod8z,Exceed_SC2,,1,2024-12-10 16:33:42,,,,Yeah its more so that everyone is on discord While the capabilities are there on Steam discord is where everyone is where the group chat already is where the voice channels and everything are already happening Ideally you dont need to change the thing everyone is using because you bought a Steam machine instead of a windows PC or even a PS5XBSX those have discord support,m1dnq9o,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dyvax,Robot1me,,0,2024-12-10 17:28:35,,,,you can now do voice chat in Steam chat and its not bad Yeah I agree and I actually use it as a main gaming chat Yet at the same time Valve really really needs to get over themselves to work on it again For example voice chat for the chat app was announced back in 2019 and 5 years later there are still no signs of it Valve created such an amazing foundation with the chat revamp in 2018 just to later act like I dont want to play with you anymore,m1dnq9o,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1nx1x9,gg06civicsi,,2,2024-12-12 08:16:13,,,,How about this a dockable steam deck That when docked could let you use it as a desktop computer and play games at higher resolution,,0.0,1hb2339

comment,m2g7zhk,Dotaproffessional,,1,2024-12-17 05:00:22,,,,I think that requires either USB 4 or thunderbolt right I know thunderbolt is Intel only I dont know the USB spec of the deck,m2g60x8,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dd5pr,turnerm05,,4,2024-12-10 15:33:03,,,,This is a big threat to Microsoft and Sony Will be interesting to see how it shakes out No one makes money on hardware this is all about software sales and Valve will want to protect that so I dont foresee the Microsoft or Sony Stores being allowed Microsofts only hope is cloud based game streaming which isnt the ideal solution,,0.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dkzl5,thedoc90,,14,2024-12-10 16:15:43,,,,I doubt Valve would restrict applications from competitors as that would fly in the face of their current branding You own the devices and can do whatever you like with them including flashing your own OS hardware modding and sideloading programs hell they released the CAD files for the steamdeck so people could design their own accessories and potenetially lead to backlash from their free and open source partners It would also be trivially easy to circumvent because of the way open source software works or people could just flash the device with Chimera OS or any of the other non valve maintained SteamOS forks so at the end of the day itd be a pointless and inflammitory move Not to mention it could get Sony and Microsoft to pull listings from steam in retaliation,m1dd5pr,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e1wt5,AgentOfSPYRAL,,1,2024-12-10 17:44:18,,,,I dont own a steam deck so truly ignorant on this topic is playing Xbox games Gamepass or owned on the deck as simple as using desktop mode,m1dkzl5,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1eccpq,turnerm05,,-2,2024-12-10 18:38:12,,,,No And this is my point They will control the storefront You can only stream Gamepass games You dont have access to the Gamepass application or the ability to download and play Gamepass games directly from Microsoft Valve makes money on game sales not hardware,m1e1wt5,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m83vf9c,turnerm05,,1,2025-01-20 03:59:23,,,,The downvotes here are comical Time will tell If youre Valve how do you make money Just think about it for a second Im not knocking them at all Im actually applauding them for using their approach to make more money,m1eccpq,4.0,1hb2339
comment,mqjlfz9,20dogs,,1,2025-05-04 14:49:20,,,,The downvotes are because its a Linux machine Valve doesnt control which software runs on it and the reason why you cant play Xbox games is because of Microsoft,m83vf9c,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ef3j1,AgentOfSPYRAL,,-1,2024-12-10 18:52:17,,,,So Valve is already restricting applications for competitors outside of the tiny minority of folks who will do full on modding or flashing of the OS Not knocking them for doing so of course they want you buying from Steam,m1eccpq,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ehjrj,thedoc90,,5,2024-12-10 19:04:58,,,,They are not restricting applications as it is being presented in this thread The steamdeck runs Linux if these game companies have linux versions of their software they will just run If they only run on windows then they will not If not they may be run via proton or wine if they do not run via proton or wine it is because the system calls made in the software are unsupported The software the steamdeck runs on is open source as well so the developers could make their software compatible with the steamdeck for free without paying licensing fees Gog and other nonsteam storefronts with linux support can already be used seamlessly in the deck by adding them as nonsteam games,m1ef3j1,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ed944,turnerm05,,-1,2024-12-10 18:42:47,,,,They are doing it now with the Steam Deck This is a play and a smart one to get more hardware access points into the wild to broaden the funnel into their Steam storefront Sure theyll let you mod your device however you want They even provide drivers to do so You want to dual boot or turn the device into a Windowsonly machine Go ahead So I agree with you there But what they currently offer is a great OS that provides seamless access to their storefront and the ability to play games in a console like environment Id be SHOCKED if they provide access to the Microsoft and Playstation storefronts so that you can buy and download their games directly including the benefit of any subscription service that you may have,m1dkzl5,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ei4c6,thedoc90,,2,2024-12-10 19:07:55,,,,If Microsoft or sony create linux compatible storefronts nothing will stop them from running on the steamdeck Sure they may not be packaged with the deck by default but there would be literally nothing stopping you from using desktop mode to download them and then adding them as a nonsteam app like you already can with gog and other nonsteam storefronts,m1ed944,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m82yy4y,ChinaCSBestCS,,1,2025-01-20 00:50:40,,,,Theoretically could the xboxplaystation storefront be added in the flatpack based software section Or are those apps only limited to Valves choosing Cuz that makes it very simple for less tech savvy folks to download apps Genuine question coming from a linux newbie,m1ei4c6,4.0,1hb2339

comment,m1e6mpl,adratlas,,1,2024-12-10 18:08:43,,,,Considering how proton right now and how good the new integrated graphics are on the new processors that can be a pretty good move by valve I believe itll be pretty much like one of those mini PCs we see on the market,,0.0,1hb2339
comment,m1h6iiz,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2024-12-11 04:27:46,,,,You can basically make your own right now beyond knowing how to install Linux if you wanted it no reason not to use the included Windows IMO you just hook up a controller and set steam to launch on startup in big picture mode Ive used one of these for a client before and theyre not only fast but it has another PCIe slot and even a slot for a 25 SATA SSD At least the S500 I used did Theres probably cheaper ones out there the linked one is 500 with 16gb1TB but at the time I bought it they were on sale,m1e6mpl,1.0,1hb2339

comment,m8309cq,ChinaCSBestCS,,1,2025-01-20 00:57:26,,,,Well OEMs are gonna be paying 0 for SteamOS on handheld hardware so would be pretty stupid of them to charge extra for use in console like systems,m1hvh5v,4.0,1hb2339

comment,m1i8nfk,Frece1070,,1,2024-12-11 10:49:29,,,,As someone who uses Batocera we are almost there although we need better Steam support The best thing about it is easy to install and it can run from a USB stick or drive Being Linux it means it can work even all the way back to C2D or C2Q era CPUs The general problem for mass adoption is that a lot of publishers are cleaning their hands with Linux users when it comes to stopping cheaters in online games when in reality they do zero to nothing,,0.0,1hb2339

comment,m1dixc3,WalletFullOfSausage,,-1,2024-12-10 16:04:35,,,,I would pay good money for a Steam console a la the Xbox or PlayStation I know I know you can use a PC that way but not without a moderately higher amount of effort compared to a consoles ability to just plug in and play I want to come home plop on my couch pick up the controller and play games on the big screen with my surround sound If I could do that as easily with the Steam library as I could an Xbox then Im sold Edit all the comments telling me that its possible also have the caveat of changing settings or something that proves my point I want a 11 experience as quick simple as plugging in an Xbox right out of the box,,0.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e30br,G8M8N8,,1,2024-12-10 17:49:57,,,,What if Valve sells the Steam Machine as a console competitor but inside its just a standard ATX compliant PC You have a nice well rounded gaming console for relaxed players and have a easy to tinker with machine for those more into PC,m1dixc3,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e66dy,WalletFullOfSausage,,1,2024-12-10 18:06:19,,,,Id go for that probably I just want the simplicity of consoles with the functionality and library of PC Consoles are plug play right out of the box PCs arent I want a 11 experience,m1e30br,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e6fxe,G8M8N8,,1,2024-12-10 18:07:44,,,,I wonder what would set it apart from a normal machine with Steam big picture mode though,m1e66dy,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ebcvy,WalletFullOfSausage,,2,2024-12-10 18:33:04,,,,For me the ease of use An Xbox or playstation can be up and playing within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box bullshit updates notwithstanding,m1e6fxe,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dqm7q,Lurking_like_Cthulhu,,2,2024-12-10 16:45:24,,,,You can with big picture mode though Ive been doing it the last year and its really as simple as turning on your pc and opening Steam Everything else from that point is easily done with a controller from the comfort of my sofa,m1dixc3,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dup1w,WalletFullOfSausage,,0,2024-12-10 17:06:39,,,,But thats the thing thats more effort than a console requires Not much but more,m1dqm7q,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m1dvg8x,Lurking_like_Cthulhu,,0,2024-12-10 17:10:37,,,,Actually you can set Big Picture Mode to launch on PC startup so its not really any extra effort or steps,m1dup1w,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e2iz9,WalletFullOfSausage,,-3,2024-12-10 17:47:28,,,,Youre missing my point Its still not easier than a console If Im playing with my PC on my tv screen Ive gotta get a wireless controller Ive gotta hook way more things up since my console audio goes straight from my TVs HDMI to my surround sound so on and so forth PCs do not out of the box operate as easily as consoles and thats just a fact PCs are not plug play without putting forth the effort into making them that way I want a Steambased console that can mirror that experience 11,m1dvg8x,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ih2kj,LupusDeusMagnus,,5,2024-12-11 12:10:45,,,,Thats just wrong I legitimately dont know what youre onto At most you have to download Steam as a setup as opposed to having a store baked into the OS like a console Theres literally nothing a steambased console would make simpler than things already are,m1e2iz9,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m1iiivd,WalletFullOfSausage,,-1,2024-12-11 12:23:04,,,,How am I wrong Consoles are plug play right out of the box PC is not like that If I have to do anything more than I would a console then it isnt the 11 experience Im wanting All Im saying is I want a Steambased Xbox I dont know why that pisses you people off so much to the point where youd tell me Im wrong aboutsomething that doesnt exist that I wish did I dont get it man Its not a wild concept,m1ih2kj,6.0,1hb2339
comment,m1is0xc,LupusDeusMagnus,,4,2024-12-11 13:33:37,,,,The reason is that youre simply not making sense Youre saying things that are blatantly wrong and acting like you live in an alternate universe where they are true With consoles which are not plug and play out of the box you have to take them out of the box they come in plug in the cables turn them on connect the controllers let them update set up your account download games and then play With PCs specially if you buy prebuilt you take them out of the box plug in the cables which are literally the same as that of a console download steam set up your account connect your controller download games and then play The same thing the only difference is that you download steam once Thats it You may want a steam box for whatever reason you like thats on you but the specific reason you cite just isnt real,m1iiivd,7.0,1hb2339
comment,m1ix5wz,WalletFullOfSausage,,0,2024-12-11 14:07:20,,,,Okay then let me be more specific I want a 11 experience for the same price My console has 2 cables coming out of the back of it My PC has an entire fucking rackmounted recording interface attached to it costs twice as much and still cant run every game as my consoles at equal settings I want a dedicated gamingonly machine akin to an Xbox or PlayStation but with a Steam library There is nothing wrong with that,m1is0xc,8.0,1hb2339
comment,m1jfaqv,LupusDeusMagnus,,2,2024-12-11 15:52:11,,,,Your PC having a recording interface is literally a you problem Thats for your other uses of a PC and has nothing to do with its ability to play games If you want to record games both windows and console have functions to record screens but otherwise youd need a dedicated recording card for all of them As for the price thats a valid reason but thats not what you were talking about Consoles will have a lower price point because companies selling them sell them at a price lower than they cost because they then have an exclusivity of the store and make up the difference with pricier software and being the only choice Assuming a steam machine comes out being a PC I really doubt Valve is going to subside it to people as thats basically giving a discount on an open PC,m1ix5wz,9.0,1hb2339

comment,m1e8fi6,ticket2win,,4,2024-12-10 18:18:04,,,,You lost me when you compared plugging a hdmi cable from a console to plugging an hdmi cable from a PC They work the same way,m1e2iz9,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m1e9lz7,WalletFullOfSausage,,-3,2024-12-10 18:24:07,,,,My PC has a dedicated audio card that I use for recording purposes my audio does not come out of my GPUs HDMI or my IO port On PC I can route all that to my rack interfaces and not worry about it If I took my PC to my living room and hooked it up to the big screen Id need more connections than I do for my consoles which require one singular cable Which brings me to my other point I use my PC for things that arent always gaming I want a dedicated gaming machine that doesnt need to move from place to place and preferably I wouldnt have to build a whole new PC to do it,m1e8fi6,6.0,1hb2339

comment,m1hk9wm,ninjapro98,,1,2024-12-11 06:22:12,,,,I dont understand all of the people arguing with you tbh You can get a console like experience on PC but you need to do a lot of set up both hardware and software wise to make it work,m1dixc3,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1druu6,Wildantics,,-1,2024-12-10 16:51:47,,,,Yeah I feel exactly the same man I hope they make tiers if they do it because I would love something like that with a 4080 super or equivalent,m1dixc3,1.0,1hb2339
comment,m1d2qwx,cunningmunki,,1,2024-12-10 14:32:25,,,,Remember those rumours that got shot down about Valve developing a device that would double as the GPU for the Deckard and a new homeconsole version of Steam Deck,,0.0,1hb2339

comment,m2gwfqi,sometipsygnostalgic,,1,2024-12-17 09:00:56,,,,The steam machine went really badly because Valve couldnt make it more appealing than a games console or a pc The device had too limited power Steamdeck is great because you can use it like this or you can use it as a portable It is the perfected Steam Machine Even if they somehow find a reason to offer the steam machine again if they split attention between steamdeck and steam machine then they may be shooting themselves in the foot Microsoft have that problem where they have too many Xbox options which is why they arent confident making a handheld,m2g4w4s,2.0,1hb2339
comment,m2hyvzn,Dotaproffessional,,1,2024-12-17 14:36:15,,,,I dont understand the emphasis on attention youre making They are completely different product categories Its like saying people might not buy a ps3 if they buy a game boy,m2gwfqi,3.0,1hb2339
comment,m2i935v,sometipsygnostalgic,,1,2024-12-17 15:35:32,,,,Theyre not though Consider how much worse the Wii U did compared to the 3ds and how much better the Switch did than both systems because it combined everything into a single focused handheld The Steam Machine is like a Wii U to the Steamdecks Switch,m2hyvzn,4.0,1hb2339
comment,m2ifjzb,Dotaproffessional,,1,2024-12-17 16:10:42,,,,Are you suggesting that the Wii us failure was because of the 3ds Thats the part Im disagreeing with Youre relating things that are unrelated A steam console wouldnt fail because the steam deck exists and the Wii u which failed had zero to do with the 3ds They didnt even play all the same titles Theyre unrelated,m2i935v,5.0,1hb2339
comment,m5b4pl8,Mr_Nicotine,,1,2025-01-04 05:02:30,,,,Back then the APUs were literal shit as well as console being the main gaming platform Things changed now and desktop usage is DWINDLING majority of pc players play Sims 4 LoL Dota 2 CSGO2 on their consumerlaptops,m2gwfqi,3.0,1hb2339
