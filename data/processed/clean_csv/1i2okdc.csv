comment,m7ghbig,farklespanktastic,,48,2025-01-16 14:50:06,,,,Weve got two new Zelda games in the past two years so I doubt itll be a new Zelda Theres been no new 3D Mario games since 2017 so that seems likely Also this year marks the 40th anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros which Id think theyd have something planned for that,m7g5irf,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7i7uz1,farklespanktastic,,2,2025-01-16 19:53:56,,,,I feel like Bowsers Fury is a sort of expansion of 3D World than a full game of its own,m7i58bl,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gdtlz,OldeArrogantBastard,,164,2025-01-16 14:30:39,,,,As popular Metroid is in the gaming community I wouldnt see it as a major system seller for the general population Itll be the other flagship recognizable games that are Mario related The reveal itself shows a snippet of a new Mario Kart game,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7gh7wz,Windfish7,,4,2025-01-16 14:49:34,,,,Metroid prime 4 was announced with the switch launch so it would fit well in Definitely not as a solo launch game but this time around it has backwards compatibility to pad its launch Were most likely getting a new mario kart as a launch game which will def do well Edit Mixed up metroid prime 3 release date as a launch title for the wii,m7gdtlz,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7hp0fh,TingleyStorm,,1,2025-01-16 18:23:28,,,,Metroid Prime 4 has been highly desired for years and got a gameplay trailer this last year Metroid Dread also helped give the series new life as well I would not at all be surprised if it was THE major launch title especially with backwards compatibility,m7gdtlz,5.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7j58s9,laughland,,6,2025-01-16 22:36:11,,,,Mario Kart will be the major launch title but the Metroid franchise is going to explode thanks to being a launch title for the new console,m7hp0fh,6.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gdqt0,idebugthusiexist,,8,2025-01-16 14:30:13,,,,They could announce M4 as a launch title but Metroid has never been a heavy hitter for Nintendo so I doubt it will be THE launch title Most likely new MK or some other best seller,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7g9ipf,AntiDECA,,20,2025-01-16 14:06:08,,,,They literally just redid skyward like 3 years ago Zelda has been beat into the bushes on the switch Its actually a good strategy launch the the console with a popular but not bestknown game franchise and watch it blow up Zelda has done insane numbers compared to before the switch and now theyll probably try to get the same success with Metroid The franchise will keep selling once it goes big Then they have created another cash cow franchise Zelda was popular before the switch but never sold even close to Mario or Pokémon games Now it does They may also just be launching with Mario kart 9 Its overdue,m7g80kl,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gicst,Molwar,,11,2025-01-16 14:55:37,,,,As much as I would like another zelda I think historically could be wrong they normally alternate their console release titles so its more likely to be a mario game then a zelda,m7g9ipf,6.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7krd9s,Bob_Chris,,1,2025-01-17 04:12:19,,,,No one outside of hardcore gamers gives a shit about a game that is effectively a side scroller Maybe if there was a new Mario side scroller but I dont see Metroid ever going super mainstream like that I found Metroid Dread so boring I didnt even finish the demo,m7g9ipf,6.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7kxkpp,DomLite,,1,2025-01-17 04:56:32,,,,Zelda may have a huge swathe of its games available on the Switch but the fans have been clamoring for them to port the HD remasters of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess that are trapped on the Wii U since the Switch launched Whatever other titles there may already be those are the ones that have been constantly requested and never delivered While I dont necessarily think theyd make something like that a launch title for the Switch 2 I do think that they might use it as a very safe bit of padding and release them shortly before the launch for the original Switch giving the fans who arent adopting Switch 2 right away a very nice goingaway present while simultaneously giving people who are picking up a Switch 2 be it for the first time or as an upgrade two beloved titles That way its not a flagship title for the Switch 2 itself but it also isnt just a last gasp for the original hardware and itll sell copies to both demographics That leaves the door open for Metroid Prime 4 to be upgraded to a 2 release andor something like Pokemon Legends ZA that might be ready to go around that time as well It wouldnt exactly be a terrible idea to come out the gate swinging with a longawaited title in a recently revitalized franchise a hotly anticipated Pokemon release and round it out with a very safe Mario Kart 9 It also covers a range of bases for launch games with an actionfps title a pokemon rpg and a multiplayer racing game And it bears repeating that backwards compatibility means that even if theyre not new titles the entire Switch library is right there for the taking on launch day so you dont run the risk of enthusiastic gamers blowing through stuff too quickly and having nothing else to play on their new consoles Even things like BOTWTOTK will probably run a lot smoother on the more powerful hardware and thats not even mentioning some of the hidden gems for Switch like Astral Chain which still looks and plays fantastically Basically with backwards compatibility confirmed theres room for Nintendo to throw OG Switch owners a few bones at the end of its life in the form of longawaited titles that become something like backdoor launch titles for the Switch 2 because theyre still new releases just not ones built to take full advantage of the new hardware Its the smart business choice to capture sales from two different markets and keep squeezing money out of the original console for a little longer while simultaneously padding out the hot new titles that Switch 2 owners can enjoy on day 1,m7g9ipf,6.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7iola2,DropDeadEd86,,4,2025-01-16 21:15:08,,,,Naw theyre going MARIO PAINT REDUX and MARIO MAKER 3 with that mouse feature,m7g80kl,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7h0t6d,bacchusku2,,1,2025-01-16 16:27:44,,,,Unless its a Zelda remake thats somehow not been leaked WW remake Ocarina TP,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7h5iyc,sirwilson95,,1,2025-01-16 16:50:29,,,,I wouldnt be so sure I feel like tears of the kingdom being a sequel makes it possible that it was a side team and that a game for the switch 2 launch might have been in parallel production,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7iz0ak,FireLucid,,1,2025-01-16 22:05:00,,,,No way it still took themwas it 6 years to make Heck they held it back a year just to polish it They had to make an entire new map underground plus the sky islands,m7h5iyc,5.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7izthx,sirwilson95,,1,2025-01-16 22:09:03,,,,No question but Nintendo has been doing parallel projects a lot lately Based on what we know there are 23 Pokémon teams at least two Mario teams and at least two Zelda teams Im just saying I wouldnt be surprised if we find out that they broke ground on a Zelda for the switch 2 before tears was done and then transferred the tears team once tears dropped Especially since they gave up a major cash cow in the form of DLC for tears I feel like the tears team couldnt do dlc because they were already reassigned,m7iz0ak,6.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7jaowf,FireLucid,,1,2025-01-16 23:04:49,,,,I feel like the tears team couldnt do dlc because they were already reassigned I think they just had everything in the game That year of polish would have been the time to start prepping that But I still think we are a few years off a big new Zelda game at BOTW scale Cant wait for it though,m7izthx,7.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7h7z26,froggyjm9,,1,2025-01-16 17:02:06,,,,Metroid 4 wouldnt be a console seller,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7h8prc,LeCrushinator,,1,2025-01-16 17:05:41,,,,I dont think Metroid has enough mass appeal for that to be what theyre waiting for Another 3D Mario game would be my guess But I wouldnt be surprised if they also hold up Metroid Prime 4 to release at the same time as the console as well,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7i5pjo,Kichigai,,1,2025-01-16 19:43:32,,,,Its a 4 game but not Metroid Mother Ⅳ,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7iw5p4,themanfromvulcan,,1,2025-01-16 21:51:25,,,,The only way I see Zelda is if they have done some kind of stealth sequel for Tears using the same landscape where they dont have to reinvent everything and its more of a direct sequel in the same world and not a new game from the ground up I think its possible to do this but Im not sure if that is the way they will go,m7g68vw,4.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7h5mjg,itsdripping,,7,2025-01-16 16:50:57,,,,Mario kart 8 is a WiiU port and its the best selling game on the switch so its not that crazy to make it a release title Honestly the number of people who bought a PS5 to play FIFA is probably shockingly high too,m7gtm7b,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gsyd6,Pigeon_Lord,,5,2025-01-16 15:49:42,,,,Its definitely Pokemon since the announcement of the new game said launching simultaneously in 2025 which heavily implies it is a launch title with Switch 2,m7g5irf,3.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7ghzpp,Sylvurphlame,,1,2025-01-16 14:53:43,,,,I think its probably still too early for a new new Pokemon Although another Lets Go or Legends title is a solid maybe That might just be wishful thinking Fair chance it could be the new Metroid Prime,m7g5irf,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gf1gl,RAZR31,,14,2025-01-16 14:37:31,,,,My guess would be either a Mario game or Metroid Prime 4 MP4 is already announced to be coming out this year and since it wasnt announced to be coming out this spring I can easily see it being a launch title Otherwise a Mario game is the next likely one given how long its been since a mainline Mario game has been released Super Mario Odyssey A Zelda game is unlikely as Tears of the Kingdom is still fairly new no new game has even been hinted at even in all the recent leaks and Echoes of Wisdom just came out last summer I could also see both Mario and Metroid being launch titles Edit after rewatching the teaser the music really feels like it would fit nicely in a Mario Kart game and Nintendo really likes to do subtle hints like that so I can see Mario Kart 9 maybe being a launch title as well,m7g571l,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7imiak,Mdgt_Pope,,1,2025-01-16 21:05:06,,,,The assumption is that it would not be released the same day as the direct Therefore if the direct is on 202542 then a release of 202561 would indeed be considered summer,m7gfqsz,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7icxr8,DarthFader4,,1,2025-01-16 20:18:47,,,,If you rewatch closely youll see them connected to the new strap attachments which are now color coded The plug you mention is covered and protected This makes it seem to be a deliberate feature Id be more skeptical if it wasnt basically known that theres optical sensors on the inside of the joycons I think you can see them in the video too Right next to that plug it looks like a recessed square with an optical sensor On the other side theres what looks to be the pairing button,m7gfis1,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gp5ar,jubuttib,,1,2025-01-16 15:30:41,,,,I would at least expect them to use a more standard stick tech like the Xbox PS5 use The main problem with traditional sticks like that is that the module alone even without the shaft of the stick is about 2023mm tall while the whole Joycon from the bottom of the plastic frame to the top of the thumbstick is 21mm The thickness of the Joycon stick module itself is 52mm a quarter of the thickness Ie they would have to make the joycons dramatically thicker to use standard modules like that which would go against their whole design idea for them,m7g7nmk,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7ky433,DomLite,,1,2025-01-17 05:00:34,,,,I get that my personal experience is just that but seriously Ive had a Switch since launch with the original joycons and Ive not once had a drift issue with them Meanwhile I went through three Xbox 360 controllers that I used for PC gaming and all three of them were drifting within a year Given Ive got an Xbox One controller now thats held up fantastically but I have to wonder how people are treating their joycons none the less,m7g7nmk,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7hf97w,ItWasTheGiraffe,,3,2025-01-16 17:37:00,,,,The joycons in particular have an insanely high rate of stick drift The president of Nintendo formally apologized for it back in 2020 and they are still offering free repairreplacement for drift regardless of warranty I can confirm it happens on xbox controllers too Happened to mine for the first time recently after 2ish years of light use convenient outside the warranty period,m7gfdq7,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7hw58h,MikeHoncho85,,10,2025-01-16 18:57:20,,,,I think its unlikely due to the fact they appear to be attached magnetically to the housing Magnets in the vicinity kinda fuck up hall effect Its quite possible given the magnets that they wont be able to be retrofit either Not sure if theyre close enough to interfere though,m7g4r77,1.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7mb8yo,Zingzing_Jr,,1,2025-01-17 12:46:41,,,,I expect old joycons to be wirelessly compatible but not connectable I also expect old pro controllers to work with no issues Theres no good reason to not support it Its just Bluetooth It should basically just work unless Ninty decides to completely redo their implementation of Bluetooth and the controller libraries just to fuck us in the ass,m7hw58h,2.0,1i2okdc
comment,m9ixv35,MikeHoncho85,,1,2025-01-27 21:37:08,,,,Oh I mean retrofit as in opening the new sticks and connecting or soldering in hall effect modules Its a somewhat common upgrade for existing controllers Its possible that if they program some sort of permanent offset they could still use them in the sticks but Im thinking its unlikely and theres a lot of hoping going on in the media The xBox Elite Controller with its magnetic stick attachment is currently either impossible or extremely difficult to retrofit hall effect sticks on them,m7mb8yo,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7l5prr,cherry_chocolate_,,1,2025-01-17 06:01:40,,,,Definitely not their biggest mistake It may have been the loser of that generation but it Nintendo hadnt pulled away from Sony it would have been the death of Nintendo as a company The way business is done in Japan larger corps can end up basically in total control of smaller ones without them being an official subsidiary And I dont think a combined SonyNintendo would have incentive to produce as many good games And they would likely be making 1 console together today rather than filling the low end and high end markets with different options,m7hcpga,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7v5lox,Griffdude13,,2,2025-01-18 21:06:44,,,,OP above me was wondering why the Japan inperson experience was later Its most likely because sales of the Switch are going to be predominantly larger in the areas that are lined up first so it makes sense to give consumers in those locations handson experience first so the impressions can spread in that country,m7sez2z,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7wgxct,Smurfsville,,3,2025-01-19 01:17:29,,,,Yeah I feel like the sales in those countries wont be predominantly larger though with the exception of the USA Historically Japan has represented a huge chunk of Nintendo sales Personally Im disappointed I wont get to experience the hands on event in Tokyo until so late but also I feel like this will be completely IMPOSSIBLE Events like this are always mental here in terms of the number of people that attend Even new Pokémon set releases are completely crazy and sold out everywhere for weeks,m7v5lox,5.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7hjh6z,arthurdentstowels,,2,2025-01-16 17:57:07,,,,This was exactly what I assumed was meant by the use as a mouse part There are definitely games that could benefit from a mouse function if you could just press or hold a button then use it like a laser pointer I think that would be reasonably useable As for putting it on a surface and using it like you would a PC mouse it seems a bit of a stretch and off brand for a portable device whose main selling point is portability That being said it could be a feature for when it is docked I sold my switch and got a Steam Deck Im more intrigued by this machine than I thought I would be,m7hg2av,2.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7hyzqs,DragonDropTechnology,,2,2025-01-16 19:11:04,,,,I suppose its possible that the accelerometers could detect that the joycon is being slid on a planar surface and that would automatically enable a mouse mode,m7hjh6z,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7g98my,Blacky_McBlackerson,,1,2025-01-16 14:04:29,,,,Yes thats the joke Unless youre saying that people were rightly confused about the Wii U because Nintendo had released many home consoles by then Thats silly in my opinion,m7g6d66,4.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7g7p7s,bran_the_man93,,2,2025-01-16 13:55:21,,,,I dont disagree that the Wii U suffered from branding issues but that was hardly the only reason it fell on its face Super Switch also clearly conveys some sort of upgrade over the original so I dont think they run into any issues there if it was called the Super Wii people would still have panned it for being lackluster,m7g4go5,2.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7ga4ki,MonsieurAvocado,,6,2025-01-16 14:09:41,,,,The issue is that it isnt immediately clear that its the successor to the Switch I could see many normal consumers confusing it for a PS5 Pro kinda device and not a new standalone console,m7g7p7s,3.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7gb5t9,bran_the_man93,,1,2025-01-16 14:15:38,,,,Fair enough though it does sort of feel like the XSXPS5 are both just Pro2 versions of the XB1PS4,m7ga4ki,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7g8shx,madchad90,,8,2025-01-16 14:01:49,,,,No its the exact reason it fell on its face People thought the Wii U was just a new controller for their existing Wii not a successor console Super switch conveys some sort of upgrade And thats what they dont want to convey to people Its not that this is an upgrade that people could live without Its a brand new successor console A new generation to where your old switch is now completely obsolete,m7g7p7s,3.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7gau2b,bran_the_man93,,-3,2025-01-16 14:13:47,,,,The naming convention explains initial sluggish sales not a lifetime of underperformance Not sure why were debating this its pretty well documented that the Wiii U failed because it was overpriced underpowered had no games for like 2 years lacked strong thirdparty support games were pretty boring touchscreen was very much a fullthroated gimmick without anyone knowing how to make a game that used it and it looked and felt cheap in the hand Again if you think it failed because people didnt know it was a new console you just werent paying attention,m7g8shx,4.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7ggkh0,madchad90,,2,2025-01-16 14:45:59,,,,Not saying it was the only reason But the name certainly didnt help nor was the initial presentation when they just focused on the controller instead of the system as a whole Im not debating or disagreeing with you Just stating a fact they are calling it switch 2 to convey its a successor console Thats all,m7gau2b,5.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7h5huz,Responsible-Win5849,,1,2025-01-16 16:50:20,,,,Isnt being comparatively underpowered a core Nintendo characteristic at this point I dont think theyve left the bottom of the generational comparisons since Sega stopped making consoles,m7gau2b,5.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7l28do,NecroCannon,,1,2025-01-17 05:32:36,,,,Plus I just want standard naming at this point Xbox went towards 360OneSeries If Nintendo sticks to the switch for a while and just keeps adding something new like the mouse thing numbers are best What would a switch 3 be called Switch Ultra But what about the parents that dont know about the Super Switch,m7g4go5,2.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7g65f1,Siyuen_Tea,,1,2025-01-16 13:46:04,,,,The issue was the visual similarities with the wii U If they release the switch 2 looking like the switch plus no one will buy it,m7g4go5,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m839z7t,FireLucid,,3,2025-01-20 01:51:07,,,,So were supposed to never go out just so he can play more video games when he already has video games Sounds like a single night out would more than pay for it if this is all in USD So youd lose a single night out All our money is pooled so pocket money auto transfers out each week into our own accounts Thats guilt free money Seems you have expectations on what your BF does with his Or maybe yaknow set up a sub account and throw a bit in each month until you have enough Hope the tariffs dont bite you,m833ng6,11.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7kodwm,dieplanes789,,1,2025-01-17 03:52:41,,,,That just makes it sound like a pro model which implies that the first model would be able to play all of the games designed for the new one,m7ko8q9,3.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7gm77s,OgreTrax71,,10,2025-01-16 15:15:40,,,,I would say the same reason people buy consoles when they could just build a PC Exclusives like you said and simplicity of plug and play SteamOS does a great job simplifying things but its still not quite console simple,m7ghzmc,1.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7he5ub,scott28574,,2,2025-01-16 17:31:45,,,,Tell me about it it took me an hour to figure out I needed to turn off auto resolution so my deck would stop trying to output at 4k when docked Now its set to 1280x800 like it should be and its butter smooth,m7gm77s,2.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7itilb,Nympho_BBC_Queen,,0,2025-01-16 21:38:48,,,,Well the Switch 2 is stronger than a Steam deck for starters and has DLSS So its easier to port current gen games to it Also has better battery tech and access to Nintendos exclusive next gen catalogue,m7ghzmc,1.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7l95xb,Neo_Techni,,1,2025-01-17 06:32:03,,,,and has DLSS thats a negative All forms of TAA result in smearing artifacts that will look worse on a handheld,m7itilb,2.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7g37bq,BrewKazma,,12,2025-01-16 13:28:05,,,,No benefit Those joycons were way too small and this is coming from someone with small hands Also it would have looked pretty stupid to have small controllers on a bigger screen,m7g1k95,1.0,1i2okdc

comment,m7g3q32,PikaV2002,,22,2025-01-16 13:31:19,,,,deprecate with no measurable benefit Except there is quite literally a measurable benefit I am seeing zero reason why the Switch 2 is designed in such a way The console is bigger for a better user experience Id get your point if the console had slightly changed dimensions for no benefit but youre factually false There is a significant benefit to the handheld side of things and the old JoyCons physically cant fit on that form factor Id rather not have a worse console because someone 8 years ago had a shopping addiction,m7g3g7s,3.0,1i2okdc
comment,m7g8eu4,BenanaFofana,,0,2025-01-16 13:59:34,,,,Yeah and it sucks that there is no way to use the switch joycons to interact with the Switch 2 like perhaps some method to connect them wirelessly to the console Oh well,m7g3g7s,3.0,1i2okdc
