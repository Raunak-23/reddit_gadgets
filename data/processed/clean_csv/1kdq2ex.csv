comment,mqexiho,vpalt,,-3,2025-05-03 18:46:48,,,,I dont know if Id call it missing Eink display no permanent backlight and only uses power to update and a weekslong battery Different watch faces available for download that anyone can make Thats called a Garmin watch I get almost a month per charge out of mine Definitely lots of models available right this minute no preordering needed,mqe9kbp,2.0,1kdq2ex

comment,mqg9g7v,chaseinger,,7,2025-05-03 23:21:03,,,,theres no garmin with an eink and if you use bt connectivity as in actually use it as a smartwatch theres no chance in hell the battery lasts a month especially with the display always on,mqexiho,3.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgi623,vpalt,,6,2025-05-04 00:15:24,,,,Pebbles dont use EInk either it is just shorthand Notice how I specified the exact properties I was talking about no permanently online backlight and only using power when updating EInk is a specific brand of display that has those properties but is not the one Garmin or Pebble use The fact that you said display always on makes me think you are talking about something different I am talking about transreflective MIPS displays They hardly use any power by being on only by changing the pixels As to the battery it depends on how much you use it and what model I said weeks in general and then talked about my watch in particular when I said almost a month Being more specific it was definitely over 3 weeks because I was on a trip but I dont know exactly when I charged it again when I got back It wasnt right away I also have the largest watch they offer with the largest battery and the builtin solar extender Fenix 7X Solar But the nitpicking is nonsense anyway The comparison is between typical smart watches that last maybe a day or two and ones that last weeks Yes the weeks vary depending on model and how you use it but it is still weeks,mqg9g7v,4.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgci10,TheSBC,,6,2025-05-03 23:39:49,,,,They USE to sell eink watches I own one and I loved it But its getting old now and I wanted something more robust so last year I bought a new OLED or whatever smart watch Shit lasted like one and a half days before it needed to be recharged and since it wasnt always on like eink is it was a pain in the ass to check something as simple as the time I hate that almost all smart watch companies want to run smart watches like theyre phones MORE PROCESSING POWER BETTER SCREENS MORE APPS BRIGHTER LIGHTS MORE CONNECTIVITY NEEDS TO BE RECHARGED NIGHTLY I dont need any of that shit give me something simple and light and flexible that I can wear for a week or more without charging I want it to be a constant tool I can just check in a second without a thought more complex shit is for my phone,mqg9g7v,4.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgky0k,vpalt,,3,2025-05-04 00:33:31,,,,They still offer nonOLED displays that are alwayson just like the old one you have My old Forerunner 220 uses the same kind of display as my current Fenix 7X Solar The new one just has higher resolution What was the model of the old one you have Check out the Fenix or Instinct line they are very clear which ones are AMOLED and which are not within each line They get many weeks per charge,mqgci10,5.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgs492,TheSBC,,3,2025-05-04 01:20:11,,,,it was a forerunner 35 I see they do have some mip watches although they dont really advertise it and I do see they state AMOLED for other stuff so I think the lack of obvious information was my confusion I am going to get one of these pebble watches instead though much more lightweight than the vast majority of garmins Also I do like the fact its running open source software that is highly changeable,mqgky0k,6.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgnst3,sy029,,1,2025-05-04 00:51:57,,,,I had a Fossil Hybrid smart watch Battery lasted a good month between charges They stopped making them because they werent popular Now I bought a TicWatch Enduro Battery lasts about 4 days 5 if Im lucky,mqgci10,5.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgifrm,Neo_Techni,,-1,2025-05-04 00:17:10,,,,I hate that almost all smart watch companies want to run smart watches like theyre phones MORE PROCESSING POWER BETTER SCREENS MORE APPS BRIGHTER LIGHTS MORE CONNECTIVITY NEEDS TO BE RECHARGED NIGHTLY and stupid sensors I dont need GPS on a watch ffs Or a heart rate monitor or a bloodoxygen sensor etc I want a watch not a medical tricorder,mqgci10,5.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqgo7qo,sy029,,2,2025-05-04 00:54:40,,,,This I dont understand Why do they really need to push fitness and other health features instead of productivity While there are lots of people who use them to track excercise the vast majority of users just want an interface to their phone on the wrist,mqgifrm,6.0,1kdq2ex

comment,mqe6tp9,NecroCannon,,3,2025-05-03 16:30:36,,,,I mean I get people disagree with him because of nostalgia but theres a lot of people today that dont want to rely so much on smartphones anymore for their own mental health and Im one of them The market shifted a bit after their first round of popularity Genuinely need NFC payment capabilities or I just stick to what I have which can I use smart watches because I dont really use my phone Ive even started taking quick calls with my watch over pulling out my phone and potentially getting sucked into an app afterwards I feel like thats pretty important for the crowd that this appeals to it isnt just people wanting something with a long battery life and amazing support theres people that use these for health reasons for accessibility for less reliance on a phone If Pebble wants to make a comeback then they need to adapt to the current climate while keeping the core part of their product intact Which honestly shouldnt be too hard over time,mqdkg8x,3.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqenfcn,try_harder_later,,3,2025-05-03 17:54:31,,,,I think one of the problems is that NFC integration and the minimum people want is visamaster is going to be incredibly complicated Most banks only support apple google samsung pay The amount of work that goes into certification cannot be small or we would be seeing third party NFC payment apps already Ive seriously been considering disassembling one of my credit cards and implanting the nfc chip with a smaller antenna under my skin but the infectionrejection risk and the need to do it every couple years as the card expires is really a pita,mqe6tp9,4.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqg9m32,Bridgebrain,,1,2025-05-03 23:22:03,,,,Thinkgeek had a diy rfid implant kit as an april fools prank and Ive wanted one ever since I think rejection wouldnt be too bad of a problem if you did it up in a medical grade silicone pouch but yeah having to do replacements would suck If you could duplicate the card onto a reprogramable device that could eliminate that problem,mqenfcn,5.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqfkdvb,LearningIsTheBest,,1,2025-05-03 20:52:20,,,,Obviously everyone is going to have different usage goals and reasons Thats totally understandable That is a good point about leaving your phone entirely too Personally my watch couldnt fully replace my phone unless it had 5G capabilities and that would kill battery life plus add cost Health monitoring is probably way bigger than I realize too Adding the basics has gotta be relatively cheap though if a lowend Amazfit can do it Not an expert though,mqe6tp9,4.0,1kdq2ex
comment,mqezsi8,tempest_87,,4,2025-05-03 18:59:07,,,,Which is a niche use as a vast majority of the time your phone is in your pocket I literally cannot think of a reason for those features where the extra half second motion to get my phone from my pocket is prohibitive Thos type of device is meant to be an accessory not a replacement or a stand alone tech item,mqd4wvh,2.0,1kdq2ex
