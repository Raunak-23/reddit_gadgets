comment,ms5eezf,NotAPirateLawyer,,1,2025-05-13 20:00:19,,,,Sure it does It highlights that Nintendo is a predatory company that uses lawfare to stifle competition instead of developing a better product much like the Switch 2 which is just a rehashed switch with barely improved specs and no OLED You can be damned sure if the steam deck released a model with removable controllers Nintendo would pitch a fit,ms5dpmi,3.0,1klotxk

comment,ms59x3y,NotAPirateLawyer,,12,2025-05-13 19:38:37,,,,They ripped off Pokemon in the same way digimon ripped off Pokemon and the same way Pokemon ripped off tamagachi In other words vague inspiration and nothing more Nintendo has sued on the basis of a ton of patent violations not trademark violations based on a slew of patents they filed only after Palworld had been released for over a year Included in these absolutely ridiculous patent claims are mechanics such as Aiming and capturing characters Smoothly switching riding objects in a virtual environment and Initiating conflict via launching one creature at another If those sound incredibly broad and commonplace thats because they are Nintendo is using the patent system to try and shut down competition that is rightfully highlighting the inadequacy of their own titles I say again Fuck Nintendo,ms4vest,4.0,1klotxk
comment,msacbdg,LanaDelHeeey,,-5,2025-05-14 15:39:44,,,,To be fair if you look at the 3d model comparisons some of the palworld creatures are extremely suspiciously close down to weird design quirks that you basically wouldnt see unless they ripped the model then edited it,ms59x3y,5.0,1klotxk
comment,msdwf7n,LinuxMakavry,,4,2025-05-15 02:50:53,,,,Thats not at all related to what theyre suing for Theyre suing for capture mechanics and theyre suing for riding a mountgliding with a mount And theyre suing them specifically in Japan because obviously those wouldnt be upheld anywhere else,msacbdg,6.0,1klotxk

comment,ms5f5j8,master2873,,-3,2025-05-13 20:03:53,,,,I seem to remember the actual suit was for something kind of strange It was for capturing monsters with a ball like object Nintendo claims they own the patent and only sued for a VERY small amount I heard it was like a dollar but never fact checked it myself so they have evidence of them defending their patent so they dont lose it but was all taken care of instead of going to court,ms4vest,4.0,1klotxk
comment,ms622wf,NotAPirateLawyer,,5,2025-05-13 21:58:25,,,,66k and them suing establishes case law in their favor that the patent is legitimate That plus Palworld has to cease and desist,ms5f5j8,5.0,1klotxk

comment,ms4zlyv,rundownv2,,2,2025-05-13 18:48:05,,,,Theyre STILL not a good deal compared to the switch one Even if it was 80 dollar games youd have been spending a total of 380 Even with the deal here youre spending 500 bucks for the bundle Still around a 30 increase,ms48l8x,1.0,1klotxk

comment,ms5k5pd,master2873,,1,2025-05-13 20:27:34,,,,The NES Gameboy SNES Wii and WiiU all came with pack in games They were definitely hit and miss with including pack in games and is definitely greed at this point 450 for 5 year old tech and trying to charge for a glorified interactive manual is WILD There might be a couple of others that might have came with games but my memory isnt perfect lol Having that extra free game packed in gets peoples attention and makes it easier to get them to be part of the ecosystem of the platform Now its a SIGNIFICANTLY harder pill to swallow when trying to charge 80 for a Mario Kart game that will more than likely have DLC if it does well making it cost that much more I wouldnt mind having a Switch 2 but with prices and other anti consumer practices theyre trying to pull along with software rising in price ranges above 70 and companies that will abuse the Game Key Card function that nullifies Nintendos plug in play aspect of the Switch despite physical games for Switch still sell VERY well compared to other platforms but its hard to swallow that pill It seems so weird to alinate so many of the users of the past console while making it unaffordable for others during a horrible economic time and requiring SD Express thats barely used and very expensive along with 20 price hikes on all accessories around using similar and removed tech from the Switch 1 and the new tech being used has been around of over 20 years Its just too much for those who dont make a whole lot,ms4to2n,2.0,1klotxk
comment,ms6x368,AgencyBasic3003,,-3,2025-05-14 00:56:19,,,,You are either very young or you forgot what games used to cost back then The N64 did cost 400 in todays prices They initially planned to make it even more expensive but due to the competition from Sony and Sega they had to lower the price The originally announced price would have been 500 in todays prices And then you want to buy games Sure all prices adjusted for inflation Super Mario 64 would cost 120 Wave Race 64 would cost 130 Turok would cost 150 And you need a Gamepack to be even able to save your games Another 7080 A controller 100 Nowadays you can get a couple of indie games or free to play games in the store and have enough to play for a life time Back then we could afford maybe 12 games and played the hell out of them Modern gamers sure dont know how well they have it When I was a child I wouldnt even dare to dream about the possibilities we have nowadays,ms5k5pd,3.0,1klotxk
comment,ms6zb10,master2873,,5,2025-05-14 01:09:21,,,,You are either very young or you forgot what games used to cost back then The N64 did cost 400 in todays prices Neither Issue is those games cost as much as they did because they required specialized expensive and licensed Cartridges from Nintendo Same goes for the SNES and NES Nintendo used to always discount their hardware after a few years as well They dont do this anymore same with their games via Players Choice and stopped that too Trying to compare prices to modern games today doesnt exactly work since the price varied on the cartridge to begin with or potential helper chips added too and was so expensive for publishers it could nearly bankrupt them It really doesnt cost that much for Switch carts compared to the N64 or the SNES Switch carts should be much cheaper than specialized carts for the SNES or N64 with helper chips even and digital releases are an option now too which makes these price points further make no sense Not to mention a majority of price increases have been because of greed Especially with Xboxs case There is no universe that anyone is ever going to convince me that Mario Kart World is worth more than 60 These companies keep making profit and record profit when prices keep going up That should tell people something Edit Yes downvote instead of refute Next thing I know youll be using the the price of Neo Geo AESMVS games to try justifying these greedy price increases for modern games Theres a reason why they cost as much as they did but lets ignore that to think theres a pointless point to be made,ms6x368,4.0,1klotxk
comment,ms8d2uj,BobbyDig8L,,1,2025-05-14 07:16:04,,,,To be fair when I bought Super Mario 64 with my N64 I got the whole game they didnt come back asking for more money for extra bits nor did I have to spend half a day updating it when I got home or worse it was broken at release and needed an update to work properly at all Also all games were a cartridge that was mine forever I could sell it or in my case I still have it and can still play it I am extremely skeptical if digital copies of games will work in 30 years likely the serviceservercompany may no longer exist or have revoked your license due to some technicality or TOC condition Oh and that 100 N64 controller would work FOREVER my originals are all fine Meanwhile I think Ive had stick drift and needed replacements for like 4 Switch controllers and a few XBOX Series controllers since I got it I agree that costs are probably still comparable but what you get is not I cant help but feel ripped off in todays market compared to the past and its just getting worse,ms6x368,4.0,1klotxk

comment,ms4ll8s,RobertdBanks,,7,2025-05-13 17:41:35,,,,Worth pointing out And despite the Switch 2 launch Nintendo is actually forecasting a decline in profit for the coming fiscal year Furukawa says we expect the gross profit ratio to decline due to Nintendo Switch 2 hardware having a lower profit margin than Nintendo Switch hardware In other words despite the 150 price increase Nintendo is actually making less money on each Switch 2 sold than it does on Switch 1 units Thats not entirely shocking the tech that powers Switch 1 is eight years old at this point but it illustrates the challenges of pricing tech in 2025s global economy,,0.0,1klotxk

comment,ms4bcu5,jacobpederson,,2,2025-05-13 16:52:35,,,,Lol no it hasnt Just the opposite in fact COURSE their first party stuff works because they have tuned it to make absolutely sure that they work However the first party stuff is about 01 of the library 122 vs 12k or so This stuff cannot be tested aside from the automated does it launch test because the amount of labor to play 12k games front to back is absurd We wont know if it works until we have the system in hand and people start finding the issues,ms42txz,3.0,1klotxk

comment,ms5j60v,MultiMarcus,,1,2025-05-13 20:22:55,,,,Sure thats true but something weve learnt over the years is that in all likelihood most of the popular games that dont have some technical hardware reason for not being compatible will be updated to be compatible with the Switch 2 Advanced majority of time spent in games is in a fairly short list of very popular titles and on the switch its primarily Nintendo titles which all seem to be okay with some peripheral requiring exceptions There are also some thirdparty titles but I think most of them will at least get an update to function on the new console even if they dont get a boost,ms57v51,4.0,1klotxk

comment,ms56u7k,jacobpederson,,1,2025-05-13 19:23:19,,,,Correct a translation is not quite the same thing as emulation but for the purposes of how does it effect compatibility They are close enough to make no difference This isnt the kind of nearly perfect backwards compatibility that say PS2 to PS1 was because PS2 had the PS1 CPU added on strictly for that purpose This isnt quite the doomsday scenario of 360 back compat either at least the chips are from the same vendor and will share a lot of calls,ms4ilag,5.0,1klotxk

comment,ms6irno,SweetCosmicPope,,2,2025-05-13 23:32:21,,,,How much of that demand is being driven by scalpers though The real test will be seeing how much money people are willing to shell out for a scalped Switch 2 and what the sales look like after the initial launch window closes Im in the same boat I actually dont have a problem with the cost of the switch 2 itself but the price of games and some of the shady legal shit nintendo has been doing lately has me put off from wanting to buy one This will be the first Nintendo console EVER that I didnt get at launch I do suspect Ill get one at some point because they make some of my favorite games but Im not rushing out to get one and Im taking the waitandsee approach in hopes that they fail hard and have to coursecorrect,ms497l4,2.0,1klotxk

comment,ms4454f,gman5852,,14,2025-05-13 16:17:30,,,,The hardware being 450 is almost exactly what I expected and I wasnt anticipating 120 fps capabilities or 4k60fps Zero complaints about hardware cost and honestly people that actually did their research prior havent really complained either Its very interesting seeing everybody who actually followed the console predict 450 based purely on what the hardware was allegedly capable see that its actually outputting more than expected and then get drowned out by the horde of people who never cared to begin with wanting to complain about the latest edrama,,0.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4ah9s,nero40,,10,2025-05-13 16:48:25,,,,The Switch 2 being 450 isnt really the biggest problem here As you say its almost expected Its the games pricing that is the real problem And it has been a problem since around halfway through the Switch lifecycle Maybe not flame people for the wrong reasons,ms4454f,1.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4tp1e,Yogurt_Ph1r3,,3,2025-05-13 18:20:03,,,,The game pricing if 80 is the exception is both expected and fine in America as a Canadian Im pissed though because they hiked the prices up 20 bucks instead of 10 70 dollar games are 90 here but they appear to now be 100 which is a pill to swallow for any game Im not 100 sure I want Ill pay that for Mario Zelda Fire Emblem and Xenoblade but anything else Not a chance in hell unless my job gets real better real quick,ms4ah9s,2.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4kahp,Elon61,,-2,2025-05-13 17:35:25,,,,Why is the game pricing a problem Because the internet decided so Nobody is entitled to buy a game at a discount you do realise that Or at 60 rather than 80 Just because nearly the entire rest of the industry decided that its the right move for them doesnt mean Nintendo has to do the same,ms4ah9s,2.0,1klotxk
comment,ms487ls,The-student-,,3,2025-05-13 16:37:26,,,,450 is the higher end of reasonable expectations I think a lot hoped theyd do 399 to really make it an appealing value but 450 is still a reasonable price especially when you consider they wouldnt have sold at a loss anyways,ms4454f,1.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4tzgy,PSIwind,,1,2025-05-13 18:21:25,,,,if the Switch Pro were to come out it would have been priced at either 350 like the OLED or 400 And if the Switch 2 kept the price people would have seen its only 50100 more than the Pro and go oh yeah thats a reasonable increase If we want to argue though the Switch 2 is only 100 more than the OLED model which is honestly a ripoff to buy unless you play a lot on handheld,ms487ls,2.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4juzv,Elon61,,-1,2025-05-13 17:33:22,,,,Most people have no deeper understanding beyond the sticker price Higher bad and greedy company in their minds because they simply cannot imagine a good reason for the price increase Its a plague across any community with a large enough following because you only have so many people who are dedicated enough and broadly knowledgeable enough to understand both the economic and technological reasons behind this And for some reason they just dont care enough to fix that gap theyd rather keep whining,ms487ls,2.0,1klotxk

comment,msabi0f,DavidinCT,,-1,2025-05-14 15:35:50,,,,Let me correct myself the RTX1050 was released on October 25 2016 that is 9 almost 10 years ago It might be running a newer architecture but comparably PERFORMANCE WISE it is less than a 9 12yearold Nvidia card Should I go over the AMD comparable specs to show how old the performance tech they are using is Shows you how clueless you are here on true performance Spec wise its lower than a Series S a lot lower like by 13 and that is a 300 at retail console the Switch 2 should be no more than 350 based on specs performance display and upgrade over the last console And in Japan they will be selling the Switch 2 for 330 converted into to USD about what it should be sold for Sure its faster than the Switch 1 it costs almost as much as a PS5 and Series X if you include a game its the same price and is not even in the same ballpark in performance numbers not even 210ths of the performance Your post shows you how much of a Nintendo fanboy you are this console could be 700 and you would still justify it some way or another I will stand by my statement Nintendo is over charging for this console There are a lot of facts to back this up Switch 1 was a gloried cell phone processor that was 34 years old when released the Switch 2 is following the same path I like Nintendo games but as a company I hate them I am a true numbers guy and performance is key the Switch 2 is a joke for a release in 2025 Down vote away clueless fanboys,ms4lvjh,3.0,1klotxk

comment,ms6be9b,None,,1,2025-05-13 22:50:14,,,,I was around seven years old probably in 2006 when I first experienced the internet I had just started learning to write in school My older brother already understood how computers worked but I had no clue One day the internet guy came to our house to set it up I just watched him quietly as he did his work When he finished he opened a browser It was a blank white page with a search bar He said It works now you can search for anything and then left I had no idea what that meant but I was excited My mom was sitting next to me She also did not really know how to use a computer but she helped set it up for us I decided to try it out I was really into SpiderMan at the time like most kids so I typed SpiderMan into the search bar Nothing happened I did not know I needed to add and com at the end Later my mom spoke on the phone with some people from her village They told her about a website for their community that started with and ended with com and had the community name in the middle She typed it in and it worked I was shocked So I tried and it actually opened The site had pictures and info from the movie company I could not believe it I started typing other things like spider or school with different endings just to see what would happen Then my brother came and typed Google That changed everything Suddenly we could search anything Wikipedia came up We learned so much We also installed MSN Messenger and started doing video calls That day felt magical It was like a new world had opened right in front of me This tool could answer anything It felt unreal And honestly I feel that same excitement now with AI The first time I used ChatGPT I was amazed It gave me the same feeling I had when I first saw the internet Of course ChatGPT back then was much simpler compared to now But that sense of wonder the feeling that this would change everything was exactly the same It still feels unbelievable what technology can do and make you feel wonder,,0.0,1klotxk

comment,ms4ll69,ChainLC,,-1,2025-05-13 17:41:34,,,,this has gamecube fail written all over it they finally make a switch that will run as the switch 1 was supposed to still not as well as a pc with an emulator and they want to charge you 50 more and tell you they will brick it if they detect any bad software on it or maybe a corrupted update file is seen as a trigger to brick it who knows its a brick now good luck with your 500 brick,,0.0,1klotxk
comment,ms3xv5s,momlookimtrending,,-10,2025-05-13 15:46:52,,,,Nintendo is high price low quality overall Most games on their store thats not produced for the Nintendo runs bad prices are way too high for the products they offer hardly any good discount It was good when it was the point between no console and an actual console but now that the price is 500 where I live its just better to buy a Xbox Ps5 and get games for cheap that actually run well Even modding the stock Nintendo Switch isnt worth it because games arent even worth pirating,,0.0,1klotxk
comment,ms47kj7,TheMegaMario1,,2,2025-05-13 16:34:15,,,,I think most people including you memory hole the fact the original Switch was most of the time more expensive than its contemporaries It only became the budget option when the PS5 and XSX released At least in the US it launched at 300 and the MSRP of a PS4 was 300 but often you could get it on deals for 200,ms3xv5s,1.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4aksh,Lexmusea,,2,2025-05-13 16:48:54,,,,I looked it up when I remembered this earlier and Sony reportedly Im not from the US so this is based on an article lowered the base PS4 price to 250 officially in February 2017 the month before the switch launched Which really puts Microsoft raising Xbox prices the month before switch 2 into perspective,ms47kj7,2.0,1klotxk
comment,ms4bdow,TheMegaMario1,,1,2025-05-13 16:52:42,,,,Yeah I saw that too when looking it up but it was a limited time deal to match black Friday pricing Wouldnt be surprised if this follows a similar pattern and PS6neXtbox is closerhigher than the PS5 Pros price and makes the Switch 2 the bargain comparatively similar to last gen,ms4aksh,3.0,1klotxk
comment,ms42b7c,gman5852,,2,2025-05-13 16:08:29,,,,It depends on your personal taste Personally Ive been using my gaming PC and PS5 less and less and my switch more First party offerings imo are far better than the libraries of either right now Third parties the Switch handles indies well and with the current collapse of the AAA industry thats about all thats needed,ms3xv5s,1.0,1klotxk

comment,ms583ot,gman5852,,1,2025-05-13 19:29:30,,,,In your case its probably not super worth it The Switch 1 is meeting your criteria well enough The only thing going for switch 2 as far as retro games are concerned is the GameCube library and that alone wont be worth it especially at launch,ms4wax0,1.0,1klotxk
