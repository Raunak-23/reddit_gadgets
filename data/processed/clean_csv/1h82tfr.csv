comment,m0rrdx3,Deflated_Hive,,29,2024-12-06 21:22:52,,,,The economy is pulling back The low tide is really showing what product lines are swimming naked Microsoft was adamant at the beginning about not putting VR on the Xbox because of how little uptake it had People said heh Sony aint They and their Playstation got their games on lock And then a few years later PlayStation halts their VR efforts after dismal sales I expect well see more examples of fat trimming from Google Microsoft and many other tech companies coming soon Im surprised Google hasnt pulled the plug on their Pixel Fold line yet If Google killed their Pixel tablet due to sales I could only surmise how little quantities the Fold managed to sell,m0pqt3p,1.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0t30ek,Runazeeri,,5,2024-12-07 02:16:16,,,,I think the issue with high end android tablets is the app exclusivity for IPad Yeah its a powerful tablet but it doesnt have the apps to use it,m0rrdx3,2.0,1h82tfr

comment,m16m7ro,Enough-Meaning1514,,3,2024-12-09 12:23:28,,,,I have an iPad 7th Gen and recently came across on of them expensive Samsung tablets S10 or something The screen and the materials of the Samsung tablet were superb but I cant believe how crap every app on it was Like the UI is clearly meant for Android phones and just expanded to the tablets screen So much wasted space and unnecessary scrolling buttons etc I think the HW for great Android tablets is there but there is no real app ecosystem I fully understand why Google cancelled their tablet line,m0um7rz,4.0,1h82tfr
comment,m16mhof,Enough-Meaning1514,,1,2024-12-09 12:25:47,,,,All agree Also I briefly used the first Surface Studio Honestly it was quite crap Like the idea is nice but there were no apps that took advantage of the hardware And for the ones that claim to have a proper app they were all junky as hell If MS wanted to enter this market they should have sold these to universities and startups for a quarter of the price,m0rrdx3,2.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0pprvk,BBK2008,,104,2024-12-06 14:50:59,,,,Its the same formula over and over ignore all the reasons Apple didnt make a product like that argue endlessly that this is exactly what most people want based on a fringe focus group release it and fail and cancel the whole thing rapidly At some point MS will wake up to the reasoning Apple uses to avoid having to constantly drop product categories rapidly You need enough users who can afford it who want it and who would benefit from it Even though it looked pretty cool even to me as a product Not remotely an IMac competitor though And the problem is their os is terribly not touch optimized so it loses a lot of the benefits of being touch screen,,0.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0wwpr8,brelywi,,3,2024-12-07 19:20:00,,,,I mean factually my statements ARE accurate because that is my experience with the surface pro they gave me Im not the only one experiencing those issues either Our IT department has even told me that they cant support multiple displays That being said it wouldnt surprise me if the company handed out the bargain bin models from ten years ago or something,m0t37bk,3.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0tm8rm,achman99,,3,2024-12-07 04:34:42,,,,So much this I have a 5 year old Surface Pro with an i7 and it runs multiple monitors all the Photoshop tasks I need and even Premiere Pro in a pinch in the field Its been a fantastic tablet laptop combo My only gripe was dropping it and cracking the corner a while back turning it into a desktop in its dock Ive just been waiting for the right need to upgrade to the current standard and replace now that Im not traveling as much,m0t37bk,3.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0ukiyc,randompanda687,,1,2024-12-07 10:16:27,,,,Honestly I dont fault them at all for making this It was a really cool product idea I think they just didnt execute well enough Maybe they should have iterated on it or something but even though Im a mac guy I was cheering for this to succeed out of sheer innovation,m0pprvk,1.0,1h82tfr
comment,m19hkti,BBK2008,,1,2024-12-09 22:01:37,,,,I never said it wasnt cool looking But that doesnt make a viable product that lasts in the market Apple is far better at not chasing fringe stuff that doesnt have what it takes to make it in the market is all Im saying,m0ukiyc,2.0,1h82tfr
comment,m1bufke,randompanda687,,2,2024-12-10 07:43:18,,,,Oh I wasnt saying you were hating I think MS was forced to try something a little different to compete I mean head to head an artist or designer is going to pick an iMac over a windows machine every time So MS tried to add something to the hardware to entice users to give them a shot Not a bad idea but it just didnt pan out,m19hkti,3.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0rdrcb,brktm,,5,2024-12-06 20:08:57,,,,I think their plan was always to scale back for the second generation But to be fair they werent or arent really sure what applications will actually be useful or catch on which is an unusual approach for Apple But its also why the first Pro generation is so overbuilt hoping that thirdparty developers will find the profitable use cases and the less useful features can then be dropped for the general consumer models,m0qo9pn,2.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0t2jy0,SirVezaTheBrave,,3,2024-12-07 02:13:07,,,,I doubt that but each persons experience is different Ive seen plenty of surface devices myself I own one But the level of power from one surface device to the next is vastly different A surface used by a high school is significantly underpowered vs a surface pro The pro is underpowered compared to the laptop studio Its a bit sad,m0skxxn,6.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0uc6s3,phara-normal,,1,2024-12-07 08:42:29,,,,Probably depends heavily on the country the area you live in and what youre actually doing at the university I know that schools over here use them seen them at public service offices they were pretty present at my university media design game design product design and Ive seen them as tablet replacements because you can run stuff like ad block on them which is the reason I got one myself this year to replace a old ass Samsung tablet Especially at my university they were way more present than macbooks which is funny because everyone always claims that macbooks completely dominate in the creative world Now I work as a 3d artist my girlfriend works as a general content creator for a pretty big YouTuber other friends work as animators special effects artist and product designers and literally none of them and none of the people at their companies use a macbook while surfaces are pretty present,m0skxxn,6.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0xqerd,tiroc12,,0,2024-12-07 22:01:42,,,,everything is an Xbox This is the worst possible thing they could do Xbox is over First if it was true why would I ever buy an xbox again I know they would rather sell games than hardware but if I want to play games on my computer I am using Steam or any other distributor Not Xbox Nor is Xbox on my mind as the place to go Thats if But xbox is not everywhere They have gamepass in a lot of places Cloud gaming in a lot of places But my xbox libarary is only available on my xbox My xbox experience is only on my xbox I honestly have no idea whats available where Just like the xbox itself I dont know which one to buy anymore The X Series X The S Series S The one The 720 They ruined the brand by pretending like I can have my Xbox anywhere except its a different experience with a different subscription everywhere I go No thank you Comming from somoene that has had an xbox since 2001 Havent bought a game in probably 4 years,m0qlf0t,3.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0y9azp,mobrocket,,1,2024-12-07 23:50:52,,,,I was a big Xbox supporter when it first came Im American so to have an American company Awesome right I think the OG Xbox was great it had every feature available at the time really Then 360 was still sold then they went stupid with XB1 and I jumped ship to PS4 Then they got stupid again with 2 consoles instead of just 1 How fucking hard is it to just take what was great about the OG and just better the specs each gen It was basically just a PC u know the thing MSFT has ALWAYS been known to be familiar with Straight DUMBASSES,m0xqerd,4.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0qr03t,dicedaman,,9,2024-12-06 18:08:33,,,,Google rightfully gets shit for cancelling services but nobody has MS beat when it comes to killing consumer products I have a brother thats a diehard MS fan and the list of abandoned shit hes bought from them is insane Zune Kin two separate abandoned LumiaWindows Phone lines Surface RT Surface Duo some fucking Fitbit band thing even a damn Hololens MS is to hardware what Google is to services,m0pz1tp,2.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0r4owh,BigCommieMachine,,4,2024-12-06 19:20:33,,,,Microsoft is notorious for either being too early or too late The Zune Windows Phone KinLumia were excellent products that were too late The Surface RTDuo and the HoloLens were too early,m0qr03t,3.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0sy31n,Saidagive,,2,2024-12-07 01:43:20,,,,The windows phone wasnt late it was deliberately sabotaged by Google and app makers that wanted it to fail despite being a superior OS with superior cameras Nokia Lumia series The kin sucked I have no defense for that one,m0r4owh,4.0,1h82tfr

comment,m26n5v0,Saidagive,,2,2024-12-15 16:14:20,,,,At the time having the latest and most popular apps was the lifeblood of the mobile world This meant Google services YouTube google owed and social media like Instagram and Snapchat If it didnt have these then it was dead Both Google and the owner of Snapchat knew this and deliberately blocked Windows phone from using them Young people didnt want to use the phones because no Snapchat and adults didnt because no Google services Yes this is a simplified view of the issue but this is what crippled any chances of Windows phones from gaining traction,m18bcm4,6.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0t2oxx,SirVezaTheBrave,,1,2024-12-07 02:14:03,,,,HoloLens was too early,m0r4owh,4.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0w8oue,umbananas,,1,2024-12-07 17:13:31,,,,the reason you think they are too early or too late is because they did not release a good product For example windows Phone they were not too late They had Windows mobile for years before the iPhone but they never really cared for the user experience so it stayed a niche product until iPhone came out and changed the market,m0r4owh,4.0,1h82tfr
comment,m18bsus,AkirIkasu,,1,2024-12-09 18:25:49,,,,Honestly I think the main reason why Windows Mobile failed to capture the earlier market was because it was called Windows The people who did want a pocket version of Windows were disappointed and the people who wanted a good mobile experience did not want what desktop Windows offered which is why they chose Palm which was designed from the groundup to be used as a mobile device,m0w8oue,5.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0ppy9s,HakimeHomewreckru,,13,2024-12-06 14:52:00,,,,What consumer spends 5500 euros on a computer nowadays I have a HEDT build that didnt cost this much with a 49 inch OLED ultrawide This wasnt a consumer product and even for creative professionals it was useless with its laptop hardware A 3060 in 2024 really Not enough VRAM for content creators video editors motion designers 3D artists list goes on This was a glorified tablet for graphic designers that cost way too much compared to the even just Apple M1 hardware that blows it away in terms of performance And that means something when an Apple product is faster AND cheaper,m0pou9b,1.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0qtuk5,Blakers37,,6,2024-12-06 18:23:32,,,,Those are not even close to comparable for the kind of person buying them The vast majority of iMac buyers are getting the base model which is like 10001100 They might upgrade storage or ram and hit like 1500 but even that is the minority The only people buying Mac StudioPro are very high end users or businesses,m0ptbf6,5.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0psepe,leastlol,,28,2024-12-06 15:05:59,,,,Its a shame its a beautiful product that had some unique and interesting features but its kind of plagued by Microsoft not really being a hardware company first I hope that Microsoft in the future uses that brilliant hinge and display hopefully in a standalone product The iMac also suffers from the problem of having an absolutely beautiful frame and display being tied to a specific set of hardware It just doesnt make much sense for most people where the display will far outlast the computer its attached to This is compounded by the fact that its tied to x86amd64 Something like this with an Mseries chip in it would be a lot more compelling It being decoupled entirely from a computer would be even better,,0.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0tpt5e,smallcoder,,2,2024-12-07 05:03:07,,,,Agreed wow when I saw that I was so keen on getting one The puck alone plus the ability to draw directly on a huge canvas of a screen just seemed well amazing and perfect for my needs as a designer at the time However the price and then some of the mixed reviews made me pause and stick with my regular setup Then it just kind of disappeared or at least seemed to anyway This is where MS falls apart on the hardware front in comparison to Apple even when they come up with a compelling product they just dont seem to be able to infiltrate the creator market and make the product ubiquitous so you see it all over YouTube and in moviestv and in offices you visit in day to day life If Apple had made the studio and this device was the closest MS came to creating something that looked like an Apple product then maybe it would still be going today and be a successful part of the Mac line up Seems sad really as it was a cool looking and from the advertising having never used one myself innovative and practical device that could have been really popular Oh well,m0smbhb,3.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0pzpvk,iCowboy,,5,2024-12-06 15:45:54,,,,Thats a shame even as a Mac user I fell in love with it in the initial reveal advert and a play in a Microsoft shop showed that it was a really useful way of working on large drawings that seemed so obvious in retrospect But it badly needed updating with better hardware to make it competitive Mind you despite the M4 refresh Apple seems to be quietly killing off the iMac which is the closest alternative still new no 27 machine or Pro version so perhaps this big screen sort of allinone doesnt have a market,,0.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0puesv,GregLittlefield,,4,2024-12-06 15:17:06,,,,Except it was never a real competitor to the iMac It was an interesting piece of hardware but it was a very niche product that priced itself out of the market Id be very curious to see just how low the sales numbers were,,0.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0qhxq9,Acceptable-Truck3803,,2,2024-12-06 17:21:32,,,,It was a fun product but more or less it seemed it was for use to show what windows can do and still can do compared to when the iPad Pro came out and folks migrating to that ecosystem for artists who draw and do creative work Branded as an AIO it was always a product to be sold at a loss but kept folks from migrating to MacOS,,0.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0px1sq,quietIntensity,,3,2024-12-06 15:31:32,,,,All in one PCs are terrible Its the worst of all worlds in a single piece of hardware You get a monitor that would be useful far longer than the computer but you cant use it as a monitor for any other PC You get shitty laptop hardware packed into a tiny case on the back of the monitor usually little or no upgrade options available but its still a desktop machine not really portable at all The market for these is almost exclusively rich people who buy this stuff as throwaway items and people who dont know a fucking thing about computers at all but like the nice single unit packaging I would never recommend one of these to anyone for any use case No one that would ask me about this stuff is rich enough to buy throwaway hardware,,0.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0qay97,quietIntensity,,-9,2024-12-06 16:45:24,,,,Do all of you Mac people consider your hardware to be regular PC hardware Its not Even then lets compare on costcocom today Mac Mini base model M4 1010 core 16gb RAM 256GB storage 579 iMac equivalent model with 24 screen 1349 For the almost 800 difference in price you can get a pretty nice monitor Granted if you are part of the fruit cult you wont buy anything less than the 1600 27 monitor they offer as the smallest monitor they sell outside of the iMac display But for the rest of us 770 will buy a really nice display If youre doing professional things that require a pro display youre not buying an iMac at least not if youre smart I dont see this as a great deal Were looking at picking up a new Mac Mini with the M4 Pro chip for 1349 and using one of our existing monitors we bought for under 800 This seems to me a far better deal than any iMac they are currently selling both in the bang for your buck category and the ability to expandupgrade later,m0q73xl,2.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0rb0qy,Extension_Carpet2007,,5,2024-12-06 19:54:11,,,,Thats how much those monitors cost Or at least close enough once you consider the generic apple markup So its like buying a Mac mini and a slightly overpriced monitor and in return you get it all in one which is significantly cleaner and easier for most people The assertion that people would need to be doing professional things to buy a high end monitor is weird To most nongamers ie apple buyers the monitor matters more than the gpu or whatever People like screens that look nice,m0qay97,3.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0qt8i1,None,,3,2024-12-06 18:20:19,,,,My point is that theres a target audience for each Apple product Some will pay for the convenience of an allinone Additionally similarly specd displays 500nit DCIP3 1bcolor go easily over 1000 Notable examples of these include LG UltraFine Dell UltraSharp and ASUS ProArt 4K Considering the above iMac is really not that terrible of a purchase especially if you dont have a good 4K display lying around,m0qay97,3.0,1h82tfr

comment,m0q2l8n,Striking_Ad_4562,,7,2024-12-06 16:01:09,,,,I dont think this is a fair assessment I still use my IMac from 2009 The only upgrade I had to make was for an SSD My work Lenovo laptop from 2020 bit the bullet this year The USBC port could no longer charge the computer I moved my iMac from home to work As a small business owner I am thrilled with the reliability length of life and ease of use of an iMac I dont have an IT department and dont care for the frequent issues I had with my laptopmonitor combo such as USBC connector issues firmware updates etc The only issue I have with iMac at this point is that I can no longer update the OS to a newer version but it hasnt been prohibitive to my daily use at this point Just some food for thought,m0px1sq,1.0,1h82tfr
comment,m0q4zd8,quietIntensity,,1,2024-12-06 16:13:58,,,,Macs do seem to have a longer useful life than PC hardware but still when you upgrade no matter how nice your display is and how well it still works you have to buy another one If you would have bought a Mac Mini and a display separately you can upgrade to the new Mini for a fraction of the price of a new iMac and keep your same display if you want,m0q2l8n,2.0,1h82tfr
