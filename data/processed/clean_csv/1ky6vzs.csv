comment,muvz7go,CatWeekends,,56,2025-05-29 14:20:30,,,,Maybe Im misreading things but it looks like this isnt that big of a deal The CVE mentions manipulating data in a request to start_applyhtm which would be on the router itself To perform the exploit an attacker would need to already be on your local network or your router would need to be exposed to the internet And in either case you were screwed long before this exploit IMO CVE202339780 isnt great but its also not a worldending exploit,muv1vc1,1.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muwfh9u,jaymemaurice,,25,2025-05-29 15:37:05,,,,You used to be able to make a browser do xmlhttp arbitrary requests to local addresses with JavaScript Most routers local address is usually 1 or 254 with like 90 being 19216812340 or 17216 You used to be able to get your arbitrary JavaScript to run widely through shady add networks or by compromising WordPress phpbb plugin de jour But now also theres probably some pythongo library in your build chain just waiting to give local access to a botnet builder Local network access isnt always as hard as it should be,muvz7go,2.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muwtgdn,CosmicCreeperz,,10,2025-05-29 16:42:50,,,,The actual report vs the detail free article linked said the initial access was from Bruteforce login attempts That means people are turning on access to their rioter UI or ssh etc on the public IP and protecting it with a crappy password Thats no different from any other computer you might give a public IP Years ago I put a Windows NT PC on a public IP to act as a home router for a brief time until I replaced my broken router I figured it would be ok for a couple days note there was no loginetc available from public side Took about a day for it to get owned Luckily it was a clean install with no useful data so I just wiped it,muv1vc1,1.0,1ky6vzs
comment,mv1u0ig,Emu1981,,6,2025-05-30 11:38:19,,,,Years ago I put a Windows NT PC on a public IP 20 odd years ago I went to reinstall Windows XP but I was missing the service packs The computer was connected directly to the ADSL modem with no firewall as Windows didnt come with one back then and whatever firewall I was going to be using wouldnt install without the service packs The machine was compromised before I could even navigate through MSs website to start the download If I remember right I ended up using Linux with the backup dialup connection to download the service packs so I could install Windows so I could use the ADSL modem lol,muwtgdn,2.0,1ky6vzs

comment,mux9gmi,Jiopaba,,12,2025-05-29 17:55:56,,,,In my experience your ISP is charging you five to ten bucks a month to rent a router which cost less than a hundred dollars If your ISP really just gives it to you and doesnt sneakily offer a discount if you opt not to use it then theyre a unicorn,mux18cj,3.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muz1t7u,Jiopaba,,1,2025-05-29 23:14:57,,,,Yep Ive never encountered an ISP yet that doesnt let you opt out of it but theyll drag their feet on it and try to be a huge pain in the ass if you want to Bring Your Own Device Theyll send regular reminders about how much better your speed could be if you used their company branded equipment even if youre literally using the commercial version of the exact model that would give you minus their sticker I had one ISP a decade ago that would send you the router and youd have to ship it back at your own expense and then separately call them and request the line item be removed from your bill because you werent interested in renting it from them so its really petty bullshit Over one person its not a huge amount of money but they pull these scams at scale on millions of people and the average person has not the slightest clue what a router or a modem really even is except box that makes wifi So lots of people pay many times more than their outdated garbage networking equipment is worth to rent it from their ISP and then get charged fees if they lose the equipment or it gets damaged My mom got slapped with a 120 fee for a 70 routermodem combo that got stolen out of a parked car which she had already paid 600 for over the last decade,muyzzsk,5.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muyveqp,thetwelveofsix,,1,2025-05-29 22:39:49,,,,My fiber provider ATT provides a modem with builtin WiFi router with no opt out discount and you cant use it without a fiber modem anyway But it wouldnt cover my house entirely and they do charge a monthly for mesh satellites If I were in a smaller houseapartment the builtin would probably be sufficient I have my own mesh system behind the modem instead,mux9gmi,4.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muv3n96,Tenziru,,382,2025-05-29 11:15:03,,,,only way for router users to determine whether their devices are infected is by checking the SSH settings in the configuration panel Infected routers will show that the device can be logged into by SSH over port 53282 using a digital certificate with a truncated key of sshrsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEAo41nBoVFfj4HlVMGVYPsxMDrMlbdDZ To remove the backdoor infected users should remove the key and the port setting Okay sounds like factory reset or manual removal patched already but still need to be removed if infected,,0.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muv4687,mbergman42,,93,2025-05-29 11:18:58,,,,Yeah I think the secure key storage is compromised and reboots and firmware updates dont clear it Edit removed resets article doesnt mention that,muv3n96,1.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muvzpl3,S_A_N_D_,,48,2025-05-29 14:22:53,,,,Reboots and firmware updates preserve settings and its effectively just changed some settings rather than a hardcoded back door so it makes sense it would be preserved This is a built in feature otherwise youd need to set up your router after every rebbot or firmware update As others have pointed out a factory reset should kill it or you can just go in and disable SSH and delete the key and update firmware to close the original vulnerabilities Edit Fixed a word,muv4687,2.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muxgtig,ChrisSlicks,,3,2025-05-29 18:30:39,,,,Yeah the ones being hit are those that havent updated their firmware and the exploit is available to allow them to bypass auth and change the SSH settings For internet facing devices enabling autoupdate is probably a good idea,muvzpl3,3.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muy7ha8,Tenziru,,5,2025-05-29 20:38:06,,,,it depends on if your alternative firmware has the same vulnerability but more then likely not you would have to keep up with the provider of the firmware to know this was patched out of asus firmware a year or so ago its just that some people dont do firmware updates or have no longer supported older equipment this is a direct asus firmware based attack but like everything no firmware is invulnerable Always keep it updated use strong credentials and disable remote admin access unless you absolutely need it,muy5gmb,4.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muw9wth,Tenziru,,5,2025-05-29 15:11:01,,,,Posting only part of the key is usually a cautious choice some of it do to legal standers and journalistic practices in security Its done to reduce the risk of abuse even if it makes user side validation harder But from a defenders perspective it wouldve been better to include either the full key in a secure context or the fingerprint that is correct its pretty slandered practice they dont want accidental spreading of infections though their is enough for people who are into security to have enough information to identify or get close enough to see if infected or not if I was uncertain I would suggest factory reset strong router password and updating to latest firmware as it has been patched resetting to factory is only way to get rid of protestant changes,muw0ewd,2.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muxcihx,UnrealisticOcelot,,3,2025-05-29 18:10:13,,,,Youre saying with the full public key exposed it would spread infections because people would take that and put it in their authorized keys file,muw9wth,3.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muvoadp,Asheet_Mapanz,,-1,2025-05-29 13:24:13,,,,I like how the end of the article puts some responsibility on the user to ensure they install security updates Ive had about 20 routers over my lifetime and I only remember one of them getting an update and that was done the first moment I connected it to the internet Security updates my arse,,0.0,1ky6vzs
comment,muvqfmj,Rabo_McDongleberry,,8,2025-05-29 13:35:46,,,,That just means you never login to your router after initial setup Ive had everything from cheap routers to expensive ones I login maybe quarterly and receive firmware update sometimes Hell my Asus router just got a firmware update last week,muvoadp,1.0,1ky6vzs

comment,muxh5p6,CobraKolibry,,1,2025-05-29 18:32:15,,,,It was years ago USG3P Its still kicking and I still run 10001000 fiber connection which its able to keep up with so no plans to replace it any time soon I bought a UAP Lite which seems to be discontinued and the newer models a fair bit more pricey so only have one I have a home server already so just running the controller software there For switches I went for a generic cheapo TPLink but might grab the 25G Ubiquiti ones once they go down in price No issue with the TPLink at all but no fancy device tree integration either At this point I just came to just enjoy how it is as a hobby not just have it get the job done,muvlfag,3.0,1ky6vzs

comment,mux1guv,keonyn,,0,2025-05-29 17:19:35,,,,I swear theres just no reliable and secure routers out there It doesnt help that most these companies stop providing updated firmware for devices after only a few years in spite of the fact routers have a lifespan way beyond that About the only remotely safe option is to setup your own router which is a pain since now you have to run three separate devices to do what one device does otherwise,,0.0,1ky6vzs
comment,mv0bue8,RealisticEntity,,1,2025-05-30 03:46:17,,,,You could go for something like an OPNsense or pfsense router which are regularly updated Im using a minipc with 2 Ethernet ports with OPNsense installed as my router with multiple security apps installed including crowdsec malicious dnsad blockers Adguard intrusion detection etc Its pretty good Its probably better to have a separate wifi access point and switch that sit behind the router firewall anyway,mux1guv,1.0,1ky6vzs
