comment,m2eko4g,lordraiden007,,80,2024-12-16 22:47:34,,,,Which in itself was down to them cutting costs They reduced the memory bus width to the point that the memory had to be either 6GB or 12GB and they simply couldnt justify a 6GB model and hit their desired performance It probably only cost them a few dollars per card but it has made the card arguably superior to some of the better cards longterm and in nongaming workloads,m2ee36a,2.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2encyh,nick182002,,36,2024-12-16 23:02:55,,,,The 3060 12GB has the same bus width as the 2060 192bit the 3060 8GB and 4060 are the ones with the reduced bus width 128bit,m2eko4g,3.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2eo74x,lordraiden007,,23,2024-12-16 23:07:50,,,,yeah The 3060 had a 192bit bus which meant it could be either 6GB like the 2060 or 12 GB They knew 6GB wouldnt market or perform well so they tossed in higher capacity memory chips to give the card 12GB If they had altered the GPUs design to have 128 or 256 bit busses it would have probably had 8GB of memory,m2encyh,4.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2ep7uf,nick182002,,18,2024-12-16 23:13:52,,,,Yep Im just saying that they didnt reduce the bus width they kept the same bus width and bumped the memory As a 3060 owner Im happy they went that route The 5060 having only 8GB of VRAM is sad,m2eo74x,5.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2eq110,lordraiden007,,11,2024-12-16 23:18:34,,,,8GB at a lower bus width It looks to me like theyre literally marketing the xx50 dies as xx60 cards now and are hoping the DRFGAI features help it keep up Maybe GDDR7 will help its bus speed but Im honestly not too hopeful,m2ep7uf,6.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2eszjf,nick182002,,13,2024-12-16 23:36:16,,,,I care less about the bus width due to GDDR7 and potentially more cache Id honestly prefer a 5060 12GB with a 96bit bus Would still have more bandwidth than the 4060 Ti 16GB,m2eq110,7.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m2h33pe,scrdest,,14,2024-12-17 10:17:10,,,,But that doesnt make sense either If youre banking on AI you are missing the market of local model users and VRAM capacity is even more important there Most usecases dont need to be realtime so you could have slightly subpar compute but memory is a hard limit 8 GB VRAM is on the extreme low end of viable for those purposes these days If this goes on its just begging for a competitor to eat NVIDIAs lunch their main moat ATM is CUDA,m2fu7o4,2.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2hgr0b,_RADIANTSUN_,,8,2024-12-17 12:31:00,,,,Local models users are in the same market segment if they are going for a 5060 or something they dont want to sell very limited margin lower market cards their higher end and specially server cards have much higher margins They dont care if you are gonna use the 5060 for gaming or AI they are calculating by market segment,m2h33pe,3.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m2jhg0n,DriftMantis,,2,2024-12-17 19:30:28,,,,It doesnt eat up too much At least on a 12gb card my vram usage only goes up about 500mb to 1gb using it at 1400p Maybe it eats more at 4k not sure But at the end of the day cards should have been 12 gb or 16gb plus for any midrange card over the last couple of generations They have been cheaping out over the ram Switching to ddr7 isnt going to help if you need to swap because your hitting the vram ceiling on a 5060 or whatever In my opinion we need more vram and not just faster bandwidth and throughput,m2elfor,3.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m2fdif8,Nobody_Important,,50,2024-12-17 01:39:49,,,,Definitely should have more but I dont understand the constant comparisons to the 5090 The gap has been widening between the 80 and 90 cards each generation and the 5090 is looking truly ridiculous Who cares how the 5080 performs relative to that what matters is how it compares in performance and price to the 4080,m2er8iv,1.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2i6ao5,_dharwin,,16,2024-12-17 15:19:42,,,,Its genius marketing using the anchoring effect When the 90 cards were called the Titan series no one was comparing them to the more mainline cards and the 80 sat on top The rebrand did wonders with how people judge the cards value,m2fdif8,2.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2nwrvr,Rapph,,1,2024-12-18 14:43:50,,,,Yeah I think that gets lost on people The 90 is the top of the line not for normal people card that was once the titan Nvidia just renamed it and consumers now consider it during purchase In general nvidia loves to muddy the waters with their products by changing naming structures The numbers dont really mean anything They could put out a 60 card at 200 to replace the 1660ti and make the 60ti a card that slots into the 3060 spot I dont really think any leaks or rumors mean much of anything until we see the full line and can get performancedollar comparisons,m2i6ao5,3.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m2h7rnx,asscdeku,,-5,2024-12-17 11:08:00,,,,Its technically true in a sense If youve ever used an 8gb m1 Macbook in a workstation use it feels very close to a native windows 16gb system Though you cant say the same thing above vram Fast vram doesnt fake space,m2fk9pq,3.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2hha5g,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2024-12-17 12:35:18,,,,Its not true in any sense RAM doesnt work that way and delusional personal testimonials dont change that fact And 8GB M1 and even M2 feels like dogshit tbh For my mail room computer I switched from an 8GB M2 mini to a 16GB M1 mini and it felt like an upgrade Idk about M3 cuz I was not stupid enough to get an 8GB Mac again,m2h7rnx,4.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2khps1,asscdeku,,0,2024-12-17 22:44:50,,,,It is absolutely true that the M1 chip handles RAM significantly more efficiently compared to even their own intel chip counterparts Thats just a fact lmao There are many scenarios where you cant fake the RAM space for applications that actually utilize that space without compromise but Ive done video editing work on premiere and after effects and 3d modelling work on Blender on 4 systems My old 8gb laptop my 16gb ryzen 5 3600 desktop system my 8gb m1 macbook and my current 32gb 5800x3d system The latter blows them all out of the water for all tasks but the 8gb macbook keeps up with my old desktop system in almost every single workstation application use Rendering times proxy generation prerenders in memory maintaining fps for live previews on complex models you get the gist The only time I found my 8gb m1 lagging behind my 16gb was for massive projects with tens of layers I cant say thats anywhere near true for my old laptop Could it be the CPU difference The GPU difference Perhaps but that doesnt really matter to someone thats comparing systems as a whole Its an anecdote for me but a massive amount of people who have actually tested this and compared this out has come to the same conclusions M1 chips handles its 8gb of memory extremely well more than any other system with that amount of memory I dont doubt that the 16gb m1 or m2 models would feel like a significant upgrade over their 8gb counterparts but would that not just be because their 16gb models also feel significantly more optimized than regular desktop 16gb systems,m2hha5g,5.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2l1ya0,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2024-12-18 00:46:16,,,,Its not true at all no the M1 has no special exclusive way of using RAM efficiently none of what you say makes any sense whatsoever and your testimonial doesnt change that Lol Show me a benchmark or something Nobody is gonna sit here arguing about why your ryzen desktop might have sucked just for you to say no ayckshually it wasnt that it was ayckshually their super special RAM magic it was totally way better maybe its the bandwidthclock speed difference for the RAM to that particular chip maybe you fucked up the thermals maybe its the CPU cache differential maybe you are just lying maybe your comparisons suck etc who knows You understand what a stupid basis that is for arguing Apples statement is true in any sense No you cant fake having RAM Maybe you are referencing page memory the fastest page memory can only be barely as fast as DDR2 or the overaggressive memory management strategy of paging everything which is why the 8GB mini completely fucking failed as being a basic mail room PC Neither of these legitimize the relevant idiotic statement by Apple tho If you dont understand how computers work then its ok to just not say anything,m2khps1,6.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m4yva0z,luuuuuku,,1,2025-01-02 05:36:43,,,,Thats wrong No one says its because of the hardware but in fact macOS uses memory way more efficient than windows which makes it feel like there is more available The hardware both cpu performance and bandwidth help a lot with that Its nothing special many Linux systems do it similarly Please educate yourself before making such statements,m2l1ya0,7.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m5185pj,luuuuuku,,1,2025-01-02 17:02:59,,,,Its not really my job to educate you especially when youre offending other people and claim they dont know what theyre talking about I never said windows memory compression was somehow inefficient The key difference is that Windows focuses more on scalabilty whilst XNU puts performance first One might even argue that windows has more efficient compression in terms of compression ratios Windows even implements a feature called page combining which basically a deduplication of memory pages which can have performance implications and is enabled by default XNU uses WKdm which is highly optimised and purpose built algorithm for memory compression If you wonder how it works look it up XNU is literally open source which makes it easier to understand than windows closed nt kernel When Apple introduced Apple silicon there were a lot speculations that apple builds in hardware acceleration into their chips to speed up this decompression Even though its hard to find proper reviewsanalyses on that but there are many threads discussion this behaviour like this XNU vm source Here is an article about how memory compression works on windows And this about macOS and Linux Long story short XNU memory compression isnt the most space efficient algorithm but its built and integrated in hardware in a way that makes indistinguishable from accessing a regular page for humans,m50u9b2,13.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m51r90d,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-01-02 18:38:17,,,,Its not really my job to educate you The usual mantra of someone with no facts or evidence on their side right before you blast out a massive cope text wall with still no technical info aside from random forum posts XNU and wkDM are not special in any way they are just solutions developed only for Apples proprietary hardware and ecosystem LZ4 and snappy can beat wkDM on both speed as well as compression ratio on Windows is used XPRESS which can also give comparative or better performance in both compression ratio and speed So again no nothing special going on inside a Mac which in any way even remotely saves the 8GB on Mac is like 16GB on Windows statement from being completely stupid,m5185pj,14.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m52eq47,luuuuuku,,1,2025-01-02 20:39:46,,,,That has never been my point I never that that 8GB in Mac is like 16GB on Windows youre misquoting me My point is that the difference in implementation influences how the compressing is felt by users Ill give it one last try otherwise I wont waste any more time on you Even though benchmark performance might not be much better it focuses more on remaining responsive Compressingdecompressing does not cause notable latency when interacting with the UI and that is for several reasons The windows implementation is more similar to how zram works on Linux read the linked paper and might understand it Let me quote from it so there is less for you to read However pages on the standby list havent yet been reclaimed so they retain their data until MM repurposes them for another processs working set They can be reused by the app that previously owned them if that app asks for the page before it is reclaimed This is called a soft fault But if a page has been repurposed and the original process asks MM for that page a hard fault occurs The original process is now asking for memory that has been taken by another process and the OS must issue disk read IO to retrieve it MacOS on the other hand uses a compressor pagers which handle compressingdecompressing transparently About performance As linked there was a huge performance improvement in this process when Apple switched to their own silicon which made people assume that apple put in hardware to accelerate it And there is evidence for that In fact apple silicon CPUs have some instructions that are unique to Apple silicon and not present in other ARM CPUs two of them are most interesting for this 00200800 rD 5 rS wkdmc compress memory page 00200c00 rD 5 rS wkdmd uncompress memory page Apple Silicon has hardware instructions for performing compressing and decompressing of memory pages How exactly its implemented is not known yet as far as I know Its likely that Apple has implemented some form of accelerator for this which would explain the outstanding performance in this Its a fact that XNU on Apple Silicon does in some form hardware accelerated transparent memory compression and decompression And that is something no other system that Im aware of And that is what allows them to get away with less memory than other systems in many cases,m525tr9,17.0,1hfu8xf

comment,m2enn8e,AnalTrajectory,,9,2024-12-16 23:04:35,,,,For perspective pcie slots already supply 75 watts My NASplex build pulls maybe 2050W My gaming machines 3090 pulls 350W tdp At the point a PSU is specifically for the GPU,m2ekyqh,4.0,1hfu8xf
comment,m2i3cwg,diacewrb,,7,2024-12-17 15:02:42,,,,Years ago a PSU above 500 watts was largely for show The GTX Titan X needed at least a 450 watt PSU and that card was released a decade ago If you are running a 4090 then it is recommended to get at least 850 watts now If you live in the uk or another high priced electricity country then it will really sting running at full load for hours 245 pence per kWh here in the uk that is about 31 cents per kWh for you yanks I read you yanks pay around half what we brits do depending on your state,m2enn8e,5.0,1hfu8xf
