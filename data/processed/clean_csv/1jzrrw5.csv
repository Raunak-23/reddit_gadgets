comment,mn8vtcc,SkotchKrispie,,-25,2025-04-15 15:18:28,,,,Im not sure Sony discounts their games Sony simply decides to produce so many discs that the used market at GameStop becomes large and thus the prices drop Nintendo doesnt mass produce cartridges so as to keep the price higher,mn8pto5,3.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mn9n8gu,Obyson,,4,2025-04-15 17:33:25,,,,I dont remember the last time I bought a physical copy of a game I only use the playstation store for downloads which always has heavy discounts so your crazy theory makes no sense,mn8vtcc,4.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mnasxog,SkotchKrispie,,-3,2025-04-15 21:00:52,,,,I have never bought digital games Physical games are far cheaper on Sony because discs are far cheaper to produce than cartridges and because Sony produces far more discs than Nintendo and ships them Im not too sure what doesnt get through you thick skulls about the fact that a far larger supply of used PlayStation discs at GameStop causes GameStop to drop the price of the disc and therefore game A quite simple intellectual deduction LOLOLOL,mnalnbn,5.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mnb2o3c,Squirrel_Apocalypse2,,2,2025-04-15 21:51:54,,,,Youre talking about GameStop a 3rd party They have absolutely nothing to do with how much Sony and Nintendo are charging for brand new games Most games are purchased digitally now your anecdotal self evidence means nothing The irony of you calling people dense here and talking about intellectual deduction while having zero intellectual deduction Lol,mnasxog,6.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mnb4owm,SkotchKrispie,,-1,2025-04-15 22:02:51,,,,I have plenty of intellectual deduction I test at an extremely high IQ but thanks Plenty of people buy games physically Im one of them There are GameStop stores everywhere which proves my experience isnt simply anecdotal It doesnt matter to me where the game is cheapest Plenty of the time its cheapest physically Therefore I didnt differentiate between Sony and Nintendo discounting the game vs if the game is simply discounted because I dont care the difference and plenty of people at the physical store dont either I bought Mario Galaxy for under 12 and Skyward Sword for under 20 Also the OP wasnt talking about brand new games He was talking about discounts after years,mnb2o3c,7.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mn8apk7,None,,164,2025-04-15 13:27:59,,,,If the device is years away from launch then this might just be specs without any real hardware behind it Im sure in years time itll be adjusted and whatever SoC is planned for that time frame will have a much better chance of living up to the PS5 compute power It would be silly for Sony to throw out much of their PS5PS6 library if they can prevent it,,0.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn94o39,EagerSubWoofer,,112,2025-04-15 16:02:23,,,,the nintendo switch is 15W and the PS5 is 250W Battery technology is unlikely to dramatically change so the PS6 handheld will still need to be about 15W to get decent battery life Temper your expectations According to rumors the PS6 handheld is expected to obey the laws of thermodynamics,mn8apk7,1.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9knwo,Alpacas_,,7,2025-04-15 17:21:06,,,,To be fair theres a sub 15w chip today that supposedly gets better perf than my 77w old chip But the ps5 is already 7nm and my cpu was 22 or 32 so maybe not huge gains to be had,mn94o39,2.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn95vyv,None,,12,2025-04-15 16:08:38,,,,When I say it will be adjusted I mean the goal specifications The SwitchSwitch 2 are different technologies and that kind of change wouldnt play PS5 games anyway due to incompatibility They could make a handheld on a different architecture though and make it like a Vita 2 or something but I kind of expect something more akin to the Steam Deck Time will tell I guess,mn94o39,2.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mnad0a3,None,,4,2025-04-15 19:42:21,,,,I think I agree with this The market is either oversaturated or close to it right now More devices probably wont help the market any The only way I think it could work is if they made the portable their main system but then they lose their edge in the higher end graphics arena It would also be stupid if they trashed backwards compatibility,mnac9tt,4.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mnaei4w,Evilmudbug,,2,2025-04-15 19:49:44,,,,It seems like it only really worked for nintendo since handheld gaming was almost a monopoly for them and since they werent trying to push cutting edge hardware which makes development easier and can lower the cost of manufacturing,mnac9tt,4.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mpcue2t,UboaNoticedYou,,1,2025-04-27 18:47:53,,,,But they already do with the existence of the Switch and Series S and its a major problem developers complain about constantly so like yeah youre probably right,mnac9tt,4.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9hdxr,Aleni9,,1,2025-04-15 17:05:28,,,,I generally agree but you should also realize that an old P4GeForce 4 PC also needed a 300W PSU and you can play games from that era on a toaster now progress in efficiency is actually a thing,mn94o39,2.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9t699,KalashnikittyApprove,,6,2025-04-15 18:02:20,,,,While thats true I think in the PC handheld space devices still struggle to play even some PS4Xbox one era games at 15W without scaling them down so Id be sceptical whether enough progress can be made to run PS5 games which may not even support scaling down in the same way PC games do at 15W in a handheld in the next few years Not without major patches to games anyway,mn9hdxr,3.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mncjf28,NecroCannon,,3,2025-04-16 03:01:19,,,,Honestly the handheld boom has me excited because well probably see more innovation in APUs Gaming laptops are mobile desktops basically now time to make a powerful efficient chip for handheld devices With Intel talking about making chips too NVIDIA is the only one not fully on board with just the switch,mn9t699,4.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mna1fq6,tylerderped,,2,2025-04-15 18:43:58,,,,The switch is also running an ARMbased CPU whereas the PS5 has an AMD64 CPU Remember when Apple switched their CPUs to ARM a few years ago They absolutely perform on par with or even better than similar AMD64 CPUs while using dramatically less power Using such a powersipping CPU allows for a more powerful GPU as well 15w for a mobile SoC is kinda huge The Switch even has a heatsink and fan Guarantee most of that power is going to the GPU,mn94o39,2.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mndxd34,Deringhouse,,2,2025-04-16 10:39:31,,,,While it is true that ARMbased SoCs tend to have a slightly better power efficiency than X8664 CPUs though both AMD and Intel claim that their current offerings beat Apples and Qualcomms ARM chips many of the reasons why Apples M chips saw such a massive increase in power efficiency dont apply to the Switch Apple is willing to pay extra to ensure that is own processors are made in the latest process nodes ie the most advanced manufacturing methods offered on the market When the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max launched they were made in a smaller process node ie 5 nm than contemporary desktoplaptop x86 CPUs That alone provided a massive boost in power efficiency TSMC claimed a 30 reduction going from 7 nm to 5 nm Apples latopdesktop class M chips ie M Pro and M Max are massive and in regards to processors size matters Eg the Apple M2 Max has a die area of 510 mm¬≤ the M2 Pro has a die area of 288 mm¬≤ The newer M3 ProMax and M4 ProMax models are similar sized with the M4 Max supposeldy being larger than 400 mm¬≤ Compared to this a current Strix Point APU from AMD has a die area of 2325 mm¬≤ The M ProMax chips from Apple are always paired with fast memory and offer a relatively high bandwidth due to their memory controllers The memory controller of a desktop x86 CPU might allow a bandwidth in the area of 200 GBs at most eg for a Ryzen 9 7950X the hypothetical maximum is 96 GBs effectively it is less than 80 GBs even with the fastest DDR5 memory The Apple M4 Pro meanwhile has a theoretical memory bandwidth of up to 273 GBs The larger cache and the higher bandwidth lead to less time spent waiting for cache hits ie less time that computations have to wait consuming energy without providing performance Last but not least there is a sweetspot for power efficiency for every processor ie a clock speedvoltage beyond which the power consumption increases more than the gain in performance Due to the tight competition on the laptop desktop market many x86 CPUs are often clocked beyond that point For the Switch and Switch 2 only the last aspect matters to some degree Nintendo is not willing to pay extra for smaller process nodes larger chips or fast memory The company wants to keep production costs down and hence relies on slightly customized older offtheshelf designs from Nvidia Likewise Sony is unlikely to pay the extra costs required to copy Apples massive power efficiency gains,mna1fq6,3.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mnclt9y,r31ya,,3,2025-04-16 03:17:24,,,,So far all we know with Sony next console family is that its going to made with 3nm fabrication based on AMD UDNA RDNA5 and with newer version of PSSR The console version should be at least 4 times more powerful than base PS5 since Sony themselves note that IF PS5 pro was made with RDNA 34 could reach above 20 teraflop expected to be around 30 ish but Cerny opt to remain using RDNA2 for ease of game development Current RDNA4 7090xt is at 52 Teraflop tough sony usually aimed for upper mid range even if PS6 Portable is less powerful than PS5 portable CPU should be able to reach desktop Zen2 easily next year with BIGlittle medusa family PS6 family will include next gen PSSR which will bridge some of the GPU raw the difference and it wont chase native 4K60fps anyway IF PS6 portable could play bigger PS5 game at 1080p120FPS portable or upscaled 4k3060 on docked it would be pretty good options for 20262027 supposedly SteamDeck 2 might be looming as well in 2027 with proper UDNA generation jump OG steamdeck would be four years old in 2027,mn8apk7,1.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mn8g7s0,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,67,2025-04-15 13:58:41,,,,Might be nice if all the gaming companies jump on this mobile bandwagon Then we can stop focusing on drawing more polygons and pixels and focus on building fun games that people want to play I stopped caring about graphics getting better probably at least a decade ago A large portion of the market is just playing eSports games that can run on a basic computer The gaming industry would be so much better without trying in increase visual fidelity and picked a target that was affordable for more people,,0.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn8innq,EViLTeW,,36,2025-04-15 14:11:52,,,,This has always been the antiNintendo argument Nintendo is so weak look at how amazing the games look on XBox and PS and Nintendos argument has been Our games are more innovativefun and that matters more than realism It would be interesting to see how things play out on a level playing field,mn8g7s0,1.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn8pnqh,raccoonbrigade,,-1,2025-04-15 14:47:38,,,,TOTK is better than any big budget PS5 game Ive played for example Its embarrassing that Nintendo can release a game like that on an old tablet soc while Sony struggles to make anything interesting beyond how pretty a game is this gen,mn8innq,2.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn8ze1l,Saboteure111,,31,2025-04-15 15:36:18,,,,This is such a bad faith argument Yes Tears of the Kingdom is a great game but are you really going to argue Sony hasnt released good games this generation Literally right after last years game of the year award was dominated by them as a studio with them having several entries,mn8pnqh,3.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9f5rl,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,3,2025-04-15 16:54:40,,,,Problem with Game of the year is right in the description They have to nominate games from the current year That doesnt mean that the games from the current year are better than game from 2 years ago or 7 years ago Looking at this page for IGN GOTY one of the standout games with many awards seems to be AstroBot along with Balatro getting some nominations shows that graphics dont really matter all that much Combine that with a Final Fantasy VII remake getting nominated for so many awards there really must have not been a lot of great games to choose from in 2024,mn8ze1l,4.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mn91l93,Stussygiest,,2,2025-04-15 15:47:11,,,,Nothing wrong with chasing better graphics Graphical powerchips tend to spread to other industries like movies ai laptops phones etc etc Which in turn drive costs down for older chips,mn8g7s0,1.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9akxe,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,3,2025-04-15 16:32:04,,,,The current PC gaming situation for higher end graphics doesnt make me want to participate at all 550 MSRP for a 5070 that actually costs closer to 9001100 isnt really affordable for a lot of people Personally I prefer PC gaming because of the free online play and support for mods and other advantages But its just so hard to justify the price of building a modern gaming PC,mn91l93,2.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9dwun,Stussygiest,,3,2025-04-15 16:48:40,,,,Im still using a 1660 super Plays most games fine Its near its end of life tho with recent games Honestly do people really need 5070 Isnt the 30 or 40 series adequately fine With FRS and other ai whatever to boost fps getting better each year its not bad The price is fked because what I mentioned earlier how these graphical chips being used in other industries Yes you might be priced out of the best graphic cards but society improvement as a whole is advancing Self driving cars robots etc,mn9akxe,3.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9frj6,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,3,2025-04-15 16:57:34,,,,The problem is that the current generation of cards sets the mode for the pricing Even the 30 and 40 series of cards are expensive for someone looking into getting in PC gaming Im on a 1080 and it still plays some games Im thinking of getting CPURAMMB update just so I can enjoy some more games Might not be playing anything really new but I can still have fun with a huge back catalog,mn9dwun,4.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9nkor,Stussygiest,,-1,2025-04-15 17:35:04,,,,A quick search 3050 for 190 is too much I dont know what to say I bought my 1660 super for around the same price during covid when graphics card price was extremely expensive Its not cheap or expensive in my opinion Thinking of upgrading now,mn9frj6,5.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9qb4s,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,2,2025-04-15 17:48:18,,,,190 250 USD for a 5 year old card with 8 GB of VRAM Some quick searching on Google says that the 3050 is only a little better than the 1080 The 3050 was 250 at launch I did some search on eBay and found some that where around 160 USD which seems like a better price but still seems like more than Id want to spend on something that old I got my 1080 for 112 USD from ebay a couple years ago,mn9nkor,6.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mn9tufn,Stussygiest,,1,2025-04-15 18:05:40,,,,Yeah you could be right Could be at this very moment we are at the peak due to what I mentioned When crypto died down after covid graphics card did get cheaper for awhileif my recollection is correct I guess time the market cycle to purchaseunless the other industries dont die down,mn9qb4s,7.0,1jzrrw5
comment,mnaxkz5,happy-cig,,1,2025-04-15 21:24:55,,,,Honestly if i could do it over i would still be using my 1070 instead of buying a 4070s last year for 550 The 5070 can be had easily for 550 on newegg If i waited i couldve had a newer and better card for the same price I dont even think i need a 5070 either,mn9akxe,3.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mn8xh2s,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,5,2025-04-15 15:26:46,,,,Possible but for whatever reason nobody seems ready to make the jump and put out good games for phones that arent based on microtransactions I think the issue might be that phones seems to have the same problems as PC gaming where you have to target a huge range of devices with various specifications without the advantages of PC gaming where you can focus on high end games and people that are willing to put the effort into understanding how to get the most out of the hardware they have Also phones have the problem of being communications devices I wouldnt want to use my phone as my primary gaming device because I wouldnt want it interrupting me when a call or message came in while gaming nor would I want it muting all incoming communications while I play Having the phone as a separate device is useful I dont even like playing music on my phone when Im at home because Id rather not have messagescalls interrupting my music,mn8rup7,2.0,1jzrrw5

comment,mnhdj6w,Optimus_Bull,,1,2025-04-16 21:45:27,,,,I consider that a failure if a PS6 Handheld Edition is less powerful than a PS5 I honestly think they should strive for at least being as powerful as the regular PS5 Although I know that it also might not be feasible or make sense in the handheld space since you could make the argument that its needlessly powerful as a handheld draining battery too quickly and costing too much to manufacture not to mention what retail price could be for consumers,,0.0,1jzrrw5
