comment,ms4zd72,kazuviking,,78,2025-05-13 18:46:56,,,,The researchers reported their findings to Intel in September 2024 and the tech giant released microcode updates that mitigate CVE202445332 on impacted models,,0.0,1kltg80
comment,ms5zkuo,Pika256,,17,2025-05-13 21:45:17,,,,impacted models Yes 8th gen and onward Looks like it might not each and every single model but seems rather inclusive Edit I misinterpreted the table It looks like its a small handful of models from those generations I didnt immediately recognize the CPU IDs,ms4zd72,1.0,1kltg80
comment,ms6lw22,PetroMan43,,27,2025-05-13 23:49:58,,,,Important quote The risk is low for regular users and attacks have multiple strong prerequisites to open up realistic exploitation scenarios So many of these exploits to me read they can only occur in a lab setting under ideal conditions,,0.0,1kltg80
comment,ms6vpr7,ChrisFromIT,,21,2025-05-14 00:48:07,,,,So many of these exploits to me read they can only occur in a lab setting under ideal conditions There is no need for a lab setting It is more of you just need physical access to said hardware,ms6lw22,1.0,1kltg80
comment,ms7wc51,ShenAnCalhar92,,22,2025-05-14 04:42:36,,,,Oh shit you mean if someone breaks into my house and opens up my computer and for some reason ignored the SSDs they could attempt to glean small slivers of data from the CPU That sounds like a really serious issue that definitely warrants all these articles designed to scare people,ms6vpr7,2.0,1kltg80
comment,ms9atbq,Zomunieo,,5,2025-05-14 12:20:05,,,,Sometimes lab only exploits can be leveraged into more serious exploits so it does make sense to fix them,ms7wc51,3.0,1kltg80
comment,ms9u7w8,NorysStorys,,5,2025-05-14 14:11:10,,,,Its more of a concern for government and business machines than home users corporate and government espionage is very much of a thing and thats without mentioning disgruntled employees at lucrative targets being approached by criminal elements up upload a thing here or there,ms7wc51,3.0,1kltg80
comment,msamvl7,Fractoos,,5,2025-05-14 16:30:12,,,,Hypervisor escapes where untrusted people have guest access is typically the main concern for these types of flaws,ms6vpr7,2.0,1kltg80

comment,ms9ajqg,swiftninja_,,-1,2025-05-14 12:18:19,,,,Glad I have an amd cpu,,0.0,1kltg80
comment,msnztri,FeloniousReverend,,1,2025-05-16 18:11:52,,,,Sorry to break this to you but AMD cpus also have security exploits and flaws if you are unaware of that chances are it A doesnt actually matter to you and B dont pay attention to patching your own hardware The bug Intel had that was based on hyperthreading and the patch in some cases significantly lowered performance was a big embarrassment but regular security flaws and subsequent fixes should be expected and are not an Intel only isssue unless youre just a fanboy of their competition,ms9ajqg,1.0,1kltg80
