comment,m75pqow,Miss_Speller,,124,2025-01-14 20:37:03,,,,From the article The FTC is sending checks and PayPal payments to 6764 consumers who purchased the deceptively marketed products Recipients will get a full refund the agency said So yeah a pretty good deal And just to be clear since the headline isnt the money is coming from a settlement with Razer The FTC sued Razer in April 2024 and the gaminghardware company agreed to a settlement including a 100000 fine and 107125433 toward a fund for consumer relief,m75ibp3,1.0,1i1e8zn

comment,m7ebagg,dark_gear,,6,2025-01-16 04:05:02,,,,Those are most likely just scalper accounts still trying to sell their initial purchase I tried to purchase one of masks during the first 3 releases They all sold out within seconds only to reappear on ebay for 3 times the price Considering how wellknown scalpers tricks were at the height of the pandemic looking at you GPU price gougers its really surprising Razer didnt come up with a means to establish some kind of buyer verification system,m7c0f2j,3.0,1i1e8zn

comment,m75t5ea,Jasper0812,,108,2025-01-14 21:00:04,,,,Razer is an awful company I had a headset that was a couple months old and the mic boom began to sag and wouldnt stay near my mouth This was a pervasive issue judging from the reviews I called and they refused to do anything and said it didnt affect the performance of the mic Thank god I bought it from Amazon and could still return it That was 23 years ago and I have never and will never touch their products again,,0.0,1i1e8zn

comment,m778u28,Low_Background3608,,19,2025-01-15 01:35:44,,,,I had a headset from them for YEARS that I loved eventually broke because I kept dropping it while it was plugged in charging and the charging port just gave up Anyways some friends gifted me a replacement of the same model but it no longer had voicegame splitting built in and the controls were all different in a slightly worse way The new one had the mute built into flipping the mic boom and that broke within 3 months Same story with the keyboard I had one for YEARS that I loved that had the greatest wrist rest When I replaced it with the ultimate or whatever version of the exact same model everything feels cheaper the wrist rest no longer has padding its just a cheap plastic piece Razer will never get another dollar from me,m76tz1o,3.0,1i1e8zn
comment,m779ruq,k3rr1g4n,,15,2025-01-15 01:41:07,,,,Logitech is a more preferred option to current Razer products Especially their shitty chroma spyware they keep wanting to install with every accessory,m76tz1o,3.0,1i1e8zn

comment,m77c8hx,Kedodda,,7,2025-01-15 01:55:16,,,,The only razer products I actually like and havent replaced they wont die for whatever reason is my 2013 blackwidow keyboard and the naga mouse I got in 2020 to replace my older 2014 naga that shocked me when I touched it and it quit working Looking at other brands for replacement though,m75t5ea,1.0,1i1e8zn

comment,m77uq56,BbyJ39,,2,2025-01-15 03:46:43,,,,They are no different than any other company They make some good products and like anything else theres a small percentage of defective units Your anecdotal experience is meaningless overall considering Razer annual revenue is 16 billion They dont get there by being a bad company that makes bad products Heres my anecdote Ive got a pair of Razer kraken headphones I bought on sale for 50 normally 90 that have better sound and build quality than anything else at that price point The retractable mic works great Theyve lasted me for years without issue See how pointless it is for me to use my anecdotal evidence to prove Razer is a great company Youre here on reddit crying about one little thing but right now Razer is selling thousands of items,m75t5ea,1.0,1i1e8zn
