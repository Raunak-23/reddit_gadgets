comment,m8jzsgo,dertechie,,216,2025-01-22 16:02:06,,,,The article says the issue was user error NVidia has solved user error Bold claim Well see if it shakes out,,0.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8k2lbe,pattperin,,127,2025-01-22 16:15:11,,,,You can engineer a solution that solves a user error issue by changing the procedure to not make the user error possible It is an entirely normal design procedure to follow,m8jzsgo,1.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8kpfuz,Hardware_Hank,,15,2025-01-22 17:58:39,,,,Yeah not really sure why they didnt anticipate this in the first iteration terminal ends have retaining mechanisms for a reason and they are supposed to deliberately try any means necessary for it to fail in some capacity,m8k2lbe,2.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8k713m,dertechie,,18,2025-01-22 16:35:53,,,,Yes you can do that The issue is that weve played this game before They said it was all fixed and good to go for the 12VHPWR connectors for the 40series after this issue first cropped up on FE Ampere cards,m8k2lbe,2.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8vpej6,Stingray88,,1,2025-01-24 08:36:16,,,,Yeah then it was actually solved with 12V2x6,m8k713m,3.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8k0n95,PicnicBasketPirate,,39,2025-01-22 16:06:06,,,,The hardest part of engineering is solving the human element No matter how idiot proof you make a design the universe will just create a better idiot And sometimes cost cutting manufacturers will gleefully help the idiots along And sometimes the idiot is the engineer,m8jzsgo,1.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8k29d5,dertechie,,16,2025-01-22 16:13:41,,,,Yeah Id have more confidence if they gave slightly more information about what patterns they found and how they fixed it,m8k0n95,2.0,1i7e1cg

comment,m8obhz7,QuickQuirk,,3,2025-01-23 05:00:26,,,,I only knew that I had to really push almostbreakingtheboardhard because of the numerous videos that came out after And Im very techically literate Im in the this was bad engineering camp,m8nwcwx,3.0,1i7e1cg

comment,m8ka6si,stillfoldinglaundry,,5,2025-01-22 16:50:15,,,,Im going with the idiot is the engineer on this one Also the idiots are also everyone else after the engineer in charge of pushing it out to consumers If the users were the idiots then wed have 8pin cards burning up at the same rate,m8k0n95,2.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m9fgrth,Veganarchy-Zetetic,,1,2025-01-27 10:07:33,,,,And every other 4000 series cards with the same connector would be burning up the same amount but they are not,m8ka6si,3.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8kk83a,audigex,,8,2025-01-22 17:35:31,,,,I think their idea is that users left cables under tension which causes cable strain The new angled connector is presumably their solution,m8jzsgo,1.0,1i7e1cg
comment,m8l0tly,dertechie,,4,2025-01-22 18:49:11,,,,Thats what were all hoping These are advertised as SFF compatible and those cases tend to have a if I fits I sits attitude towards packing things in so if it isnt fixed well find out,m8kk83a,2.0,1i7e1cg

comment,m8lmw2i,drmirage809,,13,2025-01-22 20:27:49,,,,4090s had an issue where the power connector could melt It was a brand new more compact connector and the 40 series was its first outing Early adopters of the card ran into issues if the connector wasnt seated properly and it is apparently hard to tell if it is or not Or so I understand at least I presume Nvidia and their board partners have reengineered the power connector to make sure it is seated properly I do believe this revision was already in place when the Super cards dropped However the 5090s power draw is even greater so I hope they double checked to make sure every T is striped and every I is dotted The hardest part of any engineering project is the end user People are very good at doing something wrong in ways that youd never see coming,m8k1fj4,1.0,1i7e1cg

comment,m8od8dt,glitchvid,,-2,2025-01-23 05:12:56,,,,12VHPWR is awful design and unforced error on the ATX spec The solution was right in front of everybody and that was to use the EPS connector that virtually all high end PSUs already provide ample of and were already ubiquitous in the server GPU space,,0.0,1i7e1cg
