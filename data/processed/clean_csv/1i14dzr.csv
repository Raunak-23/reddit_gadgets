comment,m73334o,igby1,,20,2025-01-14 12:08:01,,,,What are the benefitsuse cases for this,,0.0,1i14dzr
comment,m735mx3,audigex,,24,2025-01-14 12:28:15,,,,I guess you could split it vertically and basically have two screens Useful for most productivity tasks Probably fairly useful for writers and as a programmer I can definitely see the benefit of more vertical space in my own workflow Do I want it Not really at least not in an early generation but if its refined and improved then I could see a use for it once the tech hit a sensible price I primarily use a desktop for work the biggest issue with a laptop being lack of second screen and a small vertical height This potentially resolves both Assuming there were no significant downsidestradeoffs Id probably pay a 100 premium for this in future I appreciate thats a big assumption hence I wouldnt pay 3500 to test it out today,m73334o,1.0,1i14dzr
comment,m740w1s,SoontobeSam,,5,2025-01-14 15:39:04,,,,As a writer Id prefer horizontal space but vertical would be better than nothing to have ref docs or my outline on screen once the hardware matures a bit it could be nice esp if they added it as horizontal expansion to create ultrawide displays without the laptop being massive,m735mx3,2.0,1i14dzr
comment,m741xyy,audigex,,3,2025-01-14 15:44:27,,,,The nice thing about vertical is that you can use it as two stacked horizontal monitors for reference docs or outlines etc or one vertical one Obviously many people are gonna prefer two displays side by side rather than one on top of the other but in many cases there isnt space for that But yeah I wouldnt be surprised to find that future laptops have a horizontal screen stretch,m740w1s,3.0,1i14dzr
comment,m74h5a2,SoontobeSam,,1,2025-01-14 17:00:04,,,,Definitely With the height shown in the image I could easily have stacked windows with everything I wanted on screen I guess it is just preference for side by side instead of stacked I expect well see laptops with slides like this on both sides to expand 2 or 3 inches either direction to pull a 15 inch screen up to 19 or 21 honestly surprised we havent seen a folding screen yet thou figured that would be first,m741xyy,4.0,1i14dzr

comment,m739sz9,danielv123,,11,2025-01-14 12:58:59,,,,Yeah but they lack many of the advantages of laptops You dont always have a chair or a table or a workspace wider than 50cm A common example is planes or when driving Not to mention backpack space,m7396b2,3.0,1i14dzr
comment,m73bf9x,audigex,,6,2025-01-14 13:10:14,,,,Sure but then Ive got to carry that and make sure I have it with me It takes up extra space and weight its another thing to charge etc Plus if Im on a train or plane I probably have room for an extra few inches of height on my laptop but Im unlikely to have space for a second screen next to it Portable monitors have some great utility and Ive used them in the past but I can see the use case for this too,m7396b2,3.0,1i14dzr
comment,m78dvco,Fidodo,,2,2025-01-15 06:12:18,,,,I have a portable monitor too but its like the size of my normal laptop so I skip it on a lot of trips This is a first Gen version but I would be willing to shell out an extra several hundred dollars for this for the portability if it pans out and gets cheaper,m7396b2,3.0,1i14dzr

comment,m7c49fm,psilent,,1,2025-01-15 20:52:42,,,,Are you really asking why it might be good to have a bigger screen without the weight or size of a bigger screen Seems pretty obvious to me Put more stuff on it see it at the same time Close it back up and put it in a backpack,m73334o,1.0,1i14dzr
comment,m73inzf,Q__________________O,,0,2025-01-14 13:56:44,,,,Some people who do programming and other such tasks prefer vertical space for more lines of text Personally i prefer high refresh rate If i need more lines to read i can scroll,m73334o,1.0,1i14dzr
