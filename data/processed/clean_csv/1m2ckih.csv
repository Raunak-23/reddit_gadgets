comment,n3rs5pb,HonestSonsieFace,,29,2025-07-18 06:21:14,,,,The best description of the different cultural approach to freedom in Europe vs the US I heard was Freedom from vs Freedom to So in Europe socialised healthcare is about citizens living live free from debilitating conditions and medical debt regardless of your wealth In the US its about the freedom to decide for yourself what medical care you receive based on your own personal wealthmeans Gun control is about the freedom from gun violence vs the freedom to own and use a firearm on another person Free speech is freedom from abusehate speechracism vs freedom to say what you want without restriction This extends to private businesses and companies where the government in the US is minded to protect the rights of the company to do what it wants in the pursuit of businesssuccess In Europe companies are more restricted in the interest of ensuring citizens are free from corporate overreach and abuse There are merits to both sides and bad implications of the government leaning too far in one direction,n3nt995,1.0,1m2ckih

comment,n48zdyi,Void-kun,,0,2025-07-20 23:18:21,,,,This is the stupidest thing ever The only difference between our free speech and the US is that you cant just say things to incite terror to someone else you cant verbally abuse someone else Id much rather that be disallowed Why on earth would I want that protected Like why on earth would I want Nazis racists xenophobes and fascists to be protected Because theyre the only type of people that benefit from the US version of free speech compared to free speech in most parts of Europe We can and do criticize politicians openly because we have a democracy were allowed to protest were allowed to speak out Not sure where youve heard this but its false The only places in Europe that dont allow this are places like Russia which are currently allies with the US What youre describing is an Authoritarian government which funnily enough is what the US are moving towards Trump also wants to do away with free speech as you know it so yeah good luck Sources Trump Calls On Congress To Pass The Take It Down ActSo He Can Censor His Critics Electronic Frontier Foundation only China Russia and North Korea censor at this level No Trump Did Not Bring Back Free Speech TIME,n48ras5,3.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3y6yal,weespid,,1,2025-07-19 05:45:04,,,,Yes console was banned from online services however the console was mostly still perfectly usable Games where distributed on disks not virtual game cards Also Im 90 sure it woud have still been considered a main console so installed games would still work Not 100 on that This is pre the main console thing when msft still used points but The switch 2 is you put in a mig switch card you get banned and loose access to any games and as the switch 2 has to be your main console essentially the account as well Putting a burned disk in the drive of a unmodified 360 would not result in a ban There are lots of similarities and there definitely where edge cases on the 360 where you lost content on a ban with the 360,n3pit44,2.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3rxdid,multithreadedprocess,,0,2025-07-18 07:07:39,,,,If Nintendo is Evil there is literally not a single dev out there who is good then Youre so close Here If Nintendo is Evil there is literally not barely a single dev big publisher out there who is good then Nintendo makes good games and has good game dev teams They dont make the consoles they dont publish the games they dont handle marketing they dont make the web services or the shop Thats other dev departments marketing and the executives The problem never was and never has been with the studios Some are shitty cough Blizzard cough but the publishers are almost always in need of a sanitary cordon for the sheer greed and desire for control that exudes out of them like a toxic miasma not the numerous devspublishers pumping out gacha games or insane predatory tactics with microtransactions You mean scams and gambling Thats the kind of scum that almost doesnt even need constructive criticism They need jail and fines Those publishers arent even worthy of being in the same conversation as anti consumer behaviour those are just third rate petty criminals And while I can agree that Nintendo has forcefully done bad things So youre going to chastise them for the shit they did wrong then right Not proceed to defend them right they are by no means the worst devpublisher in the industry If not being the worst is the bar before we start substantively criticizing shitty behaviour I guess we can all lie and steal as long as a single murderer still exists on this earth right They dont get a wink and a wave for being less shitty than dogshit They do creatively stupid bad shit They give other people creative shit ideas to also do They dont get a pass They first and foremost make good fun complete games without being littered with microtransactions They dont As a business they primarily make proprietary gaming platforms and merchandise The games are the vehicle for those platforms and merchandise to make money The games are good Again first party Nintendo game studios are not the problem here Their platforms are the problem Their publishing arm is the problem When you have a good hearted guy come do landscaping for you with shit tools and a shit schedule and goes above and beyond to provide a decent service just for his boss at the landscaping company to overcharge you and tell you to eat it is it the labourers fault youre getting screwed You might as well just quit gaming if thats your opinion You do know that theres an entire world of videogames old and new in a million different platforms from a million different publishers besides console exclusive first party games right which is already infinitely better than 99 of the industry Only if by industry you close your eyes and forget anything exists but EA Ubisoft Sony and Microsoft Thats ironically much closer to 1 of the industry than 99 Even middling publishers like Atlus ship an amount of games in parity with those big names This sounds more like you saying if Marvel is shit than the whole movie industry must be shit when theres more movies coming out of France in one film festival then the entire Marvel catalog,n3po2g9,5.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3q6zrv,Shouly,,10,2025-07-17 23:54:47,,,,So you are just as pissed at sony and xbox for not making hall effect controller Not pissed at the 3 hour battery life of ps5 controllers which is pathetic in 2025 or their ps5 pro controller that costs over 200 and doesnt even have hall effect sticks for that price and still only a battery life of 10 hours,n3pq05k,6.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3qkx6t,evangelism2,,-4,2025-07-18 01:17:07,,,,Neither xbox or ps5 controller is 85 bucks They also havent had the prolific drift issues the Switch 1 joycons had They also came out years ago And at least you dont have totally rip the PS5 controller apart to get to the battery Pick one of those reasons why nintendo is worse then them instead of just uselessly whataboutisming Also when you go to the subs for xbox or ps5 people shit on those controllers where when you go to rNintendoSwitch2 all you see are people going i never had drift i dont care if its unrepairable i like getting fucked by nintendo the switch 1 pro controller is the best controller ever made even when this is demonstrably false and third party controllers are far better and cheaper than any first party anymore Thats my main point,n3q6zrv,7.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3qqknu,Shouly,,6,2025-07-18 01:51:28,,,,Replacing the stick on a ps5 pad is a million times more annoying than a joycon I had 2 ps5 pads drift one i gifted to someone started to drift too all in under a year My joycon started drifting too after 12 years same with a mate of mine Why would i rip my ps5 controller apart to get to the battery The issue is that the charge last for like 3 hours out of the box The joycon battery is replaced in like 5min but never had to do that or know of anyone that had to so not sure what that point is Your really showing your fanboyism with your second paragraph too There are tons of threads and comments on nintendo subreddits talking about drift Ofc people on a nintendo sub are gonna hype their controller and call it the best but that is the same in xbox and sony subs Shit there are even pc players saying the steam controller is the best The point your trying to make again makes no sense Just admit you have an unreasonable hatred for nintendo and that your biased its obvious for everyone already anyway And dont even bither calling me a fanbox or whatever you guys too when your backed into a corner i have plenty of things i hate about nintendo but like any reasonable person i dont just see black and white or fight useless console wars that were last relevant 20 years ago,n3qkx6t,8.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3rk2d2,resplendence4,,1,2025-07-18 05:12:55,,,,Neither xbox or ps5 controller is 85 bucks Youre right its only 75 plus tax when purchasing direct from Sony The Switch 2 Pro Controller is 10 more expensive which is a trivial difference when talking about the purchase price of new hardware,n3qkx6t,8.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3tzb3s,evangelism2,,0,2025-07-18 15:28:32,,,,Yeah its cheaper They were also made before the drift issues became mainstream No amount is trivial its a 13 drop Guess how much a hall effect replacement kit is for the PS5 Just over 10 bucks for 2 controllers Which again goes back to my original point Nintendo refusing to just move to hall or tmr is just plain arrogance or ignorance,n3rk2d2,9.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3pvtex,None,,4,2025-07-17 22:52:47,,,,far more than most companies So do you just blatantly admit youve never heard of most companies Like continuing to not use hall effect or tmr sensors on their joycons and overpriced unrepairable pro controller The vast majority of people wont have issues with joycons And calling them an evil company because of this is a complete utter joke Nintendo doesnt or rarely lays off people And what this is the big evil lmao,n3pq05k,6.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3on1wz,stellvia2016,,12,2025-07-17 19:10:50,,,,And in that hypothetical situation you could call support and show them the genuine cart to prove ownership or even the receipt from the game shop It would also likely only come up if you were running the game at the same time as the other console and most people that copy games dont take the console online for that very reason that its too risky,n3okz7d,4.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3oo9wr,tj-horner,,22,2025-07-17 19:16:40,,,,This is actually not hypothetical people have reported this exact thing happening to them But like you surmised a quick chat with Nintendo support providing photos of the receipt resolves it So its really a nonissue,n3on1wz,5.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3opvbf,FlyingBishop,,-12,2025-07-17 19:24:24,,,,This assumes that you can get through to Nintendo support and they believe you And even then its not reasonable Nintendo is basically accusing you of a crime and meting out punishment which is not their right they shouldnt be able to do that without a court judgement,n3oo9wr,6.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3q3m5i,stellvia2016,,6,2025-07-17 23:35:41,,,,How is it on a whim when they see 2 people using the same game key online at the same time And youre talking about a tiny handful of cases of this happening across millions of units sold already And they unbanned them when they showed the receipt etc Seems like a reasonable outcome to an extreme edge case Especially since word will get around that you cant use those devices online at all so it will probably happen less over time Either because people stop trying to do it or they do it and dont go online to expose themselves so the person who bought the used game will be none the wiser nor worse for wear,n3pzwjy,9.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3r83vu,DomLite,,2,2025-07-18 03:43:48,,,,In all fairness this is a nonissue for anyone who would be putting custom firmware or homebrew software on their Switch 2 The OG Switch had all kinds of failsafes to prevent firmware rollbacks and custom firmware installation as well as banning anyone who went online while running it The folks who were doing it got around all of that very easily by creating partitions with custom firmware and keeping a basic installation of official firmware if they wanted to play online or ya know they just didnt play online at all They also had easy to use software to manually download updates and install them to the system without ever having to connect to official servers Once someone cracks the Switch 2 there will be similar workarounds so you wont ever need to connect to Nintendo and risk having your console bricked and even if you fuck up and get yourself banned from their online service Oh no boo hoo Guess Ill just have to do it myself now They wont be locking you out of anything and youll be free to install whatever homebrew you desire The threat of being cut off from the servers is only an issue right now because we dont have homebrew running that would allow us to circumvent that problem Its the threat of actual bricking that makes this such a huge issue and if they start leveraging it whatever the reason its completely unacceptable,n3od5q6,3.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3oqkeh,FlyingBishop,,-3,2025-07-17 19:27:43,,,,It depends a bit on the specifics but while in some cases the Switches will be partially functional its obvious that Nintendo will brick devices in some circumstances One obvious one you could imagine you bought a used Switch and lets say the original owners account had been banned because the Switch was modded you do a hard reset and then Nintendo bans your account because you have signed in with a modded console you didnt even know it was modded and now your other switch cant download games and this Switch which was partially functional is now a brick,n3oh6kd,5.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3oxz06,kolonok,,8,2025-07-17 20:03:21,,,,Nope hes right If it was bricked it wouldnt even turn on Bricked means that its completely non functional and its an important distinction because if they actually BRICKED your switch that is significantly different than them saying we dont want you using our online service anymore,n3oqkeh,6.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3o7v5g,DiZial,,10,2025-07-17 17:58:39,,,,Its still going to damage the preowned market but this wasnt simply a game that was previously on a different account What happened is that the ID was detected simultaneously on more than 1 account The person who sold the game was still playing a dumped version when the new owner started playing from the actual cartridge,n3o2i9z,3.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3t4g00,Edward_TH,,1,2025-07-18 12:55:18,,,,Wat No those units are actually really valuable for the first steps in developing custom firmware etc because while still bound to what is official software they generally offer much deeper insights into how the hardware works and how resources gets called in an easier package No golden bullet just less guessing and probing around PCBs and memory chips They can cut months or even YEARS in developing unofficial software sometimes Its like having access to the files a programs uses instead of just having the program already running Its no source code but it can be very valuable,n3o6rws,3.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3ucjwi,MeatSafeMurderer,,2,2025-07-18 16:31:00,,,,I think you misunderstood me The homebrew scene is not only homebrew Its the entire development scene on each respective console Homebrew isnt just games its any code you wrote yourself and that includes the exploits And yes some old dev units were usefulbut its not 2003 anymore Sony Nintendo and Microsoft are all much more careful these daysand thats besides the point that a console that was mistakenly flashed with a dev firmware wont have any leaked code on it in the first place because for that yo happen it has to be used for development first The actual firmware is every bit as locked down as on a retail system Often moreso since as I already said they usually cant even run retail games anymore and require special development or socalled debug builds,n3tt9i1,6.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3p4sgw,fullmetaljackass,,1,2025-07-17 20:35:35,,,,That was a hardware test firmware not a dev firmware When theyre initially built they have a selftest firmware installed The ones that pass are supposed to get the appropriate firmware for their intended region installed before theyre boxed up but occasionally one slips through the cracks It may lead to some useful discoveries but it isnt anywhere close to being a dev firmwareit cant even run any games,n3o1edy,2.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3uu7ez,Myaaaahhhh,,1,2025-07-18 17:53:02,,,,I didnt answer your question because you can backup Switch Wii U Wii and GameCube games and it is legal for you to do so as long as you make those backups However I believe that Nintendo should have the right to protect Switch 2 software that they published a month ago from being pirated What legitimate and legal reason do you have for making a Switch 2 backup right now Emulators dont yet exist and if your Switch 2 were to break it is most likely covered under warranty Once the Switch 2 matures it is highly probable that you will be able to make backups via a new exploit I actually think manufacturers should provide consumers with the means to do this for discontinued hardware but that is unlikely to ever happen,n3ud5ut,7.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3pvkec,afurtivesquirrel,,2,2025-07-17 22:51:24,,,,This is absurd Bricking a console is bad Microsoft basically do exactly the same thing by explicitly not bricking a PC Firstly youve missed the entire fucking point Even if Microsoft did that to their PCs which they dont the user can 1 Factory reset and install a newdifferent OS 2 Pay for a legitimate copy of the OS they have And the problem would instantly go away The hardware remains entirely usable Secondly note I did not say a pirated copy of Windows You made that up to make your absurd argument sound slightly less absurd I said a pirated copy of MS Word Not pirating the OS but pirating software that runs on the OS That is analogous to pirating a game on the switch Detecting pirated MS word and refusing to run word until you pay Reasonable Detecting pirated windows and refusing to run windows until you pay Reasonable Detecting pirated software and refusing to run the whole OS until you pay Absolutely not reasonable Detecting pirated software or even the OS and permanently bricking the whole fucking device Absurd anticonsumer behaviour Your example isnt even in the same ballpark as what Nintendo are doing And completely misses the point If Nintendo detected a pirated copy of animal crossing and said sorry this copy is pirated you cant play it thats honestly pretty reasonable Bricking the whole console is pretty fucking not,n3o6sve,3.0,1m2ckih

comment,n3ooy5i,Gaeus_,,1,2025-07-17 19:19:56,,,,just let them steal Small rant a bit unrelated IT Lawyer here piracy isnt stealing its lobyist bullshit Piracy is counterfeiting aka making an unauthorized copy to distribute yourself Beauty of it That means you need to distribute to be guilty of counterfeiting and thus piracy For technicality it also means that torrenting something qualify as counterfeiting and thus piracy so unless youre leaching or using warrez you are guilty of counterfeiting when pirating Why did they hammer down so hard on the idea that piracy is stealing Because stealing sound a lot more immoral than printing a new copy As for the rest of your argument Ill only say this piracy is Nintendos problem not their paying customers If theyre willing to punish their entire legitimate playerbase for it Nintendo deserves to be pirated to bankruptcy,n3ob2gl,5.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3rcguv,Catten4,,1,2025-07-18 04:14:40,,,,Hmm well I get the technicality of it being called counterfiting its also abit inaccurate Due to its nature as a programme I mean If we compare to something more of a physical nature the amount of effort needed to copy it compared to a programme is night and day cuz I mean its not like they are making the game themselves with same codingassets Inherently the loss of salesvalue via this form of counterfitting or piracy would be much more serious in comparison due to its ease of access which is why I do believe it is more immoral compared to traditional counterfitting which ya may argue to be the closest to stealing that of a programme considering that ya are indirectly making said programme less valuable by using it as a service for free when ya otherwise had to pay for it,n3ooy5i,6.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3uepuo,Gaeus_,,1,2025-07-18 16:41:28,,,,Hmm well I get the technicality of it being called counterfiting its also abit inaccurate Due to its nature as a programme I mean I did not write the law But still youre making a nearly identical copy the physical copy would always be imperfect while the digital ones are modified to circumvent DRM and distributing it its fitting and thats why this one was chosen since stealing was systematically neutralized by the lack of good being stolen Inherently the loss of salesvalue via this form of counterfitting or piracy would be much more serious in comparison due to its ease of access which is why I do believe it is more immoral compared to traditional counterfitting Not trying to be unnecessarily snarky but you consider redistributing a program for free to be more immoral than redistributing a copy of a physical good for profits And you consider more immoral the redistribution of a program without the involvement of any form of labor over the human trafficking and slavery involved in a large scale counterfeiting operation,n3rcguv,7.0,1m2ckih
comment,n3vjwko,Catten4,,1,2025-07-18 19:59:04,,,,I suppose its moreso how things are portrayed that makes us make an inherent assumption that due to traditional goods and value in what is physical that make us have this inherent assumption that stealing is worst than counterfeiting Though to be clear Im moreso referring to the results of the act itself with relation to the owner of the original The thought process being that when it comes to physical goods stealing itself deprived the owner of the physical goods itself and thereby causes more damage than if someone were to create a counterfeit and indirectly creates loss of sales for the owner This was my inital thought process and one that I believe many hold though it is true that it can be worst since if something is counterfeited even if the owner were to make more the damage is still done from the loss in value in counterfeiting I am ignoring the process as to how the act is done though Since as ya mentioned it could slavery that allows the counterfeit to happen or maybe the person themselves made it with their own effort copying the design Slavery in the scenario ya mention I would consider it a separate offense If someone were to steal something for example and were to kill someone in the process of stealing something I would consider a separate offense to determine and differentiate the average thief who stole something without harming others physically Being a programme however It has its pros of being close to impossible to stealdeprive the owner of the programme itself but is also extremely easy to counterfeit in its exact form with little to no limitations There is a high cost of production of said programme but distribution itself cost little to no amount of cost making its true values tied solely to intangible means However that also means that unlike a physical item where there is some cost for its materials or tangible form being reliant solely on its intangible value means that it can become worthless and the owner be left with nothing similar to stealing A physical item that was counterfeited has to some extent be sold at a price that recoups initial cost It would also take some time to develop and have its effect of reducing the value of the original owner be at a much slower rate However as a programme that cost in terms of money and time is close to neglible which is why it is able to be resold for free or close to free many piracy sites do sell them at a cost or via ad revenue thereby drastically reducing the value of the owners product more and therefore more immoral so to speak imo since it negatively impacts the owner more drastically compared to traditional countefeiting,n3uepuo,8.0,1m2ckih
