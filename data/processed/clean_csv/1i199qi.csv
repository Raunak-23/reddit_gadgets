comment,m74xz7l,None,,65,2025-01-14 18:21:23,,,,People here might poke fun of this but honestly this really hits a target of the non handy home owner I have a friend who hired someone to hang a picture I have friends who think a hammer and tape is all you need They dont want to spend 150 on a drill plus driver combo or things like a stud finder This tool is actually pretty genius,,0.0,1i199qi
comment,m76d3ti,Perverse_psycology,,18,2025-01-14 22:39:27,,,,Yeah the people shitting on this arent the target market Im not either Ive got drills and stud finders and all that This is actually pretty cool though for the average not too handy person All contained in a neat little package and probably comes in one of those plastic clamshells for storage like other Dremel stuff Most people dont have the need or desire to have a bunch of tools laying around taking up space E Honestly even though I have all those tools for 100 bucks Im kind of interested Might actually be pretty handy Id probably grab one if I saw it on a decent sale Ive already got one of their 12v cordless rotary tools anyways,m74xz7l,1.0,1i199qi
comment,m7ab875,ParacelsusTBvH,,2,2025-01-15 15:40:28,,,,Yeah the convenience factor might still make it worth it A lot of my tools are in my garage at or near my work bench For small projects upstairs if the level and stud finder are adequate it might be a welcome addition,m76d3ti,2.0,1i199qi
comment,m76q6tv,jucs206,,17,2025-01-14 23:50:32,,,,Carpenter here Stud finders are generally trash I use a strong magnet that I bought from dollar tree to find the studs Cheap and works great,m74xz7l,1.0,1i199qi
comment,m7d3nn1,Riegel_Haribo,,2,2025-01-15 23:49:50,,,,Until you find that the guy who put in the screws didnt use a stud finder We figured out a gimmick for this drill that sucks worse than any made,m76q6tv,2.0,1i199qi
comment,m7d53oy,jucs206,,1,2025-01-15 23:57:53,,,,Yes poor craftsmanship is poor craftsmanship But it works pretty much every time Find a screw confirm the stud is there by finding a couple more screws either above and below If what i am hanging is heavy Ill still confirm a stud is my desired location by drilling a small test hole Its great when hanging interior items like shelves and I know I cant rely on a standard 16OC or 24OC layout,m7d3nn1,3.0,1i199qi
comment,m79ito2,nalc,,2,2025-01-15 12:53:27,,,,Needs to go one step forward and have USBC charging on it A couple brands have done basic USBC on their 4v tools but with either USB PD or some additional electronics in the screwdriver they should be able to get a way for the 12v battery to charge That would really take it to the next level for casual use,m74xz7l,1.0,1i199qi
comment,m7ibf9c,Goddamn_Grongigas,,1,2025-01-16 20:11:24,,,,Every stud finder Ive ever owned never worked right Just went off everytime I touched them,m74xz7l,1.0,1i199qi
comment,m76g6sa,get_it_together1,,-20,2025-01-14 22:55:34,,,,As someone who started with a shitty corded drill this gadget sucks and its meant for people who have no idea about anything and theyll never use the features anyhow Drivers with builtin lights are seem to be far more useful Stud finders are super cheap but you can also just tap on the wall with your knuckles and drill a bunch of holes and guess Attaching the stud finder to the driver makes them both worse and same for the laser level,m74xz7l,1.0,1i199qi

comment,m74mn8f,runningoutofnames01,,10,2025-01-14 17:26:59,,,,At that price point I would buy a better quality drill then a cheap level and stud finder magnetic ones can be found dirt cheap Dremel brand definitely isnt my top choice for tools You could probably pick up a Ridgid drill with battery plus a stud finder and level for about 100 then youre at least building your tool set batteries around a decent brand with expandibility Nothing sucks more than picking a mediocre brand and finding out they no longer make tools in a couple of years or their product line doesnt have the tools you need later,m74gkhv,1.0,1i199qi
comment,m7fbit3,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2025-01-16 09:29:34,,,,Youre basically a totally different kind of human being than the target demo who might own zero tools normally and usually pay a TaskRabbit person or their apartment handyman to merely hang a picture frame,m74mn8f,2.0,1i199qi
