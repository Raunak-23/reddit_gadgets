comment,lw3k9tg,SpaceGoonie,,186,2024-11-08 16:11:39,,,,If gamers would just exercise a modicum of self control they could easily kill off the scalpers business model Just dont buy from them Wait until you can get it from retail Being an early adopter might be exciting but doing it at an inflated cost that supports a scumbag business model is bad for everyone,,0.0,1gmlgvc

comment,lw5sm3g,Omegalazarus,,6,2024-11-08 22:54:35,,,,That would make sense except people especially heavy users exhaust the product either way So they get the same amount of use either way but they do get to start that use sooner,lw4hvvf,3.0,1gmlgvc

comment,lw3gsb3,x_scion_x,,2,2024-11-08 15:54:35,,,,not likely The scalpers that are pulling this off are more than likely the ones that have bots and plenty of CCs to utilize while being joined to the groups that give early warnings of sales That said possibly a handful did that,lw3fxpa,2.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw3krao,KyuubiWindscar,,7,2024-11-08 16:14:00,,,,they are Sometimes a scalper can get 100 consoles or something before anyone else can but they usually work in groups and split pay that way Its the reason it went from only special edition stuff to every major retail release being a target So if that inventory sits thats lost money because now youre a retailer and not just an asshole lol,lw3fd0b,1.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw3mm69,x_scion_x,,2,2024-11-08 16:23:01,,,,Wasnt aware that they split it like that That would make sense I guess but even then whomever returned it could give the money back to the pot,lw3krao,2.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw3nqcx,KyuubiWindscar,,1,2024-11-08 16:28:25,,,,Youd get part of the investment back but Im willing to bet more scalper groups than not have an entry fee that they say the first check will cover and then some when they start moving consoles Too bad this isnt the short stock 2020 release so thats burning a hole lol Another factor is that they wont fold this soon so this is just potential money they have to wait out on because returning at the start of release like this is a bad business strategy too,lw3mm69,3.0,1gmlgvc

comment,lw46s1d,hgs25,,2,2024-11-08 18:00:12,,,,I remember a lot of stores stopped issuing refunds on the scalped consoles Other times is because the scalper bought too many and is now outside the return window anyway,lw3fd0b,1.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw473db,x_scion_x,,3,2024-11-08 18:01:43,,,,Other times is because the scalper bought too many and is now outside the return window anyway I could see that but not when it was released yesterday,lw46s1d,2.0,1gmlgvc

comment,lw3lsjh,PageOthePaige,,4,2024-11-08 16:19:00,,,,I get the sentiment but much of this has either been true for decades or isnt blankety dismissable Prices have stayed under inflation and competition has forced generous sales that werent common 20 years ago DLCs is really blanket CDProjectRed and Fromsoft dlcs have consistently been ridiculously high quality Super Mario Sunshine Windwaker and Demons Souls all shipped with parts visibly missing and are still loved games Scalpers suck but thats largely a supply chain issue And scalpers of ps pros isnt really an issue since the pro sucks anyway lmao,lw3hpqi,1.0,1gmlgvc

comment,lw4e25c,Renive,,0,2024-11-08 18:35:50,,,,Explain to me please how the demand for them is so much higher than consoles itselves What is the secret sauce Why people buy the drive but not the console In order to want to buy it from scalpers or from store you have to have console or ordered one Is this everyone now tries to be scalper Same situation with stick replacements for Edge but at least there the stocks are low but thats not the case with drives Sony is pumping them because they know most people who buy Slim or Pro want one,,0.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw6jfd6,Xerain0x009999,,1,2024-11-09 01:31:16,,,,If sony wanted every PS5 Pro owner to be able to have a drive they wouldnt have made it separate The reason to sell the drive separately is so that they can limit the number of people who can buy used games and share discs between friends to a number significantly lower than that of people who own PS5 Pros Now this isnt quite the end game theyre sold still boiling the frog So its not like theyre going to put a hard cap on drives produced and never make more But theyre in no rush to meet the demand for them If its inconvenient to get the drive and a must have game is about to launch some of the people who want a drive but cant get one in time are going to be trained to buy digital instead instead of physical,lw4e25c,1.0,1gmlgvc
comment,lw8bn9q,BigCommieMachine,,0,2024-11-09 10:39:13,,,,The issue as has been previously pointed out is Sony didnt understand that the people that spend 700 on a PS5 Pro are the same people that spend 150 on the collectors edition of games Those people want a physical copy Yes Maybe the majority of the market who exclusively play Madden and CoD dont care about the disc drive but the people who are buying a PS5 Pro do You wouldnt sell a Porsche with a 18L 4 Cylinder engine because research show that is all the average driver needs,,0.0,1gmlgvc
