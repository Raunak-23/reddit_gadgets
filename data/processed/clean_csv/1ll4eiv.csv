post,1ll4eiv,a_Ninja_b0y,The Switch 2's super sluggish LCD screen is 10 times slower than a typical gaming monitor and 100 times slower than an OLED panel according to independent testing,7836,2025-06-26 16:20:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1ll4eiv/the_switch_2s_super_sluggish_lcd_screen_is_10/,849.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mzwvgy9,ednerjn,,1239,2025-06-26 16:56:22,,,,i found this article talking about the same thing and I liked the way they explained Our best guess is that Nintendo has not implemented overdrive to conserve power Overdrive applies a higher voltage to the LCD layer to force it to transition faster higher voltage equals higher power consumption Thats fine on a desktop monitor plugged into the wall but not fine on a handheld device with a tiny 193 Wh battery,,0.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzynurw,Daigonik,,589,2025-06-26 22:08:43,,,,The Switch 2 is already super power constrained as it is I understand why they made that decision if thats the case they likely thought not many of their consumers would notice or care I would love it if they enabled the option for those who wanna trade a bit of battery life for more motion clarity if possible I dont know how these things work,mzwvgy9,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzysmj3,GUMBYtheOG,,177,2025-06-26 22:34:55,,,,Im a 34 yo gaming nerd and usually get ever console on release I avoided switch 2 1 because not many adult friendly exclusives when I got switch 1 and 2 they usually port down the road I doubt most kids will care about screen load times If youre that technical about screen shit you likely would not be using a switch very much unless youre into Nintendo style games not knocking if u are,mzynurw,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzz3s9b,24bitNoColor,,116,2025-06-26 23:37:13,,,,I doubt most kids will care about screen load times If youre that technical about screen shit you likely would not be using a switch very much unless youre into Nintendo style games not knocking if u are Back when I was a young kid the difference in smearing between the bad Game Boy screen and the for the time better Game Gear was already something understood let alone later on when the first LCD screens came known for that very problem They might not understand it but they will see especially in scrolling 2D titles the difference compared to ALL other screens they are used to,mzysmj3,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n022tgw,NuclearLunchDectcted,,57,2025-06-27 12:57:02,,,,Counterpoint I had both and my dad refused to buy more batteries for the Game Gear after a certain point It would eat up 6 or 8 I forget AA batteries in something like 5 hours I had the car adapter and the wall adapter but portable was in massive quotes when it required hundreds of dollars in batteries My Game Boy originalnoncolor would last weeks on a set of AAs,mzz3s9b,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n02vbrb,tha_dank,,27,2025-06-27 15:22:18,,,,Dude game gear had to be like 25 of battery sales in those few years it was poppin It got to a point where mine just wouldnt buy me batteries for it and I was either playing with it plugged in with our super funny 4 prong charging cable or nothing at all How the fuck will I direct the lemmings off the cliff if I got no batteries Thats the point of that game right,n022tgw,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n05ahib,3dforlife,,2,2025-06-27 22:31:51,,,,I had the Game Gear too and it needed 6 batteries Needless to say I used it with batteries exactly one time and for the rest of its life it remained plugged to the wall,n022tgw,5.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n01d63n,diacewrb,,5,2025-06-27 09:49:56,,,,The game gear also had a colour screen that would have been the bigger difference between it and the gameboy Although it chewed up 6 AA batteries in less than 4 hours which wasnt ideal for a handheld vs the 10 to 12 hours on 4 AA batteries in the gameboy,mzz3s9b,4.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzz4ns0,GUMBYtheOG,,23,2025-06-26 23:42:16,,,,True but also as a kid not like I had a choice Either that or nothing Especially now since literally there is no alternative if u want to play a switch 2 game Can cry all u want either play it or dont are parentskids going to complain their 5 yos switch loads to slow for their liking,mzz3s9b,4.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n0058zz,FlyingBishop,,13,2025-06-27 03:25:58,,,,The thing is that Nintendo is all about the firstparty titles where they do the art with the hardware in mind A lot of game design firms just chase raw poly count and raw refresh rate which has some value but Nintendo isnt going for photorealism And photorealism has stopped being that good a target to shoot for anyway,mzz3s9b,4.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n03lxii,GrimSlayer,,1,2025-06-27 17:26:56,,,,Maybe but as a 35 year old I didnt notice any issues personally when playing through and beating New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe all the way through on my switch primarily in handheld mode Just started the Luigi U DLC and same thing Obviously the screen issues are there on paper but if I hadnt seen these article Id be none the wiser,mzz3s9b,4.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n0169cy,BoxOfDemons,,0,2025-06-27 08:43:15,,,,Well considering the Game Gear was about 70 more expensive thats not very surprising Its the same reason the ps3 got its ass handed to it by the 360 especially near launch despite the fact that it had free online play,n00oi71,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n018xh1,celebrar,,2,2025-06-27 09:09:19,,,,Yes so most kids didnt care about the screen quality as much as other factor eg price I mean not kids obv they werent making the purchase decisions but you get my point,n0169cy,6.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n038sqc,AgentCarbine,,1,2025-06-27 16:25:25,,,,Same age range as you It has been known for years in the gaming world at least I thought it was that you never get consoles at launch Always have problems flaws you name it I always wait 12 years so not only is it a flawless console after all the defects have been sorted out but also cheaper and a larger selection of games,mzysmj3,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n08y7rg,msondo,,1,2025-06-28 14:44:03,,,,What exactly is an adult friendly game I am an adult probably older than you my first console was the 2600 and unless its specifically a game made for young children I find myself able to play just about anything and find most of Nintendos first party games fun and challenging I tend to have all of the consoles including a gaming PC and dont really distinguish between games as being adult friendly though some are definitely not child friendly,mzysmj3,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n01govk,Eruannster,,-1,2025-06-27 10:21:27,,,,This is kind of a weird take Just because they have a pretty young audience its okay to skimp on quality Its one thing to overlook if the devices you sell are pretty cheap but the Switch 2 is still a pretty expensive device People give Nintendo way too much leeway to do a halfassed job because they make games they like and they have good memories of playing MarioZeldaMetroid growing up If Sony or Microsoft had made similar oversights that Nintendo are making right now with a Playstation or Xbox device they would have been dragged through the mud and made a laughing stock by the entire internet,mzysmj3,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzz3egq,24bitNoColor,,1,2025-06-26 23:35:01,,,,The Switch 2 is already super power constrained as it is I understand why they made that decision if thats the case they likely thought not many of their consumers would notice or care How do you agree with the decision when you dont even know how much per not running overdrive is costing Because driving the LCD panel isnt that big of a power cost to begin with the back panel brightness is,mzynurw,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04iqp4,SmoogzZ,,1,2025-06-27 20:05:30,,,,Nah stop with the cope Theres 0 0 reason in 2025 they cant produce a handheld with semi up to date hardware Its genuinely noticeable how constrained everything is that Nintendo does Start being honest with how nintendo stacks up with the industry standard,mzynurw,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04p6n2,Daigonik,,1,2025-06-27 20:37:53,,,,There is nothing in the handheld that isnt up to industry standards but the screen and even then it has good specs except for the response times If it had better specs than it has it would one over 500 dollars you think people would be willing to pay that,n04iqp4,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzz34ae,24bitNoColor,,85,2025-06-26 23:33:25,,,,Our best guess is that Nintendo has not implemented overdrive to conserve power Overdrive applies a higher voltage to the LCD layer to force it to transition faster higher voltage equals higher power consumption Thats fine on a desktop monitor plugged into the wall but not fine on a handheld device with a tiny 193 Wh battery I would call that explanation accurate but the conclusion that this is a good thing nonsense Better LCD Smartphones before they switched to OLED didnt even have that much of a late 90s era amount of blur nor are other LCD handhelds close to this bad If you cant even show a 60hz signal wo tons of smearing let alone the 120hz you advertise than you are saving at the wrong end,mzwvgy9,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n00nnw2,Naud1993,,25,2025-06-27 05:47:28,,,,Nobody will ever see a finished frame to unless they are standing still By the time the next frame is loaded at 60 fps the current frame is only half done with updating pixels At 120 fps its only a quarter done Screens should always be fast enough to change all the pixels by at least the end of the frame Not literally multiple frames later,mzz34ae,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n016tf7,KMFN,,26,2025-06-27 08:48:44,,,,This is an excellent point as well that I think most people dont appreciate The response time itself is a problem but the most important is really refresh compliance which i believe techspotHUB calls it The ability of the screen to even refresh within the given 8ms which is required if you even want to call it 120hz I guess its no different than them advertising HDR in spite of the fact that there is no local dimming to speak off and a lack of any meaningful brightness as well And their testing show very unremarkable contrast unsurprisingly Its just back to back false marketing They took a shitty at that 60hz display and turned it into a 120HDR one for marketing purposes,n00nnw2,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n019706,Naud1993,,1,2025-06-27 09:11:54,,,,Doee it even have 10001 contrast Manufacturers love to use that number even if the contrast is lower just liks how they use 1 ms response time regardless of the actual response time Although its not like 10001 contrast is that rare or good to begin with My monitor has only a 4001 contrast ratio when it was tested Absolutely horrible I cant watch a dark scene without constantly noticing it,n016tf7,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n01aiib,KMFN,,4,2025-06-27 09:24:45,,,,It just about clears 10001 in testing Has no local dimming ofc and 430 nits peak brightness 2 window In other words no theres not a single specification here that would warrant HDR marketing,n019706,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n03214l,Lyreganem,,2,2025-06-27 15:53:38,,,,They made sure it does 98 P3 colour And thats basically the ONLY spec that complies with the HDR requirements It fails on EVERY other level,n01aiib,6.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzzgahl,seaQueue,,8,2025-06-27 00:51:25,,,,Theyre constrained in a couple of ways Both handheld power budget and display cost are at play here I can totally understand why they made this choice even if I dont like the result At a guess it probably would have cost them significantly more money for a power efficient fast display in their bespoke size than what they went with That or they couldnt find anyone to make a bespoke part with better specs in the quantity they needed,mzz34ae,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n00weju,IchVerliereImmer,,20,2025-06-27 07:06:29,,,,Its Nintendo every Display manufacturer knows they can and will sell millions of devices And that argument also seems weird considering OLED Screens like one the switch 1 pull more power than VA IPS TN Id guess the thought was This costs 2 usd per unit more lets get the shit one and make even more money selling an oled Version later Nintendo already is the only company making profits selling their Hardware compared to PS and Xbox Imo theyre just greedy,mzzgahl,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n0124uh,favorite_time_of_day,,1,2025-06-27 08:02:07,,,,Have you used a Switch 2 The super sluggish LCD is news to me it looks gorgeous I remember actual super sluggish screens the original Gameboy was like that And we played it anyway The Switch 2 is nothing like that,mzz34ae,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n017czt,BoxOfDemons,,2,2025-06-27 08:54:02,,,,Its as slow as 33ms pixel response That means at 60fps by the time youre on the second frame the first frame isnt even halfway done being displayed Its convenient for you that it doesnt bother you but its very very noticeable for many people and not just something they are imagining,n0124uh,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n02ylpf,favorite_time_of_day,,1,2025-06-27 15:37:46,,,,The point is not whether it bothers me the point is whether this is another one of those Im an audiophile and my speakers are unacceptably plush Even if it doesnt bother me I should be able to at least detect it I started up Mario Kart to try and figure out what you could possibly be talking about and I realized that I have absolutely no way of telling the difference between this and the artificial motion blurring that every game does now as a special effect Certainly there is nothing there which seems at all off Mario Kart is fast enough with enough full screen movement that this should be a problem if it is indeed a problem at all Albeit Mario Kart is also a bright and colorful game and bright bright transitions are going to be faster than bright dark transitions The grey transitions that youre talking about in that artificial testing are a worst case scenario the actual transition time will be faster Maybe if they port Mad World to the Switch 2 then it could be an issue Perhaps But its going to take something like that a moody black and white game which also has a lot of action,n017czt,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n032peb,Lyreganem,,3,2025-06-27 15:56:45,,,,It primarily affects LATERAL movement Which isnt huge in Mario Kart But play any sidescroller or move the viewpoint quickly in a FPS TPS game and you would be blind not to notice it Heck just page through your installed games in the menu fast enough and it is BLINDINGLY obvious,n02ylpf,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04ioix,BoxOfDemons,,2,2025-06-27 20:05:11,,,,Its odd that you cant detect it but count yourself lucky I havent even bought one yet because Im waiting for more exclusives My friend bought one on launch day and showed me He just handed me it on the main menu and said scroll the tiles and tell me what you notice and it was blindingly obvious to me He told me it was the first thing he noticed as well This was before there were YouTube videos and articles talking about it so I can assure you its something we could both immediately notice,n02ylpf,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n012rk1,Trzlog,,18,2025-06-27 08:08:21,,,,The article ends up being fair towards the Switch 2 display As someone who largely analyzes PC gaming monitors what do I think of the Switch 2s display overall Well its not the best display weve ever seen but we are talking about a handheld gaming device so comparisons to desktop monitors are only fair up to a certain point Compared to the original Switch 1 LCD the Switch 2 is generally an upgrade Its larger and higher resolution which makes it more enjoyable to use Its brighter and has a wider color gamut which gives it additional vibrance and it subjectively produces betterlooking images because of this It also has better reflection handling so while the contrast ratio isnt improved in actual usage conditions it has better apparent black depth And it supports more advanced technologies like variable refresh and a 120Hz refresh rate Honestly I think its weird to compare a screen like this to full PC monitors that are permanently plugged in with few power use limitations Reviews of other handheld devices show results that are far more comparable to the Switch 2s display Its clear the display is undervolted and has no overdrive to maintain halfway decent battery life and that it was necessary to maintain the overall display quality in the face of the Switch 2s much more powerful SoC and its comparatively small battery Like the S2 display is brighter has a higher resolution and its larger compared to the S1 LCD All of this has a big impact on battery life,mzwvgy9,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n0pptci,Its_Broken,,3,2025-07-01 06:05:17,,,,like most of reddit you fit right in adding to this playing handheld on my bed or on the train i have literally never noticed the screen being slow and Ive played on 1ms 165hz displays for luke 3 years now the screen looks better handheld than the switch 1 did and most adults that care treat it more like a traditional console kept in the dock 247 anyways,n02hm6f,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n008b0r,lawrence1024,,4,2025-06-27 03:47:21,,,,Does the switch 2 really only have 193 Wh Thats less than a lot of phones these days For comparisons sake a phone with that capacity would be advertised as about 5000 mAh Although its really silly to me that batteries are advertised in amp hours when a consumer might unknowingly be comparing devices with different battery voltages Not typically with phones but in general I mean,mzwvgy9,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n033m3b,whilst,,3,2025-06-27 16:00:59,,,,Which for anyone who doesnt know would mean a battery size of 185 Wh since lithium ion batteries have a nominal voltage of 37V 5Ah 37V 185Wh EDIT Sidenote theres an actual unit for energy and its bizarre to me we dont use it and keep trying to invent new ways to label batteries like mAh and Wh Why is it we dont measure battery size in Joules,n008b0r,2.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n037cn3,lawrence1024,,5,2025-06-27 16:18:35,,,,My problem with joules is that theyre a very small unit Its hard for me to quantify 1 joule but a watt hour makes sense intuitively,n033m3b,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n047xu6,whilst,,2,2025-06-27 19:11:18,,,,But it makes sense intuitively because of the two weve made Watts the one everyone knows about Which again of the two Watts is by far the less intuitive The idea that Watts are a rate is confusing every other rate we see frames per second miles per gallon has the word per in it and that explains to us what it is That watts is synonymous with joules per second is very nonobvious and walls energy use off from intuitive understanding And then saying watts is synonymous with watthours per hour is even more confusing Its a shame we dont trade in kilojoules and kilojoules per hour in common parlance That has a direct analogy to gallons of gas which were familiar with,n037cn3,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04a3d4,lawrence1024,,3,2025-06-27 19:21:52,,,,I think that the only reason watts exists is because joules per second is kind of a mouthful I feel like if we had a different name for watthour that took away the hour it would be less confusing for people because they see the time unit and assume its a rate Eg power is measured watts and energy is measured in spouls super joules where 1 spoul 36 kilojoules 1 watthour Then wed measure large amounts of energy in kilospouls and megaspouls,n047xu6,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04gf2q,whilst,,1,2025-06-27 19:53:45,,,,I think that the only reason watts exists is because joules per second is kind of a mouthful I mean no more so than miles per hour I think its handy to have a short form if its something you find yourself saying all day if youre a scientist or an engineer but for most people joules per hour is both easy enough and easy to understand Not to mention watthours is nearly as much of a mouthful as joules per hour while also not having nearly as clear of a meaning to the layperson I feel like if we had a different name for watthour that took away the hour it would be less confusing for people because they see the time unit and assume its a rate Im not suggesting that we rename watthours Im suggesting that we delete that unit fully from the public lexicon The resulting discussion of adding yet another new unit spouls goes even further away from my suggestion of just we already have a unit lets just use it as is,n04a3d4,6.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04nwjh,lawrence1024,,2,2025-06-27 20:31:24,,,,I definitely see the merit to your point Keep in mind that since joules are so small people would likely need to say kilojoules per hour or megajoules per hour which makes it an even bigger mouthful Where Im from people often say clicks instead of kilometers per hour but I guess there isnt really a shorthand for miles per hour I feel like if the standard unit of energy had been a larger easier to understand amount like a calorie kilocalorie we might have ended up saying unit per hour just like we say liters per minute hour for the flow rate of liquids,n04gf2q,7.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n058mmp,whilst,,2,2025-06-27 22:21:14,,,,I suppose its always possible that wed have done exactly what we did with your example and used joule as shorthand for kilojoule Which maybe Id be here complaining about it like an asshole Though it does seem like people in metric countries dont need a new unit so as not to have to say kilometers per hour kilojoules per hour is fewer syllables,n04nwjh,8.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0qnh6o,Mightyena319,,1,2025-07-01 11:22:41,,,,The thing with speeds is that generally the units are omitted in day to day life because the units are implied generally youd say Im doing fifty and not put the unit at the end Which I suppose you could also do with power consumption but this TV does 56 feels clunkier and more prone to misinterpretation Also kilometers are often abbreviated to klicks,n058mmp,9.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n022ml1,gbeezy007,,3,2025-06-27 12:55:54,,,,It seems this is mostly due to size on the switch The battery would actually be good if they didnt have some odd must be super skinny like a tablet ish Its efficient enough to have good battery The rog Ally had a 40wh and the X has 80wh and they are about the same dims WxH just not thickness A 40wh probably would not make the switch any less enjoyable as a handheld size wise but double battery life which would increase enjoying it as a handheld,mzz2z8p,2.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n0x1m42,alidan,,1,2025-07-02 10:16:48,,,,refresh rate is what the hardware behind the screen can produce response time is how fast pixels can respond to a chance in their output input delay has several different factors 1 monitors absolute delay if everything is perfect it will always have X delay in showing you a result 2 the delay in hardware rendering and outputing a given frame 3 the delay between human interface interaction and the signal getting to the device and hitting the cpu so it knows to do something NOW given what the article says average pixel response time of 33 ms at 60 hz that means the average pixel transition is 33ms which is 303 frames a second if you feed it 60fps that means there is going to be a ghost frame and 120 would be 4 frames of ghosting or a smeary mess the article isnt talking about latency its not talking about refresh rate its talking about response time for pixel color shifts,n0mwvo6,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0xpfhq,Dependent-Mode-3119,,1,2025-07-02 13:02:51,,,,I agree with what youre saying There are people here trying to claim that the screen cant display above 30fps because of the response time which is false It will have ghosting but it can definitely display 60 and above and it is noticeable when it is Someone in this thread that the screens 33ms response time was the reason for the input delay in their online games which is another conflation that I keep seeing,n0x1m42,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n1162jh,alidan,,1,2025-07-02 23:21:11,,,,This is a hard argument when you dont have examples in front of you I doubt the switch 2 ips is going to be as bad as my monitors dark to dark smearing but I will use mine as an example in any lighter area my monitor is capable of switching color at under refresh rate my monitor is only able to do 60 but dark to dark I would be hard pressed to say its able to do even 15 frames a second with full color transitions now YES it is smoother than 15fps but at the cost of everything blurs out to hell and back and I would rather limit the frame rate to lower than response time than have it be smoother just because the clarity of the image is impacted that much the switch 2 has a few things going for it with dlss already adding in blurry frames unreal being a garbage engine for image clarity taa being adopted by so many engines that even if they had a perfect 120hz display you would still see smearing that looks like its a screen problem im guessing they are not anticipating this version of the switch to last long and an oled version will take over so they are using the base version as a stop gap or they made the base version so bad that the oled will look even better in comparison,n0xpfhq,6.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzyva8l,DFrostedWangsAccount,,2,2025-06-26 22:49:49,,,,Nah I wouldnt expect a midgeneration update like the first switch got That wasnt planned The original switch had a less bespoke processor it was basically an off the shelf android tablet processsor that ran nintendos custom OS However there are a lot of people in the modding community with tons of experience getting into android and it wasnt long before they realized power vol up home button on boot still got you to recovery mode From there installing a custom OS is identical to a phone or tablet The only issue was that the home button on the controller isnt the android home button but they found some pins on the right joycon rail that would send the home button signal when shorted together So basically Nintendo had to modify the hardware on the switch to prevent that signal from getting through and they also changed to a different processor that happened to be more powerful than they needed it to be So they downclocked it to work like the original one which gives the refreshed system better battery life than the OG It was really just a coincidental upgrade,mzyaegn,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwxcvd,FunctionalFun,,2,2025-06-26 17:05:03,,,,Its not unimportant though A 30ms delay is really noticeable in first person games or games with aiming Someone who doesnt play on other devices may not notice but for those that have it feels really bad For context a single frame at 60fps occurs every 1666ms a delay of 30ms could mean the response for anything you do is delayed by 2 frames For many games its a nothing burger but any game that relies on feedback and feeling will be compromised Saying all that if this is distinctly an issue with the screenpower It shouldnt affect docked mode right TV users should still be able to play normally presumably,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzxdyqy,FunctionalFun,,6,2025-06-26 18:20:52,,,,Server latency and screen latency are not the same You should know your point enhances mine though When youre playing a multiplayer game your client is usually allowed to move freely clientside because locking your movement with the servers perception of your movement would feel delayed and clunky Instead its usually just checking for abnormalities instead of sending your own movement data back to you Even at 30ms Its rare for a game to pursue such a restriction and is typically limited to specific genres like MOBAs where the benefits outweigh the downsides,mzwzl53,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzx33l1,Octaive,,0,2025-06-26 17:30:58,,,,Thats latency on top of system latency 30ms on its own is fine but when you have processing time on top of an additional 30ms you can easily notice this And its not so much the response time as its the blur The pixels cant even keep up with 30FPS refresh without smearing the image depending on the lighting colour and contrast conditions in the game That isnt good,mzwzl53,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n07ax12,SteeveJoobs,,1,2025-06-28 06:52:43,,,,Its not just that but the handheld mode would be 999 used in a casual environment and many switch customers dont even use handheld mode But its still an odd decision for the worlds premier 5050 device especially when the handheld industry is trending toward high quality OLED as the expectation not the exception with Nintendo themselves being a reason for that,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n07s6tg,Haru17,,1,2025-06-28 09:41:27,,,,Yeah even if someone put a gun to my head and said spend 500 the Switch 2 would still be a bad deal because they dont have an option for an OLED screen We all know theyre going to come out with one in a couple years like with the Switch,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0l1aj0,BigBossHaas,,1,2025-06-30 14:36:52,,,,I mean you could argue it doesnt matter for enthusiasts either since its not noticeable until you put it under a microscope Im a stickler for performance and visual smoothness I will drop money and go out of my way for these things I had no idea about it until Digital Foundry told me it was a thing The only context where this would really truly matter is esports and we know thats not going to be taking place on a handheld console anyways,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n017zlt,BoxOfDemons,,0,2025-06-27 09:00:03,,,,Curious how they will handle an OLED model Even the high end OLED monitors today still have flickering issues with VRR enabled So either they wait until thats solved remove VRR or let their screens have flickering issues,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzz2kak,quasirun,,-3,2025-06-26 23:30:14,,,,Yeah its no different than offering a base model car and then tagging on the upsells Want a better screen refresh Wait and buy the more expensive and better profit margin display version in 8 months Hell they can just wait 8 months drop a bigger battery in this model and crank voltages for higher refresh and market it as a Switch 2 or whatever and milk an extra 100 out the customer Then drop an OLED or some new tech display 8 months after that And Id bet they have usage stats for Switch OG showing them 99 of play time is on an external TV or monitor anyways for 90 of their customer base,mzwoxxo,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n02pvya,edvek,,1,2025-06-27 14:56:24,,,,Ya but that higher trim is available at the same time so you get to choose what you want Sure you can choose still by choosing to not buy but who knows when or if they will even release an OLED model In my opinion because the OLED switch is so much better the switch 2 should have been OLED by default There is absolutely no reports of an OLED version coming so saying 8 months is straight from your ass,mzz2kak,2.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n00asne,BlobTheOriginal,,-2,2025-06-27 04:05:10,,,,How does that make any sense Pixels have no concept of motion they just change from one intensity to the other and in this case slowly Maybe its more noticeable on some games,mzwuxtc,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n017ga8,SystemofCells,,2,2025-06-27 08:54:55,,,,When someone says a screen is 1080p the p stands for progressive scan It means that the pixels dont refresh all at once or in interlacing lines but start from one end and work their way down Generally this is setup to start refreshing at the top of the screen then work down for each frame But there is I think speculation that the Switch 2 screen refreshed from the side instead because its a flipped mobile screen that would normally be held in vertical orientation,n00asne,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0cv921,BlobTheOriginal,,1,2025-06-29 04:27:52,,,,Of course but the switch screen refreshes every 83 ms a fraction of the time it takes for the pixels to actually change Not saying youre wrong just curious where that information is from if you can remember,n017ga8,5.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n007wnz,porkyminch,,1,2025-06-27 03:44:33,,,,The thing that kinda drives me nuts about the Switch 2 personally is that its pretty blatant that they pushed this thing back multiple times but the software support at launch is honestly pretty bad I mean anemic launch lineups are nothing new but the backwards compatibility really should be in a better spot A lot of these games could use a resolution bump andor framerate bump It sucks that there are like 5 games with real switch 2 updates,mzyf2vk,3.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n03d0ky,Edmundyoulittle,,1,2025-06-27 16:45:19,,,,Well as of right now there are handheld gaming 0 devices with a 120hz VRR OLED ROG said its too expensive right now If its too costly for themfor a device thats 800 its definitely too costly to put in a switch 2 at 450,mzx0i1z,2.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwr38r,sicker_combos,,19,2025-06-26 16:35:33,,,,TLDR its likely done to save on battery life Switch 2 already doesnt last very long playing new games handheld so I cant imagine how bad the battery life would be with overdrive Still it would be nice if this was an option we could choose to enable to avoid response times worse than 20ms or so 33ms does feel pretty egregious but I only notice on newer games so far,,0.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzxuzbl,AreYouOKAni,,10,2025-06-26 19:42:47,,,,Yeah no Overdrive doesnt meaningfully increase battery consumption even on a 14 screen Tested of my Zephyrus G14 60Hz vs 165 Hz Overdrive is maybe a 10 difference They just cheaped out on the screen And gave the owners an incentive to upgrade to Switch 2 OLED in 2028,mzwr38r,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n00zv2h,HerrPiink,,8,2025-06-27 07:39:44,,,,Thats nonsense of course it will be doable no idea why the other user would say such a thing but its basically just a monitor integrated in the console Its more expensive to manufacture it like that but thats true for every OLED screen and the console might cost a lot more because its a 4k VRR screen but there is nothing technical that prevents that,mzz0nyu,3.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n001gqm,Vinnie_Vegas,,3,2025-06-27 03:00:27,,,,When your fingers take up a good portion of the screen it makes playing rather annoying This problem is completely solved by telescoping controller like the Razer Kishi or the Gamesir X5 which are both smaller and cheaper than a separate pocket sized portable would be and a phone is likely to be able to play more impressive stuff than a portable console could The convenience of the mobile phone considering that everyone is always carrying one anyway is just impossible for a portable console to overcome Its a nonstarter in the same way that a separate music player was instantly a nonstarter once you could play music from your phone No one will carry two devices when you can carry one that does both,mzyqpw0,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n00gkia,Programmdude,,1,2025-06-27 04:49:16,,,,Sure and I did look at one of those But then Im carrying two devices or one oversized device just to play a game for 1020 minutes while waiting for something If the games on phones were decent enough then the tradeoff would be worth it but I didnt find playing emulated games a big enough draw to buy one Now if I got a steam deck or similar Id also be carrying a second oversized device but then I could play real games rather than microtransaction filled garbage or emulated old games If native phone games came out that were as good as switchsteam deck and they supported bluetooth controllers the situation would be a lot different of course One controller is a lot smaller than the steam deck after all,n001gqm,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n00xxsj,Vinnie_Vegas,,1,2025-06-27 07:20:58,,,,Sure and I did look at one of those But then Im carrying two devices But the original premise of the discussion was originally that one might want a separate gaming device thats smaller than a Steam Deck or a Switch If youre not willing to carry a second device even smaller than that then that proves the idea is DOA,n00gkia,6.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwqj1q,akeean,,8,2025-06-26 16:32:51,,,,Its so slow and smeary that there is no point running anything higher than 60hz in portable mode since the screen will literally refresh too slowly to show the differences between the frames Probably not a huge deal in portable mode but anything online competitive ie Switch 2 Call of Duty will have a significant advantage to people playing in docked mode on an OLED recent NeoQLED or even a nonancient LED TV,mzwoncq,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,n01jcuf,Tobi97l,,2,2025-06-27 10:44:07,,,,Response time is how long pixels need to switch from one color to the next If the response time is higher than the refresh rate the pixels never get to the actual color they are supposed to be at For example if the screen switches between black and white at 120hz the individual pixels would be stuck at grey since the pixels dont have enough time to reach full black or full white At 33ms they are 4 times slower than the refresh rate of 120hz At that point its not a 120hz screen anymore even if it refreshes at 120hz,mzww6wg,4.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0kh0tz,Dependent-Mode-3119,,1,2025-06-30 12:45:11,,,,You have it backwards Response time is not refresh rate The screen is able to refresh at the 120hz as advertised its the pixels from before that dont change in time which means you still get the 120hz smoothness but you get a trail of the last few frames still behind it as the screen updates By your logic a 33ms response time is too slow to even see the difference between 30 and 60 on that screen but you obviously can Thats how ghosting works and is why the whole conversation is about ghosting Why speak so confidently on something you clearly dont understand,n01jcuf,5.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0ki5er,Tobi97l,,1,2025-06-30 12:52:12,,,,Yes but you dont see 120 individual frames anymore With a pixel response time of 33ms 4 frames are getting blended together which results in ghosting I wouldnt call that 120hz anymore even though it technically still is 120hz Its smoother but visually not comparable to a true 120hz refresh rate with an 833ms response time,n0kh0tz,6.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0kivaq,Dependent-Mode-3119,,1,2025-06-30 12:56:36,,,,It looks like 120 with motion blur I had an iPad pro that had this type of ghosting and Id still much preferred that over the 60hz screens Even then they can overdrive the display to get the times down a bit,n0ki5er,7.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n0kmfs9,Tobi97l,,1,2025-06-30 13:17:41,,,,Yes it would be nice if nintendo added an optional overdrive I doubt the extra battery drain would be even noticeable But i guess for a true switch 2 we need to wait for the oled version anyway,n0kivaq,8.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwrwzk,Thorusss,,40,2025-06-26 16:39:30,,,,but they also compare it to the Switch 1 Which already had bad latency with 21ms but the Switch 2 is worse with 31ms But Nintendo advertises a 120Hz which requires switch time under 8ms The switch 2 with 31msliterally shows 4 Frames overlapping in this mode 4 Ghost images The 120Hz mode of the display is useless,mzwq93v,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzyaino,shalol,,7,2025-06-26 21:00:14,,,,Monitor overdrive does not reduce durability Its a setting related to ghosting on how fast colors transition not a single setting on your monitor reduces or increases lifespan other than some pixel cleanup things on OLED panels youre just making shit up,mzwq93v,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,n04h0ad,Hans_H0rst,,1,2025-06-27 19:56:43,,,,Its literally basic electronics knowledge Overdrive higher voltage more switching cycles faster arrival at the MTBF amongst other results Overdrive increases the voltage thats why its called overdrive which puts additional strain on your hardware which will basically always reduce the lifespan,mzyaino,2.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwzxfn,Might_be_a_Geek,,-5,2025-06-26 17:16:44,,,,I know this article is technically ragebait but I have always wondered why does Nintendo get away with releasing gaming systems that perform far below other new systems capabilities I know their staple games arent focusing on insane graphics or anything but I could not even consistently get 60 fps while playing BOTW on the console it was released on and could not even run Minecraft Bedrock edition on fancy graphics The Switch 2 specs are still far behind modern console specs so why on earth are people foaming at the mouth for them at their ridiculous price point And by the time the price comes down to a reasonable amount its going to be very obsolete,,0.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzzp5m3,nifterific,,1,2025-06-27 01:44:18,,,,Handheld gaming has always been behind Its why their handhelds the Switch is one of these sell like crazy handhelds being behind isnt a huge deal Its expected Laptops that are the same price as desktops never hit the same performance either There are 1000 handheld PCs on the market that dont perform at the level of a PS5 expecting Nintendo to cram a PS5 into something smaller than those for half the price is completely unreasonable The PSP was 250 in 2005 and was slightly worse than the PS2 but significantly worse than the upcoming PS3 and it sold great 80 million units Power just isnt as big of a deal for handhelds Going beyond that specs cost them dearly with the WiiU So yes people do care about that with Nintendo People love painting this idea of a rabid Nintendo fanboy army but less people bought the WiiU than the PS Vita Keep in mind the WiiU was right after Nintendo sold a combined 250 million Wii and DS consoles so there were more hypothetical fanboys going into that than there are coming off the Switch 1 The Wii did good because it had a very competitive price point 250 compared to the 360 400 and PS3 600 people cared about the specs but also the price was fine and it was new tech to a lot of people who never messed with motion controls Motion controls werent gonna sell the WiiU though The Game Cube outperformed the PS2 on the power front by a wide margin and sold like trash btw So power doesnt help Nintendo either,mzwzxfn,1.0,1ll4eiv

comment,mzwspkq,dugg117,,-2,2025-06-26 16:43:18,,,,After owning the switch OLED and knowing that the really big difference was the colors this really doesnt mean much Still gonna wait till they actually put an OLED on the second one to buy,,0.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzx1xut,StickFigureFan,,-2,2025-06-26 17:25:46,,,,In the article they say its 33 ms which comes out to 30 fps which seems expected for handheld mode Or what am I missing other than that dedicated gaming computers are obviously better than hand held devices,,0.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzzn9o6,nifterific,,1,2025-06-27 01:32:56,,,,33ms is just shy of 2 frames 1 frame is 166ms the 6 repeats I have no idea how to get that symbol on my phone 60hz frames divided by 1000ms the number of milliseconds in a second gives you the number of milliseconds in a frame In other words its a totally reasonable amount of lag Ive gamed on TVs with 80ms with no issue and they didnt have a video game console built into them jacking their price up,mzx1xut,1.0,1ll4eiv
comment,mzym3gb,Lagviper,,-2,2025-06-26 21:59:19,,,,OLED being fast with pixel response is also an hindrance 30 fps content looks like shit it looks like it stutter all the time,,0.0,1ll4eiv
