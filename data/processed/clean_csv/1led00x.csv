comment,myfyp13,Servanda123,,2,2025-06-18 13:12:04,,,,Those terms would be invalid You cant just make outrageous conditions and then reduce them to the minimal allowed level So they would likely achieve the opposite,myfrt3h,7.0,1led00x
comment,myg0hf2,Denimcurtain,,5,2025-06-18 13:22:05,,,,They arent reducing anything They decided not to allow active access to their service A service they can also end,myfyp13,8.0,1led00x
comment,myhc90z,Ordinary_Prune6135,,3,2025-06-18 17:12:27,,,,As in reduce their unenforceable terms and conditions to something they can enforce Terms and conditions often break down in court when they include agreements a user wouldnt reasonably expected to be in there and confirming theyve been read at all can be an issue They might be better served by having reliably enforceable terms and conditions in the first place,myg0hf2,9.0,1led00x
comment,myhcquz,Denimcurtain,,4,2025-06-18 17:14:42,,,,They arent reducing their terms and conditions by doing this Try your legal theory out What Nintendo is doing isnt exactly novel but if you can get a win then itd work for other situations as well,myhc90z,10.0,1led00x
comment,myhe92y,Ordinary_Prune6135,,1,2025-06-18 17:21:32,,,,Sorry for my phrasing reduce their demands below their terms and conditions when said terms and conditions might not be enforceable Test my legal theory out Again terms and conditions very often break down in court if theyre beyond what might be expected,myhcquz,11.0,1led00x
comment,myhgp7f,Denimcurtain,,2,2025-06-18 17:32:35,,,,They definitely arent reducing their demands Youre not making sense Yes Test your legal theory out Sue Nintendo if you think youre right I dont think you are,myhe92y,12.0,1led00x
comment,myhodbh,Ordinary_Prune6135,,0,2025-06-18 18:07:27,,,,Haha alright doing less as a consequence than they claimed they had a right to do It turns out claiming that right in their terms and conditions doesnt automatically offer it to them companies find this in court all the time So claiming a right courts would uphold might be more effective I dont have grounds to sue on this particular case Guess well see if someone tries,myhgp7f,13.0,1led00x
comment,myi60yp,Denimcurtain,,0,2025-06-18 19:31:40,,,,No one said claiming a right automatically offers it to them I see why youre confused You conflated doing less with the idea that their terms are unenforceable Their terms are likely enforceable legally Theyre pretty careful to change them in compliance with local laws The idea isnt that they would do less to avoid liability the idea is that they warned you of what the maximum consequences could be so you cant claim you werent warned about the penalties The liability shield comes from if you try to claim that their action has other consequences other than accessing their store If they say theyll just shut your connection down then they have to defend themselves from claims that they did more in a practical sense Itd be pretty simple for you to sue Buy a Switch 2 get them to brick it sue them Youd push the industry back and likely have your expenses paid for if Nintendo is on such shaky ground,myhodbh,14.0,1led00x
comment,myh4cj6,Warcraft1998,,27,2025-06-18 16:35:48,,,,If it was just vague threats Nintendo wouldnt have installed literal remotetriggered kill switches in the console They have every intention of killing modded consoles entirely the EU just slapped them and said no,myflklh,4.0,1led00x

comment,myqqm8x,GreggAlan,,1,2025-06-20 02:21:40,,,,Sega fixed almost every launch screwup theyd committed with Saturn But one big one was they didnt have the online service ready at launch and had publishers remove online capabilities from most of the launch titles instead of leaving it in with a way to play online once the service was ready Thus games designed for online play like Armada had to have multiplayer on one screen because the online function was ripped out of it Sega didnt have the money to buy DVD reader mechanisms or to pay the per unit license for DVD playing so they sunk a lot of their funds into pushing CDROM technology to 1 gigabyte as the GDROM They shouldve found the money somewhere somehow to get DVD into the Dreamcast That was the 1 killer feature that pushed Playstation 2 sales in Japan Many homes still didnt have DVD players then and a combo game console DVD player cost less than they would separately and took up less space They also planned on GDROM being an effective antipiracy method because PCs cant read the discs and access to GDR discs and burners was tightly controlled But they left an unintentional backdoor by making the consoles able to read CDR That got exploited to load software to stream the content of a CDROM out the serial port Then people figured out how to compress essential content and edit games to remove the need for nonessential stuff like music to squeeze games down to fit onto a CDR Dreamcast is the one time game piracy really did hurt the market for a console because it took hacking and modding to rip the games while anyone with a CD burner and download bandwidth could get the games for free to play on a stock console Playstation and Xbox required modding the console to play pirated games Sega was boasting about the numbers of Dreamcast units sold to stores They werent counting the sellthrough numbers to customers which is what Sony and Microsoft did Dreamcasts were sitting on store shelves while customers were buying the other two and getting a free DVD player built in,myjoke9,5.0,1led00x

comment,mygd0yy,ariolander,,15,2025-06-18 14:27:00,,,,Yup I have a cart and a dumper and self dumped all my games Both for the convenience of having all my games with me all the time and not having to carry a dozen cartridges Since I own the games self dumped and use my own encryption keys not the public ones online I actually play online using my Mig and have no problems They are indistinguishable from real cartridges as long as your dump the games yourself It even works on the Switch 2 with a firmware update You really only get in trouble if you use public keys from someone elses dump or you resell your cartridge and two games with the same serial are online at the same time,myfvs3q,7.0,1led00x

comment,myjm8j4,Aramillio,,2,2025-06-19 00:00:44,,,,Its clearly not indistinguishable because they wouldnt be able to ban it if that were truly the case My admittedly limited understanding is that the MiG firmware update was to make it so the games would actually launch Do we know for certain it stops Nintendo from detecting the MiG cartridges,mygd0yy,8.0,1led00x
comment,myjn5uj,ariolander,,3,2025-06-19 00:06:01,,,,The only reason people are being banned is because they are using public dumps and public keys If you rip your own games dont buy used dont resell your cart after ripping it there is no risk of ban Carts have individually identifiable serials If your serial doesnt appear on multiple consoles IE you ripped your games so you can keep your physical carts at home Nintendo has no way to detect you are using a MIG Everyone that is getting banned is because of piracy not self dumping There may be an edge case of someone buying a dumped used cart whose keys got shared online but that is now a real risk of buying Switch games used even if Nintendo doesnt admit it,myjm8j4,9.0,1led00x
comment,myjr07f,Aramillio,,2,2025-06-19 00:28:33,,,,I think your statement presents a rather cynical outlook There are several instances of people who only ripped their own games and used a MiG card and got banned By your statement they are all lying which is statistically unlikely Additionally if what you say is true then presumably theres nothing wrong with what Nintendo is doing because the only MiG users actually getting banned are pirates so if you arent doing anything wrong then theres no reason to be upset about Nintendos approach,myjn5uj,10.0,1led00x

comment,myhuwfb,StealAllWoes,,4,2025-06-18 18:38:21,,,,When it came out at first there was concern around essentially folks buying a game dumping returning It wouldnt get banned unless two switches were both running the same unique ID at the same time So the product could result in a noncompromises switch running an authentic cart because the person who dumped the cart also happened to be online Def recommend hacking your old switch though trivially easy running mods is cool and Nintendo internet is dogshit anyways If youre playing to play with friends online not as worth it but at least with the switch 1 you can isolate custom firmware from original firmware and just boot into regular mode This is how a lot of streamers who play modded stuff operate because also visual mods are less likely to get hit its mostly just been inauthentic unique ids For pirated games theres usually only the original dump so everyone is running around with the same game ID which makes it easier to flag,myfvs3q,7.0,1led00x

comment,mygysgs,Alenicia,,6,2025-06-18 16:09:30,,,,That I recall the MIG thing is the equivalent of a flash cart that you wouldve seen back then for consoles especially like the Nintendo DS specifically the DSi as it actually had its own operating system of sorts compared to the previous versions and the Nintendo 3DS to which softmodding was relatively easy that you didnt need to modify the console physically These kinds of devices are there for the people who dont want to modify their consoles too much even when the alternative is arguably safer but admittedly trickier Switch modding was very easy on the original Switch but then future versions and revisions of the Switch need a new entry point that often required soldering a chip onto the motherboard which isnt that hard but it is a step that requires toolsskills that the average person really doesnt have I can get why someone would rather get something like an MIG over trying to set up something like an environment that lets you have both the sysNAND and emuNAND environment but at the same time it comes off to me as people who are willing to take shortcuts and compromise their actual consoleaccounts just for one of the more obvious gains from what homebrew tends to motivate sailing the high seas At least that Ive heard there are already holes found in the Switch 2 but it hasnt exactly led to anything superfruitful yet but Im under the impression that using the MIG will make it that much more obvious for Nintendo since theyve been watching that thing for ages from even the original Switch in fact something similar happened with the 3DS where successive updates for stability would actually render DS and 3DS flashcarts as unreadableunusable until the users spoofed the cartridges anyways For the people still trying to use the MIG with the Switch 2 it might as well be the equivalent of walking around with a KICK ME shirt and those people wondering why theyre getting kicked,myfg8v2,4.0,1led00x

comment,mygvqfw,jstndrn,,1,2025-06-18 15:55:06,,,,A lot of people dislike digital titles for the simple reason that its extremely likely to eventually lose access to those games If its not installed already and Nintendo shuts down the store entirely in the future suddenly you dont have that game anymore Nintendo so far hasnt locked out any previous digital purchases from downloads completely but for some the original device cant download the title anymore such as dsiware only being available to the 3ds2ds and not the original DSi Still a valid concern,mygdamj,3.0,1led00x

comment,mygo7w8,Serialtoon,,1,2025-06-18 15:20:05,,,,All correct But because Nintendo is hot right now off the release of the Switch 2 I cant help but feel the narrative is a bit skewed Any company in existence doesnt want them to pirate their games or hardware This is just to make sensational news because of the aforementioned,myf6l71,1.0,1led00x

comment,mygr7ip,Natural-Parfait2805,,1,2025-06-18 15:34:04,,,,the thing is with the switch 2 is it seems Nintendo has built security measures into the console itself if the console detects a flashcard it marks itself as banned so whenever it goes online next it tells nintendos servers to ban it,myf6l71,1.0,1led00x
comment,mygt7cg,AlabamaPanda777,,1,2025-06-18 15:43:22,,,,no Really though thats more of a general guideline its still noteworthy when we find out what does happen My understanding on the 3DS was you could stay unbanned by just not having your most recently played game or current game homebrewmodded but could play backups online Its not a universal truth even if its common sense Im also surprised because I thought MIG Switches only emulated one cart at a time and needed some actual cart data general roms didnt have at the time So it sounded less detectable,myf6l71,1.0,1led00x

comment,myh1x18,MattWatchesChalk,,1,2025-06-18 16:24:13,,,,The problem as far as I understand it is that there is a unique identifier on each cart so if you dump with that flash cart and you buy a preowned copy of a cart that was dumped Nintendo may still thinking youre pirating and ban you I didnt realize that cart still worked on switch 2 but if Nintendo didnt change anything this could be a real mess for those who buy preowned games,myf6l71,1.0,1led00x

comment,myh8kv6,DomLite,,1,2025-06-18 16:55:44,,,,Yup Even the OG Switch homebrew scene had a whole workaround where you set up a second run environment on your device and only did homebrew stuff on that so you still had a clean official firmware if you wanted to play online As far as Im concerned I have zero interest in playing any of the Switch games online Im not a Splatoon kinda guy and if I wanna play the new open world game Ill be doing it solo anyway Mario Kart is fun but it only holds my interest for so long I like Pokemon but Im far past the point where Im gonna chase a complete pokedex and I dont have any friends to battle with so again swing and a miss If theres a legit working flash cartridge that I could use to skirt around that ludicrous 80 price tag not being able to play online would be the smallest price I could ever pay Then again once they find a way to put custom firmware on the thing its a simple matter to manually update official firmware to make sure you can play the latest games and you wont even need a flash card I know Nintendo is trying to make the online play with discord voice chat some huge deal but Im not buying into it Im here to play Donkey Kong and whatever new Zelda and Animal Crossing and Kirby and hopefully a new Bayonetta and Astral Chain You can keep our online connectivity and Ill consider the purchase price worth having spent,myf6l71,1.0,1led00x

comment,mykg6m5,theevilyouknow,,3,2025-06-19 03:00:45,,,,A line between behavior that affects online play and behavior that doesnt is a reasonable line to have and that includes the slurshouters griefers grifters cheats and even pirates who put their heads above water Until theres piracy effect or foul play though as commonly defined not just as spelled out by Nintendo in service of their monetization strategies But thats exactly what this is This ban is specifically targeted at people using flash carts or jailbreaking systems Two things used almost exclusively for piracy Sure maybe like 4 people who cant use digital games and also need to have every single cartridge they own on them at all times now have to spend an extra 15 on a case that holds 48 cartridges But 99 of the people affected by this policy are doing something illegal Nintendo is not obligated to wait until after people pirate their games and then launch full investigations and lawsuits to stop them That is an absurd expectation Nintendo is not waiting until they suspect people of piracy and then just banning them That would be totally unacceptable and illegal Nintendo is saying in their terms of service these are programs and devices used almost exclusively for questionable purposes You are not allowed to use them AND retain access to our online services If you do we will block your switch from online services That is completely different from what you are saying they are doing and totally acceptable a blanket prohibition on thirdparty peripherals is well into the None of Nintendos business category Cmon dude Its fine to not be informed about this issue but if youre going to formulate an opinion about it at least do 5 or 10 minutes of research Nintendo is not doing this There is no blanket prohibition of third party peripherals I have no idea where you came up with that idea The console just came out like two weeks ago and there are already a ton of third party peripherals They all work fine and no one is getting their Switches banned over them Literally the only peripheral I can fine that is getting people banned are the flash carts,mykbia1,16.0,1led00x

comment,myjnwbw,SuperFLEB,,0,2025-06-19 00:10:17,,,,I think the sticking point is when significant features of the device are irrevocably tied in to the online services If there werent things like firmware signing that keep you from using the device with another provider itd be perfectly reasonable to say that if you dont like Nintendo or Nintendo doesnt like you youre free to walk If theres practically nowhere to walk to though because any software or service has to be blessed by the hardware manufacturer theres a case to be made that refusing to provide services that provide basic bulletpoint functionality is not just opting out but is taking away what the buyer already bought and paid for Its kind of like when car manufacturers tie features like remote starting into a cellularconnected app then plead that of course they should get control and recurring revenue off of it because connection is a cost and updating the app is a service they provide ignoring that theyre the ones who chose to tie the features solely to that infrastructure when options like IR or RF remotes were entirely viable fallbacks,myjkx5n,7.0,1led00x

comment,myh9rrf,DomLite,,-2,2025-06-18 17:01:10,,,,Its fairly likely that if they tried that it would get taken down hard in the courts Newer Switch titles tend to require newer firmware updates to be playable If Nintendo denies a user access to update the firmware on their device thus preventing them from playing newer software titles theyre still in essence limiting the device that the consumer owns and that seems like a pretty clear conflict with EU law Im no lawyer and not even an EU citizen so take it with a grain of salt but based on what Ive read about their consumer protection laws and simple logic its a fairly easy conclusion to come to They might be able to ban you from online play if you modify the softwarefirmware or are using an unauthorized device because it could enable cheating and preventing you from cheating in online play is one thing but locking you out from purchasing eshop titles updating your firmware or even sharing virtual game cards with your friends would be another entirely,myg5tgt,5.0,1led00x

comment,myfcmt4,JaggedMetalOs,,12,2025-06-18 10:47:36,,,,They cant tell who has the original but they would know someone pirated that cart and that the pirate was playing the cart online,myf8xkc,3.0,1led00x
comment,myg1ykg,lost_send_berries,,1,2025-06-18 13:30:08,,,,The pirate or the original owner was playing the cart online You could also see people buying a cart off eBay then the original owner uses their backup Do they get a pass on Nintendos system because they were the first to use the cart,myfcmt4,4.0,1led00x
comment,myf9o0l,Kniferharm,,12,2025-06-18 10:22:58,,,,And even if they could those pirating games would probably find a way to spoof it So not really in Nintendos interest Not that this justifies bricking peoples consoles,myf8xkc,3.0,1led00x
comment,myfcw03,JaggedMetalOs,,9,2025-06-18 10:49:36,,,,I think to spoof it they would have to mod the console making the flashcart unnecessary Its not just an ID the cards have the data on the card is encrypted with a unique key thats probably signed,myf9o0l,4.0,1led00x
comment,myfkn3l,mpolder,,4,2025-06-18 11:46:17,,,,It was mentioned partially by the other guy as well but you cant spoof the signature on the cartridge without either having one that is already signed or SOMEHOW having the original key used by nintendo to sign the cartridge The former is easily detectable by nintendo if you spread the game around since the signature is the same the latter is basically not possible without an internal employee leaking it,myf9o0l,4.0,1led00x

comment,myfwfae,Warning_Low_Battery,,14,2025-06-18 12:59:02,,,,And ironically if you factory reset it after a ban you do actually brick it See if your console is banned you can still play physical cart games just no online access ever But if you factory reset it the first thing you have to do before you can even play a game is sign into your Nintendo account which you cannot do As soon as you connect the banned console to the internet it will prompt you that it is banned and you cant even sign in to a different Nintendo account Thus factory reset brick,myfbffg,6.0,1led00x

comment,myfw2a6,wirelessfingers,,4,2025-06-18 12:56:59,,,,Correct me if Im wrong but most Switch 2 games are Game Key Carts which means if you cant download anything then you cant play any physical games It basically is bricked,myfbffg,6.0,1led00x

comment,myf9llw,hellowiththepudding,,21,2025-06-18 10:22:22,,,,Nintendo is the most collectible console manufacturer with a record of shutting down eshops It is also a handheld portable console Ive got 80 or so physical switch games and the mig is an easy way to bring them all when traveling People could always get banned on the switch 1 by using pirated copies but if you used your own specific key files off your cartridge you were safe One final note this cart does not require a modded switch to use,myf7poo,3.0,1led00x

comment,myha54w,celsiusnarhwal,,2,2025-06-18 17:02:52,,,,Nintendo is the most collectible console manufacturer with a record of shutting down eshops This sentiment gets repeated a lot but I dont think its reflective of reality You can still redownload purchased titles from the eShop on 3DS and Wii U and the Switch 2 uses the same eShop as its predecessor so thats not going away anytime soon The Wii Shop Channel also continues to support redownloading purchased titles six years after its discontinuation even though Nintendo has committed to completely shutting it down at an undetermined future date I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone materially affected by that when it happens,myf9llw,4.0,1led00x

comment,myhbysu,DomLite,,2,2025-06-18 17:11:09,,,,99 percent of the time that wording is used specifically as some kind of legalese protection to skirt around potential prosecution Just look at the OG Switch custom firmware situation for a prime example When it was first cracked there was an opensource community custom firmware that very publicly stated they didnt support use of their firmware for piracy and forbade discussion of it There was also a company that sold a closed source firmware and boot device to enable it and their firmware very specifically included software intended to dump cartridges and install pirated games The gentleman in charge of the second example found himself arrested charged and fined millions of dollars among other consequences The former was able to continue on unscathed Of course despite the official stance that they didnt support piracy others were able to look at the source code and create software that enabled dumping and installing of games and thus it was possible and still is The manufacturers probably phrase it specifically so on their site to put some distance between themselves and those that would use the card for piracy If the card itself doesnt enable the dumping of games then its a pretty solid cover They can simply advertise it as a way to put multiple dumped titles on a single card for easy transport and play when youre travelingon the go so you dont have to fumble around to take out and put in a new game card and put the other one back in a storage case or what have you Just put all your owned games on one single card that you can use to swap between them on the fly and not have to carry a case of games with you in addition to the system An article discussing the product has to phrase things this way to avoid defamation lawsuits from the company We all know what the more likely use of the product is but if theyre not enabling game dumping and advertising their product as simply a way to combine and transport multiple games that you already own someone calling it a piracy device would open themselves up to legal action Its simply the world we live in,myf6h0r,1.0,1led00x

comment,myfm3mw,mpolder,,-1,2025-06-18 11:56:02,,,,Its only really a risk because Nintendo decided it needs to be supposedly you own the game and you are the only one playing it so nintendo doesnt lose out on any revenue from you having a copy of your cartridge in any way Nintendo is able to detect if multiple people are playing the same cartridge so they can already tell if what you are doing costs them actual money or not and if your game is really owned by you or not,myfd9kf,3.0,1led00x

comment,myfxwup,Justjack91,,1,2025-06-18 13:07:38,,,,If you play some newer Nintendo games like Pokémon they offload a bunch of data as patches to make up for cheaping out on SD cards Essentially the put the burden of storing the data on you rather than themselves Servers go down for updates like that and youre cooked Games just arent made like they used to be anymore to where you know theyre actually complete upon release,myfqaj5,4.0,1led00x
comment,myg0bnu,BootyMcStuffins,,1,2025-06-18 13:21:13,,,,I think this started because the media we had available to distribute the game disks in most cases couldnt physically hold the games anymore GTA V was over 100 GB Xbox disks certainly couldnt handle that at the time micro sd wasnt costeffective or large enough yet Nowadays an SD card can hold over a terabyte but every game comes with updates that have to be stored somewhere so companies never switched back To your point Pokémon at 10 gigs could easily fit on an as card,myfxwup,5.0,1led00x
comment,myg4bd4,Justjack91,,1,2025-06-18 13:42:54,,,,I just think the Switch cartridge format was doomed to meet this fate With how bloated in gigs most new games are to your point and how poorly optimized they are it falls on the consumer to pick up the slack There ARE larger space cartridges that for a 60 Pokémon game they should be able to fit the majority of the game on instead of offloading it onto your SD with a Day One Patch Theres a lot wrong with this day and age of gaming compared to older times Theres a reason topics like this come up that are more a symptom of the problem rather than the whole problem itself,myg0bnu,6.0,1led00x

comment,myfvj8z,zero_z77,,2,2025-06-18 12:53:57,,,,It depends on what you mean by nuke If nintendo really wants it wiped off the face of the earth then yes they could have it remotely deleted from everyones console removed from the store and they can lock the cartridge out with their existing DRM system via a firmware update so that even if you had a functional copy somewhere physical or not they could still effectively kill it if you ever connect your console to the internet This is the same system they use to stop people from running homebrew cheats for online games or pirated games But this would also be an incredibly stupid descision that wouldnt really benefit them in any way If they just remove it from the store that only means that you cant buy or download it anymore If you already have it downloaded it should still work as long as you dont delete or uninstall it But you may not be able to move it to another console if yours breaks or you decide to upgrade If you have a true physical copy then the base game lives on the cart and it should work as long as its plugged in but you will still be missing a lot of content from DLCs and any updates that werent pushed to the cart before it was taken down But what others are talking about is that nowadays the physical cart basically just has a web installer and a physical activation key on it and not a functional copy of the game The web installer is just a shortcut to downloading the game from the store and the activation key basically just tells DRM that you own the game as long as the carts plugged in So if the game was removed from the store and you plug that cart into a console that doesnt already have the game installed it wont be able to do the download In this case it feels like having a physical copy of the game but functionally its just a shortcut to a digital download that could potentially disappear,myfhi6y,3.0,1led00x

comment,myjmv75,EnlargedChonk,,3,2025-06-19 00:04:19,,,,its not just reddit its most of media and the reason behind it is simple nintendo is tremendously more popular than xbox or playstation right now with 46 million more switches sold than xbox series SX and PS5 combined Of the top 10 best selling consoles the only thing close to a current console is the switch sitting comfortably in 3rd place Not only that but the more hardcore gamers are kinda desensitized to being fucked over by the industry these days And during the last few console generations most of those gamers moved to xbox PS or even PC while nintendo tried to uphold a family fun for everyone attitude with weaker more affordable hardware Which leaves most of current nintendo players in two camps normies ala bought switch to play animal crossing during covid and nintendo meatriders fans both of which dont really care much about the rest of the industry and are only now facing these realities So its less that people are acting like nintendo did it first more that this is their first time eating a shit sandwich and there was outrage over price raises from xboxsony for online services price raises for games and over physical media not actually physically containing the media Im not much of a console player in general and even I was aware of these outrages and on top of that we all know that 70 new games from everyone else will eventually find themselves at reduced prices but 70 nintendo games will always be 70 until the system reaches EOL theres at least a tad more nuance than simply to reddit its never a problem until Nintendo does it but yeah seeing the response to nintendo following xboxPS footsteps makes me wish there was a similarstronger reaction when those first started with some of this BS,myf9qds,2.0,1led00x

comment,myhrl2g,BootyMcStuffins,,2,2025-06-18 18:22:38,,,,The TOS is not allowed to break the law but theyre certainly allowed to add restrictions beyond what the law says Like Reddit could put in their TOS that they dont allow people born in December to use their site Its a stupid example but totally within their rights to do it,myh2fpb,4.0,1led00x

comment,myiw14p,Somepotato,,1,2025-06-18 21:38:32,,,,Uh I never once said pirating games And to equate Facebook and Spotify with a hardware game console you pay for and are then restricted from using is a hilarious take Want to use ROMs on your switch Go ahead You just wont be able to access their online services And thats exactly what people are upset about I dont understand how youre struggling to keep a grip on your initial argument that people shouldnt be allowed to complain because its in the TOS But feel free to show me Facebook banning you from accessing your purchased games and using Facebook capabilities because you downloaded an image for archival,myivijj,9.0,1led00x
comment,myk2a3n,BootyMcStuffins,,1,2025-06-19 01:36:12,,,,I think youre struggling to get a grip Let me slow it down for you People who own and maintain servers dont have to let you access those servers You bought a piece of hardware Youre entitled to use that hardware however you want If you break the TOS the owners of the servers have no obligation to continue granting you access to those servers In fact the people who own those servers can shut them down or deny access any time for any reason Microsoft Apple Sony etc all do the same thing Youre saying that Nintendo should have to adhere to rules that no other company adheres to For reasons You think you have some right to lifetime uninterrupted access to Nintendo servers because you bought a 500 device,myiw14p,10.0,1led00x

comment,myhpslm,Crizznik,,6,2025-06-18 18:14:08,,,,They were banning everyone for using a third party cartridge thats explicitly against EULA and could easily and very stealthily be used for pirating And no that is a very reasonable EULA Itd be like installing a third party turbocharger in your car and expecting the manufacturer to cover the damage when it explodes because you did it wrong Its not 1 to 1 as a metaphor but its in the same spirit The main bad part of this whole ordeal Nintendo and beyond is the fact that consumers do not own their hardware The only part about this that makes that a relevant point is the fact that the hardware is rendered nearly unusable What I said as a course correction would largely eliminate that as a concern,myhjjt8,4.0,1led00x

comment,mykgose,favorite_time_of_day,,1,2025-06-19 03:04:06,,,,I think this is only for Switch 1 games and the Switch 2 doesnt let you play Switch 1 games unless you go online I dont know if thats for every game or just once but if this is supposed to be a form of software activation then Id expect it for every game Also every Switch 2 game comes with firmware that the console will install before you can play So their approach seems to be that someone might get away with piracy for a while but then theyre stuck once they try to play something new,myi1n4n,1.0,1led00x

comment,myffwym,error521,,3,2025-06-18 11:12:33,,,,Even ignoring that the Switch has expandable SD storage and even if the MicroSD Express cards for Switch 2 arent cheap well neither is the MIGSwitch you arent gonna be filling the MIGSwitch with 2TB of games Theres no menu system you just have to continually rotate between games at random by pressing a button on the cart or in older versions inserting and reinserting the cart so if you actually fit 1TB of games on it it would be a complete nightmare to find the specific game you want to play,myf797u,4.0,1led00x

comment,mygqven,Zealotstim,,1,2025-06-18 15:32:29,,,,One answer I havent seen is this because there are many old Nintendo games that Nintendo has no intention to ever port to newer systems people also make digital versions of these old Nintendo games that they own on the original systems allowing them to actually play them on new consoles Its been a frequent complaint for decades at this point how many older games Nintendo just wont release for any new consoles People are already playing roms of these games on their PCs but they may also want to use their new Nintendo systems to play them I havent actually used one of these game cartriges that stores downloaded games before but I have played roms on my PC of old Nintendo games that were never rereleased like Ogre Battle 64 which I also own on the N64 If they ever released it on the switch I would buy it in a heartbeat but Nintendo for whatever reason has tons of games they just never want to let people play on a newer system,myf65xq,1.0,1led00x

comment,myl98g6,green_link,,0,2025-06-19 06:45:15,,,,nope thats not how the terms of services is written and its not soft bricking your console this person broke the terms of service that is a contract and its NOT nintendo that has started this banning consoles from online services has been around since consoles started going online back in the 2000s sony and microsoft banned consoles in the past and there was nothing you could do about it but buy another console no one whined like people are doing right now that back then your console got banned and it was tough shit cell phones get banned from cell services all the time especially when they are reported stolen and yes apple has in the past stopped you from updating an iphone when it was jailbroken and the only way to update it was to wipe the phone and reinstall the whole operating system and yes other functions and services of apps especially banking apps would refuse service if they detected that your device was jailbroken printers and a game console are 2 wildly different devices and blocking of third party print cartridges isnt the same as banning a console from online services you cant compare the two this user broke a contract they made with nintendo and nintendo acted as they said they would in the terms of conditions if your online games started to have nothing but cheaters or people who could brick your console just by entering a match with them you be complain to nintendo do do something or do more well THIS is them doing something about that before its widespread and uncontrollable switch games can and will still come on the cartridges developers have the OPTION to sell their physical copies as just key carts or a piece of paper with a code in the box nintendo ISNT forcing anyone to use key carts or codes and i bet any amount of money it was developers who pressured nintendo into making key carts an option AND it wasnt nintendo that started that crap for literal decades game discs especially for consoles with DVD drives have literally been just a key on them and the whole game downloaded from the internet i remember buying portal on PC with the orange box and literally the only thing on the disc was an installer for steam every single game that i bought came with a code i had to enter manually after i installed steam and then when i bought portal again on xbox 360 literally the same thing happened again there was no game on the physical disc just a license file and the entire game downloaded from Microsofts servers even though the game was downloaded entirely on my 360s hard drive i still had to put the disc in the drive to play it absolutely no difference between that disc and the switch 2 keycarts i remember games in that same generation and the next where only the first part of the game was actually on the disc and the rest had to be downloaded it would allow you to play the fist maybe half hour of the game while the rest downloaded in the background but if you had a slow internet connection and it didnt finish by the time you finished playing the content on the disc to bad you had to wait,myl1hex,3.0,1led00x

comment,myrusn3,iShakeMyHeadAtYou,,1,2025-06-20 07:26:57,,,,Except you may as well not be able to Because switch 2 cartridges dont actually contain a game just a key to an online download of said game Because of this its more akin to because you took my lunch I put a safe around your home And thats assuming there was malintent in the first place The published intent of these cards is to backup legitimately purchased gamesrun your own code None of that is inherently illegal but Nintendo treats it as such and diminishes the value of hardware It could be argued that Nintendos actions are theft the crux of the issue is that banning an online account bricks the device This bricking is persistent across factory resets as well The bottom line is this If I buy a device I then have the right to use that hardware as I choose when I choose in its original and unadulterated condition unless I choose otherwise Nintendo has the right to protect their IP and control who accesses their online systems Nintendo DOES NOT have the right to remotely and unilaterally diminish the ability of MY hardware barring evidence of illicit intent which use of the cartridge does not inherently prove Two clichés for you You will own nothing and be happy If buying isnt owning then piracy isnt stealing,myn005s,2.0,1led00x

comment,myhf11g,Engine_Maximum,,-1,2025-06-18 17:25:01,,,,I meant for back up purposes Like if you needed to rip the cartridge of a switch 2 cartridge and the switch 2 prevents an easy jailbreak you could just rip the cartridge from a modded switch v1 export the data onto an external medium then run the backed up game files through an emulator or modded console,mygifq0,2.0,1led00x

comment,myftq3y,Jamie00003,,-4,2025-06-18 12:43:38,,,,So Im going to be getting a switch 2 before legends ZA comes out as I love pokemon and refuse to play another game on switch 1 Yes Im part of the problem I know but only stoop low when it comes to pokemon My switch 1 is a launch switch meaning its hackable or unlocked I want to sell it as such and Ive also modded my joy con to Hall effect sticks a black shell and a d pad I want to advertise it as unlocked as I presume itll increase the selling value a bit I also have the original box Questions 1 Is there a chance that if I sell this even having wiped the thing a buyer can get me banned on switch 2 for hacking my original switch 2 If Im selling as an unlocked switch will I be good to show the serial number in the eBay listing Like even if I dont sell it as an unlocked switch theres still a chance of the above happening Is there anything I can do in this regard Ive never hacked my switch myself Im in the UK and its on the latest firmware if any of that matters,,0.0,1led00x
