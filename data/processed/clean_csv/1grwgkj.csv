comment,lxayajq,libury,,21,2024-11-15 18:21:46,,,,Compared to having no grammar check Id say its pretty good But its overzealous and zeroes in on keywords instead parsing sentences which is admittedly hard to program for It ends up doing things like recommending commas that turn complete sentences into broken phrases or recommending things that while still grammatically correct change the tone of the sentence,lxarfsx,5.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxd7x25,Buttersaucewac,,3,2024-11-16 01:52:02,,,,Not editing headlines is a deliberate choice because its a feature begging for abuse when paired with an upvote or cross postrepost system You use one title to get something upvoted then change it to something else whether thats getting everyone to endorse Hitler did nothing wrong or selling front page text for money Doesnt matter if you put a time limit on it either because the first rush of votes are the most impactful Pretty much no site that allows voting or reposting will allow editing titles or if posts dont have titles like Twitter allow editing the post at all,lxbw50b,4.0,1grwgkj
comment,lxd9zo3,Lehk,,2,2024-11-16 02:05:10,,,,The way to prevent that would be to reset a positive vote record on edit As it is you can still edit the post in the same way Imposing an obnoxious limitation on everyone as a lazy way of countering one particular potential abuse is still lazy,lxd7x25,5.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxcrk31,HolierEagle,,18,2024-11-16 00:08:38,,,,The action is called shut down but you tap the action after you add it and select the restart option Edit to complete this I guess just add a shortcut with the action restart this device then create an automation that triggers the shortcut at a time of day,lxbxi9q,3.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxw1f2e,I_Was_Fox,,1,2024-11-19 06:33:23,,,,Thats how my phone works today basically Once a day or so I have to enter my pass key Which is an 8 digit pin Alternatively I can enter my full password I think its a requirement of my work profile but I actually kinda like the extra security If I dont leave my house for 48 hours I dont actually have to enter my pin But if I travel to a new location or connect to a new WiFi then it asks for that sometime in the next 1224 hours,lxak25h,1.0,1grwgkj

comment,lx9ffrw,chrisdh79,,382,2024-11-15 13:38:26,,,,From the article Apples handsets indicate that passcodes are required after a restart while iPhones in After First Unlock AFU states can be unlocked using just Face or Touch ID Some data is unencrypted and easier to extract with certain tools in the AFU state Apple added a 7day inactivity reboot feature in iOS 18 shortening the length of time to just three days in iOS 181 Magnet Graykey suggests the simple solution is to ensure law enforcement extracts evidence from iPhones using its tools as quickly as possible ie within 72 hours of seizing a handset This isnt the first time Apple has annoyed law enforcement The Cupertino company famously refused to help the FBI access Syed Rizwan Farooks locked iPhone one of the San Bernardino shooters,,0.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxbmhwg,CoreParad0x,,23,2024-11-15 20:23:44,,,,Just because some organization can exploit a vulnerability doesnt mean Apple actively works with them to do it These operating systems are 10s of millions of lines of code and developers arent perfect We make mistakes Im a software developer These mistakes can lead to vulnerabilities which other third parties can exploit It turns out state actors and well funded corporations have the resources to find these vulnerabilities and exploit them for their own gain The reason the FBI went to Apple was not simply to unlock one iPhone its because they wanted Apple to build a backdoor so they could access all iPhones Apple refused this and they did not have the ability to unlock the iPhone in question It turns out some other company had an exploit to do so I believe this case was to pressure Apple into playing ball and when that failed they backed off before it went to court Apple has also released patches in the past to fix vulnerabilities used by tools like Pegasus but since these actors are out for their own interests Apple or other white hat security researchers also have to find the bugs so they even know what needs to be fixed The thing you linked in another reply even points out some of these,lxaert4,4.0,1grwgkj
comment,lxbp195,Urc0mp,,-12,2024-11-15 20:36:39,,,,Id just say that Apple probably could access locked phones even if they say they design it to not be able to and refuse to put an explicit back door into it The suite of exploits that accomplish it are existence proof that it is possible I suppose you could argue the organization that made Pegasus has a better understanding of the device than Apple but in my opinion Apple probably could do just the same if not better,lxbmhwg,5.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxanf3f,__JockY__,,38,2024-11-15 17:27:47,,,,You are misinformed Apple cannot unlock a phone without your passcode nobody can Why In order to get your passcode Apple would need to brute force it on device because the crypto keys protecting the data are derived from the passcode a unique identifier thats only accessible on device To brute force the passcode without lockingwiping the phone after 10 unsuccessful attempts Apple would need to deploy a custom version of iOS to the phone in which lockouts were disabled and only then would they be able to start brute forcing the passcode This is what Apple refused to create for the FBI in the San Bernardino case There are some exceptions to this For example phones that are vulnerable to SEP exploits can be jailbroken and then have the SEP patched to disable lockouts Even then if the passcode is complex and alphanumeric then LEApple are basically hosed Theres nothing they can do to get the passcode short of torturing it out of the phones owner And without the passcode they cant derive the crypto keys and without the keys they cant access sensitive data So no Apple cant just unlock your phone,lxahpyx,4.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxagyq5,Shawnj2,,4,2024-11-15 16:55:51,,,,That in text isnt a refusal to help but Apple could probably break the iPhones security if they were ordered to They have all of the hardware design documents all the encryption keys and all the source code on the device something no one else has For example they could sign a custom iOS version with no security measures and write it to the device because theyre Apple and control the TSS servers something no other iOS security team on the planet has access to If anyone could back door an existing iPhone to get data off of it would be Apple and other companies with less resources have managed this in the past Theyve made changes since 2017 which would make it hard for anyone to pull data off an iPhone but still,lx9pyhs,4.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxddcir,Buttersaucewac,,23,2024-11-16 02:27:18,,,,Its impractical to do that with a modern iPhone because part of the data you need to complete an unlock is stored in the Secure Enclave effectively a separate chip with its own memory and storage containing encryption keys it never shares with other hardware You need to clone the matching enclave to read a cloned phones storage First that means cutting open and disassembling the chip at a microscopic level to try and read it and its deliberately designed so trying this will likely destroy it in which case you cant even read the original phone anymore Then it involves creating a new chip with the recovered ID key also on it The ID key is on readonly mask memory so you cant use an existing enclave and there are involved hardware measures taken to make it difficult to create another device simulating it Its not physically impossible but figuring out a way to reliably clone a password locked iPhone from this decade without risking evidence destruction would be like a Nobel prize level achievement in security research,lxbye5h,4.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxj7ju0,BigPepeNumberOne,,1,2024-11-17 02:31:51,,,,Yes you are right Hmmm I wonder if thats apples security feature or if there is some way to bypass it,lxj6daz,9.0,1grwgkj
comment,lxj93nw,BolivianDancer,,1,2024-11-17 02:42:08,,,,I was afraid of that Far as I can tell a rational reason to implement this is to prevent some sort of boot loop if intervals are too short and the phone keeps rebooting A better solution would have been to limit the minimum time interval,lxj7ju0,10.0,1grwgkj

comment,lxcrc9p,GardenPeep,,2,2024-11-16 00:07:15,,,,Whats funny is that if Apple actually documented this feature no one was able to find the user documentation Does Apple even have technical writers or is it just oh the users will figure it out,,0.0,1grwgkj
comment,lxdcz04,WeeBo-X,,3,2024-11-16 02:24:49,,,,Sometime its better to leave a feature undocumented If you announce it the bad actors who may have the phone know they only have 72 hours If theyre not aware of the feature theyll just assume they have more time or unlimited time,lxcrc9p,1.0,1grwgkj
