comment,m7mpgj2,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,29,2025-01-17 14:15:26,,,,Am I just missing something or does the image only show a two app split screen I wonder how this would be useful Even with a folding device it would be hard to have 3 things on the screen at once Maybe rotate the screen and youd have a little more width per app but it would still be very little space We already have support for windows for devices with even larger screens or when you hook up your device to a monitor so I dont really see the use case for having a mode thats specifically 3 screens as opposed to just making a better window manager that makes it easier to organize any number of windows and have them snap to eachother or the edge of the screen,,0.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7n5z53,connor42,,3,2025-01-17 15:42:33,,,,Huawei Mate XT is a trifolding phone I can see the use case there Display panels are made by various different companies so those panels could be rolling out to other android phone manufacturers There are very credible rumours Honor are coming out with a trifold bit of a silly term when it actually only folds twice zfold makes more sense ime,m7mpgj2,1.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7n7whr,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,4,2025-01-17 15:52:01,,,,Such a small percentage of the market though WOuldnt it just make more sense to spend time developing the windows feature have apps with zero borders snap together The user can organize them how they want Save different layouts so the user switch back and forth between their favourite layouts So many ways to make this more versatile rather than just working on a single fixed layout that only works for a very small percentage of users The only place Ive ever seen a folding phone was on YouTube in a tech review Ive never seen one in the wild Im sure some people have them but they are extremely rare,m7n5z53,2.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7nc42m,connor42,,1,2025-01-17 16:12:26,,,,I think they could be and the manufacturers already do seem to see them as a growth market Opens up an opportunity for an even higher priced flagship too Only time will tell if that bares out Im pretty sure they sell better in Asian markets and they sell well to business types people who are willing to drop 2 grand on the latest nottotally proven tech which are definitely the type of people phone manufacturers want as customers Hardware drives software innovation as hardware is where the money is in phones Perhaps they feel 3 windows on a candy bar design is too visually crowded Or that 3 apps would slow down all but the latest flagships Or its just a more difficult task to make them truly dynamic with the way appsOS are designed than it seems at first glance Anyway introduction of 3 apps is moving closer to your overall stated wish for a more dynamic system over what we have currently,m7n7whr,3.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7neqc6,chloe-and-timmy,,1,2025-01-17 16:25:02,,,,Id say a windows feature is inevitable If Google is ditching Chrome OS and just going full on Android I suspect that will come with Android being more windows like for larger screens,m7n7whr,3.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7v4535,Practical-Custard-64,,1,2025-01-18 20:58:58,,,,Samsung foldables already do this The screen is split in 3 with one app on one side and two more sharing the other side by splitting the height of that half screen between them You can actually have a fourth app in a floating window in front of the others in OneUI,m7mpgj2,1.0,1i3gzxj
comment,m7vnuco,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,1,2025-01-18 22:40:47,,,,On Samsung you can just open whatever apps you want in floating mode I just opened up 5 apps on my standard sized phone I dont really think theres a limit The problem is that its hard to organized the windows in any meaningful way This is why I said they should work on their window manager to allow you to more easily snap apps to the edges of the screen or up against eachother rather than trying to create just a few predefined layouts that may or may not work for someones specific use case Just give people the tools to organize and display the apps in a way that makes sense to them,m7v4535,2.0,1i3gzxj

comment,m7mr8yl,chloe-and-timmy,,2,2025-01-17 14:25:32,,,,I have a fairly big screen on my non folding phone but I wonder what I could do with 3 way split screen I do use it occasionally on my tablet but its been niche eg Youtube Twitter and onscreen timer and probably more niche on a phone But as Im typing this I realise there has been a few times Ive had a YouTube pop up window while also doing something between two other unrelated apps,,0.0,1i3gzxj

comment,m7pwpyh,chloe-and-timmy,,1,2025-01-17 23:55:42,,,,Thats very doable A calculator is just a good third app in general I think Im also hoping they can make the floating windows smaller Id have a tiny youtube app up while Im just doing stuff on the phone but the smallest size is still a hit too big for me to use it too often,m7ptecw,2.0,1i3gzxj
