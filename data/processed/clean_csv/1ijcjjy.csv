comment,mbfa9vn,vermeiltwhore,,1,2025-02-07 04:17:05,,,,With a physical filter sure your camera can do the neutral density or graduated neutral density filter The mode that generates a higher resolution photo probably not,mbcvym5,3.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbdsi9z,TheUmgawa,,4,2025-02-06 23:14:33,,,,I initially read Live ND Shooting as Live Nude Shooting and thought Well thats a pretty narrow field of people to cater to with a 2000 camera body but I guess if its the best for shooting live nudes or possibly shooting while nude this is not clear then thats the camera some people will just have to get,mbcvrh8,2.0,1ijcjjy

comment,mbcwy9d,reddit455,,5,2025-02-06 20:44:48,,,,its a generic term for the things you can do when you capture images digitally sensor vs film your phone can make a panorama computationally for example now you can access pano mode via a physical control vs poking thru menus on a screen,mbctyjp,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbcx335,Doormatty,,3,2025-02-06 20:45:25,,,,fair enough I suppose It just feels like a term that didnt need to exist in the first place,mbcwy9d,2.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbfav1o,vermeiltwhore,,5,2025-02-07 04:20:54,,,,Well thats because reddit455 is incorrect Computational photography is using machine learning algorithms to make changes to photos Its like a more advanced image processor pipeline So for instance computational photography allows the camera to analyze motion in a photo and generate images that blur the motion out while keeping static parts of the image static all while handholding the camera which is usually not possible due to the need for stability during long exposures,mbcx335,3.0,1ijcjjy

comment,mbiil08,seahorse_party,,3,2025-02-07 17:48:12,,,,It makes it hard to find a good starter camera that feels more like a film camera I used to use my dads 1960s MamiyaSekor but does not need to look all cool and vintagey I have ADHD and I get overwhelmed by too many optionsbuttonsscreensbellswhistles so I keep searching for something that is as pared down as possible but I tend to keep finding very expensive cameras that just look like theyre nofrills In fact most are full of frills,mbd19gq,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbe4p02,shodanime,,2,2025-02-07 00:20:11,,,,I get the aesthetic about it but now they are just using it to charge a premium,mbd19gq,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbdg4bf,Nask_13,,3,2025-02-06 22:12:46,,,,For 2000 that too for body only Hmmmmm I dont know much about cameras but I am pretty sure you can get a nice sony a6700 rig for well under 2000 dollars Also saw some fujifilm cameras on ebay 26mp for roughly 890 dollars with two different lenses,,0.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbfb5ck,vermeiltwhore,,6,2025-02-07 04:22:47,,,,You can get larger sensors sure But the speed weather sealing and size of the camera are all factors where this camera sets itself apart That said the price may come down in the coming months to 15001700,mbdg4bf,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbf778p,akeean,,1,2025-02-07 03:57:48,,,,Or for the super vintage enthusiast digitalize a real vintage analog camera body with a 900 digital sensor film roll probably forever stuck on auto mode or really clunky controls outside the camera Even with skyrocketing used camera prices you can still get a nice 30 year old camera body and lens for 1100,mbdg4bf,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbfre5m,fourthdawg,,0,2025-02-07 06:21:42,,,,For the same price you can get Nikon ZF a full frame camera with retroinspired body Or an A7C II a compact full frame camera with the size of A6700,mbdg4bf,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbn6fsz,BSforgery,,1,2025-02-08 11:31:21,,,,You would be surprised how many cameras can do these things A huge number of Sony cameras can effectively multiply this physical pixels by even shifting the sensor to slightly offset the pixels and then computationally determine from multiple pixel angles what would be between them The truth is a company is advertising easy access to what is normally deep in a convoluted menu and may even require PC tethering to turn on with a knob You either buy the camera for the feature or play with it then use the camera for what you would This extra knob position will be the same,,0.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbf9mne,Even_Establishment95,,-2,2025-02-07 04:13:00,,,,Everyone wants to be a photographer but no one knows how to use a camera lol or lighting Just do something else man Literally anything fucking else Just because you can take photos with your phone that does not mean you are a photographer So exhausting,,0.0,1ijcjjy

comment,mbg4yoz,mangelito,,6,2025-02-07 08:30:16,,,,It also has shitty plastic lenses and a small sensor meaning that the input that your phone can work with is of a significantly lower quality Dont get me wrong phones nowadays can take really good shots in the right circumstances but they mostly look good if viewed on a small screen,mbdwhrk,1.0,1ijcjjy
comment,mbgn41v,HansBooby,,1,2025-02-07 11:31:47,,,,agreed tho iphone lenses are sapphire and yeah for anything below than FF is a small sensor,mbg4yoz,2.0,1ijcjjy
