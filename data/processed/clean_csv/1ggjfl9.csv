comment,luq2gt5,x_scion_x,,71,2024-10-31 17:04:48,,,,From this being on another subreddit yesterday its because the PS5 Pro has a larger cooling system that didnt allow the hinge points to be on the same spots,,0.0,1ggjfl9
comment,luq7v4m,TheMegaMario1,,76,2024-10-31 17:32:37,,,,I feel like thats a real weak answer both the slim and Pro were likely conceived at the same time outer shell wise so they couldve accounted for that in the slims design Its just Sony didnt want even something as simple as plates to transfer so youd have to buy another 100 buck set,luq2gt5,1.0,1ggjfl9
comment,luq8dz8,x_scion_x,,34,2024-10-31 17:35:21,,,,I dont necessarily disagree with you just explaining what the reasoning was The fan is apparently larger which changes the innards which changes where mount points were Either way Im not the targeted customer as I dont buy these meaning the plates anyway,luq7v4m,2.0,1ggjfl9
comment,luq90o2,TheMegaMario1,,15,2024-10-31 17:38:36,,,,Oh yeah peace and love dude was more calling Sonys BS I just feel sorry for anyone who got the slim that might be upgrading if its their only platform and getting nickel and dimed like this,luq8dz8,3.0,1ggjfl9
comment,luqu69j,Harley2280,,9,2024-10-31 19:29:00,,,,I mean theyve got to purchase a disc drive and stand separately already So even if the plates fit anyone buying the Pro already knows theyre getting nickel and dimed,luq90o2,4.0,1ggjfl9
comment,luqv4gl,TheMegaMario1,,4,2024-10-31 19:34:04,,,,I mean theoretically if you had a disc drive slim then you could put the disc drive in the pro so not entirely nickel and dime in that case but the pro is still absurd,luqu69j,5.0,1ggjfl9
comment,lur8ipx,x_scion_x,,2,2024-10-31 20:45:31,,,,and stand separately already I agree they are nickel and diming people but it comes with the stand You just dont get the pretty one if you dont pay an extra 20,luqu69j,5.0,1ggjfl9

comment,lut8l7p,Johnready_,,0,2024-11-01 04:38:08,,,,You dont have to buy another set of plates quite literally no one HAS TO buy the plates they WANT TO buy them and change the color,luq7v4m,2.0,1ggjfl9
comment,lutp15w,andDevW,,0,2024-11-01 07:40:29,,,,Odds of somebody buying and customizing a PS5 then doing the same thing for another PS5slim or Pro are going to be low The number of people who buy more than one PS5 of any variety probably isnt going to be a high number or a significant demographic Nobody at Sony is making expensive design changes based on the idea that theyll make money selling more aftermarket parts,luq7v4m,2.0,1ggjfl9
comment,lurjzpe,SirBulbasaur13,,5,2024-10-31 21:50:49,,,,Im sure they couldve engineered a solution if they really wanted to but they get to sell more custom faceplates this way,luq2gt5,1.0,1ggjfl9
