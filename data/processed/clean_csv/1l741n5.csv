comment,mwu5qua,Auxilae,,288,2025-06-09 14:35:21,,,,400 dock with a single display out interface Thats pretty not great especially considering how common multimonitor setups are nowadays,,0.0,1l741n5
comment,mx5o3gn,DenchKecia,,38,2025-06-11 06:30:13,,,,Not exactly tb ports can be used as video output as well so a single display is not accurate Dont mention the tb ports are replacing HDMI DP,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mxja7gk,alcoholic_jogging,,42,2025-06-13 09:44:18,,,,tb ports can transfer video signal too and I think they will replace HDMI gradually So this dock is capable for multiple displays,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mwyt32p,positivelymonkey,,19,2025-06-10 05:17:29,,,,Its got dual thunderbolt out on the back The dp alt ones are for convenience You should be using the tb ports for monitors to get the most bandwidth,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mwz18q1,PhotoSpike,,18,2025-06-10 06:27:59,,,,It also has two thunderbolts that are both also display outputs,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mwu8jsx,lindymad,,47,2025-06-09 14:49:03,,,,It has one HDMI 21 port and one DisplayPort 21 port if Im reading it correctly,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mwu99jc,Auxilae,,75,2025-06-09 14:52:33,,,,It says Select one output meaning you cant use both at the same time,mwu8jsx,2.0,1l741n5
comment,mwua6an,lindymad,,37,2025-06-09 14:56:54,,,,I cant see where it says that in the article are you reading it somewhere else or am I missing it EDIT I was missing it its printed on the dock itself and can be seen in the picture of it The article however says You can connect to one or two monitors via either of the dedicated video ports DisplayPort andor HDMI or via the downstream Thunderbolt 5 ports or any mix of the options Which I interpreted to mean you could use both at the same time EDIT I guess the article is wrong,mwu99jc,3.0,1l741n5
comment,mwuc4cf,Auxilae,,17,2025-06-09 15:06:18,,,,If you look at the image of the dock youll see the words or there between the two dedicated display interfaces HDMI and DisplayPort You cant plug in a monitor to the HDMI and another with DisplayPort and use them at the same time Docks normally have multiple display interfaces that can be used at once For example my Dell one from work a WD22TB4 has two DisplayPort and one HDMI and you can use them all at the same time It also has two Thunderbolt 4 ports With this Anker dock you can use the Thunderbolt ports as a display out option as well however that is eating into a thunderbolt port that you can use for other things There should have been at least one other output either a lower bandwidth DP 14 or HDMI 20 which would help people with multiple displays with their setups without eating up a superfast port,mwua6an,4.0,1l741n5
comment,mwwm9b4,FewHorror1019,,4,2025-06-09 21:31:24,,,,HAHAA NOT FOR THE MACBOOKS THAT ONLY HAVE USBC ports You get mirroring at best Unless you have a pro with a dedicated display port no amount of adapters or docks will get you two working external monitors,mwuc4cf,5.0,1l741n5
comment,mwx67ti,thedanyes,,4,2025-06-09 23:16:26,,,,Hmm i thought that only applied to like M1 and maybe M2 models and only if youre also using the built in display,mwwm9b4,6.0,1l741n5

comment,mx3yvsi,desteufelsbeitrag,,2,2025-06-10 23:38:31,,,,This is bullshit When working at home the girlie connects her M1 MBP to an itec docking station and runs MacOS on her two external monitors All she had to do was installing the driverssoftware from the vendor and she was good to go And no they are not mirrored and no this does not include the MBPs hdmi port The limitation has to do with the MBA M1 M2 graphic capabilities not with dedicated display ports,mwwm9b4,6.0,1l741n5

comment,mx66p7y,desteufelsbeitrag,,1,2025-06-11 09:34:24,,,,The hdmi 20 port on the right hand side that she used before she got the dock edit I guess were talking about different things here I was initially referring to the MBP because I think OPs unedited comment was phrased a bit differently Anyhoo you could already add a secondary display when using a MBA M1 or use two external displays in case of a MBP M1 This raises the question why the Anker dock only uses one monitor connection OR the other even though every generation of Apple Silicon MBPs and half of all THE MACBOOKS THAT ONLY HAVE USBC ports allow for at least two external monitors,mx4enct,8.0,1l741n5
comment,mx6ercv,syates21,,1,2025-06-11 10:47:01,,,,So M1 Pro not M1 MBP On the originals you had to use display link or some other kinda softwarebased thing to drive two monitors Was really glad they removed this restriction in later models but got stuck living with it for 35 years for work laptop,mx66p7y,9.0,1l741n5
comment,mx55vv0,DocRedbeard,,1,2025-06-11 03:59:54,,,,I think Displaylink docks get around these limitations They create a virtual screen for the OS and transmit a compressed video stream to the dock over a standard USB,mwwm9b4,6.0,1l741n5
comment,mwztlzn,exomachina,,1,2025-06-10 10:54:51,,,,Windows supports MST to split the DisplayPort signal into 2 streams MacOS has never supported this because they went all in on Thunderbolt which has its own way of doing it but the monitor has to support it too All ThunderboltUsbc docks use DisplayPort tunneling to transfer video signal and bandwidth is limited by the cable and usually docks that support 3 monitors at once are using DisplayLink which is a software solution and introduces noticeable lag Ive seen a few docks that have 2 USB connections to mitigate that HDMI connections are handled by onboard chips that convert the DisplayPort signal and it leverages DSC because of bandwidth limitations As for the Mac side of things M series chips have different amounts of display processors M has 1 Pro has 2 and Max has 4 Also fun fact each display processor stream maxes out at 4K120hz so if you connect a 4K240hz monitor via DisplayPort it actually has to use 2 display processors running 1920x2160240hz and combines them,mwuc4cf,5.0,1l741n5

comment,mwx2fs0,littlemanontheboat_,,1,2025-06-09 22:56:05,,,,We can argue that but frankly I dont think its a real must to have two ports when other external peripherals you most likely have can have HDMI as well For me this would totally work with my laptop and two monitors My M1 Max has an HDMI out that I dont even use I have an Asus monitor that uses USBC I have an external raid drive with an HDMI where my second monitor is so technically this would be another HDMI for a third monitor so plenty of options and Im only using a laptop,mwu5qua,1.0,1l741n5

comment,mwwmkoy,FewHorror1019,,1,2025-06-09 21:32:59,,,,Yea you need one with a dedicated display out like mbp then you can use two external monitors Edit not mirrored tho,mwwidil,4.0,1l741n5
comment,mwxtqhi,MrBlahman,,1,2025-06-10 01:28:02,,,,You can connect two monitors to a Macbook M4 Air using both USBC ports one for each screen No dedicated display output needed Or you can plug one Thunderbolt NOT just USBC dock in and do two screens that way If you plug a regular USBC dock in youll get only one screen or both screens working but mirrored which is useless Apple it just works Meanwhile my wifes Dell latitude happily docks via one cable and her USBC dock and powers 2 screens all day long Never tried 3 though which now rereading the comment chain may have been what you meant,mwwmkoy,5.0,1l741n5

comment,mwy0dkg,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-06-10 02:05:17,,,,People seem to miss this USBC is just a connector standard Monitors do video by supporting DisplayPort DP Alt mode over USBC But its not the same as supporting any USBC connections,mww23ab,2.0,1l741n5

comment,mwu0hxu,maidenmaan,,37,2025-06-09 14:08:48,,,,Depends on how you define future I suppose the future thing of this dock is the thunderbolt 5 ports If Im not wrong tb5 is not applied massively so yeah in this case call it future proof is somehow convincing for me,mwtoyeq,1.0,1l741n5
comment,mwtyoye,ANGOmarcello,,41,2025-06-09 13:59:17,,,,I have a thunderbolt 3 docking station and Im still very happy this thing itself for me was future proof back when I bought it So in this case to a certain degree it is believable,mwtoyeq,1.0,1l741n5

comment,mwu85xe,kevihaa,,5,2025-06-09 14:47:11,,,,Probably Theres an argument to be made that below 40 inches the difference between 1440p and 4k is so minor as to fail blind testing for most people Like if you take the more resolution is always better argument at face value then youd likely see 8k making more inroads than it has Yes yes there needs to be content but 720p was popular before almost any broadcast cable was above SD and 1080p was normalized when most content was still 720p The same thing has happened for 4k Refresh rates are likely to go up and up as well as better and better implementations of HDR which is a way more significant improvement to viewing experience than more pixels but as it stands going above 1440p 4k depending on screen size might just be a vanity exercise,mwu1ut4,5.0,1l741n5
comment,mwuirrz,Tepigg4444,,4,2025-06-09 15:37:54,,,,But now is the future from when they bought that thing is the point Its a literal decade old at this point of course it isnt going to be future proof anymore but the fact that they can use it and have 0 complaints still means it was obviously pretty well future proofed,mwu1ut4,5.0,1l741n5
comment,mwule7g,Small_Editor_3693,,4,2025-06-09 15:50:13,,,,Well ya They can use it with decade old parts Thats not future proofing,mwuirrz,6.0,1l741n5
comment,mwu3ofj,ResoluteGreen,,-1,2025-06-09 14:25:03,,,,Im skeptical that 4k 144hz will become mainstream for an average user Itll always be more expensive than lower definitions and frame rates and youre well into diminishing returns at those levels most people wont notice a difference nor care for it,mwu1ut4,5.0,1l741n5
comment,mwu4cl6,Small_Editor_3693,,4,2025-06-09 14:28:26,,,,Whats the point of future proof if you cant upgrade If youre just an average user there zero reason to get anything future proof Just use that ecosystem till its not supported,mwu3ofj,6.0,1l741n5
comment,mwuaodm,_DuranDuran_,,3,2025-06-09 14:59:19,,,,My main monitor is literally a 27 4k 144Hz monitor Since Im using dual 4k monitors and a TB4 dock if I want the second monitor to run at 60Hz and I do then the max refresh rate on the main monitor is 95Hz Good but not quite as smooth when scrolling in my IDE or web browser as 120 would be,mwu3ofj,6.0,1l741n5
comment,mwv1urc,dakta,,3,2025-06-09 17:07:12,,,,And thats even with DSC Theres just not quite enough bandwidth on TB 3 or 4 to push two full DP streams I have the same kind of setup,mwuaodm,7.0,1l741n5

comment,mwujdfp,Oops_I_Cracked,,2,2025-06-09 15:40:43,,,,I like most people dont replace my external drives every time a faster version of USB or thunderbolt comes out So like many people I have a mix of devices from USBA 30 drives through thunderbolt 2 drives Some of those drives are old enough that I plan on replacing them in the next few years When I do replace them I will likely buy drives with faster speeds than my current drives So I would like a dock I would buy today to support the drives Ill buy in 3 to 5 years Additionally while today I dont need a dock that can provide 240w power I may some day in the future Additionally thunderbolt five has four PCIE 4 lanes versus PCIE 3 But again is not something I need today but is something I may want in the future If 144 Hz refresh rate is the main thing you need this obviously isnt the product for you But there are a way way more things a dock can be future proof for than just refresh rate The place I work is actually in the process of buying a bunch of docks We have zero 144 Hz monitors and I can say with a pretty high degree of certainty that unless 144 Hz becomes the default and you cannot buy lower refresh rate they will also not have 144 hz monitors for 10 years from now We do however have to deal with tremendous amounts of data so being able to move that shit around quickly is extremely valuable,mwuea6f,9.0,1l741n5

comment,mwy3hlm,Small_Editor_3693,,2,2025-06-10 02:23:10,,,,If you are looking for something to be future proofed you are looking to add stuff that is not on the market today To get tomorrows features A truck cant be future proofed unless youre looking to buy a boat or something in the future I guess,mwy0szg,4.0,1l741n5
