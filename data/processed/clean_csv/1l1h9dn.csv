comment,mvnvpyk,not_so_chi_couple,,15,2025-06-02 21:38:38,,,,This is bad reporting they arent claiming they did some ground breaking technique They wanted a project to work together on and thought this would make a good video as well as a neat live demonstration later It was meant to be entertaining not revolutionary,mvnlpnb,1.0,1l1h9dn

comment,mvkwv78,chrisdh79,,1,2025-06-02 12:54:30,,,,From the article In a workshop filled with the whir of machines and the scent of fresh plastic two makers have found a new use for an old piece of exercise equipment Ivan Miranda and JÃ³n Schone both wellknown in the DIY 3D printing community have transformed a discarded treadmill into a massive beltdriven 3D printer Their project pushes the boundaries of whats possible with home fabrication The idea began with a simple question could the moving belt of a treadmill be adapted to serve as the conveyor in a 3D printer allowing for prints of virtually unlimited length For Miranda and Schone the answer was yes but getting there took a blend of ingenuity technical skill and a willingness to experiment with unconventional materials Their process started with stripping the treadmill down to its essentials They kept the sturdy frame and the continuous rubber belt which would become the heart of their new machine The team then mounted linear rails directly onto the treadmills frame and constructed a custom gantry system to support the print head To handle the demands of largescale printing they developed an extralarge extruder and integrated stepper motors to drive precise movement Custom wiring and modules tied the system together ensuring that the belt and print head worked in perfect sync The technical challenges were significant Calibrating the belts speed to match the printers output was crucial for producing clean accurate prints Adhesion also proved tricky they needed the plastic to stick firmly to the moving belt during printing but release easily once finished Through trial and error Miranda and Schone refined their approach sharing both breakthroughs and setbacks with their online audience Video,,0.0,1l1h9dn

comment,mvl3i0k,Durahl,,-12,2025-06-02 13:33:16,,,,I dont know man Who the F has or goes out and buys an old Treadmill to build themselves a Large Scale Belted 3D Printer theyd have to modify the ever living crap out of other than for a Clickbait Title It makes no sense Considering how much they had to change INCLUDING the Frame youre better of making your own from Scratch using off the shelf Components The best part about this stunt was Ivan taking a break from his Marble Clock which IMHO has really just turned into another never ending Wintergatan thing Its just just not funny anymore watching content about it Id rather have him do cool stuff actually worth pursuing like I dont know a mostly 3D Printed CNC Lathe akin to his 3Axis CNC,,0.0,1l1h9dn

comment,mvlgz00,Leafy0,,1,2025-06-02 14:43:54,,,,Someone just dropped a mostly 3dp lathe a month or two ago But they didnt seem to be a very big fan of linear guides so someone could remix it to be substantially better without much effort,mvl3i0k,1.0,1l1h9dn
