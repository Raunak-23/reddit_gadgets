comment,lywtu2r,CookieKeeperN2,,3,2024-11-25 14:43:26,,,,The raw speed for GPU computing is much slower than CPU iirc However it excels in parallelability Im not talkikg about 10 threads Im talking about 1000 its very useful when you work on massively parallel operations such as matrix manipulation So its great for machine learning and deep learning if the optimization can be rewritten in matrix operations but not so great if you do iterations where the next one depends on the previous iteration MCMC Plus the data transfer between GPU and RAM is still a gigantic bottle neck For most stuff CPU based computations will be faster and much simpler I tried to run CUDA based algorithms on our GPU P100 and it was a hassle to get it running compared to CPU based algorithms,lythj9f,5.0,1gywo4t
comment,lyyif4w,tecedu,,1,2024-11-25 20:01:01,,,,Kinda yeah but thats why you use GPU directly nowadays like it is slower for pure parallel operations but embarrassingly parallel is a beast even with scheduling For us we have a couple of GPUs setup with CPUs just being orchestrators Using cudf you only have the orchestration overhead and thats all no more transferring stuff to and fro from memory or storage Again this is still cheaper for us to do with CPUs when our data is little but when the data sizes starts to grows its so much better,lywtu2r,6.0,1gywo4t

comment,lyvvvsp,massive_cock,,2,2024-11-25 10:14:54,,,,I potentially lose warranty but tbh on such an expensive item while its a big gamble the odds it actually goes bad are quite low while the constant gains from having the GPU itself are well constant and immense In a pinch I can ship it out to my sibling in the US who can claim the warranty and I can pick it up when its fixedreplaced on my next visit I have other GPUs I can run in the meantime As for import duties nope Ive never had any trouble bringing a personal product through in my carryon When I first moved over here I brought 2 full PCs disassembled in my luggage with the CPUs and GPUs in my carryon and everything else in my checked bags Every time I fly back into Europe I bring each years upgrades Its never an issue In fact most of the time theres no passport control or customs at all in Germany walk straight through empty booths and off you go,lyvv00x,5.0,1gywo4t

comment,lyu5bt2,dark_sable_dev,,23,2024-11-25 01:30:01,,,,Historically you arent wrong the 90 series made absolutely no sense in terms of a value That started to change with Ada Lovelace where especially with ray tracing the 4080 was about 70 of the performance of the 4090 at 75 of the price Now with the 5000 series the 5080 is credibly rumored to halve halve the CU count of the 5090 and I doubt its going to cost half as much,lytpbrw,2.0,1gywo4t
comment,lyukzeh,-Agathia-,,14,2024-11-25 03:09:03,,,,The current announced 5080 is a 5070 in disguise 12GB ram is mid range That would be the minimum I recommend to anyone wanting a good computer if they want to play the most recent games in a decent manner And 5080 is NOT mid range it should be somewhat future proof Note I currently have a 10GB 3080 and while its quite performant it showed its limits several times and really struggles in VR The GPU market is pretty terrible at the moment Its either shit or overpriced,lyu5bt2,3.0,1gywo4t

comment,lyv2gy1,VisceralExperience,,7,2024-11-25 05:15:37,,,,If you only play video games then sure But for a lot of workloads a 3090 for example smokes the 3080,lytpbrw,2.0,1gywo4t
comment,lyvfagp,buttholedestroyer87,,3,2024-11-25 07:13:24,,,,I bought a 4090 because GPU rendering is much faster than CPU I use a render engine that can use both my GPU and CPU to render so I am doubling my render power Also with 24gb of ram I can load a lot on to the card that I wouldnt be able to with a 12gb card People gamers need to realise graphics cards arent just used for gaming anymore,lytpbrw,2.0,1gywo4t
comment,lywducy,None,,0,2024-11-25 12:59:14,,,,Even then the 4090 isnt a good option youre better off renting time on a renderfarm or building your own with quadros Also Im not saying that in very rare use cases the 4090 doesnt makes sense just that most people who own one spent a ridiculous amount of money for minor gains,lyvfagp,3.0,1gywo4t
comment,lzndyfg,buttholedestroyer87,,1,2024-11-30 01:44:06,,,,Well no not really Im an automotive cgi artist I only do stills so a 4090 can handle 150 CAD data in VRED or Vray without issue Time to render in VRED or Vray is less than 30 seconds with denoiser Its not just about render time its about what can be loaded on to the card As the automotive industry is moving more and more in to Unreal Engine animations are done a lot quicker and with heavy scenes forests cities etc again the 24gb of GPU memory handles it without problem As for render farms I just finished an animation job and was using Chaos Cloud because its a one button solution and nothing else supported some of the plugins I was using To render 300 frames 1440p cost around 600 credits which works out around 600 There were 3 rounds of client feedback which took the cost over 2k The 4090 is absolutely a good option for me I can play any game I want I can render anything I want and I can pump out AI generated images for fun and in no time at all,lywducy,4.0,1gywo4t

comment,lz4gvev,TrekForce,,1,2024-11-26 19:33:09,,,,I would honestly be quite surprised if you tried it and you stayed not interested Youre not interested because you havent experienced what youre missing 3d tv was definitely more novelty You could try it in the perfect setting and it is still meh Its kinda neat VR is different and absolutely has been and will be adopted by more people The only people who dont think so either havent tried it or are too easily nauseated by it,lyz0hfu,12.0,1gywo4t

comment,m2vix6p,akeean,,1,2024-12-19 20:22:01,,,,You bet NVIDIA will claim it is happening Prolly through raytracing improvements combined with some driver locked features like neural texture compression in a benchmark set up that causes the 4090 to overflow its VRAM at comparable looking texture details to a neural texture enabled 5090 Basically the same inflated and artificial performance claims they did when comparing frame generated fps to non FG green performance bar of deceit For real world use prosumer grade VR headsets are over 4k per eye nowadays and dynamic foveated rendering to ease the burden is not a mainstream feature yet either You can totally max out a 4090 with that and not even need the highest settings or mods to increase the burden You can max out a 4090 with Minecraft if you really want to There can always be a use for significantly more graphics power the question is mostly price,lytpgdw,2.0,1gywo4t
comment,lyu20bg,elton_john_lennon,,-5,2024-11-25 01:09:34,,,,Yeah thats not happening 70 would be so much of an increase that literally no game other than maybe Cyberpunk at max settings will be able to take advantage of it I think the reason is different first of all nVidia isnt competing with anyone else in this high end segment so all they have to beat is 4090 and second we are closer and closer to stagnation when it comes to compute power growth We cant shrink that much more maybe a few generations are left we cant have a transistor be smaller than atom after all and increasing power demand and die size is starting to become ridiculous so it would be just wasteful for nVidia to just throw 70 when there is absolutely no need for therm to do so,lytpgdw,2.0,1gywo4t
