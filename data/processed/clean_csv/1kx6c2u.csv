comment,mun9id4,hardy_83,,12,2025-05-28 04:38:43,,,,This annoys me so much When my PC dies I was just gonna get a prebuilt but all of the ones in my price range ONLY have 4060s and literally nothing else No AMD no Arc Nothing,mumv9kj,3.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mune6va,Enthapythius,,16,2025-05-28 05:16:05,,,,There are a lot of pc building websites which let you customize your setup with automatic calculation of the most fitting processor needed power supply etc They almost always also have an option to assemble the rig for you for a bit of extra money You will get a stronger machine for the same price a prebuilt wouldve run you and the time difference between clicking through the options and looking for a good pre built deal is nonexistend,mun9id4,4.0,1kx6c2u

comment,mumy0f3,karrotwin,,11,2025-05-28 03:16:51,,,,Thats literally the opposite of what the article says At 1080p Full HD without ray tracing or upscaling we measured the RTX 5060 8 GB to roughly match last generations RTX 4060 Ti And why are we comparing these anyway The cheapest new 4060ti is still 500 bucks,mumu86h,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mun9fs6,lordraiden007,,8,2025-05-28 04:38:10,,,,Which indicates that the limitation in that case was not the GPU as the 1440p and 4k tests both showed the 4060 Ti performing better than the 5060 8GB,mumy0f3,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mun148h,mockingbird-,,30,2025-05-28 03:37:43,,,,It falls behind at 1440p and even more so at 4K compared to the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB and its not because of a lack of VRAM because the GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 8GB also has 8GB,mumy0f3,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mung3wy,chinomaster182,,-14,2025-05-28 05:32:02,,,,Its virtually margin of error I agree though that a generational upgrade should mean that it should beat that card fairly easily,mun148h,3.0,1kx6c2u
comment,munrhmk,danielv123,,15,2025-05-28 07:15:35,,,,12 is not margin off error but sure That is more than the difference between the 4080 and 4080 super which most would argue is a decent upgrade,mung3wy,4.0,1kx6c2u
comment,munrntk,chinomaster182,,0,2025-05-28 07:17:17,,,,I was referring to the 1440p results which are 4 8gb of vram is clearly insufficient for 4k anyways,munrhmk,5.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muo0f91,Braunijs,,2,2025-05-28 08:44:10,,,,Bought a New 4060 ti msi ventus 3x 8gb for 350 eur,mumy0f3,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mumz271,Blazr5402,,-8,2025-05-28 03:23:46,,,,No one reads articles on reddit anymore But yeah youre right Crazy generational uplifts with technology dont happen anymore The 5060 has one job to be better than the 4060 If the 5060 is actually available at MSRP it will have done its job Comparisons are yet to be seen against the 9060xt but this is shaping up to be a decent card 8 GB cards costing 300 is unfortunate but honestly the only card at this price range with more VRAM is the B580 and those are pretty hard to find and are rarely at MSRP anyways The 5060 also outperforms the B580 at 1080p anyways,mumy0f3,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muoha25,masterprtzl,,2,2025-05-28 11:13:54,,,,Just got a build with 5060 16gb should be here in a week or two Got a really really good deal on the rig but all these bad reviews got me worried Can always upgrade the card later down the road and it will likely still suit my needs but damn wish I had researched this more,mumu86h,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muro9r3,MixaLv,,1,2025-05-28 20:57:50,,,,Wow wtf Thats even worse than I expected,mumu86h,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mvbzpjl,ESCMalfunction,,1,2025-06-01 00:06:38,,,,So basically its a glorified 3060 ti that costs 300350 dollars And I paid 350 for a 3060 ti almost 4 year ago This GPU market is so fucked,mumu86h,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mumw6lf,That_Host_5296,,-11,2025-05-28 03:05:06,,,,No it is more powerful than rtx 4060ti,mumu86h,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mumx3u2,NotAPreppie,,13,2025-05-28 03:11:00,,,,I mean it draws more power than a 4060ti,mumw6lf,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mun56vo,That_Host_5296,,-9,2025-05-28 04:06:29,,,,But it is very cheap,mumx3u2,3.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mun9zhk,Random-Name-7160,,48,2025-05-28 04:42:22,,,,Proof once again that they dont give a rats ass about the gaming enthusiasts who positioned them to take advantage of the lucrative bitcoin and AI farms Personally Im waiting on the next gen of Intel gpus If they keep on their current trajectory mean green could lose a huge part of the market,,0.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muux3wp,Swallagoon,,6,2025-05-29 10:23:02,,,,Well no shit A capitalist venture only looks for the best return If AI and crypto make more money then why wouldnt they go for that Why would nvidia ever care about gaming enthusiasts,mun9zhk,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mv1xm8y,Kadarach,,2,2025-05-30 12:02:30,,,,Surprised by the downvotes this is just basic economics prices come from supply and demand balancing out helping allocate things to where theyre most needed Right now AI gaming,muux3wp,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muqz5zl,Juub1990,,2,2025-05-28 18:59:46,,,,Does the performance still tank on lowerend CPUs,mun9zhk,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mv7qd2z,Yeeeoow,,0,2025-05-31 08:32:34,,,,Intel sais not to use it with 9th gen intel CPUs or older Anything newer than that will be fine Im using a 14th gen i5 and its fine And that cpu feels like the best value thing on the market right now half the price of a ryzen 7 7800x3d and outperforms them on cpubenchmark by alot,muqz5zl,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muoekst,obelix_dogmatix,,-20,2025-05-28 10:53:32,,,,wont happen Intel is long gone I would be surprised if they dont declare bankruptcy in a couple years,mun9zhk,1.0,1kx6c2u

comment,mv1hnki,NiNieNielNiels,,1,2025-05-30 10:00:43,,,,Depends on what games and screen resolution you play I guess,mv1hdtc,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muo171s,diacewrb,,11,2025-05-28 08:51:45,,,,What a waste of silicon Really hoping Intel or anyone else can make a good alternative with 16GB of VRAM since AMD also want to concentrate on the AI and data centre side of the business instead,,0.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muo1k3t,OffbeatDrizzle,,12,2025-05-28 08:55:19,,,,98 of people will be very happy with a 9070xt Not sure why everyone keeps sucking nvidias dick when its clear they dont care about gamers whatsoever,muo171s,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muo8dxw,Phantasmio,,3,2025-05-28 10:01:13,,,,I went red for the first time last year and Im pretty happy about it except for encoding for streams Thats all Id really love to see a solid encoder out of AMD and theyll be perfect for me I still sometimes switch to my old 2070Super for streaming certain games or use my CPU if I have enough overhead,muo1k3t,2.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muqchbu,henrydavidthoreauawy,,1,2025-05-28 17:11:22,,,,I use a Mac to stream so Im a little out of the loop what is AMDs encoder lacking that Nvidia cards have I heard something about being able to stream multiple resolutions at once with newer Nvidia cards which sounds cool,muo8dxw,3.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muqjss3,Phantasmio,,2,2025-05-28 17:47:10,,,,I dont know the nitty gritty exactly but Nvidia encoder is just better I stream Dead By Daylight and with my 2070 or CPU as an encoder I can set it up to look crisp and clear regardless of whats happening With my AMD gpu 6800xt it becomes very pixelated and blurry whenever I move the camera around and in low light scenarios Ive spent hours tinkering with the encoder looking up settings in videos and on posts streaming at different resolutions and no matter what I do its always blurry when there is movement,muqchbu,4.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muokbb7,mockingbird-,,3,2025-05-28 11:35:52,,,,AMD just announced the Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB for 349 MSRP,muo171s,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mup45dx,botgtk,,-7,2025-05-28 13:35:33,,,,why the fck would you need 16GB of vram in a low end GPU these GPUS are for i1440p and youll rarely need like even 12 gb,muo171s,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mup5tp1,Homerdk,,2,2025-05-28 13:44:28,,,,Holy shit the prices on these things What are their material costs that send the price this high I have been building PCs since before they were 3D somewhere along the way the graphics cards started costing more than everything else in the build including pheriphals I hope other countries like China soon get closer to being a viable choice Dont feel like ever buying a Nvidia product again,,0.0,1kx6c2u
comment,mv1hvcz,Christopher135MPS,,1,2025-05-30 10:02:40,,,,Same here Been doing custom builds since 2003 CPUs used to cost 152 times the GPU Now high end GPUs cost more than combined cost of everything else Its crazy,mup5tp1,1.0,1kx6c2u
comment,muu3s2j,Very_Creative_Wow,,1,2025-05-29 05:44:47,,,,So is greed the only reason we still have 8GB cards and the baseline hasnt been brought up,,0.0,1kx6c2u
