comment,lvji2cv,sargonas,,8,2024-11-05 16:09:07,,,,Its not a bribe its Apple meeting their demands They passed a new law that requires at least 40 of a smart phone being made or designed or developed in the country for it to be allowed to be sold there and they have banned many android phones with the same reason Apple cannot feasibly move iPhone production or development to Indonesia so they are taking the fine print of the law and using the alternative option provided in the law to shift various forms of investment into the economy to bypass the manufacturing requirement Theyre doing the thing the Indonesian government is trying to force them to do in order to be able to sell phones in the country Is it messed up Yeah probably but its either that or walk away from a massive market Which no sane company would do,lvhsouo,1.0,1gk1qen

comment,lvilzey,shadowrun456,,-9,2024-11-05 13:13:49,,,,Because apple signed a contract promising they would invest a minimum amount of money in indonesia Did they have a choice to not sign this contract because indonesia has laws that a certain percentage has to be sourced locally to protect their businesses So the answer is no Thats what makes it blackmail racketeering and apple fell short a measly 14 million and refuses to pay itz even though its such a nothing number Its not about money its about sending a message I cant believe than Im defending Apple but good on them to at least initially refusing to submit to blackmail and pay bribes,lvide4m,2.0,1gk1qen
comment,lvj7jyv,GerhardArya,,1,2024-11-05 15:16:45,,,,No that makes the country smart as it knows how to extract the most benefit out of giving a company access to a market of 270 million people Instead of just letting a company exploit their people for nothing Apple knew what they need to do to be allowed in the indonesian market they agreed to it they failed to fulfill it Samsung and the chinese brands follow the rules without too much hassle Why should Apple get special treatment Its not blackmail because no company is ENTITLED access to a countrys market Its not a bribe because the money Apple is offering here goes to investing on new factories in the country instead of officials pockets,lvilzey,3.0,1gk1qen

comment,lvjcjd1,GerhardArya,,3,2024-11-05 15:41:50,,,,Again not blackmail since the company is not entitled access to the market in the first place You think America doesnt have certain rules companies need to follow to enter the american market EU China India You sound like an entitled corpo shill that thinks companies are above countries and should be free to do whatever they want,lvjalvo,5.0,1gk1qen
comment,lvjfrdr,shadowrun456,,-1,2024-11-05 15:57:42,,,,Again not blackmail since the company is not entitled access to the market in the first place But they were already allowed And its not about following some health safety environmental or labor regulations Its pay us x million or we will remove your access Thats what makes it blackmail entitled corpo shill How to admit youve lost the argument without admitting youve lost the argument switch to ad hominem attacks,lvjcjd1,6.0,1gk1qen
comment,lvjfy13,GerhardArya,,2,2024-11-05 15:58:36,,,,They were allowed because they agreed to those rules The failed to fulfill their part of the deal and now theyre trying to bargain their way to fulfilling partially the deal they failed to uphold They were too low in their indonesian investment by 14 mil they now try to bargain it to 10 mil Yes you are a corpo shill because you think countries shouldnt be able to force companies to fulfill deals they AGREED to and SIGNED,lvjfrdr,7.0,1gk1qen
