comment,lw9kn90,_RADIANTSUN_,,17,2024-11-09 16:07:38,,,,I speak as someone who cherished a Pixel 4a for several years as my preferred daily driver over many other newer more expensive phones I hate the Pixel brand its a big failure and largely a shit follow up to the Nexus line Rick Osterloh has no idea how to handle the development of a hardware brand This is not at all to say Nexus phones didnt have these problems actually often they were way worse Im just saying if youre gonna start making upmarket phones priced like iPhones then you best not miss And certainly NOWHERE close to as regularly often and hugely as the Pixel hardware does Imagine a world where Google has an actually good Pixel hardware ecosystem Yea keep imagining keep dreaming that is a fantasy,,0.0,1gn4xjo

comment,lwautj4,Siyuen_Tea,,1,2024-11-09 20:15:13,,,,Ive had the pixel 8 pro for a year Bluetooth crashes hotspot will just say error and not work The worst part is this all started the day after the warranty expired Just my luck Id hoped it was a glitch Reseted factory reseted and WiFi reseted Resetting used to fix Bluetooth but not anymore I had these issues with the Pixel 7 too but that was reasonable because Id actually dropped the phone,,0.0,1gn4xjo

comment,lwct6t5,carteblanc71,,1,2024-11-10 03:09:18,,,,I recently purchased iPhone 15 thru Spectrum and used it in my car for the first time with Google Map and Youtube Music at the same time for about 10 minutes and it got so hot I had to disconnect it from my car It is crucial that I should be able to use them for hours on long trips without getting it overheated so I returned it and purchase a Galaxy S24 At first the Galaxy S24 was overheating almost as much when I used it with those two apps but I managed to lower the temperature by changing its settings to minimize the chance of overheating from Youtube tutorial video There were so many videos there teaching tricks to tweak the settings of iPhone and Galaxy devices to address the overheating issue I had to pay 50 of restocking fee when I returned the iPhone 15 although it was due to a legitimate reason,lw9lz8y,1.0,1gn4xjo
