comment,mingss9,trowayit,,9,2025-03-19 17:24:48,,,,I use an ASUS ryzen 5 minipc as a linux plexgameadmin server Theres been times where Ive borked stuff bad enough that Ive had to drag a monitor into the closet it sits in just to fix something This would be nice for such an occasion,mimft9g,1.0,1jexkpq
comment,misqfav,Lostndamaged,,1,2025-03-20 14:10:03,,,,This will be handy dandy for my servers on film tv sets With the onboard touchscreen I can design a custom ui in the software to do basic controls and not have to have an additional screen or keyboard,mingss9,2.0,1jexkpq
comment,misy0k0,TheSmJ,,1,2025-03-20 14:49:03,,,,I keep a old monitor with dead pixels connected to my server for this reason I only need to power it on once a year or so when something goes sideways but it makes those once in a blue moon visits to the server effortless and one less monitor out of the dump,mingss9,2.0,1jexkpq
comment,miooi1f,TryingT0Wr1t3,,1,2025-03-19 20:57:57,,,,GPD Pocket has HDMI and keyboardtouchpad as KVM Its not cheap but is a small computer that can also do that,mingss9,2.0,1jexkpq

comment,mipj1cm,TryingT0Wr1t3,,2,2025-03-19 23:36:52,,,,Ah I think I understand what you are saying you mean you wanted this small monitor already in the server you have not using this PC to access your other PC as a debug tool Yeah I see There are some small monitors for this for case mod but there are small portable usbc monitors too and they are surprisingly cheap,miop933,4.0,1jexkpq
comment,mipih56,scsibusfault,,1,2025-03-19 23:33:52,,,,For the reason you just complained about The gpd is essentially a laptop that also works as a KVM in a pinch So if you already have one you can plug it into a headless server and get video keyboard mouse all in a single portable unit You obviously would not buy one solely to use as a monitor,miop933,4.0,1jexkpq
comment,minq8xm,atb12688,,5,2025-03-19 18:09:37,,,,The 890m is roughly equivalent to a 1070 and is capable of ray tracing Integrated graphics is no longer the joke it once was You should be able to do quite a bit especially with older titles which are apparently getting more play atm with this APU assuming you have at least 16gb or RAM or even better 32,mimft9g,1.0,1jexkpq
comment,miq6uu3,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,-3,2025-03-20 01:52:18,,,,WTF the 1070 is a ten year old GFX card10 year old performance is a joke lol Hardware community has gone really weird in the last year lol,minq8xm,2.0,1jexkpq
comment,miqgsl2,Paksarra,,5,2025-03-20 02:51:39,,,,Keep in mind that most games dont target bleeding edge hardware anymore The days of can it run Crysis are longgone now its will it run on a Steam Deck On top of that a lot of people just play live service games these days You dont need a 600 video card to run Fortnite and Marvel Rivals I was rather surprised to realize that my new desktop with a Raedon RX 5700 is already five years old the only game Ive had any issues with was trying out the Final Fantasy 16 demo and getting frame drops in heavy cutscenes on the default graphical settings I just had to tweak the settings and I was good to finish the demo However to be fair I dont play a lot of new release AAAs,miq6uu3,3.0,1jexkpq
comment,mjistn4,Dt2_0,,2,2025-03-24 18:35:28,,,,And yet the 1070 is still perfectly performant in most games at 1080p with lower quality settings AAA games Maybe not but then again lots of AAA games run on the Steam Deck,miq6uu3,3.0,1jexkpq
comment,mip3rsu,welsper59,,2,2025-03-19 22:15:36,,,,Same As long as it isnt too expensive or perhaps has cheaper options and my eyesight doesnt become terrible I often do have interest in these things I try to find whatever use I can for them even if they arent used that often I still use my 3rd gen Surface Pro from time to time to do little work things or when I travel Also this mini PCs 5 screen isnt bad at all when you consider thats only a little smaller than most phones today Just dont expect to use the screen for things that have small UIfonts lol,mimft9g,1.0,1jexkpq
comment,mipgncd,rolfraikou,,2,2025-03-19 23:23:58,,,,Ive been seeing so many people buying those mini displays that show hardware stats that are even close to the size of this display So I could even see someone who rarely needed the built in display to be a main display setting it on their desk within sight using the built in display just for stats on temperatures and speed And maybe you do need to take it on the go for some reason you already have a display built in Also for troubleshooting if a external display were to stop working your built in one should keep working,mimft9g,1.0,1jexkpq
comment,mimb6ja,chrisdh79,,28,2025-03-19 13:58:13,,,,From the article Mini PC brand Aoostar has launched the GFlip 370 a palmsized mini PC that aside from its cool display also packs some serious power under the hood Thats thanks to AMDs Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 APU at its heart which boasts 12 Zen 5 cores and Radeon 890M integrated graphics Aoostar says this setup can handle mainstream AAA games with ease Gentler titles like League of Legends can even hit 90 fps at 4K But lets talk about the star of the show that flipup screen At a modest 5 inches the screen isnt exactly a cinematic experience but it has a fullHD 1080p resolution and supports touch input Aoostar touts it as perfect for system monitoring quick tasks or even catching up on your favorite shows The screen is mounted on an aluminum alloy hinge allowing it to tilt up to 65 degrees Its a clever addition especially for a mini PC where space is allimportant since the goal is to cut down on the dimensions as much as possible Screens are not typically a priority for PC makers when designing such compact devices That said the integrated screen isnt the only way to experience the GFlip 370s capabilities Five inches just doesnt cut it for tasks like gaming so the mini PC also comes equipped with HDMI 21 and Oculink ports for connecting to more impressive displays At the same time dual 25G Ethernet ports and WiFi 7 support ensure lightningfast connectivity while a fingerprint scanner next to the flipup screen adds a touch of convenience for quick logins Cooling is handled by a large vapor chamber and a single bottommounted fan which should keep things running smoothly And for those who like to tinker the GFlip 370 offers removable memory and two M2 PCIe 40 slots for storage Aoostar hasnt announced pricing yet but if past models are any indication the GFlip 370 could land around the 700 mark Whether thats a steal or a stretch will depend on how much you value portability and that unique screen,,0.0,1jexkpq
comment,mimtltn,A_Doormat,,47,2025-03-19 15:32:47,,,,I love fun hardware like this Seems like theyre getting closer to my ideal device I am on call 247 365 for critical infrastructure and I hate carrying around my damn laptop everywhere I go I wish I had a more portable device I could have in my day bag or jacket pocket that would let me vpnremote into my environment and begin troubleshooting if I am remote So far the closest thing I have isthe steam deck lol Not exactly a perfect solution This little guy would be great provided I had a portable keyboard or something A little beefier than I need of course,,0.0,1jexkpq

comment,min1m20,chamullerousa,,-5,2025-03-19 16:11:56,,,,Fun idea but I feel like this is just barely missing the mark Why not use the smart phone form factor and just make it a little thicker We are already accustomed to that and you could use the extra thickness for ports and battery,,0.0,1jexkpq
comment,minxvcg,Yankee831,,3,2025-03-19 18:46:37,,,,Nah how is a phone better Like set your phone on a table with a bunch of cords plugged in and now I have to look straight down at it its a pc not a cordless device its meant to be plugged into a monitor and be used with peripherals not as phone,min1m20,1.0,1jexkpq
comment,minzu8q,chamullerousa,,-1,2025-03-19 18:56:06,,,,The phone screen would be the portable viewing option Bluetooth for keyboard and mouse No ports required Plus fewer moving parts to fail When you are at a desk with external monitor then youre plugging in peripherals and not using the integrated display Also the form factor is way more portable than this almost cube Even the foldable phone form factor would be a good option Samsung DeX is heading in the right direction but it isnt being invested in enough,minxvcg,2.0,1jexkpq
comment,mio3rab,Yankee831,,3,2025-03-19 19:15:03,,,,It has a screen So now it needs a kick stand to be viewed You hold a phone in your hand you dont hold this in your hands Phones are not meant to be used on a table theyre meant to be held Laying your phone down on a table is not as good as a screen that pops up on a hinge The screen is small and not meant as the primary form factor This is meant to be connected to a screen so ports unless youre going to be using wireless screen tech which is not common Once again its meant to be hooked up to a screen and a keyboardmouse Sure you can use Bluetooth but its still going to need a screen A brick with a flat screen misses the mark way more than this does Your device creates more issues with no gain Whats the benefit to being a slab,minzu8q,3.0,1jexkpq
