comment,n01p3vz,luv2hotdog,,1,2025-06-27 11:28:14,,,,I had the original titan only replaced it when it started chugging too hard for reliable daily use Which you should expect to happen with cheaper phones like this I am still amazed at all the cool tech they fit into it for the price The keyboard was great the battery was fricking enormous you could probably have hammered a nail into soft wood with it too The camera and internal specs were so so but again you arent buying a cheap phone like this because you care about camera quality and up to date chips MrMobile did a video review on it at the time and summed it up well with if you want it you already know you want it and nothing I say is going to make any difference there was just nothing else like it out there Id probably be pledging for this one if they hadnt removed the headphone jack Headphone jack on a mid range device that also has an IR blaster and a nerdy AF physical keyboard just seems like a no brainer I wonder why they removed it,,0.0,1ljmsf2

comment,mzlhplv,hickok3,,11,2025-06-24 22:36:10,,,,Physical keyboard were the only reason Blackberry stayed relevant Their UI and OS sucked balls but the physical keyboards were so crisp to use especially for anyone who was using it for typing emials and such for work I probably wouldnt want it as my normal use phone but for a work phone it was great,mzlbxed,2.0,1ljmsf2
comment,mzlrcjl,Docphilsman,,2,2025-06-24 23:28:23,,,,Blackberry only stayed relevant because of adoption lag by big business and government Lots of businesses bought into the ecosystem and didnt want to dump it so quickly after they had installed the infrastructure for it Lots of official stuff was done on blackberry for a few years after the consumer market had moved away from it They would have died even sooner if people were given the option No one cared about the keyboard except for a very small and weirdly loyal minority,mzlhplv,3.0,1ljmsf2
comment,mzlmb65,pcdenjin,,7,2025-06-24 23:01:27,,,,Because the iPhone came out and every mobile company started mindlessly copying it Physical keyboards on phones were intuitive and worked well touch keyboards are so imprecise and errorprone that 5000000 redundant technologies like autocorrect and text prediction had to be invented to compensate for misinputs It was also easier to play games on them They should come back,mzlbxed,2.0,1ljmsf2

comment,mzp3tjg,zkyevolved,,1,2025-06-25 13:50:24,,,,The Titan 2 for some reason since the 1 did doesnt have a micro SD slot It does come with 512gb storage by default though But I cancelled my preorder when I saw they didnt include any IP certification and wont Nor can you have an eSim On top of that they have a terrible track record for updating I really wanted to want it too,mznn2l5,1.0,1ljmsf2
