comment,mxjfisj,SllortEvac,,8,2025-06-13 10:32:15,,,,Yikes front wheel motor Theres a reason why theres no consumer FWD motorcycles and certainly a reason why VanMoof when bankrupt in the first place Ill stick to my creaky Aventon,mxj6x8m,1.0,1la8rsy

comment,mxkt598,SllortEvac,,6,2025-06-13 15:23:45,,,,Theres a lot of reasons why front wheel drive didnt catch on for motorcycles The most damning one being that the drive train would need to be connected to the wheel that steers the bike That takes a hell of a lot more engineering than slapping a sprocket on the back wheel and using a chain The power ratio issue between front and rear is very different between an ebike and a motorcycle so the primary problem a front wheel motor poses on an ebike is control Electric motors have exceptional acceleration When that acceleration hits on the back wheel you have more control over the bike When it hits on the front you have less control as that wheel will want to go the direction its headed rather than being led by a different force Ie a different wheel that gets steered Its one of those things that most people wouldnt think about unless they spent 30 minutes on one and then 30 minutes on the other VanMoof putting a motor on the front wheel and divorcing the electric motor from the chain drive shows theyve spent 0 minutes on either,mxjnhi1,3.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxllkag,Rhywden,,8,2025-06-13 17:37:14,,,,The newer ones have momentum meters in the pedals Theres no acceleration hitting the wheels as your natural biking motion is assisted Ive ridden VanMoof bikes and Brompton also with FWD and your downsides do not exist outside your own mind let alone reality,mxkt598,4.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxqvnj8,proudcanadianeh,,2,2025-06-14 14:32:02,,,,So is it just a standard pedal assist ebike with a torque sensor over cadence and a front hub motor,mxllkag,5.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxrllpr,Rhywden,,2,2025-06-14 16:48:16,,,,Both the Brompton with cadence and VanMoof with torque have a front hub and show none of the problems described above And Ive been driving both for a long time Never had any problem with losing control even on highest assist and using Boost on the VM,mxqvnj8,6.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxvexcv,MrOaiki,,2,2025-06-15 07:05:50,,,,I was blown away by VanMoof S3 The best way I can describe it is that while my other ebike felt like it was helping me pedal Vanmoof felt like it was helping me move forward while the pedaling felt normal I havent found any equivalence of the boost button Setting my Bosch to Super for full power just feels like Im getting more help to pedal It doesnt really pull me up the hill,mxllkag,5.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxsz9o4,iwanderlostandfound,,1,2025-06-14 21:11:32,,,,Yeah I got 5k miles on my VanMoof and it rides great Never had any sense of not being in control,mxllkag,5.0,1la8rsy

comment,mxvdx1o,MrOaiki,,1,2025-06-15 06:56:14,,,,I really enjoyed my old VanMoof S3 until it was stolen a few weeks ago Everything you say might be true from a technical standpoint but I havent found any ebike that comes even close to the feeling of a VanMoof My other bike an Urban Arrow has a motor at the crankset that helps you pedal That feels like something is helping you pedal The VanMoof feels more like something is slightly pushing you or pulling you while the pedaling feel normal Thats the best way I can explain it And while it is frustrating when things break I think engineering hard things propels innovation,mxkt598,4.0,1la8rsy

comment,mxmzg5y,RamBamTyfus,,1,2025-06-13 21:43:30,,,,Not recommended goes too far its a feasible option Its generally done to ensure the rear can be fitted with a gear hub without running into space issues But it does have some drawbacks 1 It feels like you are being pulled a rear wheel engine feels like being pushed which is a more natural feeling as that is similar to having the wind in your back 2 Higher chance of slip in corners which can make you lose grip in turns and fall especially on wet roads 3 More vibrations in the front make for a less comfortable ride 4 Worse EMC behavior and some efficiency losses as there need to be long motor cables running through your frame Some advantages these frontrear hub motors have over mid engines Bosch et cetera is that they are quiet cheap look slick deliver power independent of the users gear settings and can do recuperation in some cases,mxjnhi1,3.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxixnle,Natural-Ad-2596,,18,2025-06-13 07:38:36,,,,Dont buy this rubbish product I was one of the first time investors Van Moof being still a Dutch company with a good looking product But then all issues started bikes were faulty service was far below standard and you could not repair the bike at a third party issues with parts They received a big investment in 2021 got in trouble in 2022 and went bankrupt in 2023 Now a restart same rubbish product,,0.0,1la8rsy
comment,mxj2ume,joeshmoe9898,,6,2025-06-13 08:30:33,,,,I was an early adopter and had every headache imaginable something like 10 service appointments and repairs in 18 months I ended up returning it for a refund under EU buyer protection rules That said when it was working it was an ideal urban ebike Ive owned the Veloretti Ace also returned after immediate issues and the Cowboy ebike I always preferred the van moof but their quality control and reliability made it a non option This is completely new ownership and leadership and supposedly new components focused on reliability Theres no reason to assume it will have the same quality control issues you can effectively treat this as a new ebike startup that has purchased the IP and brand of a failed ebike company I wouldnt be any more skeptical of this than any other new ebike coming to market I would still expect some growing pains but McLaren Applied will be trying to minimize any issues given the reputational recovery they are hoping to execute,mxixnle,1.0,1la8rsy
