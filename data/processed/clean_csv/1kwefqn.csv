comment,muh9kn1,Kep0a,,87,2025-05-27 07:40:07,,,,I dont know why this phone is getting remotely positive reviews Its an awful device MrMobile recounted it died 3 times in one day from garbage battery life and google maps would crash from overheating This is unacceptable for an 1100 phone in 2025 It doesnt even use the new battery technology Its literally just an s25 and they removed 30 of the battery to make it thinner,,0.0,1kwefqn

comment,mugsaay,SmartphoneCollector,,1,2025-05-27 05:00:25,,,,Im glad that OEMs are bringing lighter phones back to the market that still have high end specs that arent just about the cameras Phones have gotten too heavy in recent years especially noticeable in pockets and such Personally holding out for a 17 Air to pair with a Z Fold7 both devices should be much thinner than predecessors I know that a big battery is a common desire but we already have plenty of bulky Pro MaxUltra type phones on the market with multiday battery life We have basically no super thin and light phones on the market until now Glad we finally get to pick this type of device,mugpa1v,1.0,1kwefqn

comment,muhrz60,justthisones,,5,2025-05-27 10:41:53,,,,Smaller phones would be better variety than a few mm thinner one with another camera bump This is more of a fashion thing with a ridiculous price than proper convenience,mugsj5v,2.0,1kwefqn

comment,muyqsjh,LordSnaggle,,2,2025-05-29 22:14:45,,,,Make it thick enough so that the back camera is flush with the back of the phone And for the love of fuck give us back the micro sd card slot I wont upgrade my phone from the s20 since the newer models dont come with expandable storage,mugp2ll,1.0,1kwefqn

comment,muixwg6,Alternative-Sock-444,,3,2025-05-27 14:59:47,,,,Its not smaller in any meaningful way though If the screen was smaller yeah many people want that But a phone with a proper battery is already thin enough I havent heard anyone complain about phones being too thick in years Who wants a phone with a huge power hungry screen lacking a battery to properly support that massive screen Power user or not the battery life is atrocious,mui03pm,2.0,1kwefqn
comment,muj1fjx,PhaseExtra1132,,1,2025-05-27 15:16:26,,,,The phone is lighter and with a case its as light as a phone without one People criticized the iPhones 16e and said it was a dumb purchase when you could buy the older iPhone 15 which is better stats to stats But they ended up buying the 16e in mass These companies know their customers better than Reddit commenters This is a fact,muixwg6,3.0,1kwefqn
comment,muj2y7l,Alternative-Sock-444,,2,2025-05-27 15:23:27,,,,Companies are actually quite known for thinking they know their customers releasing something based on that assumption and that product flopping horribly because the corporation is completely out of touch with normal people Id almost be willing to put money on that being the case with this phone Id be surprised if they release a new version next cycle,muj1fjx,4.0,1kwefqn

comment,muyz5ka,Frequent_Flyer_Miles,,1,2025-05-29 23:00:19,,,,The way I see it and most others seem to do too with all the complaints is that manufacturers are ignoring the peoples feedback and simply producing what they want The customer is whats keeping them alive so that alone should drive the phones they produce not trying to impress us with stuff we dont need I think a good move for phone manufacturing would be to see a yearly mandatory poll being publicly released on their website every year with points they plan to upgrade or improve on maybe even trial new ideas there before they jump the gun to see what customers actually want and what they dont That way they can make informed and real changes not gimmicks The most important factors these days that most seem to be crying out for are bigger batteries better cameras and more storage Simple The rest is secondary Slim phones AI in every corner and the latest high end Snapdragon 8 Elite are no longer that important Slim is no good if youre squeezing a tiny battery in when people want longevity Phone processors now are so good you dont need the latest and greatest Theyre fast enough for anyone and gimmicks just seem to annoy people AI not everyone wants it so give people the choice between a model implemented with AI and one without for a lesser cost on the latter Give people the choice instead of forcing it on everyone Also technology advances seems to have slowed to an all time low because all were seeing every year are tiny iterations and theyre struggling to produce anything with the wow effect which is why theyre resorting to gimmicks Theres no real jumps anymore so its not worth the upgrade every year or even two Not like the good old days where every year was way better than the previous Maybe its time for them to start releasing phones every 3 years rather than 10 different models a year That way we feel like were actually getting the jump in tech we deserve and not flooding the market with dozens of wasteful makes and models of phones people dont want,,0.0,1kwefqn
comment,mvd32of,TheModeratorWrangler,,1,2025-06-01 04:26:29,,,,This is why I will forever mock Android Back in the day Android held so much promise but fragmentation made it all moot The last Android phone I had was the Motorola super slim Verizon variant SLVR or RAZR Droid with a Windows Phone full theme Terrible battery life but decently enough hardware that I could handle it Tried out a few times on my friends to see if Galaxy is worth it Absolutely not Dont even get me started on the UI Its like watching someone go your iPhone cant do that before asking me an hour later to make a call because their phone died from how much GOD DAMN DATA THAT ANDROID SELLS TO PAY FOR YOUR FREE PHONE OS Once I went back to iPhone I never looked back I enjoy knowing iCloud has my back with frequent password changes seamless integration and that my phone just freaking works Sent from my 16e,,0.0,1kwefqn

comment,mumvxow,Successful_Athlete38,,0,2025-05-28 03:03:32,,,,Mine arrives tomorrow to replace my S23 ultra On paper this may feel like a downgrade to somebut I am looking so forward to having a phone that doesnt feel like a brick in my pocket and annoying to carry aroundor having it fall on my face and leave a bruise when Im using it laying in bed Ive slowed down phone upgrades lately used to be on the yearly bandwagon s7s8s9s10s21us23u only because the camera failed in the s21ubut Ive hated how heavy and unwieldy these big phones have become and have been pining for a highend phone thats small and light Why choose the largest model Samsung annoyingly locks the best screen cameras and storage out of the base phones I need at least 512GB storage Otherwise Id just choose the base phones with maxed out storage I still have my old S10 in a drawer and took it out to inspect itand man that phone was amazing I didnt appreciate it at the time but that phone is one of the alltime greats And I definitely cant believe the S25 edge will be thinner and lighter than that phone Looking forward to seeing if the S25 edge can recapture some of the S10s charmmagic,,0.0,1kwefqn
