post,1julg43,chrisdh79,Don’t call it a drone: Zipline’s uncrewed aircraft wants to reinvent retail | Ars visits a zipline delivery service that's deploying in more locations soon.,494,2025-04-08 18:55:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1julg43/dont_call_it_a_drone_ziplines_uncrewed_aircraft/,57.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mm2zcrr,jakgal04,,109,2025-04-08 18:59:55,,,,Just another thing for people to be divided over I personally think this is pretty cool and will definitely help out in rural areas where delivery by truck logistically doesnt make sense 50 of people Thats so cool Id buy something just to get it delivered by drone 50 of people If that thing so much comes within 1000 feet of my house I will shoot it out of the sky,,0.0,1julg43
comment,mm4bjxm,S_A_N_D_,,28,2025-04-08 23:05:16,,,,For me its a question of noise Drones are pretty loud and their high pitched sound can be annoying much like a mosquito buzzing around you They tend to be more piercing So the question is will we be able to find a happy middle ground where theyre no more annoying than what you might expect from a roadway relative to the neighbourhood youre in What happens to people who live on their more common flight paths I see nothing inherently wrong with drone delivery but I see a a bunch of possible issues that could degrade peoples quality of life that will need to be managed if theyre going to be used in large numbers,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43
comment,mm4cn06,Znuffie,,31,2025-04-08 23:11:22,,,,Zipline already squashed this issue The drones fly up in the air 100 meters and they drop their packages via a Zipline MKBHD and Mark Robbers have videos about them Zipline,mm4bjxm,2.0,1julg43
comment,mmfiets,strictlyPr1mal,,3,2025-04-10 18:22:27,,,,honestly you can still hear plenty in the air 100meters away,mm4cn06,3.0,1julg43
comment,mm4e8cf,jakgal04,,11,2025-04-08 23:20:23,,,,Noise shouldnt be much of a concern For the size of the drone larger drones have a lower pitch noise and the altitude they should pretty much blend in to background noise The drone I fly for work Matrice 350 is basically noiseless at 250 feet,mm4bjxm,2.0,1julg43

comment,mm8fj4x,bremidon,,2,2025-04-09 16:15:36,,,,You should probably go watch some stuff from Zipline before making up your mind Their tech is pretty cool and that includes how quiet their drones can be and how they stay pretty high in the air,mm4bjxm,2.0,1julg43
comment,mm32wls,reddit455,,23,2025-04-08 19:17:42,,,,i could care less about getting a sandwich the bigger takeaway is the FAA setting up the rules around autonomous flight in populated areas for commercial purposes Ziplines aircraft operate under a series of FAA classificationsspecifically part 107 part 135 and the upcoming part 108 which will formalize BVLOS operation The uncrewed aircraft which are able to operate as such navigate through controlled airspace and even near airports with the help of FAAmandated transponder data as well as onboard sensors that can detect the presence of an approaching aircraft and automatically avoid it with people inside Joby reports certification progress and delivery of second aircraft to US Air Force at Edwards Air Force Base Archer receives FAA certification to begin commercial airline,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43
comment,mm8g0ap,bremidon,,3,2025-04-09 16:17:59,,,,You might not care about a sandwich but you might take a look at their tech about delivering drugs and medication Pop over to the pharmacy drop the little minime gadget into a special hole the drugs are put in and then off it goes to deliver it This could be absolutely the difference between life and death in the right situations And it will certainly make it easier for older people to keep up with their medication,mm32wls,2.0,1julg43
comment,mm6h12r,bwc153,,2,2025-04-09 08:30:54,,,,Another point of friction as well is that awhile back the FAA proposed rules that would give BVLOS drones like this a lot of protections over manned aircraft The rules would have effectively gave them right of way at low altitude exempted them from see and avoid rules and also wouldnt require them to have a transponder The drones themselves are small and fast so would be hard for a pilot to see visually jeopardizing pilot safety I know the paramotor community which flies under FAR 103 was particularly upset over it as paramotors arent fast or agile dont typically carry transponders either and operate at low altitudes too so would be in some of the higher risk from the propsed rules,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43
comment,mmetsh6,NeuroXc,,1,2025-04-10 16:23:25,,,,The rural people this would help are the ones most likely to be shooting at it,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43
comment,mmkl2zo,Oregonrider2014,,1,2025-04-11 14:47:37,,,,One of the most difficult things with wildfire prevention is inspecting powerlines through forestedmountan areas We cant use drones because the people out there shoot them down every time I still wonder how much more could be prevented if those dipshits could just stop shooting anything they are unfamiliar with,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43
comment,mmklvon,jakgal04,,1,2025-04-11 14:51:34,,,,Im hoping you get the authorities involved The FAA treats drones like aircraft If you shoot a drone down youve shot an aircraft down Someone in the township I work in was arrested back in 2018 just for making the threat He was handed a 5 year federal prison sentence,mmkl2zo,2.0,1julg43
comment,mmkmc0q,Oregonrider2014,,1,2025-04-11 14:53:48,,,,Yeah its way above my paygrade on that one Im sure the utility did go after them but they wont let us use them anymore because the cost of replacing them was so expensive,mmklvon,3.0,1julg43
comment,mm5w247,JohnnyOnslaught,,1,2025-04-09 05:02:13,,,,50 of people If that thing so much comes within 1000 feet of my house I will shoot it out of the sky I would imagine that would be treated a lot like robbing an Amazon delivery van at gunpoint,mm2zcrr,1.0,1julg43

comment,mm5ujvf,CommodoreAxis,,10,2025-04-09 04:49:48,,,,The same people we blame on the extremely rare occasion a plane or helicopter falls on someone or the common occasion that a semidelivery van hits someone on the road,mm5kklo,2.0,1julg43

comment,mm64tms,HoidToTheMoon,,10,2025-04-09 06:22:09,,,,The article at least explains why they sidestep regular drone laws Ziplines aircraft are much more comprehensive machines able to fly for miles and miles By necessity they must fly well beyond the range of any human operator or whats called beyond visual line of sight or BVLOS In 2023 Zipline was the first commercial operator to get clearance for BVLOS flights Ziplines aircraft operate under a series of FAA classificationsspecifically part 107 part 135 and the upcoming part 108 which will formalize BVLOS operation The uncrewed aircraft which are able to operate as such navigate through controlled airspace and even near airports with the help of FAAmandated transponder data as well as onboard sensors that can detect the presence of an approaching aircraft and automatically avoid it,mm5jc7l,1.0,1julg43
