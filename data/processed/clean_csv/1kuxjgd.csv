comment,mu5kyun,f_14,,224,2025-05-25 11:23:21,,,,FYI DJI made all the reviewers getting early release models let DJI review the video before they could publish it DCRainmaker did a good review of the tracking system on this after refusing to let them see it and they were not great,,0.0,1kuxjgd

comment,mu6tln4,magicwuff,,56,2025-05-25 15:52:45,,,,This is a worrying trend in the review industry at large Wasnt there just something about Nvidia not releasing drivers for new cards unless reviewers agreed to something like this,mu5kyun,1.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu7acff,whyunoname,,39,2025-05-25 17:16:15,,,,Reviews in general are cooked Companies that have the market cornered think Nvidia DJI etc only give early access to people that simp for them and withhold product and drivers until launch This way all the sites are flooded with positive reviews that become the reviews with most views and likes Then you have the Amazon Twitch social media problem Influencers bots and people that get free productpaid flood platforms with good reviews Basically the internet has shifted and become a dishonest ecommerce tool You still have honest sites like Gamers Nexus DCRainmaiker etc but overall it is mostly fake Add to the problem review baiting for shocking content for clicks and ad revenue Only thing consumers can do is not have FOMO Let the product get released and check multiple mediums for reviews Stop preordering This comes with the botscalper challenge though TLDR reviews are fake and controlled most of the time Only thing you can do is wait until long after launch and contest scalpers at a later date Still better than buying junk early and being stuck,mu6tln4,2.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu7cv0z,SsooooOriginal,,12,2025-05-25 17:28:30,,,,To me the writing was on the wall when somewhere about a decade ago amaxon quietly removed the search result filters as if they never existed and quietly allowed the clearly bribedboughtgenerated reviews of turd products to constantly be upthumbed to the top Way back when you could granularly get results now they are all sponsored and enshitification abounded,mu7acff,3.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu7kb9v,whyunoname,,5,2025-05-25 18:04:58,,,,Agreed Even just looking for a product is horrible now Suggestedrecommendedpromoted randomly inserted into feed Filters removed andor searches reset when looking Basically ecommerce is dead You will be directed and told what to buy with accompanying reviews to support it The kicker is most are too braindead to comprehend this and the model works Control searches control reviews monopolize repeat Edit add the whole collect your data from apps the worst and cookies hard to reject to drip feed you There is a reason prices are better or only available in the app They share data to continue to tell you what you are going to buy,mu7cv0z,4.0,1kuxjgd
comment,muq77y0,akeean,,1,2025-05-28 16:45:28,,,,As someone who worked with an amazon partner for SEA 15 years ago They were terrible with that stuff even back then There was no way to restrict their api output to a category of kids products So if you had a site that wanted to just show a feed of products related of plush teddies for kids thered be no way to filter out sexy lingerie or sex toys or whatever item that had the word teddy or plush in their name so you had to have people that would daily screen and blacklist the newly added amazon inventory so those product would not show up in your site At least ebay a the time had the option to do negative keywords but amazon when I last tried still doesnt Wich is why for ages the only sane way to search amazon was through Google At the same time you have the google shopping tab which is a total mess as well,mu7cv0z,4.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu9qhoo,JD-D2,,2,2025-05-26 01:31:13,,,,I agree that the general state of product reviews has degraded but in this case I dont think Engadget is one to be bought off their stuff is typically fine Maybe the guy justliked the drone and that doesnt automatically mean hes shilling for DJI We cant just argue with his conclusions and instead have to believe the whole thing is purposefully dishonest Only say this because I see this line of thinking with a lot of folks nowadays as if the only trustworthy reviewers are YouTubers and smaller orgs when ironically those are often the ones who dont have an larger institution or actual editors enforcing stricter standards GN and DCRainmaker are great though wont argue that,mu7acff,3.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu9si0i,whyunoname,,1,2025-05-26 01:44:13,,,,I mean maybe When the requirements to get access are 1 Good review 2 Talk good about these features 3 Here is what you can compare it to and how Brands and reviews are for a large part cooked Again my point was companies that do this control the narrative Sure there are honest reviews later and tons of good sites and reviewers And the product could be great The problem is you wont know for real for a while And odds are with things like DJI not like there are a ton of options in the same space anyways Nvidia 50 series is a perfect example Excluding drivers the 890 are good especially if you skipped a gen They require early access to have a good review and talk about framegen and MFG4x For the new launch they withheld drivers so the good reviews were out AND you couldnt test Also launched at computex and buried it Reviewers were trashing it in hotel rooms lol If the customer is uninformed and doesnt know this they are duped In the Nvidia example many people will end up with a 5060 and regret it now and down the road,mu9qhoo,4.0,1kuxjgd
comment,muvzhj0,toshgiles,,1,2025-05-29 14:21:50,,,,Even his review is kids silly though Hes trying to get a fairly larger drone to squeeze through tiny snacks and it does rather well This is a pro photo and video drone rather thanks a sport drone,mu5kyun,1.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu5bs77,D13U,,49,2025-05-25 09:57:32,,,,Soooo expensive Too bad they defined the new standard,,0.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu5ca71,Nolanthedolanducc,,26,2025-05-25 10:02:30,,,,So many of the drones are like that Its weird they focus so much on these multi thousand dollar drones when the majority of sales come from their sub 250 gram more budget options,mu5bs77,1.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu5fabs,WolpertingerRumo,,43,2025-05-25 10:32:15,,,,Because this is not consumer market its the professional market If youre a professional photographer a few thousand for a tool are not shocking If youre a consumer it really is The wording is wrong,mu5ca71,2.0,1kuxjgd

comment,mu6ef9d,amateurbreditor,,-11,2025-05-25 14:34:53,,,,I wanted to get into this to showcase my work but for 3000 jesus Theres no way in hell the markup on this isnt like 95,mu5fabs,3.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu6upo4,iamacannibal,,7,2025-05-25 15:58:21,,,,The mark up is likely pretty high Not 95 high but they are for sure making a decent profit for each one of thesebut they earned it DJI has been consistently putting out the best consumer and pro level drones for the last 10 years with regular updates They even continue to support older models with software updates and repairs,mu6ef9d,4.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu9mdah,HesSimplyShocking,,1,2025-05-26 01:05:14,,,,Agreed This sounds like a great successor to the Mavic 3,mu6upo4,5.0,1kuxjgd
comment,muohjn1,Alohagrown,,1,2025-05-28 11:15:53,,,,Its not that bad compared to most prolevel photo and video equipment Look at what hasselblad cameras cost by themselves and that doesnt even include flying capabilities Pro videographers can make that back with a couple gigs,mu6ef9d,4.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu6mqgx,scarr09,,4,2025-05-25 15:18:13,,,,What is now the top of the line is going to be entry level in a decade because innovation trickles down And if you lead the top end you can dominate in the lower end Thats the entire reason why DJI is pretty much the only proper mass appeal drone company in the world Look at even the original Mavic pro and compare that to the budget line of a Mini 3 pro 6 years to go from one to the other And the M3Pro is better in every measurable way except speed and weight A better camera better sensors better distance an insane amount of features,mu5ca71,2.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mub6ec6,tignasse,,1,2025-05-26 08:21:45,,,,thats because multi thousand dollar drones are mostly for professionals whom are less concerned with flight restrictions non professional stop using their drones because of annoying flight rrestriction zones which are almost everywhere in some countries check the second hand market up there are tons of drones people are reselling them because you cant use drone where u want,mu5ca71,2.0,1kuxjgd
comment,mu6ymc3,Earthiness,,14,2025-05-25 16:18:25,,,,I watched a couple early reviews and this drone didnt look good Especially watching the rainmaker review it seemed like their tracking tech regressed,,0.0,1kuxjgd
