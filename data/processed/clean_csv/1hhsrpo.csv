comment,m2yrm23,ryo4ever,,1,2024-12-20 10:54:48,,,,So much negativity on this technology There are many practical applications not limited to the living room Shop fronts transportation displays office glass walls information counters etc Also on a more everyday consumer reason who here has a big black rectangle in their living room and wish it wasnt there when its not turned on I know I did a few times I bet if the price was around 2k people would seriously consider it,,0.0,1hhsrpo

comment,m2u0ccp,WeRegretToInform,,1,2024-12-19 15:19:00,,,,Feels like laptops in the early 90s Very expensive specialist use cases not actually that great In 20 years time when theyre similar price to normal TVs and look like a sheet of glass when off yeah sure hit me up Lets be honest TVs are ugly when theyre off Massive shiny black rectangles usually in pride of place in your living room Fuck whatever interior design youre otherwise going for Cant wait for them to blend in,,0.0,1hhsrpo
