comment,m81uu80,PizzaQuest420,,10,2025-01-19 21:25:14,,,,If I understand this article this new robot can fly while connected to power and commands for about 17 minutes before the parts degrade too much for precision flight It could carry batteries and sensors but that would shorten the lifespan The material science and precision engineering is still incredible its very cool However bees can fly for a few hours a day for 56 weeks with a full suite of sensors tuned for pollination can selfreplicate are biodegradable dont have to be plugged in or carry batteries and create useful byproducts such as honey and wax They only need plants and clean water to function This bot is a big leap in material engineering and micro robotics but a serious bee replacement is over the horizon and the vertical farming model its supposedly intended for has yet to become worth the energy costs forgetting the fact that bees can work in vertical farms anyway because they can fly up,m7zsodt,3.0,1i500bc
comment,m82bcif,MINECRAFT_BIOLOGIST,,1,2025-01-19 22:45:33,,,,This is true but these are meant to be used in large vertical multifloor climatecontrolled indoor farms that can grow things yearround under very specific conditions I think most people would agree that vertical farms are a potential solution to our overuse of arable land and the issue of deforestation to create more farmland So moving onto bees wouldnt there be quite a few issues with maintaining a colony of living bees in a vertical farm The one that comes to mind first would simply be that a vertical farm would need to somehow train bees to fly up and down the farm through specific channels to consistently reach pollen I say train because this does not seem like natural behaviormost trees are far shorter than such a building and Im not sure how well bees communicate verticality with their dances Also theyd need to rotate crops to always have flowering crops so that the bees are fed Then theyd need a supply chain to feed bees when there arent any flowers unless you want the bees to die and require replacing Saying They only need plants and clean water to function seems extremely reductive for the amount of effort beekeeping requires Bees might also get into equipment and other spaces requiring more maintenance It would be difficult to get them all out so they didnt interfere with harvesting equipment Im sure people more experienced in beekeeping and engineering would have a far larger list of issues that would arise in using bees instead of robots this is just what came to mind quickly Now just to clarify Im all for sustainable solutions and I do agree that we should use sustainable solutions instead of trying to supplant everything with speculative technology But I also dont think its a good idea to blindly ignore the potential downsides or even benefits of new technology simply because it seems like a waste instinctively,m81uu80,4.0,1i500bc
comment,m82pcr4,PizzaQuest420,,2,2025-01-19 23:59:54,,,,valid points there i was more presenting bees as if they were a type of robot and comparing them to the robot in the article if bees were robots theyd be shockingly ahead of our own material engineering manufacturing and robotics capabilities our best robot now flew for 17 minutes max tethered and thats all it did fly robot pollinators as a concept are especially interesting to me in space stationshipcolony applications where relying on bees in an untested environment without a backup seems extremely risky if they even need pollinators at that point i love the robotics research i just dont think its a wiser choice for pollination here on earth anywhere that bees can live there are bees that move up and down mountains tagging space vertically isnt a huge challenge for them the bees wouldnt live inside beekeepers would bring them in to pollinate during the appropriate timeframes this is already a common practice for outdoor crops bee corpses are probably less damaging to food and equipment than plastic and metal robots which would inevitably break on site,m82bcif,5.0,1i500bc

comment,m82bym0,stempoweredu,,1,2025-01-19 22:48:30,,,,Because there are certain plants that can no longer be pollinated effectively as we have driven the insects that do so to extinction Such as the Vanilla plant It must be manually pollinated for production because the only remaining pollinators are a small group of bees that have only a 1 success rate,m7zlu4d,1.0,1i500bc

comment,m80a8s8,1Amendment4Sale,,2,2025-01-19 16:58:18,,,,Safe to assume its the MIC driving this Easier to mass produce for wartime and domestic surveillance if the infrastructure for civilian use is in place So to address your point maybe its not necessary to destroy humanity but rather reign in the MICintelligence community heavily regulate Silicon Valley and return to international arms treaties And if that cant be done well maybe Pol Pot was onto something,m7zlvvi,1.0,1i500bc

comment,m80k889,Sawses,,-1,2025-01-19 17:45:06,,,,From a species survival standpoint I do wonder if climate change will eventually end up being our savior A slow gradual change to a more inhospitable world is incentivizing us to come up with ways to survive and thrive in less hospitable conditions Sure thats a bad thing in a lot of waysbut it means that we might well develop the technology to build selfsustaining environments both here on Earth and elsewhere when otherwise we might never have One could argue its not worth destroying an entire biosphere not that were capable of that level of destruction quite yet but humanity is going to have to figure out how to handle an artificial ecosystem if were going to do anything other than live and die here,m7zlvvi,1.0,1i500bc
