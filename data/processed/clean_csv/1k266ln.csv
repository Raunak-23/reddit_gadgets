comment,mo5ksms,IllllIIIllllIl,,6,2025-04-20 21:24:50,,,,AV1 decoding too please thank you,mnwacps,2.0,1k266ln
comment,mo1p0pe,ExultantSandwich,,11,2025-04-20 05:15:09,,,,Its been so long it really feels like its not ever happening but then again they just updated the old model Also the original Shield TV used the same SoC as the 2017 Nintendo Switch a 20nm Tegra X1 Erista The refresh used the same chip as the 2019 Nintendo Switch a 16nm Tegra X1 Mariko The Switch 2 is about to come out and Nintendo is again using a Nvidia chip This time its actually a semicustom design based off of some much more powerful hardware that would never fit in a handheld or set top box Im thinking thats what theyve been waiting for Otherwise they dont have volume to justify spinning up a custom ARM chip Nintendo leads with RD and hopefully the results can be used in another Shield TV,mnvf4x0,1.0,1k266ln
comment,mo1pblt,PocketNicks,,7,2025-04-20 05:17:50,,,,Yeah good point Maybe in the next 68 months after Switch2 is launched well get notified about a new Shield model w the same chip,mo1p0pe,2.0,1k266ln
comment,mo1roqf,ExultantSandwich,,9,2025-04-20 05:39:41,,,,Also Eurogamer confirmed the new Tegra T239 has AV1 encode decode on its die Thats the one feature people really want from a successor to the Shield TV so,mo1pblt,3.0,1k266ln
comment,mo1s31j,PocketNicks,,2,2025-04-20 05:43:29,,,,Yeah theres not a lot of codecs the Shield doesnt do natively But its becoming enough now that it warrants a hardware update,mo1roqf,4.0,1k266ln
comment,mo68rwy,AustinLurkerDude,,2,2025-04-20 23:48:51,,,,I want a new model but unfortunately all their other products make more money in a quarter the shield makes in 100 years so its hard to see why theyd spend the time in it,mnvf4x0,1.0,1k266ln
comment,mo6a0pc,PocketNicks,,1,2025-04-20 23:56:26,,,,Dont tell them that Also the CEO of NVIDIA is like the 3rd richest person on earth so maybe it could be a passion project fingers,mo68rwy,2.0,1k266ln
comment,mnvlciu,stonedkrypto,,2,2025-04-19 04:19:00,,,,At this point Im happy with the hardware Its already powerful enough for a streaming device Apps and the OS could use some fine tuning but theres no reason to have a new hardware just for the sake of it,mnvf4x0,1.0,1k266ln

comment,mns01kg,The8Darkness,,3,2025-04-18 15:54:14,,,,No this isnt the known 403 smarttube issue its a specific message that tells you something about audio codec isnt supported when you go into settings and turn audio off for the video it will play without audio also smarttube is at its latest version restarting smarttube doesnt fix it Only restarting the shield fixes it without any smarttube updates,mnrzewy,4.0,1k266ln
