comment,m74245n,NuclearReactions,,9,2025-01-14 15:45:19,,,,It was a great card no doubt Back when the entry level of the high end cards was at around 300 The first who parrots nvidias indirect marketing shills claiming that 70 is mid range gets virtual punched by me straight to the virtual teeths,m73uda1,3.0,1i176s1
comment,m74ds5v,Wilson-theVolleyball,,19,2025-01-14 16:43:44,,,,Nowadays the 70 is their mid range though no Genuinely asking 5060 is entry and 8090 is high end the 70 is literally in the middle For a lot of people the 70 is probably more than enough but it is nonetheless the mid range offering of their current lineup,m74245n,4.0,1i176s1

comment,m754wqq,robbob19,,8,2025-01-14 18:54:36,,,,Yeah but last generation they moved the numbers round and the 70 was really what would have been called a 60 previous generation The 70ti is now the bottom of the high end Since the pandemic Nvidia have behaved like monopoly scum Their advantage in ray tracing and frame generation has given them too much power,m74vzkf,6.0,1i176s1

comment,m75szd4,robbob19,,4,2025-01-14 20:59:13,,,,Totally agree one of the first things I turn off are dlss and ray tracing in games they dont add enough and I go for lower resolution 1440p with higher FPS anyway Currently on a RTX 3070 but waiting to see what AMD does and hoping to move over to them with my next card Nvidia is too greedy and pushing us toward an uncertain AI future,m757hh6,8.0,1i176s1

comment,m74918q,Corvain,,11,2025-01-14 16:20:13,,,,Back then there was a Radeon card named 1650 pro It had variataions of 256MB512MB1GB with different vram types and speeds like ddrddr2lpddr and also was available for both AGP and PCIEX slots That card was around the limit of AGP slot bandwith Because of all the variations some 256mb cards with fast vrams performed better in most games compared to 1gb but with low speed Vrams Some AGP cards performed better than PCIEX but some did not Some high speedhigh vram ones overperformed 1600xtwhich was supposed to be the superior card That was a short but messy period,m73pvr9,2.0,1i176s1
comment,m74v575,NuclearReactions,,4,2025-01-14 18:07:45,,,,Man that was a different time for sure forums were filled with users confused about specs and people who bought cards with the wrong bus occasionally popped up lol i actually almost got a saphire x1650 256mb agp but ended up getting a geforce 7600gs instead You also reminded be about the g80 vs g92 chip deal The 8800gtx got released with iirc 700 something mb of vram and a 8800gts with 300 something Cue the 8800gt that got released later with the refreshed g92 chip and 512mb it cost half of what a gts went for and performed better It even outperformed the gtx in some occasions,m74918q,3.0,1i176s1

comment,m76yl0s,None,,1,2025-01-15 00:37:05,,,,So man at my 3060 because Im seriously VRAM limited because they kneecapped the laptop version compared to desktop Games dont run slow due to the card not being fast enough but due to VRAM walls because NVIDIA decided screw you Doing a desktop this year and the 5070 is dead on arrival to me due to VRAM so probably getting a 9070XT depending where it slots in compared to the 5070ti 12GB is also a joke for new cards at their prices,m73od1h,1.0,1i176s1
comment,m77za8e,Burntfury,,1,2025-01-15 04:17:19,,,,Yeah but I game primarily at like 1080p 60fps Since I play in the bed next to my life Just that a 2060 in general is really struggling with that small ask now,m76yl0s,2.0,1i176s1
comment,m73wsz2,sethyourgoals,,33,2025-01-14 15:17:43,,,,I want to upgrade this year but I have to be honest in saying that my EVGA RTX 2070 Super still holds up Well worth the 500 spent in late 2019 DLSS has been a lifesaver for older generation hardware in my opinion Often something that gets left out of these discussions,,0.0,1i176s1
comment,m7458sl,Ipearman96,,11,2025-01-14 16:01:02,,,,Honestly the only reason Im considering upgrading my 3070 is that Im upgrading my wifes computer this year and she only wants 3070 performance while I wouldnt mind a bump to 5070 or amds GPU,m73wsz2,1.0,1i176s1
comment,m75u8kc,DYMAXIONman,,3,2025-01-14 21:05:43,,,,If the 9070xt is actually 4080 super performance and its under 500 it would be good value,m73wsz2,1.0,1i176s1

comment,m74mhrg,ShrikeGFX,,12,2025-01-14 17:26:15,,,,The issue is that if your VRAM runs full your performance is completely going to shit because it completely bottlenecks the rasterization So even 799 is fine but if you go above 8 you cant play But reducing texture settings by one should generally fix the issue but since thats a 4x reduction it might be quite noticeable or not,m746lod,1.0,1i176s1
comment,m78n7zc,Pelembem,,4,2025-01-15 07:43:11,,,,The point is that whether youre getting 01 FPS or 15 FPS is irrelevant theyre both unplayable and when you reduce the settings to make it playable you no longer need more than 8GB of VRAM and both the 8GB and 16GB card will run just fine at 60 FPS,m74mhrg,2.0,1i176s1

comment,m78p4ab,everybodyiskungfu,,-3,2025-01-15 08:03:05,,,,Plenty of newer games crumble at 1080p already and fps has little to do with it You can reduce settings but the point is that you wouldnt need to if Nvidia didnt sell you a VRAM starved card,m74d8gj,1.0,1i176s1

comment,m75s738,ThisFreakinGuyHere,,-3,2025-01-14 20:54:50,,,,But thats not how this works Nothing falls over completely it just runs at a few less frames per second,m74b2xm,2.0,1i176s1
comment,m77eyk4,101m4n,,4,2025-01-15 02:11:09,,,,No If you dont have enough graphics memory to store all the assets a game needs to render a frame it has to swap stuff between system memory and graphics memory If this happens only a little it can be okay But if it happens a lot the game becomes unplayable and sometimes unstable The GPU buys you the framerate the vram gets you the ability to reliably run stuff that requires x amount of vram If your GPU has too little compute you can always lower settings or accept a lower framerate If youve got too little vram youre usually stuffed This is why Nvidia is stingy with vram They know it limits the lifespan of their cards and keeps sales up in the face of diminishing year on year performance improvements,m75s738,3.0,1i176s1
comment,m78gjyp,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-15 06:37:00,,,,If you have too little RAM you just turn down the resolution And a big reason threy are stingy with RAM is because GDDR is expensive A major reason the 5090 costs 2000 is all that extra GDDR7,m77eyk4,4.0,1i176s1
comment,m79615k,101m4n,,1,2025-01-15 11:05:21,,,,Resolution will reduce memory used for frame buffers and other intermediate buffers tied to screen size but wont have any effect on other game assets Reducing texture resolution can help but such things will only help you to an extent Memory usage tends to be much less tunable than compute Generally speaking though if you have an amount of vram that is still common in the install base at the time a game is released you can probably expect that game to fit as _one_ of its presets,m78gjyp,5.0,1i176s1
comment,m7eawfg,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-16 04:02:27,,,,Any effect Not at all true Modern game engines have all sorts of features to create appropriate texture caches possibly with more aggressive texture compression dynamic MIP map generation and streaming etc to reduce memory usage at lower quality or resolution settings Lowering the max texture resolution used or reducing optimizing MIP maps alone can cut RAM usage by a huge amount No need to load a 4k texture if you drop the resolution to 1080p Additionally DLSS etc can take lower res textures and interpolate higher resolution Sure I agree there are limits and if you hit them without optimizing perf issues can be dramatic but there are lots of techniques to reduce memory usage,m79615k,6.0,1i176s1
comment,m7fvajp,101m4n,,1,2025-01-16 12:35:01,,,,True enough I imagine there are a lot of technical solutions for making best use of vram Caching for one I imagine probably works pretty well when your textures arent all needed at once and there is some temporal locality to their usage which is probably a fairly common situation But it doesnt change the fact that in my experience from tweaking game settings in the real world vram usage tends to be much less tunable overall Admittedly though it has been a while since I have needed to think about such things,m7eawfg,7.0,1i176s1
comment,m78spek,everybodyiskungfu,,1,2025-01-15 08:42:03,,,,Nvidia is stingy because they can get away with it people dont care or dont know better How does the same money buy a 12GB Nvidia card but a 20GB AMD card,m78gjyp,5.0,1i176s1
comment,m770o8l,AtomicSymphonic_2nd,,1,2025-01-15 00:48:48,,,,Theres a point that if a game is unable to have a certain minimum amount of frames processed at its lowest settingssafe mode it will crash out randomly and wont run properly I dont quite know what the phenomenon is called but Ive seen it happen before with some AAA games on older PCs The very next thing that happens is gamers with those older GPUs loudly complain online that the devs suck and they need to optimize their game for their 7 year old GPUs,m75s738,3.0,1i176s1

comment,m7819ky,lorsch525,,3,2025-01-15 04:31:17,,,,They mentioned that that the recommendation to avoid 8GB cards only concerns buying new and that people might not want to reduce settings on a new 300 card Which is unrealistic these framerates on the 16GB card were often not very high and most people would change settings use dlss fsr,m74a57y,1.0,1i176s1

comment,m78maiv,snajk138,,2,2025-01-15 07:33:27,,,,Yes obviously but it sort of goes against the conclusion in the header It is not so much about the amount of RAM For the RX 7600 XT specifically the connection between RAM and GPU is really slow compared to many alternatives and that really limits its performance in higher resolutions Im sure my 3070 will be a bottleneck soon enough but I think a 7600 XT would hit that sooner in most cases even though it has twice as much memory,m74573a,2.0,1i176s1

comment,m7ashrm,QuantumQuantonium,,1,2025-01-15 17:05:41,,,,Not a tldr just what i think 8 GB gpus can still run on low end builds without issue I have a 1050 ti with only 4 GB that still does well in modern multiplayer titles I play Mobile VR graphics sucks with lower vram batman arkam shadows is the best example at an attempt of a high end game on pure mobile VR but integrated graphics have been gradually improving with slower DDR memory too But thats for low end The issue with 8 GB comes down exclusively to nvidia keeping 8 GB vram from the 2070 to 3070 From my experience the 2070 is perfectly capable for 1440p or low 4k except its 8 gb vram hindered its overall performance creating crashes in UE editor in particular and prompting me to find a better GPU then the Rx 6700xt that I still use today Nvidia learned their lesson with the 40 series after the naming scandal On a technical reason more vram means more quality models and textures with less development work to create lower detail optimized models This is good for high end visuals but not low end where actually direct storage tech where pcie devices like the GPU can query storage directly instead of queuing into the slow CPU would play a bigger role in allowing rapid streaming of additional info like more polygons as the player moves bit it seems direct storage isnt at the effectiveness it should be and its being subsistuted for ai models,,0.0,1i176s1
comment,m7ex850,jtn050,,1,2025-01-16 07:01:42,,,,Im gonna be honest at 1080p with a 1660ti I feel like a king with 6gb of vram at least since I upgraded from a 2gb 1050 a couple years ago lmao I cant think of a time Ive ever run out of vram Ive only had to reduce texture quality from ultra on a couple games which seems like a pretty minor sacrifice since it definitely still has the horsepower to run any modern game,,0.0,1i176s1

comment,m747vm1,NancyPelosisRedCoat,,6,2025-01-14 16:14:25,,,,The speed and the bandwidth of the RAM on graphics cards are so much better than normal RAM a swap wouldnt help at all Locally run large language models and Stable DiffusionFlux use the normal RAM when VRAM is full and the performance hit is just incredible to the point that its just not worth to use a model you cant fit on your VRAM That is why macs which have their RAM soldered to their motherboard are a hit as well since their RAM bandwidth is much higher The swap has to be on the same board to work,m73t8ox,1.0,1i176s1
comment,m74dzdo,ntropy83,,1,2025-01-14 16:44:43,,,,With LLMs yes but games are textures most games that use a lot of VRAM are just very badly programmed libraries of 4k textures For a vram swap youd have to find out if there was a way to preload them before they are displayed in game maybe manage the textures with AI on the host to avoid the double loading of similiar textures Ild look into it but I am not versed with vram coding Here is a project that uses vram as a ramdisk Could be a starting point,m747vm1,2.0,1i176s1
