comment,m1itdml,4ha1,,627,2024-12-11 13:42:39,,,,There should be a law explicitly stating that companies should open source the firmware if they ever went to abandon stuff like this,,0.0,1hbrqpv
comment,m1jnb4e,Mama_Skip,,8,2024-12-11 16:34:30,,,,Absolutely I work in product design and its so incredibly wasteful and greedy to not do this My pet peeve is smaller brand products that discontinue or go belly up leaving their product inoperable because it needs a phone app,m1itdml,1.0,1hbrqpv
comment,m1iv6zy,Irregular_Person,,64,2024-12-11 13:54:35,,,,I agree with this in principle but that isnt always a viablelegal option If they outsourced development of all or some of the product firmwaresoftware they might not have the authority to opensource everything required to keep the device working Maybe a future legislation could force companies to keep that avenue open during the initial development but trying to enforce that after the fact could be very difficult,m1itdml,1.0,1hbrqpv
comment,m1iz8w3,mikka1,,67,2024-12-11 14:20:29,,,,that isnt always a viablelegal option Thats fine in this case they should be mandated to issue a full refund once they kill the device regardless of how old it is s,m1iv6zy,2.0,1hbrqpv

comment,m1k5sag,None,,2,2024-12-11 18:08:45,,,,You just bake it into the contracts moving forward that wouldnt be that hard to effectuate especially after a new law passes requiring it Every company ever has a super strict confidentiality clause they wont ever be lenient on and for good reason until they do a government contract and come face to face with the Freedom of Information Act This also includes contractors for firmwaresoftware development Some of them may not like it and many of them pushback but the ones with experience in government contracting know if you want the money you accept the laws that come with it Even with third and fourth party subcontractors involved There is literally zero reason this couldnt be implemented into a law,m1iv6zy,2.0,1hbrqpv
comment,m1nqg4o,PocketNicks,,2,2024-12-12 07:05:32,,,,If they made a law the companies would be forced to make it part of the contract if they outsource the softwarefirmware that the IP must become available if the product is no longer supported Pretty simple,m1iv6zy,2.0,1hbrqpv

comment,m1qlxu8,obi1kenobi1,,2,2024-12-12 19:23:21,,,,If you are in the USA Crutchfield is a good place to start They only sell legitimate CarPlayAndroid Auto head units from reputable brands so theres no wondering if its a scam that wont work like when you buy on Amazon or AliExpress You put the cars make and model and theyll tell you which systems are compatible and what you would need to keep everything functional They have fair prices free super fast shipping mounting kits and wiring harnesses are either free or super cheap with purchase of a head unit they also sell more advanced installation equipment like backup cameras and addon boxes that can retain steering wheel controls and they have live chat with real employees who know the products they sell and can answer questions before you buy They also offer a lot of floating head units where the radio itself is a singleDIN chassis like a lot of 80s2000s cars used but they have the screen on a stalk that sticks out which means that not only can you fit a touchscreen in a car that doesnt have enough room for a normal touchscreen but you can also fit larger touchscreens like you get in modern cars they have a lot of 10 models and recently I saw they even have a 12 model Which is definitely overkill but the bigger the screen the easier GPS is to read at a glance and the easier the buttons are to press so Id be lying if I said I wasnt tempted You do need to measure the distance around your radio to make sure larger screens wont block air vents and climate controls though so bigger screens arent always better That being said if you have a newer car where the head unit is heavily integrated into the cars computer system and is a nonstandard size that requires special installation then their selection doesnt appear that great and the prices are going to be very high For anything up to 2010 or so maybe up to 2015 if its a really basic car that didnt have a touch screen theyre great and you should definitely be able to find something that works and retains factory features like steering wheel controls for a fair price but anything newer or more complex will probably require a vehiclespecific upgrade solution that would cost a lot more and youd have to search them out and do your own research Although lately Ive been shopping for a new CarPlay head unit for another car and some of the new ones seem to offer much more integration with features like climate controls and infotainment systems I dont have a car new enough to have those kinds of integrations so I havent really looked into it but we might finally be reaching the point where even cars with heavy touchscreen integration that prevented upgrades in the past can now use more standardized aftermarket head units,m1my1p0,3.0,1hbrqpv
