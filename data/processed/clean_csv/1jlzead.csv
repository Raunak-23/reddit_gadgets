comment,mk8nvxt,QuickQuirk,,23,2025-03-28 19:50:08,,,,There are still 1 laptops out there that give you what you want Often theyre cheaper than the razor too Just like there are the 5 laptops like the razor that shave as much weight and size off as possible There are different needs and different manufacturers meet them Personally I like the laptop as small as practically possible for transport I have a legion 7 which is excellent for thermals but a bit bigger than I prefer but the price was excellent Id be unhappy if all the laptops were the same and I had no choice,mk88vhr,4.0,1jlzead

comment,mkayir8,NuclearLunchDectcted,,5,2025-03-29 03:41:30,,,,I work from home My job swapped up my desktop computer with a laptop and are doing the same with everyones computer when tech refresh comes up specifically because of recent floodshurricanesfires They want us to be able to evacuate at a moments notice and just grab the laptop and go Id just need an extra monitor or two or have them send me a couple Its basically a desktop replacement never moves around Its a light model because Im not doing video or massive photo processing I just SSH into network devices and RDP into different servers but we have people that would need way more power than me and would need the thickheave laptops EDIT I have traveled with light laptops and with heavy ones Its not a big deal when youre just carrying it around your house It is a big deal when you have to carry around extra pounds through a massive airport or walking around multiple sites in a city,mk8w731,6.0,1jlzead
comment,mk97ef7,fourthcumming,,15,2025-03-28 21:28:37,,,,The weight it doesnt sound like much but the difference for me between carrying a Legion 5 laptop all day around my shoulder which only weighs a little over a pound less than my current laptop has made a big difference,mk8w731,6.0,1jlzead

comment,mka30g3,Oops_I_Cracked,,3,2025-03-29 00:24:04,,,,They do still exist they just are not marketed as premium products because people want thin and sleek when its a premium product Also I own a 1 thick relatively new gaming laptop and I own a 14 thick laptop They are absolutely not just as easy to carry around My 14 laptop fits in my purse Taking the 1 gaming laptop anywhere means either 2 bags or moving anything I need from my purse to my laptop bag Not to mention those good cooling systems in the thicc bois do in fact way quite a bit more than the thin laptops,mk88vhr,4.0,1jlzead

comment,mk9hlzg,dogrio345,,3,2025-03-28 22:23:52,,,,From my experience Lenovo has been pretty solid in terms of cooling I picked up a stand for when its at my desk just for safetys sake but their Legion Slims are pretty decent in terms of keeping cool when under regular use I had mine hit 40C while playing something really intense but the fans just needed some cleaning and afterwards stabilized pretty effectively,mk7sjm0,2.0,1jlzead
comment,mkal6ht,Disarmer,,3,2025-03-29 02:12:00,,,,Eluktronics has their Liquid Propulsion system which is pretty good Its air cooled if not connected to their Liquid Propulsion device but when youre at your desk and you plug it in its a full watercooling system for the laptop I have their older Max15 with a 3080 in it been looking at getting one of the newer liquid cooled ones though,mk7sjm0,2.0,1jlzead
comment,mkcmpos,rubychoco99,,1,2025-03-29 13:11:57,,,,Adding on to this even when playing cyberpunk the air cool system is enough to keep the laptop cool Ive stopped using the liquid cools system all together My previous razer would almost burn my hands when playing never had a problem with eluktronic,mkal6ht,3.0,1jlzead

comment,mk8rbl5,h3rpad3rp,,22,2025-03-28 20:06:53,,,,Yeah I dont get it pretty much anyone buying a laptop with a 5090 in it is going to be more concerned with performance than how thick the laptop is IMO they shouldnt even be allowed to call it a 5090 when it doesnt match the 5090 desktop performance and specs For example depending on resolution the game and clock speed a laptop 4090 has a 2060 lower frame rate than the desktop 4090 even with the laptop plugged in to the wall The laptop cards should have to have a different naming scheme if they arent the same At least they used to add an M to the end of the model name,mk7nm25,1.0,1jlzead

comment,mk9ptb0,TotallyFakeEngineer,,3,2025-03-28 23:09:07,,,,My biggest complaint from Razer gaming laptops is their power port That thing is just a brick if that fails The pins are super easy to be bendable specially if the charger cable has to be looped around the laptop Im hoping USB C power charging has advanced enough to be able to produce us the required power to use the GPU if the original port fails iirc there was news about it a year ago but nothing ever since,mk7nm25,1.0,1jlzead

comment,mkdjozw,Dracekidjr,,1,2025-03-29 16:23:00,,,,They also desperately need to find a way to dissipate heat better in their power supplies which are known for getting outrageouslyhot and then shitting the bed,mk7nm25,1.0,1jlzead

comment,mk88aye,ahzzyborn,,17,2025-03-28 18:32:28,,,,Most people dont upgrade every generation because they know its not a good bang for your buck This is saying hey if you have a 3000 series it might be worth the investment because this is a bit big jump over that,mk85hvs,1.0,1jlzead
comment,mkaadb6,nonresponsive,,7,2025-03-29 01:07:14,,,,But why compare the 3080 to 4090 and 5090 Wouldnt it make sense comparing the 3090 Like the 4090 was considered a sizeable upgrade compared to the 3090 Nobody was comparing the 4090 to the 3080 because they werent even in the same league The headline feels a bit cherrypicked to make people think its a bigger upgrade than it is The 4090 was simply a beast of a card when it came out nothing was close especially in 4k,mk88aye,2.0,1jlzead
comment,mkbelwy,rockstopper03,,10,2025-03-29 05:55:59,,,,There is no 3090 laptop gpu the highest gpu for the 3000 Gen laptops was the 3080ti And yes they need to add an m to seperate desktop 5090s from laptop 5090m since they are totally different chips with 4x higher power inputs,mkaadb6,3.0,1jlzead

comment,mk8c09m,HiddenoO,,1,2025-03-28 18:50:41,,,,Then the 4090 wouldve also been a big jump over that This whole idea of well if your card is two generations old this marginal upgrade from last gen might be worth it breaks down at the point that you realize you couldve just upgraded at the end of last gen for almost the same performance uplift at a lower price Its the same nonsense that people are using to try and justify the desktop versions of the 5000 series For what a 5000 series card costs you now in practice you couldve gotten a super version of a higher tier model a year ago and gotten better performance while also having it for an extra year Theyre just not good products at their price points You might have to buy them because theres nothing else available but that shouldnt be reflected in how reviews rate these products,mk88aye,2.0,1jlzead
comment,mk8oka4,Pitiful-Climate8977,,4,2025-03-28 19:53:27,,,,Youre really not the target market then Its that simple Pointing to performance upgrades to older models is going to get sales for people with those models Do you also make threads about how the newest iPhones are the same thing Wanna know how many people use iphone 612 still and want to see the difference between theirs and the latest The world doesnt revolve around you and how you think Youre not their target market If I was going to look into a gaming laptop i would be weighing out getting the newest vs each generation This one headline tells me a lot more than you huffing and puffing about it does You can sit here and make comparisons like you are all day about literally anything Youre not actually contributing anything to the conversation,mk8c09m,3.0,1jlzead

comment,mk8bl0q,thedoc90,,3,2025-03-28 18:48:36,,,,Considering you could get a 7800xt for 550 ish and an aio egpu dock for about 200 which should get you within 10 of the 4090 laptops speed on paper probably matched in practice because of how bad laptop thermals usually are Id be inclined to agree that its more worth it to spend about 700 on a laptop and 750 on an egpu that 2k plus on a gaming laptop,mk829x0,1.0,1jlzead
comment,mkalkby,Disarmer,,2,2025-03-29 02:14:28,,,,How does that actually work in practice Does the PC just seamlessly pick up the GPU when its plugged in and just start working without issue Ive been curious about a setup like that but scared it may be more trouble than its worth,mk829x0,1.0,1jlzead
comment,mkar5w2,ticuxdvc,,2,2025-03-29 02:50:34,,,,Theoretically its plug and play Mine a 2022 Dell XPS Plus 13inch with an i7 1260P likes having the GPU connected at boot as sometimes the plug and play doesnt wake up the nvidia driver and it doesnt recognize the GPU Bitlocker throws a fit when it detects it because youve changed your internal devices But once that is done then it treats regularly It keeps using the laptops internal gpu the processor igpu for the window manager and less demanding applications and then it uses the eGPU for games once you launch one You get a bit of a performance penalty because it cant carry the full 16 PCIE lanes but I can still get 60 fps of 4k FFXIV on my display with a 4070S on high settings You can get a bit more performance if you connect an external display directly on the gpu as then the gpu doesnt have to send an image signal back through the same thunderbolt cable but Ive never played anything demanding enough to notice the difference Plus I use it when I travel so I only carry the laptop and the egpu Id say that overall its a bit of a trouble and you have to carry the darn thing too but for my use case I vastly prefer that than being stuck with a heavier gaming laptop all the time Plus that means I can keep an older laptop and then hand down a GPU from my desktop to the enclosure The 5090 wont fit in it though so the 4070S will probably be there for a while,mkalkby,2.0,1jlzead

comment,mkht77v,nipsen,,1,2025-03-30 09:39:58,,,,One day I hope people will realize that even if the mobile chips were clocked as high as they could go and even if they didnt throttle that the performance youd get out of it would at best match a desktop setup set to about 120W max And that as it is now when you can get 3d and CPU performance above the level required for 1080p60fps inside 30 Watt the dgpu design is completely pointless Because you could right now put an almost ten year old gpu in a usb4 dock and objectively beat the performance of any of these gaming laptops even if you plugged the dock into a 30W max sliver of a laptop Which would with some tweaking put you on a 150W budget with an old 2070rtx for example And then basically beat the tdp budget of a razer as well as get more performance out of it for games It would be as mobile and it would be a laptop that wouldnt weigh a ton when youre not gaming Etc etc We could have that right now But the industry wants to sell underclocked Intel chips with new rtx chipsets for 4k dollars So thats what were all reviewing And sadly its what people genuinely think is reasonable to expect will be where the best performance is Basically unless youre a shill for useless products that genuinely make no sense to own you dont matter in the tech sphere And you chose this yourselves,,0.0,1jlzead
comment,mki8p65,gkfisher,,1,2025-03-30 12:09:25,,,,You make no sense I read that twice A desktop 2070is loads slower than a 4090 or 5090 laptop Especially at the same TDP let alone the technical advantages of DLSS 4 etc CPU comments also this generation has much better lower wattage performance If your argument is Desktops are better for the same then yes nobody is debating that,mkht77v,1.0,1jlzead
comment,mkie0cd,nipsen,,1,2025-03-30 12:50:14,,,,I chose to mention the 2070rtx because it is scoring about the same 3dmark score as the 4090 mobile does in labtests Ie when lifting the restrictions of watt in a theoretical physically unattainable scenario where the laptoppsu can deliver more than 175W and vent the heat while also then throttling the cpu so that itll only ever use less than 25W without reduction in score then the 4090 mobile can score somewhat close in a practically useful performancescenario to a soon decade old graphics card that barely draws more power But you know best dont you And surely DLASS and framegeneration is going to magically improve the visual fidelity on a rig that still does not have enough graphics grunt to avoid framedips when putting on the full shader budget Spend your money however you want but you can take the idea that its somehow either a a reasonable purchase b a technically impressive solution c a practical solution for gaming c a reasonably tweaked solution for an attainable tdpbudget goal and just toss it down the drain along with your 5k dollars Because this bullshit that you along with every kind of technical analphabetpress going on out there is driving an industry that doesnt just produce bad products it drives the industry that could produce good products to either not produce them at all Or to tweak the other products in a way that targets unattainable performancewatt goals So Im sitting here for example on a small laptop that exactly like these gaming laptops have been tweaked to have burstperformance so high that the entire thing throttles after 2 minutes of running Regardless of load it just throttles I have graphite pads and liquid metal custom cooling fans and ribs and its completely useless Because the manufacturer is mandated to put in tweaks that make the WMIscore look good and that has a peak on the synthetic marks that make the total result skewed upwards Its 100 useless in fact even worse its detrimental to gaming performance But you guys know best dont you Surely bigger numbers and better And surely having a million cores on a graphics card that arent used for 99 of the running time is superb on account of how someone some day are going to write CUDA code that puts cpuroutines and the final peak of 9999xsupersampling temporally antialiased buffercopy that moves the pixelcolours back and forth till everything is a superb blur of content that you cant recognize from the frontbuffer any more surely will make this bullshit product better for gamers Stupidity Organised stupidity to the point of mass delusion But surely Forbes little nepotistic son knows best right Surely Richard Leadbetter at Eurogamer who literally works for Microsoft and any other company that offers insider scoops whether he gets paid for it or not while having so little technical understanding that hes physically incapable of questioning anything his sources dump in his inbox surely they can be trusted right Straight from the source as one said about Intels whitepapers and the blogs that parrot them Surely they must be giving me sound purchasing advice s,mki8p65,2.0,1jlzead
