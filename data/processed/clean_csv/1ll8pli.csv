comment,mzxpy9h,Deflated_Hive,,63,2025-06-26 19:17:47,,,,I was gifted an ARM PC a few years ago and I have no qualms I have resorted to it as web browsers because thats all I use it for and the Microsoft Office suite Theyre very good at that Especially with the battery life With Xbox Game Pass I can stream games so I always have that need satisfied I dont because getting older with responsibilities sucks I couldnt say the same if I paid the full original price But once this stuff gets more affordable Id encourage anyone to give ARM PCs a shot,,0.0,1ll8pli
comment,mzxtqer,Icy-Comfortable-714,,24,2025-06-26 19:36:28,,,,I know we are talking about PCs here but I just switched from an Intel Mac to an arm Mac and its night and day If work didnt sponsor it Id run an arm laptop and the latest version of Ubuntu,mzxpy9h,1.0,1ll8pli

comment,n06837h,Iron_Burnside,,1,2025-06-28 01:53:38,,,,I have 16 gigs on the M1 Air The M4 can be optioned up to 32 Currently at 26 degree CPU temps and palm rests cool to the touch The Intel chips use so much power at single digit loads Thats a fair plan,n045dt4,5.0,1ll8pli

comment,n05s7pv,bbqsox,,2,2025-06-28 00:14:45,,,,Make sure you get at least 512 GB of storage They finally increased the ram but these new M chips are so powerful that you wont need to upgrade for years My M1 Air with 256 GB is constantly full just a few years later,n02xlhu,3.0,1ll8pli

comment,n06d1pv,bbqsox,,2,2025-06-28 02:25:24,,,,Its ARM in general The windows machines running snapdragon processors have incredible battery life as well from my understanding The issue you run into there is compatibility with all the legacy programs,n066y27,5.0,1ll8pli

comment,n03x1dp,upsoutfit,,10,2025-06-27 18:18:35,,,,I bought a Surface Laptop Go a couple of years ago I was in Micro Center and they had an open box one for under 400 Its light fast has a bright screen and it has a touch screen Its a very nice bargain laptop The only downside is poor battery life Apple now prices that machine the same as a MacBook Air Thats insane because its overall quality is nowhere near a MacBook Air,,0.0,1ll8pli
comment,n07jy4x,CptUnderpants-,,5,2025-06-28 08:19:14,,,,The only downside is poor battery life I manage a fleet of them for a school battery life is fine for us The real downside of them is the touchscreen is just that Cant use Surface pens on them It isnt a digitiser,n03x1dp,1.0,1ll8pli
