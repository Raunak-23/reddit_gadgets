comment,mixfa70,rowrowfightthepandas,,5,2025-03-21 05:27:52,,,,Everythings a conspiracy when you dont know how anything works If Disney is going to use AI chatbots for something theyre just going to use it But can you think for even a second about why they would want chatgpt on a roaming theme park robot A company as ruthlessly dedicated to the image and branding of their characters isnt going to use chatbots on robots that dont even have to talk Also this isnt even the point Seemingly the only reason people like OP think there would be LLMs is because AI was mentioned even though thats just a single very specific application of this extremely vague term If you have some other reason for believing theyre going to use LLMs for random unspeaking Star wars droids by all means share Your entire conspiracy is basically just article said AI and Disney sus No shit on both counts thats not an excuse to turn your brain off,mixe0i4,3.0,1jfagxa
