comment,n297ve7,mystlurker,,3,2025-07-09 21:51:22,,,,Taxes can vary down to individual addresses not just states Counties and cities can also have sales taxes and in many places special assessment zones used to pay for various infrastructure can be applied to individual shopping centers or even individual buildings Not necessarily a great system but you are underselling how complicated it is,n28tcqk,5.0,1lvjucr
comment,n29iyu2,projectsangheili,,3,2025-07-09 22:49:40,,,,Surely the place selling it must know I really do not understand the problem Hell you could slap every single tax version in an excel sheet and reference the address and be done Its such a strange reason,n297ve7,6.0,1lvjucr
comment,n29qwvj,mystlurker,,2,2025-07-09 23:32:32,,,,It changes frequently and requires a fair amount of work to maintain Usually either managed by the Point of Sale systems or by third party companies that places build into their checkout in some way When doing online purchase the address of the receiver is the one thats calculated so they do it at checkout during the online process It is effectively a giant excel but managed by a third party online its usually either a third party you integrate or managed by the store software like Shopify So you can know it but not until the last step of checkout process so all prices are quoted before tax and most people have a general idea of their local tax rate typically 810 There are unique situations where some states do not have any sales tax and people will use that to get cheaper prices by going to those states to shop but technically all other states have use taxes that force people to pay the tax for all items they come back to the state with so its not really a loophole,n29iyu2,7.0,1lvjucr

comment,n28qkg1,Enderkr,,12,2025-07-09 20:29:59,,,,I look back very fondly on the OG flip phones the RAZR was handsdown my favorite phone of all time With new flips I cant get over the screen crease Im not willing to sacrifice screen quality for screen size especially when the full size phones we have these days are more than big enough,n27mvcs,3.0,1lvjucr
comment,n2fgjfc,chostax-,,3,2025-07-10 20:30:17,,,,There were soooo many flip phones before the RAZR The RAZR was just the nicest thinnest one to come out and its design made huge waves Id argue in terms of tech we havent made the same progress on the foldable phones as we did from the first flip phones to the razr,n28qkg1,4.0,1lvjucr

comment,n2anevt,RimStain,,-1,2025-07-10 02:40:13,,,,I owned the flip 3 and 5 for 2Y each the hinge is well built Theres a video on YT where people open and close it for 6 days straight 418K opens and closes before it breaks The real problem is the flexible screen separating from the glass like screen protector that comes factory this is from moisture and grease not physical movement,n28nqzi,5.0,1lvjucr
comment,n2asqzg,bickandalls,,-1,2025-07-10 03:14:12,,,,No dust doesnt damage it Pieces of foreign materials and small dents do A tiny dent is almost a death sentence for a fold A cover prevents anything large enough to damage it from getting near the hinge and obviouslyprotects against dents Covers also have relatively strong springs for what they are Ive had my fold 5 since week of release It will likely be retired shortly because two years of heavy use is hard on a battery but everything else is golden No a hinge cover cant garentee zero damage but its a night and day difference from no cover,n28nqzi,5.0,1lvjucr

comment,n2endmy,Commander-Typo,,1,2025-07-10 18:10:59,,,,Fold 2 owner here I bought it in 2020 and still using it right now Over the years Ive dropped it a few times and as a result it does not open fully flat I have a hard plastic cover that snaps on Actually two pieces and it does not cover the hinge If I had that extra protection my phone would probably still open fully flat There are a few nicks in the main screen that have gone through the permanent screen protector so it is no longer stuck to the screen the full length over top of the hinge Still quite usable but time for an upgrade which is why Im here,n2ba4ej,7.0,1lvjucr
comment,n2bk5ql,KBeightyseven,,0,2025-07-10 06:45:39,,,,Yep zlip6 owner here according to the internet this would be the worst phone possible for me Im a mechanical engineer in the heavy industries Im usually dirty metal swarf in my pockets etc the phone has held up as well if not better than a slab phone iv also bent the last two slap phones and cracked the screens while being in my pocket as they are so huge compared to a closed flip,n2ba4ej,7.0,1lvjucr

comment,n28ywqn,Sophrosynic,,1,2025-07-09 21:08:01,,,,Flip phones had to be opened every time you used it The Fold will be used closed a lot and only opened up when settling in for an extended session,n27mvcs,3.0,1lvjucr
comment,n2943jx,VagueSomething,,5,2025-07-09 21:32:46,,,,It is still mechanical parts to fail over time in the hinges and stress on the screen area Minimal gain with this current design too so it is really just for tech fans,n28ywqn,4.0,1lvjucr

comment,n274v68,rcm_rx7,,6,2025-07-09 16:06:37,,,,I had the same problems with my 4 turns out the dust seal brush things came unglued inside and prevented it from opening I scraped them out with a thin piece of plastic from some packaging and was able to get it working again Traded it for a Fold 5 because of that Unfortunately it seems the 5 has the same problems not for me so far,n26qu1k,2.0,1lvjucr

comment,n26wkzd,OniExpress,,3,2025-07-09 15:28:57,,,,Yeah im perfectly happy with my current Ultra but even then the 23 was so prone to damage that I already look at Samsung a little sideways The vulnerability to literal pocket sand is too much for me to go with a folder,n26qu1k,2.0,1lvjucr

comment,n2joad3,iguacu,,1,2025-07-11 13:27:39,,,,No idea but lost in this discussion is that I wouldnt have been that mad about the hinge breaking under warranty if it hadnt required driving to a 3rd party repair shop 30 minutes away 5 different times so 5 hours of driving months of waiting for Samsung to send them the part needed I would call and they would say it should be in any day now before finally cutting my losses before the 12month warranty was up mailing it to Samsung official repair using a PIxel 2 for a few days buying an iPhone and putting the refurbished unit on Swappa as soon as it came back to cover half my losses,n2jaaga,3.0,1lvjucr

comment,n2c5w0r,ReddyGivs,,4,2025-07-10 10:10:22,,,,Then get the pixel 10 pro fold when it drops it will be IP68 Honestly this is fold 7 is a bust because it gets rid of the things that gave it an edge over its competitors Without s pen and UDC its basically just an inferior Vivo X fold with a larger price tag Only a fool would believe this is the best route for Samsung to go At this point Sammy has likely lost me as a customer because I would be stupid to choose the fold 7 over the pixel 10 pro folds IP68 The only real trade off is the chip and camera but at the end of the day it still will have a great chip and camera with superior durability My guess is sammy is hoping casual users will become the core base for their foldable but that isnt realistic with their pricing If I want a thinner fold I can get the Vivo X Fold that has a better camera faster charging bigger battery and is thin with zero pen support and no UDC Its basically a better version of fold 7 and the 1TB version is only 1599 compared to the 2k sammy wants Sammy has lost the plot,n2bzbik,2.0,1lvjucr

comment,n2ivoj0,tubbis9001,,2,2025-07-11 10:18:16,,,,I use it nearly every day on my 22 Ultra Some mundane features I like remote camera shutter removed on newer phones unfortunately cropping and annotating screen shots is a breeze scrolling with a pen is often just more comfortable than a fingerespecially if the screen is dirty or you have gloves on Its also great for clicking on tiny links in websites that arent optimized for mobile yet or websites where the mobile version is dogshit and you need to force the desktop version On that note it acts like a cursor when hovered over the screen allowing mouseover functionality such as drop down menus The S pen isnt for everyone But for those of us that rely on it we would never buy a phone without it unless absolutely forced to,n2ifkp3,4.0,1lvjucr

comment,n26gqcz,chrisdh79,,38,2025-07-09 14:14:41,,,,From the article At 89mm thick when folded its up there with the likes of the Oppo Find N5 as far as thinness goes Oppos device is so slim that my colleague Dominic Preston dubbed it the final evolution of foldables Open the Z Fold 7 is just a hair thicker than the USBC port on the bottom of the device But there was one notable casualty in the quest to make it thinner S Pen support Samsung claims that omitting the screen layer that makes stylus support possible helped slim the phone down to its current proportions Ill take a slimmer foldable over a styluscompatible foldable but lets observe a moment of silence for the S Pen Fold Edition The Folds new wider format is a welcome change The cover panel now measures 65 inches with a 2520 x 1080p resolution compared to the Fold 6s 63inch 968 x 2376p screen It finally feels like a normal phone when its closed The inner screen is now 8 inches and Samsung finally gave up trying to hide the inner selfie camera under the display and just put a 10megapixel sensor behind a little holepunch cutout Good riddance The water and dust resistance remains the same with an IP48 rating like the last two models Now the bad news two thousand US dollars Or 1999 to be precise thats what the Z Fold 7 costs With the price of everything going up the tariffs situation and the RD costs that went into this newer thinner Fold I guess I shouldnt be surprised At 1899 the Fold 6 wasnt exactly cheap But something about the words two thousand dollar smartphone just feels wrong you know But back to the good news the Flip is getting a proper edgetoedge cover screen for the first time Its the direction Motorola went when it relaunched the Razr a few years ago and I think its the right one Samsung uses the extra screen real estate next to the camera cutouts for the time and date as you swipe through widget panels or for navigation buttons in apps which is cute Sure its a little awkward working around them but Id rather deal with this and reap the benefits of a bigger screen than be hemmed in by the file folder shape,,0.0,1lvjucr
