comment,m6x6q1z,internetlad,,3,2025-01-13 14:10:16,,,,Im running out of phone brands to recommend I was full steam ahead on the OnePlus Bus until I traded in my 13 with a cracked screen which I found out was literally unrepairable because you cant get parts anywhere and they tried to charge me extra saying it did not power on even though it did When I contacted them to sort it out they just told me I should have taken pictures of it turning on when I boxed it up to send it in so it was my fault they were charging me Fuck OnePlus Ive been an OP fan since my OP6 several years back but I cant stand for a company that does that to their customers Good phones but not worth it considering theyre filled with Chinese spyware and have shit customer service,,0.0,1i09cf9

comment,m7061va,internetlad,,2,2025-01-13 23:09:37,,,,Honestly not sure at this point Im almost so fed up with both Google and Apple that Im considering third options but most of them are just overpriced stripped out android OSes with no support A flagship that doesnt steal user data is my white whale,m6x84hd,2.0,1i09cf9

comment,m71moqa,internetlad,,2,2025-01-14 04:02:10,,,,Not really what Im looking for I dont want digital cleansing I can just put my phone away if thats my goal I wanted specifically a phone that wasnt contacting Google 50 times dailyApple servers once a minute to dump my info I read that a lot of people are buying Pixel phones and putting GrapheneOS on it Might try that Im also North America so severely limited options on phone models that support our towers NA gets fucked compared to EU and Asia for cell companies Not only do we deal with a duopoly on the operating systems but there are really only 3 companies that have cell service and all the other MVNOs just buy time on their towers so if ATTTMobile or Verizon doesnt have a tower with the band a global phone supports it just doesnt work Believe me Ive been looking for a long time for a solution and never been happy with one yet Tried a Poco with ArrowOS Was in the beta program for the Nothing 1 Ive got a small stack of weird phones in my closet but theres always some deep flaw that makes them unreliable or highly inconvenient It seems like theres a pick two triangle of security usability and stability and security is the easiest to part with Its fucking sucks,m70zu6c,4.0,1i09cf9

comment,m6wiys6,drmirage809,,1,2025-01-13 11:08:20,,,,Having held an Open that thing is thin enough Not to mention that a thinner phone sacrifices not just sturdiness but also cooling and most importantly battery capacity My biggest worry however is and remains the hinge Its a moving part that is gonna see repeated use every single day Making it thinner will come at the cost of how many times it can fold Anyway foldable phones are out of most peoples price range They are and remain silly toys for enthusiasts for the most part,,0.0,1i09cf9
