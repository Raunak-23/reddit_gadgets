comment,msh3fcu,golddilockk,,12,2025-05-15 16:36:25,,,,i dont envy them the tech in these headsets are as cutting edge as it gets but the market wont see a wide adaptation even with a 50 price cut especially with where the 3rd party software support is at plus the reported user discomfort with prolonged use,,0.0,1kncoct

comment,mt43pis,Few_Direction9007,,1,2025-05-19 12:50:17,,,,Its tough Microsoft tried to market the HoloLens to the military and professional and industrial use and it still failed I am interested in seeing the development of this but it honestly seems like this tech might go into hibernation for a few years before it can really be affordable,msh3fcu,1.0,1kncoct
comment,msh9s3i,AnalogWalrus,,1,2025-05-15 17:06:57,,,,I legit think something like this is absolutely going to be huge in the future but the tech isnt there yet for wide adoption on multiple levels Im definitely intrigued by the concept though but will take multiple iterations before they come out with a product thats ironed out a lot of the usability and tech hurdles let alone the cost,msh3fcu,1.0,1kncoct

comment,msh4mtn,theubster,,3,2025-05-15 16:42:20,,,,They could sell at a loss at first Or at cost Given that the vison pro is sitting somewhere between 40 and 60 margins theyve got room for cuts to be made Taking the low end thatd be approx 2100 per unit instead of 3500 Like apple has roughly 50 billion in cash and stock assets as of April To put that into context Smaug the dragon only has them beat by a little with approximately 54 billiondepending on how one assigns value to the Arkenstone So they can make it a thing if they wanna Theyre too greedy to do something cool like that though,,0.0,1kncoct
comment,mshfmxp,microtherion,,1,2025-05-15 17:34:46,,,,The only product Im aware of where Apple supposedly did this was early on in the production of AirPods where it was clear that improved yields and increased production volume would soon get the product to profitability Keep in mind that even if they wanted to a company Apples size has to be somewhat careful with underpricing as predatory pricing can be illegal,msh4mtn,1.0,1kncoct
