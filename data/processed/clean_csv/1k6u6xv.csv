comment,mou8eq6,icaaryal,,1,2025-04-24 19:05:17,,,,Sure I understand the point What Im getting at is that by the time you get to food moving on a truck to the last or second to last location before consumption driver cost is probably sub 2 TRANSPORTATION cost as a whole is a more important number Thing is though the driving is only part of the job There still needs to be about 5 people involved for every leg of a trip for each truck if you take the driver out of the equation And those 5 people are going to have to come from the manpower of companies who arent directly liable for and wont easily accept liability for trucks and freight that arent theirs When Waymo Google pulled the plug on their autonomous trucking aspirations I think that was the canary in the coal mine for this isnt cost effective For certain segments of trucking it will be useful but the gains are fairly meager in the grand scheme of transportation cost,mou6h3q,10.0,1k6u6xv

comment,mouh7j6,ScientiaProtestas,,1,2025-04-24 19:49:03,,,,Different person here The problem with data is selfdriving cars have to report accidents While human driven cars do not have to So you end up with two data sources and they have to be balanced in some way For example if you use insurance data then accidents will be underreported And even if you have one data source there could be unavoidable biases in the data Also studies cost money Until the government pays for a selfdriving car study which I think they absolutely should the study will probably be funded by the company itself While this does and should cast some doubt I dont think it makes the study invalid Instead I think people should look for flaws in the study itself and make judgments from there So if people want to say no matter what you cant compare or use the data then we should stop here If instead making appropriate adjustments we decide that at least the data can give an idea even if not exact then we have something to work with Waymo is under a ton of scrutiny Any at fault crash will make the news somewhere They also have hundreds of cars running every day I feel like the crash rate might be low since not much comes up when you do searches Of course we need actual data though So with all that said there is this study And this one goes with the above one and goes into more detail on the data benchmarks Once again consumers should not be guessing or trying to understand studies the government should give clear data similar to how crash testing is done Why dont they TBC they do a tiny bit in this area But it is nowhere close to something like this carbrand gets a fivestar rating for crashes Ah I knew I would get downvotes I assume this is just from people that hate Waymo or selfdriving cars And silly me I thought this might open a discussion of the data issues or if a study is completely wrong simply because a company funded it or what the government should do in this area,moto3r7,5.0,1k6u6xv
comment,mouova6,subnautus,,1,2025-04-24 20:26:35,,,,Until the government pays for a selfdriving car study which I think they absolutely should the study will probably be funded by the company itself Theres a difference between funding a study and conducting the study yourself though For instance if a company like US Steel comes up with a new alloy to bring to the market theyll submit samples to organizations like ASME and provide funding for material properties analysis and validation So in that regard any new metallurgical analysis you see published in an ASME journal or included in ASME code was paid for by the manufacturer but its ASMEs study their findings and their determination of acceptable use for given applicationsnot the manufacturer Cue the study you linked The authors are all employed by Waymo and from your comment Im sure you see the concern there Its less Big Tobacco funding a bunch of studies into the effects of smoking and more the industry taking ATT at its word regarding the expense and technology required for international and cell phone infrastructure until governmental antitrust suits broke up their near monopoly Im not saying Waymos employees would stoop to something that insidious mind but without independent analysis we simply cant assume an unbiased analysis That said at least the study you linked shows their methodology which is head and shoulders above the veritable parade of press releases from the earlier commenters link,mouh7j6,6.0,1k6u6xv

comment,mov9b1n,ScientiaProtestas,,2,2025-04-24 22:11:37,,,,Normally Id agree but the point Ive been dancing around is a concern about selection bias When I look at the Tesla data they provide it is easy to see selection bias and many other issues with their data As for this study there is some selection bias here as Waymo operates in sunny and warm environments so no snow less rain This creates a best case scenario But since it is pulling the same area for data on humans it is best case for them as well And since they are pulling police incidents for both groups it is like for like But there could be bias as more people might report a Waymo accident hoping to get a case settlement Maybe there is more selection bias there that I am not thinking of Overall these cases dont seem like they would contribute to a major difference If the results were close then I would put it down to this error factor But the results were significantly different Lastly this is only one study so more are needed,mov3yi7,9.0,1k6u6xv

comment,mp6u8og,GrimDallows,,1,2025-04-26 18:48:39,,,,This reminds me of a story when I was in engineering college I cant recall why but we were discussing safety in building buildings So worst case scenarios and whatnot This was afterclass talking with a teacher after showing him a project in his office we were heading to the lab Anyhow the conversation takes a spin and we were talking trucks moving steel beams which then lead to a whats the worst that could happenhow would you as a driver be responsible of your truck ignoring safety standards and being stopped by the police or ignoring safety standards and then having an accident in your truck load So the teacher is like it wouldnt really matter And I am like why Because you would not have the responsabilities of doctors due to some weird legal system vaccuum And he tells me that you would be super dead He then tells me about a truck with a gas tank or something misshandled his cargo and blew up some decades ago and made it to the news I am like did he die And he is like yeah instantly A whole holiday campbeach nearby too all the people ended up dead And I was like oh like they went camping near a gas leak and they unknowingly died from cancer from the chemical effects or something after some years And he is like no Gas tanks explode The driver got vaporized The people camping got an instant death from the conflagration cloud like lungs and insides instantly burnt just from breathing People on the beach got instantly boiled to death while most of the surface water vaporized so yeah depending on the cargo it can be absolutely atrocious You can never have enough safety in certain matters,mosv97s,1.0,1k6u6xv
comment,mpg7rs8,dickbutt_md,,1,2025-04-28 08:07:23,,,,I disagree Heavily loaded semis dont drive in dense urban environments they drive on interstates over the road The warehouses they drop and pick up at are generally located pretty close to a major highway and access is built to accommodate those vehicles These routes can be easily mapped out and use a mixture of AI selfdriving and deterministic systems that preexist AI and machine learning based on static info They can also be governed to drive pretty slow Instead of being limited to driving only half the time because of laws limiting how many hours drivers can work theyll be able to go probably 22 hours a day when theyre in the field The only way to achieve this with human drivers is to shift drive which requires paying two drivers One question I have is whether the fleets will be electric or gas If gas theyll probably have more downtime for maintenance and fill ups while electric trucks would have much simpler drive trains and battery swaps can happen quickly if theyre required at all its also possible to just put a bunch of battery packs under the trailer and do entire trips without stopping depending on how the economics works out I expect that these self driving trucks will be suuuuper cautious and initially be loaded with insurance but as they prove themselves and the rough edges get polished out costs will drop and the number of nines delivered will far surpass what humans can do,mosv97s,1.0,1k6u6xv

comment,moulrxt,Rymanbc,,0,2025-04-24 20:11:25,,,,For me I see the near future holding a different sort of automation for driverless trucks I think it more likely in the next 10 years that we start to see driverless trucks that latch on to and follow a truck in front of them So imagine a truck driver driving his truck down the road but having 5 driverless trucks following him That way the driver will be responsible for the route for filling with fuel responsible for blown tires etc and unfortunately will be held legally liable when things go really wrong At this point it wouldnt be replacing all drivers but greatly decreasing the total numbers There may also start to have the option for trailers to drop off to charge in case of electric and the driver picking up freshly charged ones along their route or have automated switching out at certain hubs to create more complex routes with multiple drivers having taken it for part of the journey I think the legal liability is honestly the thing that will hold up mainstream adoption at the moment The truck company the software company and the rest will try to limit their own liability as much as possible and having a driver accountable will be the best legal stop gap until the laws catch upto where they need to be to hold driverless technology accountable And to those who say why not just use a train then its the exact same reasons as to why plenty of trucking routes exist where a train route already also exists Expediency,mot6z9t,3.0,1k6u6xv

comment,motz661,web-dev-noob,,3,2025-04-24 18:20:30,,,,The only reason driverless trucks will never work is not the tech its because conpanies will always need someone to hold responsible when it goes south Truckers are constantly getting thrown under the bus everyday at work with the shit these companies pull I know cuz i used to be a truck driver There will never not be someone in the driver seat with a camera pointed on them unless its a test in a semi controlled environment The tech is already there and the auto braking system is whats gonna cause the first accident The problem is the same with cars just on a larger scale Many cars have an auto braking system to prevent accidents which is great and trucks have them too The problem is its alot more complicated to calculate because lets say for example you have frozen meat They keep that on a sled that can be pulled off the truck Those loads are prone to sliding A false brake would make the whole load slide forward and now the weights of the truck are off So do AI driven trucks get a pass They need to change laws and the ways trucks run and are loaded in order to pull this off Its not as simple as just getting it to drive You can teach a monkey to drive Trucking is about getting the load there safely from point A to point B so you can see your family next month or 3 Anyway im interested to see what adjustments are made Im also betting this is gone drive consumer prices through the roof How much money does someone have to pay you to be strapped inside an AI death trap thats gonna kill you or kill someone else We lost alot of truckers when they switched to automatics lol,motvflv,1.0,1k6u6xv

comment,motkg20,TracyF2,,0,2025-04-24 17:12:06,,,,Its sad that Texas cant invest more in their electric grid before introducing another product that uses the electric grid The trucking industry may be strained for drivers but Im pretty sure another bad winter will make that truck obsolete and left on the side of the road,,0.0,1k6u6xv
comment,mot0zeg,Peac3fulWorld,,0,2025-04-24 15:40:26,,,,I wonder if this will ease the phenomenon of that asshole trucker who thinks its cool to just chill in the left hand lane because hes got a haul to move If these trucks are going a steady 57 mph and strictly in the right hand lane and programmed to give lots of clearance for onramping I dont see the issue aside from job loss If they are programmed to try to get there faster and pull dumbshit highway passing like normal ahole truckers do then fuck Elon,,0.0,1k6u6xv
comment,mousegz,oliefan37,,0,2025-04-24 20:43:50,,,,Its almost like we need a technology that allows a small team of people to transport 100 truck loads on a sort of predetermined path between centralized distribution hubs where local truckers can distribute the goods to individual companies and still get home at a reasonable hour,,0.0,1k6u6xv

comment,mosy553,krectus,,6,2025-04-24 15:26:55,,,,I mean the problem is we need to get a whole bunch of goods across the country and the only solution being lets make a person sit there for ten hours a day and make them go cross country backandforth with the goods The solution to that problem now is we can just get a computer to do it and we can find something better for the person to do and not make them do that anymore,moswmsg,1.0,1k6u6xv
comment,mov3efi,yoppee,,3,2025-04-24 21:39:55,,,,Yes I agree with you thats why we should have much higher taxes in the rich Universal income And much higher investment in education Because we all know that there is 35 million truck driver in the USA we are going to see massive unemployment not these people doing better stuff with their time,mosy553,2.0,1k6u6xv
