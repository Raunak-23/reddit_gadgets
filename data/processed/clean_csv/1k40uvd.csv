comment,mo9b51a,FantasticBurt,,8,2025-04-21 14:04:25,,,,Im sure they are aware and there is a line on the menu stating as much regarding the fee I saw it first day before management ever mentioned it and it pissed me off though there isnt much I can do beyond looking for a new job but they arent easy to find right now,mo99poy,3.0,1k40uvd
comment,mo9hsdb,DrDerpberg,,4,2025-04-21 14:39:19,,,,Can you pass on complaints from customers real or imagined Or even check with the labor board if they can charge a service fee that isnt going to the service workers Like Im not trolling Id assume that any fee like that is a base tip and that I can tip that much less without screwing anybody Its not a service fee if its just a price hike in disguise,mo9b51a,4.0,1k40uvd
comment,mo9jjl6,FantasticBurt,,1,2025-04-21 14:48:15,,,,Look I understand your perspective and honestly dont care for tipping culture but youre choosing to misunderstand the fee by tipping less and it does screw your server I dont want to have a job as a server I have a degree in a highly sought after field but that same field pays significantly less than I make now unless you get very lucky to find a good one and comes with a hell of a lot more responsibility and stress and less flexibility Im at the point that weve started bartering with other industry workers to trade skills rather than paying for services because everyone is broke But if you the customer just see the fee and choose to tip less as a result but dont bring it up to management what do you expect They dont give a fuck what we think and second hand complaints like that mean nothing to management,mo9hsdb,5.0,1k40uvd

comment,mo9pf29,FantasticBurt,,1,2025-04-21 15:17:53,,,,No decoder necessary the line on the menu explains the fee in plain text Im not happy about the bill but youre taking it out on the server by choosing to tip less in this instance Youd be better served speaking to management about your frustration with the fee than stiffing your server due to actions of management,mo9mxuj,7.0,1k40uvd
