comment,luvdd44,calcium,,9,2024-11-01 15:31:21,,,,I just used GSM Arenas phone finder and there are 10 phones that have so far been released in the year 2024 that have a screen size between 45 and 61 One of those phones is a standard iPhone 16 If I change the screen size to include all screens above the size of 61 I find that there are 490 phones that were released this year What Im getting at here is that based on screen size the iPhone 16 is one of the smallest screened phones being sold in 2024 so the chances of a smaller phone being sold by Apple is basically zero,luuykzj,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luv6avc,ElectronHick,,19,2024-11-01 14:53:35,,,,I hate calculator sized phones I had an SE for the longest time and then got the 13 mini I love it When I became eligible to upgrade I tried to get another 13 mini but they were all gone So now I have to make this phone last another 3 years until they have a decent powerhouse in a small form factor,luuykzj,1.0,1gh41pn

comment,luwdsxn,Josh_The_Joker,,6,2024-11-01 18:40:52,,,,I have the 13 pro currently and have no problems with it except battery life is not so great anymore I like that the SE 4 will have OLED but will it have the 120 hz screen Pro motion I think they call it Its the reason I got the 13 pro over the 13,,0.0,1gh41pn
comment,luwlo0o,ca2mt,,5,2024-11-01 19:22:01,,,,Highly unlikely the SE 4 gets 120hz Rumors are the 17 lineup should all have 120hz so I dont think well see it trickle down to the SE until 5 or 6 Hows your battery health Maybe swap out the battery on your 13P and see if itll hold you over until next fall or the following fall and pick up a 17 Pro at a discount Maybe Apple Intelligence will actually display some form of intelligence by then too,luwdsxn,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luwnjf3,Josh_The_Joker,,3,2024-11-01 19:31:58,,,,Battery is currently at 82 Most days its around 510 by the end of the day,luwlo0o,2.0,1gh41pn
comment,luwpn1b,ca2mt,,5,2024-11-01 19:43:08,,,,89 for a battery replacement at Apple might be worth it in your case They may make you wait until its showing 80 but you can probably force the issue and have em do it,luwnjf3,3.0,1gh41pn
comment,luv7cky,vincentwallbanger,,31,2024-11-01 14:59:09,,,,whats the benefit of the 5G modem and the wifi 7 chip,,0.0,1gh41pn
comment,luv8cmk,phl_fc,,76,2024-11-01 15:04:33,,,,Communication speed 5G is faster than 4G or LTE WiFi 7 is faster than 6 New iPhones already have 5G and wifi7 The news here is that theyre going to start making the components themselves instead of buying them from a 3rd party manufacturer,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvfzd4,Roboculon,,17,2024-11-01 15:45:05,,,,To elaborate most of the speeds you see advertised for like wifi 5 or 6 are misleading It might say its 5 gigs per second basically infinity which makes it seem like any upgrade beyond that would be extraneous But what they actually mean is that your router can give that speed cumulatively if its connecting to many separate devices simultaneously The actual singledevice speed is generally far lower so from the perspective of a single device iPhone there really is a significant benefit to using the newest technology,luv8cmk,2.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvhcnd,TooStrangeForWeird,,8,2024-11-01 15:52:14,,,,5Gbps across all devices is plenty especially considering 1Gbps is the fastest almost anyone uses at home The actual advantage is in places like apartment buildings where there are lots of routers Even then the importance is still often overstated,luvfzd4,3.0,1gh41pn
comment,luviho1,Roboculon,,2,2024-11-01 15:58:10,,,,I agree wifi 6 is probably ample for any general use My own example though is that I have wifi 5 at home and 1 gig internet service My iPhone can only access like 200Mb per second so if I upgraded to wifi 6 that actually would give me a speed bump Of course 200Mb is still quite a lot so this bump Id get would almost never be noticeable,luvhcnd,4.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvmyko,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2024-11-01 16:21:43,,,,Lots of people use roaming wifi while out and about with their mobile carrier or ISP programs saved public WiFis workplace wifi etc The key thing is that these technologies will get faster and more reliable in an infrastructural way too which will also affect the device to device experience even if its not a change in the speeds you get on each device at home for example,luviho1,5.0,1gh41pn
comment,luw9zf9,PM_UR_REPARATIONS,,2,2024-11-01 18:21:00,,,,You wont see that much improvement on WiFi 6 over WiFi 5 6E is there its at,luviho1,5.0,1gh41pn

comment,luwxub5,junkie-xl,,3,2024-11-01 20:26:42,,,,The iPhone 16s Wifi7 is limited and doesnt support 320hz and other features iirc its basically the same as 6e,luv8cmk,2.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvazga,CO_PC_Parts,,12,2024-11-01 15:18:41,,,,what theyre saying is this phone is the test product for their new chips They normally buy these chips from broadcomqualcomm but theyre making their own now If theres massive problems with them then the risk is mitigated because its in the phone thats cheapest to replace and has a smaller market share than the flagship phones So if you buy this new phone there is a risk there will be issuesbugs with these devices,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvep8k,Aphophyllite,,5,2024-11-01 15:38:24,,,,I was wondering about this Im in the market for a new iPhone SE but Im not waiting to get the 4 Im not paying to be a test subject,luvazga,2.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvzyw6,AirFryerAreOverrated,,5,2024-11-01 17:29:23,,,,Since itll be Apples own design they will eventually be able integrate it into the SoC instead of having it as a separate chip like now with Qualcomm modems It will be able to simplify the manufacturing process while also lowering energy usage giving better battery life I doubt itll be integrated this time though since theyll use the same CPU on the SE as the iphone 16,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvzi3t,Ok_Minimum6419,,4,2024-11-01 17:27:01,,,,Potentially cheaper phones as right now Qualcomm can charge apple a bunch of money for basically something they have a pseudo monopoly over The same thing happened with the Apple M1 chip and Apple being no longer reliant on Intel to set their prices Its how were getting a 499 M4 Mac Mini that blows everything in the mini PC space right now,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luw9dgc,veryverythrowaway,,2,2024-11-01 18:17:51,,,,Probably a spacesaving measure If Apple is engineering it its likely due to the fact that they want to put more components in devices for other features and they have a good track record of designing chips with good energy and thermal management Theyll be able to design it in whatever sizeshape fits their design rather than having to design the iPhone around a thirdparty component,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luwrs3k,Altruistic-Sir-3661,,1,2024-11-01 19:54:22,,,,5G networks support a larger number of devices then 4G LTE or older Networks for the same number of nodes So one is less likely to loose service do to network saturation I havent confirmed this but for network subletting providers like Mint Mobile that increased capacity might make a bigger difference since they would have a lower network priority than a networks retail customers,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luxf4dd,happyjello,,1,2024-11-01 22:02:03,,,,Not much Its a big step for Apple because they made it instead of Qualcomm Not much benefit compared to existing phones,luv7cky,1.0,1gh41pn
comment,luvyxae,Garconanokin,,13,2024-11-01 17:24:03,,,,Another bloated SE I would pay such good money for an iPhone 4 form factor with the modern tech Of course I am not the market Most people want basically an iPad in their pocket,,0.0,1gh41pn
comment,luwgs2y,with_MIND_BULLETS,,3,2024-11-01 18:56:14,,,,Actually based off of all of the comments from all of the posts like this one it seems like we are very much the market Now whether Apple wants to acknowledge that,luvyxae,1.0,1gh41pn
