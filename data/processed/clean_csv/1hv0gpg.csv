comment,m5pe0he,TheJedibugs,,5,2025-01-06 15:05:09,,,,Beyond the frame switch previous reports stated that the iPhone 17 will see significant design upgrades For example the Pro and Pro Max iterations could retire the titanium body in favor of an aluminummade one Does upgrade mean something different than I think it does,,0.0,1hv0gpg

comment,m5parm1,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,7,2025-01-06 14:46:16,,,,Bring back the small screen With modern phone designs where the screen covers the entire front of the phone Id love to go back to a smaller screen The dimensions of the original iphone would allow for a 5 inch screen if the screen covered the entire front of the device Personally I think thats big enough There really isnt much extra you can do on a 6 or 7 inch screen that you can do on a 5 inch screen For anything beyond basic functionality Ill just use another device anyway Id much rather have the option of carrying around a smaller phone but nobody seems interested in makeing them anymore unless its a folding phone which is still way too expensive and fragile,,0.0,1hv0gpg

comment,m5paz65,Brandunaware,,3,2025-01-06 14:47:33,,,,This is what happens when you have to keep putting out a new model every year even though theres no real need because the pace of change has slowed enough that the iterations are minor People got used to upgrading their phones all the time back when they were new and things were massively improving Last year I upgraded my 2017 model phone to a 2023 model phone and while it has a nicer camera and bigger screen and is somewhat snappier in performance it has made almost zero difference in my life I only upgraded because the old phones touch screen stopped working not from external damage Theres absolutely no consumer need for a new model every year but its necessary from the producer perspective so we just get a bunch of changes for changes sake,,0.0,1hv0gpg
comment,m5pbjis,pork_chop17,,3,2025-01-06 14:50:56,,,,Thats where Im at My battery life is going fast and my phone back is shattered My phone is from 2021 Im looking at a 14 or 15 cause I dont need the 16 Also to repair my current phone will cost around 500 So for 300 more I could get a new one,m5paz65,1.0,1hv0gpg
comment,m5pedk8,Snipedzoi,,1,2025-01-06 15:07:13,,,,I mean the new model every year is a good thing for more power oriented users I do know I want the power coming in new snapdragon generations for emulation,m5paz65,1.0,1hv0gpg
