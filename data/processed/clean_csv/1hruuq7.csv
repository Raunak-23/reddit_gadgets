comment,m51fx7u,GaussToPractice,,183,2025-01-02 17:42:13,,,,I still dont get why this segment is so slow to get price dragged down Its been 10 years for both 4k and OLED technologies and we have 2k panels for 6 inch smarthpones printed left and right Is it panel yields every 50 dollars of discount we have from new panels 1080p IPS es go down 100 dollars I hope Xiaomis new monitors keep coming to drag the prices down,,0.0,1hruuq7
comment,m52qpbu,Shoelebubba,,40,2025-01-02 21:38:36,,,,Iirc it was the yields but specifically the sizes of the mother glass that OLED panels are cut out of and keeping waste down to a minimum So yields for OLEDs have been pretty good for LG I dont really kept track of Samsung but the problem has been the size of the mother glass and how its cut Its also why the 83 models are priced so much higher than 77 persquare inch of screen size Like a pane of mother glass can neatly cut out 3x 65 and 6x 32 panels to keep the lost glass down to about 90 Or that same glass can cut out 6x 55 panels Or you could cut out a single 83 panel and a couple of 27 panels Or 2 77 panels Thats been the problem the big numbers are in the smart phone sized panels or TV sized panels It makes sense to prioritize cutting mother glass panels to sell those while the odd 27 32 42 sizes are oddly expensive Only reason I even looked into it was I found it really odd 42 and 48 OLEDs were so similar in price and so were the 55 and 65,m51fx7u,1.0,1hruuq7

comment,m53n1bl,hako_london,,2,2025-01-03 00:25:31,,,,But surely the demand is there for gaming and workstation PCs to make a billion mother glass pieces of the monitor size,m52qpbu,2.0,1hruuq7
comment,m54le28,Shoelebubba,,11,2025-01-03 03:44:11,,,,No A workstation PC will not need this what office worker is gonna need OLED Anyone working in video images or graphics sure But realistically theyre taking higher color accuracy monitors over the high refresh rate monitors and theyre happy to pay the premium for said color accuracy The other is there is still an inherit danger of burn in with OLED There will always be a risk of burn in anything Organic the O in OLED is going to degrade with time You can put as many preventative and life extending features but it will eventually happen That is always gonna be a problem for mass adoption MicroLED is gonna be OLED without the burn in but that tech is at least 5 years away also I read it was 5 years away in 2020 lol So whats why people were waiting for the 105G factories currently 85G so bigger than 97 OLEDs could be made but more importantly more 27 could be cut at the same time Dont know anything else beyond that IMO LGSamsung are making more money per mother glass prioritizing TV sizes If their research suggested theyd make more money selling 2732 monitors you betcha theyd immediately start trying to sell as many as possible,m53n1bl,3.0,1hruuq7

comment,m536d2u,Onceforlife,,2,2025-01-02 22:57:41,,,,Lmao it was on rfd and the bapcsales subreddit around Black Friday you need to read in the thread where 1 or 2 of the days monitors had 20 rakuten and the 10 rewards coupon on top of an existing 10 off,m53190l,3.0,1hruuq7
comment,m58m7ew,MattLogi,,1,2025-01-03 20:20:23,,,,Oh yeah I see it now and remember that sale I mean its 840 and 100 was Dell Rewards which unless you are buying another monitor isnt that useful,m536d2u,4.0,1hruuq7
comment,m58qijd,Onceforlife,,1,2025-01-03 20:42:29,,,,My invoice after taxes was 1118 after tax in Ontario I got 198 from rakuten so if we work backwards 1118198920 and if we take out taxes we have 920113814159 CAD pre tax in Ontario Im not sure what you mean by 100 in Dell rewards I got an 10 off Alienware monitors when I signed up for a new account with Dell rewards This promo was stackable on top of the existing 10 off And this was only available for a short time before they discontinued it,m58m7ew,5.0,1hruuq7
comment,m58rvex,Onceforlife,,1,2025-01-03 20:49:23,,,,Also the 800 number I had earlier is based on how you calculate the tax since rakuten is calculated for the price before taxes some people deduct the entire tax amount from the final price to work backwards towards the pre tax amount IMO 814 is the more realistic adjusted pre tax number but most people would deduct the entire tax amount from the final bill to arrive at 800 Not sure if this made sense Youd know if you dealt with rakuten,m58m7ew,5.0,1hruuq7
comment,m58ska9,MattLogi,,1,2025-01-03 20:52:52,,,,Ohh so the 10 was off the price not in Dell reward points Did you also get Dell reward point on the purchase Thats a really good deal for that monitor,m58rvex,6.0,1hruuq7

comment,m54dsxl,ArchusKanzaki,,1,2025-01-03 02:57:15,,,,Last years 32 flat OLED monitor already reaching 700 The curved 32 like Alienware can be got for even cheaper You can definitely buy OLED for around that price with discounts stacking and everything Also the new ROG seems to will retail at 1200 Thats pretty cheap compared to what used to be OLED starting price I can bet MSI will make cheaper version too probably with reduced refresh rate like their MAG32UP vs MAG32URX And sure you can probably get 43 inches of screen if you go for TV for same amount of money But you will also will have 43 inches of TV for a monitor and not everyone wants that,m50xaz0,1.0,1hruuq7

comment,m50r30v,random_reddit_user31,,30,2025-01-02 15:33:09,,,,Thats HDR True black which is a different certification Current QDOLED panels have a peak of 1000 nits so Id imagine these are the same or more,m50pqp0,1.0,1hruuq7
comment,m52bc7e,Placed-ByThe-Gideons,,-1,2025-01-02 20:22:42,,,,I know that My point is its not good enough many other panels also carry the same certification and are way too dim Off the top of my head the 27GS93QEB,m50r30v,2.0,1hruuq7
comment,m50rdi6,random_beard_guy,,18,2025-01-02 15:34:47,,,,HDR True Black 400 is not the same standard as HDR400 for LCDs The highlights are 1000 nits in OLED panels with that VESA standard,m50pqp0,1.0,1hruuq7

comment,m54frya,ArchusKanzaki,,1,2025-01-03 03:09:13,,,,Its probably to reduce burnins that they are going only for HDR TrueBlack 400 Brighter backlight means hotter screen means higher chance for burnin Its good enough for almost any scenario even with more or less direct sunlight especially with the added contrast If you absolutely need the monitor to fight sunlight I suggest going for Matte coating like G80SD Its really damn good,m50pqp0,1.0,1hruuq7

comment,m54q9ia,Thedanielone29,,1,2025-01-03 04:16:23,,,,Were already seeing quickly diminishing returns from 1440p to 4k I reckon theres no real good point to go beyond 8k and 580 fps At that point our brain wires will cause as much latency as the monitor and the resolution will be high enough such that antialiasing would likely be unnecessary 4k 240fps is basically already there imo,m53kgmb,2.0,1hruuq7

comment,m55coto,ArchusKanzaki,,1,2025-01-03 07:14:57,,,,27 to 32 is big difference because I did not buy 27 1440p despite it being alot cheaper than 32 4K I dont particularly care for 4K or 240Hz The size play bigger role in my decisionmaking especially because my previous monitor is already 32,m54u3zr,3.0,1hruuq7
comment,m54k6hw,ckelley87,,4,2025-01-03 03:36:28,,,,To me 27 is the optimal monitor size and not being able to get a 4K version in OLED has been annoying I dont care about the high refresh rate part of this but I am so glad to see that resolution in this space here That said for me to use one monitor for both my PC and Mac Id need it to be 5K and theres luckily a few new models coming out soon though not OLED,m5237ub,1.0,1hruuq7
comment,m54uhcj,FlaccidRazor,,-2,2025-01-03 04:45:39,,,,4k already can display more colors than any human eye can distinguish and more resolution than the average eye can fully appreciate Making shit bigger is the only reason to increase resolution,m54k6hw,2.0,1hruuq7
