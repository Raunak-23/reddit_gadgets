comment,n0yfz4d,Trisa133,,169,2025-07-02 15:17:19,,,,Their OS is just vanilla Android with a simpler aesthetic and no bloatware Other brands like Samsung makes it bloated just to add features that are mostly useless and significantly slow down the OS Oh yeah and they add apps and bloatware from third parties to make extra money,n0xogqa,2.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n105mz4,technobrendo,,40,2025-07-02 20:13:48,,,,Samsung is much better than they used to be and OneUI is considered one of the better nonstock android releases I do wish you could easily remove more components but compared to touchwiz Ill take what I can get,n0yfz4d,3.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n113e94,wazzuper1,,1,2025-07-02 23:06:37,,,,Remember when Android users boasted how much you could customize your phone and mocked Apple users only to in the end parrot how great vanilla Google is with less customization,n10h0um,5.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n11thrl,i_lack_imagination,,24,2025-07-03 01:28:25,,,,You realize the point of being able to customize is to make it fit what you want Valuing stock features with less bloat makes sense because you only add the customizations you want not the ones someone else decided you have to have These few comments that take swipes at people using Android while comparing it to iPhones are just weird Maybe I should throw in a random insult just to balance it out Guess that is what happens to ad infested brains using iPhones since they cant install anything on their phones to block ads,n113e94,6.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n14j7jw,wazzuper1,,2,2025-07-03 13:43:13,,,,The thing about Samsung which was mocked is that at stock it can be modified Much more so than Google Guess what you can still have the stock look of pure Google Just throw on another launcher like Nova as I do And for everything else like the themes the keyboard AOD the clocktime the gestures etc Goodlock is there for you You can design it exactly like you want to Its always funny to see the improvements that other OEMs have made are always introduced to Google much much later and sometimes in a worse implementation or with more limitations One UI has come a long way since TouchWiz People need to give these phones a try for at least one week before talking dirt,n11thrl,7.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n181aoi,zzazzzz,,2,2025-07-04 00:18:02,,,,what stock android is the version that allows for the most costumisation and on top of that the pixels are completely open and you can straight up install a different android rom if you want to,n113e94,6.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n1jfolh,wazzuper1,,0,2025-07-05 22:02:09,,,,Its been less and less burying settings further and further away until you have no choice to change things at all If you were around for the days of Kitkat which was IMO the best you had a ton of customization available Pixels allow you to unlock your bootloader sure but besides that and the camera all in the software processing it doesnt offer more builtin than others Its less I used to unlock the bootloader and root and switch up roms all the time Now I dont need to flash roms anymore since the phone already has the capabilities and customization that I want it to have,n181aoi,7.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n11u76h,Deftlet,,2,2025-07-03 01:32:17,,,,Youre confusing the users customization with the manufacturers customization I dont always care for the tweaks the manufacturer makes to the phone but I certainly do care for the ones I make myself The possibilities are endless randroidthemes Disclaimer lots of the submissions have poor taste but they show the kind of things you can do,n113e94,6.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n14k1k8,wazzuper1,,1,2025-07-03 13:47:40,,,,I wholeheartedly agree Goodlock takes customization to as far as you can dream The other person made an assumption that I was an iPhone user While I do have a business phone that is not my primary driver I also have phones from Samsung primary OnePlus and still miss my Moto X being the best phone Thanks for the subreddit for inspiration,n11u76h,7.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n1pambg,joe_bibidi,,1,2025-07-06 21:24:50,,,,I mean They didnt completely remove lights on the back of the phone click the damn link and look at the phone The thing that they did was that the replaced the glyph lights with a tiny pixelated screen thats capable of having much more specific and legible information See the top right of this image,n0ze0id,2.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n0z26z2,Bob_The_Bandit,,1,2025-07-02 17:01:32,,,,Artificially keeping production low and retraining that boutique label is an excuse to keep prices high If they produced 10 times and sold at half the price theyd sell all of them and still make money Stuff like the OP1 being 2000 is part of their marketing too since every reviewer will put some clickbait title and thumbnail about the price YOU WONT BELIEVE HOW MUCH THIS COST type shit,n0yp88k,4.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n0zmapp,parisidiot,,37,2025-07-02 18:37:16,,,,Artificially keeping production low and retraining that boutique label is an excuse to keep prices high there isnt a market large enough for what they make for this to make sense sorry its not keeping production artificially low it is keeping production in pace with demand for their sort of thing which is low like it is very common for businesses to make high margin low volume products like what,n0z26z2,5.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n0zx4s1,cman674,,9,2025-07-02 19:31:26,,,,Siliconcarbon batteries are still lithium batteries they just swap out the anode for a silicon one It allows for higher capacity but theres also a greater risk for degradation because the SiC anode expands more during use So maybe neat but Id wait to see if they hold up as well as the current generation of batteries,n0y3l90,2.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n0xgepi,chrisdh79,,41,2025-07-02 12:07:50,,,,From the article At 799 the Phone 3 is priced to match the iPhone 16 Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 particularly as Nothing positions itself firmly outside its midrange origins Pei says the company feels ready to compete with products in that price level Preorders open on July 4th with general sale starting on July 15th on Nothings online store and Amazon in the US Nothing says the phone is fully compatible with TMobile and ATT with more limited 5G support on Verizon This is Nothings most expensive phone yet but the specs should keep pace with the price on paper The Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chip isnt the most powerful one out right now but its performance should handle all but the most demanding mobile games especially paired with up to 16GB of RAM Storage starts at 256GB and you can get 512GB for an additional 100 The Phone 3 uses a siliconcarbon battery which is a relatively new technology that makes it easier to fit big batteries into small phones Here that means a generous 5150mAh capacity combined with a 65W wired charging speed and 15W wireless charging speed The 667inch OLED screen is more than twice as bright as the Phone 2s and the IP68 water and dustresistance rating is a first for Nothing too All four of the cameras three on the back one on the front are 50 megapixels though its impossible to say whether theyre any good until The Verge gets to test the phone out properly Nothings camera processing has previously lagged a little behind the competition so thisll be an area to watch All that is in line with other flagship phones so what makes the Phone 3 feel like Nothing Thats where that new gimmickfree Glyph design comes in While previous Nothing phones have featured an array of light strips that can glow and flash in custom patterns for notifications and ringtones those have now been swapped out for a small dotmatrix LED display in one corner on the back of the phone The Glyph Matrix is immediately less striking than older phones designs and less unique too Asus has included dotmatrix displays on the back of its ROG gaming phones for years Pei says that the advantage is that custom notifications can be much more immediate with easily recognizable images or emoji tied to specific apps and contacts rather than abstract animations that might be hard to grok at a glance,,0.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n12p2i9,clintbartnn,,7,2025-07-03 04:52:50,,,,so they basically made it look like every other phone for flagship money the whole point was those crazy lights and now its just a tiny dot display that asus already did years ago feels like theyre losing what made them different,n0xgepi,1.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n10errh,Loeffellux,,16,2025-07-02 20:57:33,,,,Nothing has made quite the impact due to the fact that they are a designfirst tech company that usually still delivers a decent value at its price point They arent the best in class in any given category except maybe design which is subjective of course but I guess people are more used to brands like this being less than the sum of their parts so when their products deliver what they promise they end up surprisingly decent I say all that as someone whos never actually bought a nothing product so this is just my perception of how they are currently regarded by the tech community Their CEO is also social mediasavvy so you end up seeing their stuff a lot I guess this couldve answered your question lol the phone 3 might be the first time where their formula doesnt quite add up with an experience that is underwhelming for its price point,n0yr94w,1.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n11szza,paaaaatrick,,3,2025-07-03 01:25:45,,,,Its not really decent value at its price point It feels like they are trying to be like apple if apple made midrange stuff where its overpriced but you are buying for the design aesthetic and brand,n10errh,2.0,1lpu4e0

comment,n11wimt,HRudy94,,0,2025-07-03 01:45:06,,,,Those arent niche far from it A headphone jack is vastly more compatible than bluetooth The bluetooth headphones are majoritarily able to also work wired In fact people that would prefer to not have a headphone jack anymore are in the very small minority,n11tash,4.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n12964u,paaaaatrick,,1,2025-07-03 03:00:49,,,,Dont change the argument Bluetooth is shit when it comes to audio is the comment that puts you in the minority Flagships have an option for wired headphones and people speak with their wallets and the market moved to wireless,n11wimt,5.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n12cw3s,HRudy94,,1,2025-07-03 03:25:28,,,,I mean people are still mostly using wired through dongles so not using Bluetooth wouldnt put me in the minority The fact Bluetooth is shit for audio is a fact though not an opinion I mean its so bad that you cant watch a livestream with it without a significant desync between sound and images Theres new codecs but theyre still much worse than a proper wired connection They all involve some heavy lossy compression to work at remotely decent level WiFi has a much higher bandwidth and range compared to Bluetooth,n12964u,6.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n12lwxq,Redeem123,,2,2025-07-03 04:28:55,,,,I mean people are still mostly using wired through dongles False The fact Bluetooth is shit for audio is a fact though not an opinion And 1080p is objectively worse than 4k Yet 1080 is just fine for most people,n12cw3s,7.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n14hwje,HRudy94,,0,2025-07-03 13:36:11,,,,Biased stats from a not so trustworthy source we cannot just have the portion of Bluetooth vs wired users perhaps the major streaming apps could gather such data and even that would likely result in a sample bias I also dont trust a stat that tells us that Beats is still relevant compared to any other brand that is talked much more often Beats by Dre was pretty much bought and put on life support by Apple That said image resolution is a good comparison Flagship computers for instance rarely run 1080p because as youre paying more you expect a higher quality This is the same thing here Id go as far as argue it doesnt make sense to remove headphone jacks from all phones since the lowerend are unlikely to be able to afford a new BT headset or a USBC one either,n12lwxq,8.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n155yrv,Redeem123,,1,2025-07-03 15:34:18,,,,biased stats from a not so trustworthy source Then post your own source for the claim you made Surely you have one Whether you like it or not most people are perfectly fine with the sound quality of Bluetooth Audiophiles who are caught up in getting perfect sound are the minority and always have been,n14hwje,9.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n16gx3s,paaaaatrick,,1,2025-07-03 19:17:01,,,,Im so confused as to why you arent living in reality about this You are clearly an audiophile and that is a minority Most people who have specific unique hobbies like that understand that they are in the minority You can make statements like it sucks flagship phones removed headphone jacks because for audiophiles like me our experience is worse with wireless headphones but I understand for most people wireless headphones are more convenient and fine for the general population in 2025,n12cw3s,7.0,1lpu4e0
comment,n16qa20,HRudy94,,1,2025-07-03 20:03:31,,,,Let me reiterate as the initial argument wasnt even about that I started it by saying no jack no buy as its ridiculous that an expensive phone is stuck to either lowquality sound through bluetooth or inconvenient dongles that arent even taking profit of the onboard sound card Then people said that bringing back the headphone jack would only cater to niches It wouldnt First because it doesnt remove the option of Bluetooth and also because theres a lot more people with wired headphones of some kind at their disposal than there is with Bluetooth headphones As a proof most bluetooth headphones also include a headphone jack and oftentimes even provide a better quality through it Now yes many if not most mobile users are fine with watereddown compressed sounds through Bluetooth I mean otherwise people wouldnt use Spotify xD But there was one time where 480p was fine for most doesnt mean we stuck to this nor that it would be majoritarily accepted nowadays Most likely if we asked people whether theyd want to bring back the headphone jack on their phone the large majority would say yes I mean you have nothing to lose and everything to win by having more options after all,n16gx3s,8.0,1lpu4e0
