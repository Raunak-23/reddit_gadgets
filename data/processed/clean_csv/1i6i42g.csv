comment,m8cbtw8,cookingboy,,696,2025-01-21 13:08:56,,,,Its not AI features its not like any of the Chinese brands are that great at AI either The author of this article doesnt know what they are talking about iPhone has always been a bit of a showy status symbol in China for the uppermiddle class after all you can easily buy a phone that does 80 the stuff for 30 the price And that demographics have been moving to foldable phones which is why the flagship model for all top brands in China is a folding phone There is a reason Huawei made a big deal about their trifold phone All top brands are launching new foldable flagships this year Well all top brands except Apple and its hurting their sales It doesnt help that iPhones have been looking the same for years If the author just spent a single day visiting a few AppleXiaomiHuawei stores in China theyd know why Apple is hurting Edit Just looked up some data Chinas foldable phone sales went up 48 YoY for the first half of 2024 And none of that went to Apple obviously,,0.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8cihza,ZgBlues,,164,2025-01-21 13:50:56,,,,Thanks that makes much more sense I have no idea why they crammed AI into the article as if sales success of any smartphones is tied to that According to the report Huawei and Xiaomi hold top two spots in whatever they chose to call premium segment Huawei has the trifoldable and Xiaomi released a clamshell foldable,m8cbtw8,1.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8dk56m,primaryrhyme,,67,2025-01-21 17:00:44,,,,This assertion that consumers care about AI is really annoying Almost seems like astroturfing by tech companies but its likely just that AI gets clicks We saw these same articles about the iPhone 16s poor sales and articles were blaming lack of AI No its just not much better than the last 3 gens so people dont care,m8cj4vs,3.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8dcq2j,Ajreil,,1,2025-01-21 16:26:37,,,,Speaking as someone who uses ChatGPT daily and is currently specking out a PC for generative AI Putting AI in a phone is an extremely niche use case Local AI is more private and sometimes has a faster response time depending on if compute time or ping is the bottleneck but most people dont care about either so its just a slower LLM AI is already the next big thing Phone manufacturers want a piece of that pie and are trying to shove it into their phones so theyre well positioned when something phoneworthy is invented Users dont care,m8cji01,2.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8dd4aw,wicodly,,0,2025-01-21 16:28:28,,,,Because if Apple hadnt implemented some form of AI it would be a whole different conversation People are people Reddit doesnt reflect all people Public perception without AI is that youre behind last gen old The next buying block of youth use ChatGPT for more things then ever You cant be stuck behind Reddit swears they are logical and has their thumb on the pulse of the world Companies dont want to be the next Black Berry or Nokia or Razr Everyone already irrationally hates iPhones If they in 2025 still didnt have any sort of AI The hypocrisy would be huge but it would still kill their image Best example the great megapixel race Everyone knows now that more megapixels dont mean better quality but if your android device didnt have 12 then 24 then 30 then 48,m8cji01,2.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8fimya,Car-face,,2,2025-01-21 22:20:46,,,,Is it confidence in the product as well A few Chinese friends anecdotal I know historically had mainland family who basically wouldnt buy Chinese brands for big ticket items if they could avoid it foreign brands were perceived as better higher quality etc you bought local for cheap stuff I feel like thats changing as Chinese brands cement themselves as higher quality options across the market and the domestic perception around Chinese products starts to erode,m8cbtw8,1.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8i25ra,rtb001,,2,2025-01-22 07:34:47,,,,Another major factor is that for Chinese consumers it is much easier to MOVE OFF of iOS and go to Xiaomi or Huawei or Oppo or whoever Western and especially American consumers tend to be far more tied to the Apple ecosystem and many American consumers seemingly will stay with iPhone purely for the blue or is it green I dont remember which text bubbles on iMessage But the Chinese dont use iMessage They literally spend 90 of their time on WeChat and WeChat is gonna look and work the same whether it is on iOS on an android based OS like Xiaomi HyperOS or on Huaweis HarmonyOS So the Chinese consumer is far likely to be locked to any specific phone OS and can more easily jump around between brands if they find a certain form factor or other hardware configuration they like better,m8cbtw8,1.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8cn1ig,Remic75,,8,2025-01-21 14:17:19,,,,It is gimmicky but people love flaunting it because it shows that you have money and does cool party tricks Imagine walking down the street with an iPhone and you see someone with a 3000 phone that can fold 3 times just because it can If a phone could do backflips and cost more than an iPhone that market would probably start to jump too,m8cfjct,2.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8cqj6h,Eruannster,,2,2025-01-21 14:36:45,,,,Interesting I was pretty much immediately turned off by foldable phones because a holy shit that price tag b wait I can literally see the crease that looks fucking stupid and c so hold on how many times can I fold this extremely expensive device before it breaks,m8cn1ig,3.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8d0stl,Hubbardia,,7,2025-01-21 15:29:40,,,,a holy shit that price tag You can get very good foldables around 1000 its not that expensive b wait I can literally see the crease that looks fucking stupid 99 of times you cant c so hold on how many times can I fold this extremely expensive device before it breaks A million times The rest of your phone will die before the hinge breaks,m8cqj6h,4.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8d4jiq,Eruannster,,-7,2025-01-21 15:47:54,,,,You can get very good foldables around 1000 its not that expensive I could also buy a much better nonfoldable phone for that price Also 1000 is not that expensive for a phone I remember when flagships used to cost like 500700 not that long ago 99 of times you cant Moves the phone around in the light Yup there it is Thats the crease Also I can feel it while touching it A million times The rest of your phone will die before the hinge breaks Allegedly a million times Also if the screenhinge breaks thats probably going to be a very difficult and expensive part to replace,m8d0stl,5.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8dsq6k,LucywiththeDiamonds,,9,2025-01-21 17:40:13,,,,You clearly never use one for even a day And much better at what Most foldables use flagship hardware in all aspects Usually the camera is slightly worse but still a tier which doesnt matter for many I used 5 different foldables as my main phone in the last 5 years and youre just talking about atuff ypu dont know,m8d4jiq,6.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8cscav,Remic75,,2,2025-01-21 14:46:29,,,,Same here I never understood the hype behind it My best guess as to why is that the market in china does not like each new phone every year to be the same as before but with upgraded camera specs slightly different chassis The folding market definitely does not the rest of the world in a chokehold like that Im sure Apples going to do it eventually and try to have a ceaseless phone Itll be interesting to see if theyre rushing development because of declining sales,m8cqj6h,4.0,1i6i42g
comment,m8d1q79,Hubbardia,,10,2025-01-21 15:34:12,,,,I never understood the hype behind it Its one of those things that you gotta use to understand Theres so many advantages to owning a foldable that you realize when you actually start using it Here are a few examples Media looks awesome whether it be reading watching videos or showing someone pictures you clicked Hard to go back once you get used to it You can prop it anywhere in different angles You can open it halfway through to make it a small laptop for watching videos You can use it in a tent mode when youre laying down to keep your hands free and use your phone You can turn on dual preview to show your subject what the picture will look like which saves a ton of headache and reduces the tries you need to take to get good pictures Multitasking is amazing Dragging and dropping files between different apps watching videos and scrolling on reddit at the same time etc,m8cscav,5.0,1i6i42g

comment,m8gk2vx,GigabitISDN,,1,2025-01-22 01:33:01,,,,The way it was explained to me was that someone said I can use AI to generate music that I listen to every day And in response I said something like but I already use DIFM and Spotify to listen to music every day And their response was along the lines of oh so just because something already exists AI shouldnt be allowed to do it You are obviously antitech and antiprogress and then a whole bunch of names So basically AI is mostly marketing hype and people get really really really angry when you point that out It reminds me of the 90s when you could just add an e or com to your company name and people would lose their minds lining up to buy in Because internet,m8cr1ej,2.0,1i6i42g
