comment,mh7cvyq,GolotasDisciple,,36,2025-03-11 14:01:43,,,,Yes and no They are not really for general audiences From what I understand they are trying to touch market of people who need to do Video Rendering or Music Production Sort of portable super drive Its one of those items that appeals to small audience that wants to have something professional but are not ready or do not know how to really go pro But in this case it really would be just wiser to start building a proper Rack which is always upgradeable and customizable with less single points of failures This reminds me of Apple Gadgets for Professionals Cool product but it really is more of a gadget that can be used by professionals rather than professional gadget If you know what i mean No real music producer or animator or designer will be willing to spend so much money on non industry standard solution,mh79fh6,1.0,1j8qrne
comment,mh7nddc,Fire_Lord_Cinder,,20,2025-03-11 14:55:28,,,,The consumer market is a very small portion of WDs customers Roughly 80 of sales go to businesses for cloud or AI storage Just think about how much data companies like Netflix Hulu OpenAI etc need to store every day These companies want the largest amount of storage that they can fit on a single Hard Disk so they can maximize the amount of storage per server,mh7cvyq,2.0,1j8qrne
comment,mh8x5ko,Abigail716,,17,2025-03-11 18:32:49,,,,To follow up on that One thing thats also worth pointing out is power efficiency with higher capacity drives It might not seem like a big deal to the average person but two 10 terabyte drives require more power than a 20 terabyte drive for obvious reasons This amounts to extra electricity costs which are already staggeringly high at data centers but also additional air conditioning needed which contributes to the staggeringly high electricity costs A few percentage points better efficiency makes no difference to your average consumer but the large scale commercial clients like Netflix or OpenAI its a huge deal,mh7nddc,3.0,1j8qrne

comment,mh7r40m,szucs2020,,9,2025-03-11 15:13:59,,,,This would be a kind of strange move for music production imo I produce music and most of what I have fits on a 1tb nvme Now its mostly full and I use another 2tb SSD for extras like large kontakt libraries But the biggest thing for me is speed For large sample libraries loading times are insanely slow even on a 7200rpm drive Now Im not a professional but I really dont see them using hard drives at this point without a nasraid Edit I see in the article they mention video Editors and photographers I think that makes a lot more sense The scale they work with is significantly larger,mh7cvyq,2.0,1j8qrne
comment,mheb3h2,heepofsheep,,2,2025-03-12 15:17:26,,,,Im not sure why anyone would want to edit video off this thing It simply doesnt have the readwrite speeds to support a lot of modern formats I can maybe see this being used for a very very massive longform TVfilm project where all the media is just low res proxies Even then thats a bit of a stretch since those types of productions would be use a remote in type workflow usually,mh7r40m,3.0,1j8qrne
comment,mh8qjv2,min0nim,,-5,2025-03-11 18:01:39,,,,This isso wrong Half the answer is even in the title so you dont even need to RTFA if you dont want But its like you didnt even read the title before having a rant aboutbedroom producers and Apple,mh7r40m,3.0,1j8qrne
comment,mh8solr,szucs2020,,2,2025-03-11 18:11:55,,,,I dont think you read the comment I replied to honestly The article says nothing about music production It mentions creatives and filmphotography Only the comment I replied to mentioned music production and I said that doesnt make sense They mentioned the idea about this being a portable super drive Professionals work in studios and wouldnt need to carry around a hard drive like this Bedroom producers and semi professionals wouldnt carry around hard drives like this because a single drive is significantly slower than SSDsnvme without a proper raid setup And on top of all of that unless youre a professional composer who needs massive sample libraries of every single instrument you wont run into space issues on consumer grade storage solutions Again that person is not travelling around with a hard drive anyway because to load that data into ram would take way too long I said nothing about apple,mh8qjv2,4.0,1j8qrne

comment,mhcgpsd,MWink64,,1,2025-03-12 06:46:43,,,,I think one of the best budget 2TB NVMe options currently available is the Team Group MP44L for 104 with a free 32GB memory card from Newegg Its from a mainstream brand even if not one of the best it still tends to come with TLC NAND generally uses components not known to have widespread issues either a Maxio or Phison controller and Micron or YMTC NAND and performs decently You can find drives slightly cheaper but youre usually getting into QLC NAND questionable brands andor questionable components,mh8hfa7,3.0,1j8qrne

comment,mh7djm8,alman12345,,-4,2025-03-11 14:05:10,,,,They are I really dont know what theyre doing that warrants a thunderbolt connection to their host since even in RAID 0 a couple spinning rust drives wont exceed the total data rate of USB 32 Gen 2 even in sequential readswrites I guess they may be running some advanced NVMeHDD cache mechanism internally Edit Wow bunch of WD shills around here,mh79fh6,1.0,1j8qrne

comment,mh92cjl,alman12345,,1,2025-03-11 18:56:55,,,,Theres effectively no difference between having the drive on a hub at the end of the chain and having it before the monitor Terminating a thunderbolt chain with a USBC device is also possible so this is effectively just spending 500 on docking hardware with the thunderbolt specification and given that the drives are exorbitant for what they are its a pretty silly product sales on Seagate Exos equipped 24tb externals have been popping up left and right for months now at 279 I could shuck 4 of those and throw them in an OWC thunderbolt dock off Amazon for 200 less and itd have 8TB shy of double the space vs the 52TB Also none of these are really NAS at all unless theyre connected to an always on machine and provisioned for network access All in all just a shitty product honestly,mh8sxaw,3.0,1j8qrne

comment,mhcj3e0,The_Oracle_65,,3,2025-03-12 07:11:27,,,,The problem is HDDs are pretty much at their physics limits without needing technologies that make them increasing expensive The capacity growth curve is flattening out without much increase in performance For larger individual drive sizes without the weight power and cooling of HDDs we will need to wait for Datacentre NVMe QLC SSD tech to get cheaper and filter down into the retail markets These drives are already at capacities well beyond 26TB but obviously optimised for storage arrays For example Pure Storage have been producing 24 48 and 75TB drives for some time and an NVMePCIe QLC 150TB Drive is available now with a 300TB on the roadmap Sure 150TB is overkill for most PCs even with an extensive homework folder but Im pretty sure cheaper SSDs at capacities beyond 30TB are coming,,0.0,1j8qrne

comment,mh8wuit,david_edmeades,,5,2025-03-11 18:31:23,,,,There are some clear differences and some notsoclear ones Datacenter drives _should_ be CMR although they do try to sneak SMR models into those lines sometimes until people notice and yell The NAS series claim to be more resistant to harmonics and heat that you get when they are in a dense disk shelf with 35 other drives They also are more likely to have a SAS option When Im buying disks I look at CMR vs SMR and warranty period If Im going with a brand or series thats new to me Ill check the Backblaze drive stats and see what the reliability has been That said for datacenter operations we are insulated from absolute failure rates because nobodys running serious storage as a RAID0 There are massive redundancies and hot spares I have 2PB of storage thats all ZFS mirror units that get rebuilt with a spare immediately upon a drive failing out of the array Out of 200 disks I get an actual RMAworthy disk failure once every few months,mh8pyfb,1.0,1j8qrne

comment,mhau9ad,dakotanorth8,,2,2025-03-12 00:06:22,,,,Ok theres a lot of really all over the place comments here Its a rotational drive This will never be anywhere close to SSD speeds A 208 TB drive is NOT a single rotational 7k drive Its an 8 bay raid equipped NAS enclosure Also with 8 drives and user defined RAID levelsyou can have increased performance because each drive only has to do a portion of the seek or write time Again since its rotational Again there are variables that affect this Such as RAID types and levels Amount of drives Speed of drives Feel free to google any of these for additional context as this is a very high level overview,,0.0,1j8qrne

comment,mhc19p4,SupremeDictatorPaul,,2,2025-03-12 04:25:45,,,,Get an 8 bay box to run Unraid put in 4 cheap drives and use double parity Then you can easily increase space by adding a single drive at a time of any size When you get close to filling it up remove the smallest drive as you add a large one You should end up with a system that is easily expandable until the hardware dies And if that happens move the drive to a new system and youre good to go,mhayvrm,4.0,1j8qrne
