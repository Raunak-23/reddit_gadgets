comment,midoyex,Paksarra,,10,2025-03-18 03:28:04,,,,Only if you were to accidentally install certain third party addons that use Kodi as a frontend Dont worry one of the steps involves somehow mananging to buttdial the correct URL for the forbidden addons repository using your TV remote they arent officially sanctioned addons so its highly unlikely youll be in danger of having such an accident Streaming video without the authorization of the copyright owner would be a violation of US copyright law and very naughty so its a good thing this is a highly unlikely accident,mida81t,5.0,1jdmuhk

comment,micobor,PigglyWigglyDeluxe,,7,2025-03-17 23:51:16,,,,Agreed People dont like seeing anyone being critical of Apple Jokes on me though they caught me hook line and sinker 3 Apple TVs 1 watch 1 iPhone 2 HomePods and 1 Mac mini I feel like Im decently qualified to speak to how awful they are in some ways They all suck though Ive tried nonApple equivalents and they are awful in their own ways Cant have anything be perfect these days which is a shame since these shits arent cheap For the money they charge and all the marketing telling us its bleeding edge state of the art global standard they are anything but so fuck me for expecting such performance in the real world right And that other guy telling me its a skill issue I didnt know I needed training to use a remote Sorry Ill go to tech school for that Ill be a certified remote professional in no time,micmzpj,4.0,1jdmuhk
comment,mie02op,bringbackswg,,0,2025-03-18 04:52:10,,,,Not to mention the integration with the iPhone an infitely better platform to queue up media and control the Apple TV than any remote could ever hope to compare to is still lacking and broken in a lot of ways I dont want to EVER navigate the TV interface directly I want to choose and queue up media using the phones interface but AirPlay honestly sucks for this Volume control always breaks the remote app is dumb and stupid and not a good alternative at all Ive spent hours and hours troubleshooting phone integration volume issues Airplay issues They keep changing it and breaking everything,micmzpj,4.0,1jdmuhk

comment,mifde1h,IllllIIIllllIl,,1,2025-03-18 12:37:52,,,,I have both an Apple TV and Shield and while I prefer using the Apple TV in general it isnt really a true home theater device and calling the Shield a tinkering box for nerds is downplaying what it is It really is a capable little box that doesnt need any fiddling to get set up and unless youre building a HTPC its an essential device if you stream ripped physical media since the Apple TV doesnt support many of those codecs If the Apple TV fills in those currently existing gaps with the next hardware refresh then its probably the best set top box on the market for a long time,mic62z2,4.0,1jdmuhk

comment,mifiv66,zushiba,,1,2025-03-18 13:11:51,,,,I already got rid of all my Rokus We use to have 4 of them The performance has steadily declined over the last year or so They keep finding new ways to push ads to my screen And I friggin paid for the god damn device If my Roku was free I can see dealing with ads but on a device I paid a not insignificant amount of money for you dont get to double dip So I tossed all 4 2 have been replaced with Apple TVs and the other 2 are some form of Android devices You can get used 4k Apple TVs for between 8 to 20 Do that instead,,0.0,1jdmuhk
