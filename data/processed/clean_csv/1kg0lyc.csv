comment,mqzxncb,OperatorJo_,,4,2025-05-07 02:17:07,,,,TLDR These are unobtrusive electrodes They stick them directly on your head where all the electrodes in an EEG would be on top of and they can 3D print these to match your hair color so these can capture brain activity while you go about your day,mqymt3z,2.0,1kg0lyc
