comment,md1gn07,Direct_Bus3341,,38,2025-02-16 07:37:36,,,,N95 N70 was iconic not this But cool idea regardless,,0.0,1iq7gvh
comment,md21nlf,Goldfire1986,,12,2025-02-16 11:11:11,,,,Yep as someone that owned the N95 and then upgraded to the N97 the N95 was much better The hardware in the N97 wasnt up to the task especially with the terrible touch screen,md1gn07,1.0,1iq7gvh
comment,md2gl2s,bearybrown,,4,2025-02-16 13:21:27,,,,Man I was fucking afraid handling N95 Takes it out of your pocket and it could slide up or down Same as N93 with rotating screen N96 was frickin beast tho,md21nlf,2.0,1iq7gvh
comment,md2x8uu,Direct_Bus3341,,2,2025-02-16 15:06:16,,,,Coolest guy in school though Its a fair trade Remember the days when our phones could give us a popularity stat buff like the ngage or anything with a Symbian D3,md2gl2s,3.0,1iq7gvh

comment,md8zqnd,alexzhivil,,1,2025-02-17 14:11:24,,,,I enjoyed my N95 so much the sliding felt so smooth and robust It also had outstanding speakers I remember putting it on my chest and being blown away by the sound It was one of the last good phones they made afterwards they failed to keep up with the touchscreen revolution,md1gn07,1.0,1iq7gvh

comment,md9autc,Cless_Aurion,,1,2025-02-17 15:14:04,,,,You are like looking too much into this one my dude If you think 1985 to 2006 isnt equivalent to 2006 to 2025 what can I say its about 20 years in both It fits for a throwaway joke on Reddit if you ask me or anyone with common sensesense of humor tbh Then following up on the you dont have to be old to have used the phone I know thats kinda the joke I had one when I was a teenager I will say its a bit weirder for someone born in 99 since you werent even 10 when the damn thing came out but sure why not,md96ngm,8.0,1iq7gvh

comment,mczqkl9,Sylvurphlame,,1,2025-02-16 00:25:20,,,,I mean personally I would love one as I think it would synergize as well with the whole gamepass conception would be more reliable solution than just tempting to remote into your console on a phone or tablet or whatever But I think Microsoft is working on slowly exiting the hardware market so I dont think well ever see an Xbox portable,mczmatc,1.0,1iq7gvh
