comment,n4q2hi9,JohnJohn173,,5,2025-07-23 14:59:16,,,,At least thats expected when the article about it and the pictures showing it off include crt I would assume others like me assume it has some kind of crt that you could buy with it or at least the connections for it But neither of those are mentioned I just want a new crt,n4pu8ls,2.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4sl1td,weeklygamingrecap,,3,2025-07-23 22:01:12,,,,This has been my problem for a long time Usually a few people get close using iPad screens and such to make a newer CRT like aesthetic but I dont think Ive seen anyone actually just put one out on thingverse or where ever with a full parts list Closest is was,n4q2hi9,3.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4t1a9f,JohnJohn173,,2,2025-07-23 23:27:55,,,,I really love the checkmate just checked it out I think thats great if youre going for pixel perfect led displays it looks great Im sure would put out a fine signal considering how many ports it has from the beginning but yeah its not a crt replacement if you have a crt I am lucky enough to have kept an older tv from my parents house A newer sony cant remember the model but it has scart svideo component and coax so I can hook moat things up to it natively So its not like Im dying for a crt over here theyre also cheap if you know where to look I would love even something as small as 12in thats done without being terrible and bad for the enviornment Id easily pay 300 for it if not more depending on form factor weight and inputs Bonus points for usb and digital inputs as well but obviously harder to get digital to analog without issues,n4sl1td,4.0,1m78bh6

comment,n4ug3au,YellowThirteen_,,3,2025-07-24 04:42:38,,,,It wouldve been cool if it had a crt display case with a curved lcdoled on the front that hinged open to reveal a storage nook,n4pg2z3,1.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4skbz1,weeklygamingrecap,,6,2025-07-23 21:57:29,,,,Why do they call these sleeper pcs lol Youre not out here rolling up on someone with a RGB fishtank PC and drag racing FPS for pink slips to your rig,,0.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4q0j0g,MidnightChannel91,,7,2025-07-23 14:50:17,,,,heres the case,,0.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4pxegt,Volhn,,5,2025-07-23 14:35:35,,,,Thats cool I think its the Silverstone case badged up and prebuilt I think the real difficulty is that all of these are previewed with a CRT which isnt what people have With some tweaking and a pair of case feet Id bet Silverstone could have a 90 rotation where the case can either be a midtower or desktop Or pair it with some crazy all in one with an LCD built out like a chunky CRT and has all sorts of extras to fill out the case volune,,0.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4t5qsg,PigSlam,,3,2025-07-23 23:52:31,,,,They couldnt even put a turbo button on it,,0.0,1m78bh6
comment,n4q0b4p,dandylover1,,2,2025-07-23 14:49:17,,,,Its ridiculous If they want to design such a machine they should put real floppy parallel serial etc in it Yes keep the modern options but also give the buyer a choice especially at that price And who really needs an 8tb hard drive anyway,,0.0,1m78bh6
comment,n50dpop,Middcore,,3,2025-07-25 01:35:56,,,,More people than need floppy parallel and serial,n4q0b4p,1.0,1m78bh6

comment,n4q1z60,el_esteban,,2,2025-07-23 14:56:55,,,,It might be retroinspired but it hardly looks like a 90s machine The fake floppy drives look well fake and the giant air intakes are a dead giveaway that this is a modern machine,,0.0,1m78bh6
