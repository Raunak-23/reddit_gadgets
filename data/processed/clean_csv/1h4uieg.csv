comment,m03p9er,sali_nyoro-n,,4,2024-12-02 21:48:31,,,,Well robot comes from the Czech robota meaning serfdom or drudgery which also the term used in languages like Slovak for work in general with robotník being a general term for a labourer In Russian the term for labour is rabota работа with a bluecollar labourer being a rabotnik работник So in an abstract sense the original robots already were powered by vodka and this is just technology mirroring nature,m017240,1.0,1h4uieg
