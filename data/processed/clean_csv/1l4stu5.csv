comment,mwkxiky,robertcalilover,,4,2025-06-08 00:52:37,,,,Imagine buying the game cart it takes up all that space on your device anyways and then your card reader breaks and you cant play it even though its on your device,mwkori9,6.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwccfhk,samtherat6,,6,2025-06-06 16:36:05,,,,Its a step backwards when other companies are taking steps forwards The sticker is not great but the battery still aggressively glued down The thumb stick also seems to be harder to remove and is attached to the colored plastic from what I can tell,mwbr7b3,4.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwjmm8v,jcdoe,,3,2025-06-07 20:15:59,,,,Weve been anticipating the Switch 2 for years And when we got it the HDR kinda sucks it doesnt have an OLED and the games are 80 I dont think this is the fault of clickbait I think people are just kinda disappointed at the corners Nintendo cut with this thing Its 2025 why arent we putting OLEDs in everything already,mwdn4nm,4.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwbtzj0,st-shenanigans,,1,2025-06-06 15:07:24,,,,Thats fine it just means their copy protection is so invasive if a game card acts funky and shoots a weird voltage itll brick your system,mwbfh9z,1.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwbnrgn,BentTire,,73,2025-06-06 14:37:32,,,,The thing is The TOS they have is standard with console manufacturers Sony has this and so does Microsoft Nintendo has had this since at least the Wii days All they did was change the wording You are still free to customize and repair your console You just cant install unauthorized software or hardware mods that circumvent implemented restrictions,mwbkjlx,1.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwcleca,BernieMP,,-18,2025-06-06 17:18:54,,,,The problem is nintendo sells their hardware at a profit not a loss like sony or microsoft If the price of the hardware is completely covered then the hardware was purchased completely anything else is a dishonest practice,mwbnrgn,2.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwcn3ie,BentTire,,15,2025-06-06 17:26:53,,,,While Im not 100 defending Nintendo and their practices They have to have some levels of restriction to prevent people from putting in modifications that change the behavior willy nilly Otherwise you end up having a far worse hacking situation than what is already present The only time Nintendo sold their consoles at a loss was the Gamecube They drop the price from iirc 200 usd to just 99 But people have to remember that Nintendo is not your friend and never has been They are a company with the intent of making a profit and maintaining a specific outer appearance,mwcleca,3.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwke4er,Arashi5,,1,2025-06-07 22:52:12,,,,3DS after the price cut and Wii U were sold at a loss and tarrifs might make it so Switch 2 is sold at a loss and it currently is being sold at a loss in Japan,mwcn3ie,4.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwcpatk,BernieMP,,-8,2025-06-06 17:37:18,,,,How about banning people from online You know like theyve always done The actual service not the hardware theyve already charged you for,mwcn3ie,4.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwcq0zk,BentTire,,6,2025-06-06 17:40:45,,,,That is likely what theyll do The bricking and even then I doubt they will stop the device from working all together will very likely be reserved for VERY extreme cases Because I cant imagine even a company as strict as Nintendo pulling an Apple and bricking your device just because you didnt follow TOS for the device,mwcpatk,5.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwed5pb,Hameron18,,3,2025-06-06 22:47:45,,,,I hear you but youll have to forgive those of us who dont trust a huge corporation to not abuse that power against people and be forgiving with nonextreme cases,mwcq0zk,6.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwfuyrs,BentTire,,3,2025-06-07 04:36:06,,,,Oh I dont blame you guys at all for having massive distrust Especially with the BS they pulled in the past of doing stuff like taking down fan games and projects,mwed5pb,7.0,1l4stu5
comment,mx4tkeb,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-06-11 02:37:29,,,,1 Microsoft and Sony dont sell their consoles at a loss 2 How is it relevant what it cost to the company So Sony took a lossleader strategy that means theyre allowed to have restrictions on the hardware you paid for What,mwcleca,3.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwen6om,pogisanpolo,,1,2025-06-06 23:46:10,,,,They do with exceptions for game consoles according to the 不正競争防止法 which specifically forbids modding of game consoles Theoretically it should be forbidden but if someone tries to sue them they can uno reverse them with this law,mwe9ggg,3.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwds2tx,pogisanpolo,,11,2025-06-06 20:50:58,,,,Its a subtle but important distinction since nothing is stopping the UK from dropping thise laws since theyre no longer bound by the EU laws,mwdr6pg,3.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwdsu13,mat145_,,-4,2025-06-06 20:54:49,,,,I think the subtle distinction is only required if you say European Union and England Imagine saying North America including Canada,mwds2tx,4.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwi1sw1,EvilTaffyapple,,-3,2025-06-07 15:13:58,,,,Anti consumer They have allowed you to play the new console with your old controllers to save you money They allow you to share digital games now too So one person buys and shares it with their friends and families They also allow game sharing where a multiplayer game just needs one copy to run with four connected consoles Doesnt sound very anticonsumer to me,mwh8119,1.0,1l4stu5
comment,mwl8uv2,___mm_ll-U-ll_mm___,,6,2025-06-08 02:07:04,,,,You are missing the ENTIRE point if your definition of proconsumer anticonsumers hinges on the superficial allowance to use accessories Thats a given considering the tech is still fully functional Its not pro consumer its neutral at best The games are not pro consumer its playtime marketing Like playable demos sent out with Playstation magazine back in the 90s and early 2000s Nothing pro consumer about it its marketing People are blind to what is a consumer benefit vs a calculated allowance,mwi1sw1,2.0,1l4stu5

comment,mwbqvs1,nguyenm,,12,2025-06-06 14:52:30,,,,The context isnt so much being selfreliant on repairs but the monopolization of repairs by Nintendo or other first party only If a design is made where an independent shop cannot procure a singular part for complete repair but Nintendo is quoting a whole motherboard repair,mwbps8b,1.0,1l4stu5
