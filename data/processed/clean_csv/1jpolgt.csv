comment,ml1p2kv,hgs25,,6,2025-04-02 16:28:36,,,,The point is that Nintendo did sell the tech demo separately in the current gen switch If you want the tech demo you have to pay extra The Wii included Wii Sports to teach people how to use the motion controls Your point seems to be that you can just not get it which is not a relevant argument because its a given You dont HAVE to buy the heated seat subscription for your car but you have to buy it to use it even though it was included with the car in the past,ml1kdwe,7.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml4pxrx,Jaerba,,1,2025-04-03 01:47:47,,,,Its Nintendos marketing department being terrible It sounds like its a set of mini games like 1 2 Switch was But instead of calling it 1 2 3 Switch they gave it a terrible game and didnt explain anything Same thing with the Switch 2 version upgrades We know what buying the standalone games cost but Nintendo has told us nothing about the cost of upgrading versions even though there is an upgrade path So people think its going to cost them 80 to get the Switch 2 version if they already have the original Terrible marketing department,ml0xjv8,1.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml3rw4k,Edmundyoulittle,,1,2025-04-02 22:32:54,,,,It makes sense that they would but still within the confines of the original performance targets Meaning I bet that BotW or TotK will actually hit their 30 fps targets when on switch 2 while the paid upgrade will up the target to 60 fps,ml2detd,6.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml4fdps,OGMagicConch,,3,2025-04-03 00:45:45,,,,Yeah idk why youre being downvoted given that the chip is stronger it will 99 mean that Switch games that struggle to run will at a minimum run better Bloodborne for example on PS4 targeted 30 and struggled to hit that in some areas whereas on PS5 it was basically a locked 30 This DOESNT mean these games will run at a higher FPS which I know is what you said but I feel like people arent understanding for some reason Thats where the paid upgrade comes in,ml3rw4k,7.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml8b3e7,None,,2,2025-04-03 17:06:50,,,,The reason why I and other were hesitant to believe this is because of how Nintendo did backwards compatibility in the past Gamecube games did not runlook better on the Wii and Wii games did not runlook better on Wii U Same with DS3DS games This is because Nintendo put those systems in backwards compatibility mode where those newer systems ran exactly like the older ones I didnt want to assume that Nintendo would just change that trend and do backwards compatibility like their competitors primarily because of the issues theyre having right now Over 120 games have compatibility issues on the Switch 2 at the moment Ill take the trade but I didnt think Nintendo would,ml4fdps,8.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml8kaqa,OGMagicConch,,2,2025-04-03 17:51:15,,,,I see what youre saying point taken Everything except for GameCubeWii runs in a different environment not sure the verbage though doesnt it Like Wii U to play Wii you enter a specific Wii mode 3DS seems to also go into some sort of DS mode WiiGameCube seems like the best comparison with their extremely similar hardware and I was just reading that apparently the Wii would underclock when playing GCN but that also meant if booting up GCN through Nintendont or something you could actually still benefit from the overclocked hardware Id be a little surprised if they did the same here just seems to be a very outdated practice though I guess that can maybe even be expected sometimes when coming to Nintendo lol,ml8b3e7,9.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml4jqqo,Edmundyoulittle,,1,2025-04-03 01:11:21,,,,Right Id also call out that a lot of switch games had dynamic resolution in order to keep things from absolutely tanking the framerate so Im sure many games will end up with a higher average resolution as well Just within the confines of the original target Xenoblade 2 dropped below 480p in handheld at points iirc Im sure that wont be happening on switch 2,ml4fdps,8.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1a3k0,LevianMcBirdo,,21,2025-04-02 15:13:40,,,,No unless the game already supported that resolution and fps and just didnt get there it wont just magically do that They need to go in and change the code,ml1953d,3.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml3s5wg,Edmundyoulittle,,2,2025-04-02 22:34:25,,,,Youre correct but Id default the answer to yes because most switch games had frame rate issues or dynamic resolution Switch 2 will make those actually hit their targets instead of hovering 480p or dropping to 15fps etc,ml1a3k0,4.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml2matx,captain_dick_licker,,0,2025-04-02 19:08:10,,,,you can run whatever resoultion you want if you emulate them the resolution isnt locked into the fucking game they could absolutely just have a high res option baked into the system as an experimental feature,ml1a3k0,4.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1cbz5,UhhBirb,,-6,2025-04-02 15:24:57,,,,Switch 1 allowed games to change resolution when docked so it should be easily adapted Lots of big games on the switch 1 had frame drops due to bottlenecks from cpu or ram causing stutter But that should be eliminated with better hardware So we should expect smoother gameplay at least,ml1a3k0,4.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml1n052,Kryspo,,7,2025-04-02 16:18:17,,,,Theyre kind of right though in that its going to depend on the game and some games will need updates to uncap the fps Some games that need updates wont get them so theyll be capped at 30 despite having plenty of juice to increase the framerate Hopefully most end up working natively or through updates but the way some games are coded its not as simple as more power more frames,ml1cbz5,5.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml22uzc,element39,,3,2025-04-02 17:34:18,,,,I think what theyre saying is the games will more reliably hit a smooth 30fps cap compared to the current situation of technically a 30 fps cap but its a jittery 20fps max in handheld mode,ml1n052,6.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml3rj8b,Edmundyoulittle,,2,2025-04-02 22:30:58,,,,The rumored specs were between a PS4 and a PS4 pro Definitely not a marginal increase over the switch For reference Metroid prime 4 is listed at 4k 60 or 1080p 120 on switch 2 If its like other games it will be around 900p 60 on switch 1,ml26ajs,4.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml5o45q,Birneysdad,,2,2025-04-03 05:58:30,,,,Thats actually impressive and hard to believe coming from nintendo However Nintendo also has a policy concerning battery life and temperature and I cant help but think that theyre going to throttle it like crazy undocked This means third party games would still have to run with lowmid specs just to work undocked and the extra power would mostly be leveraged to upscale and improve smoothness rather than enabling highfidelity effects,ml3rj8b,5.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml6goif,Edmundyoulittle,,2,2025-04-03 10:50:14,,,,Yes I definitely think this will happen I think people are going to be surprised that performance and resolution will be quite high when docked when the reality is that devs are making games that have significantly less effects to accommodate handheld mode,ml5o45q,6.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml2n2zl,stdfan,,2,2025-04-02 19:12:00,,,,They also have a lot more expensive components in there You can run games at lower frame rates than the displays Hz count and still be a good experience It doesnt have to be a VRR display I wouldnt assume it is if they arent stating it is a 30 FPS game will just display the games frame 4 times in a row and the display will still be 120 hz Edit also My steam deck oled isnt a VRR display and you can change the HZ on it It just doesnt match the FPS of the game automatically like VRR does,ml2kjba,5.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml2r2gv,StrawHat89,,1,2025-04-02 19:31:16,,,,Oh theyre not selling it for a loss thats for sure considering that Japan only console that costs 100 dollars less The question is would people be willing to pay 600 dollars or more for one with an OLED screen because Nintendo would mark that up too I feel its a lot easier to sell people 600 phones because of the contract deals and the fact that it is also a phonemini tablet PC,ml2qh7e,8.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1l26o,MC_chrome,,16,2025-04-02 16:08:28,,,,Sony thought the PS3 would sell like gangbusters on its releaseuntil it didnt Nintendos major selling point for their consoles was that they were comparatively cheap when compared to the Xbox or PlayStation Now that theyre all the same price though We just have to wait and see if this new pricing strategy will work for Nintendo or not Im placing my chips on it blowing up in their faces in some fashion,ml1jlt0,6.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml1t6hq,Oops_I_Cracked,,5,2025-04-02 16:48:40,,,,What in the revisionist history is this At launch the PS3 was selling as fast as Sony could make them in no small part because it had a bluray drive that made it one of the best cheapest most feature complete and most future proof Bluray player you could buy Three years after lunch they released a stripped down PS3 slim at a reduced price It didnt have all of the original PS3 features including lacking the PS2 backwards compatibility but the prices on Bluray players had come down so at that point it was just gamers supporting the PS3,ml1l26o,7.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml6tia8,GingerTube,,1,2025-04-03 12:25:52,,,,No it doesnt It says Despite much weaker processing power and already previously competing with eighthgeneration consoles the Nintendo Switch has also been noted as a competitor to ninthgeneration consoles Thats definitely not the Switch is a 9th generation console Maybe read a little better before being a smart arse,ml6dz4e,14.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml6vlfx,HeldnarRommar,,0,2025-04-03 12:39:40,,,,You think a competitor to the 9th gen consoles means it isnt one Thats some bad reading comprehension,ml6tia8,15.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml6w755,GingerTube,,0,2025-04-03 12:43:28,,,,Just ignoring the fact that it was previously a competitor to the 8th gen then Making itan 8th gen console that wasnt replaced for years,ml6vlfx,16.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml6wlll,HeldnarRommar,,0,2025-04-03 12:45:59,,,,It competed with both gens but it is Nintendos ninth gen console How is this not hard to fucking understand Nintendo cant have release two eighth gen consoles unless their purposes were entirely different like the 3DS and Wii U The switch is the successor to BOTH which were BOTH 8th gen This is not hard to understand,ml6w755,17.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml6yec1,GingerTube,,0,2025-04-03 12:56:55,,,,You think Nintendo started the 9th gen of consoles with the Switch Pretty sure youre alone in that thinking mate How is the 3DS an 8th gen console Its a handheld The ninth generation of video game consoles began in November 2020 with the releases of Microsofts Xbox Series X and Series S console family and Sonys PlayStation 5 Wikipedia still thinks youre talking shit,ml6wlll,18.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml1yxxk,Specialist-Cake-9919,,1,2025-04-02 17:16:06,,,,It was arrogance on Sonys part after the success of the PS2 release a console during a financial boom and expect everyone to tip up for an ugly overpriced console Microsoft did the same after the success of the 360got cocky thought they could flog an also ugly overpriced media machine Sony learnt their lesson the hard way the PS3 only got going when they streamlined it made it into more of a pure gaming machine and managed to pull the irons out of the firewould we have had the amazing Ps4 gen if the PS3 flew out of the traps when it was released Who knows The future of both companies could have been very different,ml1l26o,7.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1o4bn,ThatLaloBoy,,18,2025-04-02 16:23:54,,,,Keep in mind Japans retail price will be 49980 or roughly 340 USD So its not like they are selling these at cost to the rest of the world especially with the rumor that theyre using older Nvdia Tegra chips Also this might be the first time Ive seen MSRP on a console with the disclaimer that pricing will vary depending on the retailer My guess is they are bracing for any price increases in the future,ml13sy3,3.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml22twp,flamingtoastjpn,,5,2025-04-02 17:34:09,,,,Yes but its important to understand that the yen is extremely weak right now Ive been importing from Japan for years and the mental math rule of thumb was typically 100 1 obviously today this doesnt hold true For the Japanese consumer that 49980 is going to feel a lot like 499 Companies like Nintendo are pricing lower in terms of USD in the Japanese market because the Japanese economy cant withstand higher prices Same as how games can be cheaper in South America Video game consoles are also low margin or sold at a loss to start so I wouldnt read too much into the pricing Electronics are expensive now its just the way it is,ml1o4bn,4.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml5c161,Saskatchewon,,2,2025-04-03 04:14:55,,,,The Steam Deck is aiming at a whole other audience though I love my Steam Deck but wholly hell it is nowhere as seamless as my Switch is Games seem to be given Steam Deck Verified at random Ive had many with it run badly constantly crashing while others without it work great You basically have to tinker with the graphics settings of every single game sometimes to a massive degree to get them running decently My TV often doesnt recognize it when its docked leaving me to unplug the HDMI cables and power cable in the dock a few times until it works It can be pretty finicky and ease of use isnt great for kids The Switch and Switch 2 Im sure is essentially plug and play Any AAA game you buy for it should work Menus UI is simple and easy to understand whether youre 8 or 80 If I handed my Steam Deck loaded up with a ton of games to my 70 year old mother and told her to start up a specific game shed have it sorted in 5 minutes or less Ask her to boot up a specific game on the Steam Deck Thats going to take a little longer without help And then you get all the Nintendo first party exclusives as well Literally take it in and out of the dock while youre playing a game and it just works seamlessly Not to mention that it essentially comes with two separate controllers built in and for 100 cheaper than the cheapest OLED Steam Deck I love my Steam Deck but I wouldnt recommend it over the Switch 2 for a family looking to buy something for their little kids or more casual gamers which is Nintendos core audience,ml183tg,4.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml2l8lf,Acceptable_Ad1685,,6,2025-04-02 19:02:52,,,,Its def nice that they are considering 1440p We are probably looking more at 720p upscaled and frame generation if not multi frame generation and even then games arent even going to hit 1440p 120 fps but it is kinda nice to have the option lol DLSS 3 and 4 do look really good these days Im guessing it will have some iteration of that baked in Just man I have a desktop running an i9 and a 4090 and I dont get 60 fps consistently at 4k on every game it seems so gimicky to note the output without examples from at least a few games and what they really run at and what scaling and frame gen techniques are used to get there,ml1omrq,5.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1ayyq,Realistic_Condition7,,53,2025-04-02 15:18:03,,,,When someone asks if a console game will run at 4k you can safely assume that means including upscaling which is extremely good technology these days I think moreso what OP is asking is if games will run at 4k in any sense When it comes to Metroid 4 thats not a great example because it appears to be a switch 1 title The question is will first party current gen games run at 4k60fps My guess is no They will probably have quality and performance modes like most modern games,ml15ufx,5.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml915uy,Xelynega,,1,2025-04-03 19:14:49,,,,When someone asks if a console game will run at 4k you can safely assume that means including upscaling Then the question is moot any game can run at any FPS with upscaling it just depends what the source quality is willing to degrade to Upscaling is a fixedcost perframe so the real question should be what source resolution can the game maintain 60fps at to upscale to 4k,ml1ayyq,6.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml9c44d,Realistic_Condition7,,1,2025-04-03 20:08:43,,,,I dont think this changes much of what I said for the average gamer The difference in scaling 1440p to 4k or 1290p to 4k etc are not differences significant enough for gamers to start bothering with asking that The general question people are asking is if their games are going to be in 4k and looking like 4k 999 of console gamers are not pixel watchers trying to see where the flaws of upscaling which on higher end software is basically nonexistent Theyre just asking if their games are gonna run in 4k in a general sense Also I dont think the variance in say 1440p4k vs like 1290p4k even on low end upscaling technology eg FSR is some massive difference to the average person that they need to educate themselves on which resolution is being upscaled from The type of upscaling software being used probably has a much larger effect than 1440p vs 1290 insert whatever numbers,ml915uy,7.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml2ieae,trapdave1017,,2,2025-04-02 18:48:51,,,,Again maybe for indie titles sure but for most modern games theyre going to most likely run at sub 1080p on the lowest possible settings to get it to run at 30fps Its basically a similar situation to the PS4 Pro where they advertise 4k but youre not actually getting 4k a majority of the time Where the switch 2 will benefit is because itll have dlss to upscale resolutions but i would imagine most modern games will run at 30fps,ml2fsmq,9.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml156nz,RangedTopConnoisseur,,47,2025-04-02 14:48:56,,,,Yeah the initial install base is extremely important for the continued success of a console in its life span theres no way they would have been able to give this thing an OLED panel while still making it cheap enough to be on everyones Christmas list without selling at a decent perunit loss Remember that the profit margins on the OLED switch are much thinner than the regular one despite being 50 bucks pricier,ml0vkck,2.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml6oge1,PsykCo3,,-1,2025-04-03 11:50:45,,,,The answer is outrage As usual This was not only expected but actually reasonable People on here just like to be upset The game pricing is only 10 more than expected so it is a lot less than inflation but no one seems to understand how any of this works Its a bitter pill but again not unreasonable We were paying 70 for n64 games in 95 Nintendo often releases GOTY titles and could charge 80 per game The games are STILL worth it imo Things cost money Find a better job work harder towards your goal andor vote someone in that isnt going to tariff the world Ive waited to finish ToTK as it was brutal at 25fps The what looks like 60 upgrade honestly brought a tear to my eye The only thing that held back the presentation was no new Mario but we cant always get what we want Apart from that it was stellar And this is coming from a pc gamerps5 who just bought a 5080 so will be catching up on pcvr and the rest for a while yet New Mario would have been an instant day 1 for me,ml5hn3b,4.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml8k2qt,ian095,,2,2025-04-03 17:50:11,,,,If youre rich enough buy a second and put it away to collect dust The most important and crucial thing about exploiting and modifying a console is to not update ever Games are sophisticated enough these days as well as OS hardware to detect these things and push the user without choice to update We got away with this on the switch because the models hackable had an unpatchable exploit We can just always use that backdoor one which doesnt exist in switchs in shops these days or the switch 2 most likely I was tempted to take this route of buying a spare but Im so poor I dont think Ill buy one at all but hey people usually discuss these things on gbatemp As soon as the first guy loads a basic hello world Ill seek and buy the model needed Theres plenty of people who buy a console then never use it enough for it to be updated You just have to beat the hype,ml2ai7g,1.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml8pekm,ian095,,1,2025-04-03 18:16:04,,,,Yes even if you hack your switch you have to update the firmware before launching titles that require higher firmware There are some games modified to play at lower firmware but Ive never tried it enough to know of it causes issues or not during playthroughs If its anything like say PS4 It might be youre locked to a firmware and cannot play games that surpass its firmware requirements Anyone who hacks the switch has it good Nintendo fumbled hard and it took only a year to be found with good documentation of the GPU used preexisting Sure it took over 4 years for the first piece of homebrew for the 3DS to appear For all we know it could be they somehow messed up and ones found fast Could be several years Unfortunately companies typically pay a lot for reported exploits to their devices which more often encourages those who hunt them to report them in the first hand A most recent exploit Ive heard of pardon me going off topic is the xbox360 via hijacking the hypervisor in a game This was reported but that console is so old Microsoft clearly dont care Honestly in this state of things Id recommend anyone just find a used switch thats exploitable over the switch 2 if they can handle games at lower res30fps If they truly want to go the route of antinintendo Nintendo seems to be making games for switch still for who knows how long Tomodachi for the switch comes out 2026 So we can expect generosity from them for the switch still and to not immediately abandon it in June To conclude to this though We wont have it as good as on the switch and even if something does appear down the line its likely going to be limited in its firmware and therefore titles that can be ran Even so I could be entirely wrong We may never get an exploit at all if not for several years For those who can afford it Put a console in the attic and cross your fingers that years from now someone finds an exploit Even so it does not mean immediate access to everything,ml8lh3d,3.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml8udr0,Arras01,,2,2025-04-03 18:40:58,,,,The problem with that is that youll be on version 10 and unable to upgrade to a specific version without owning a game containing that and any homebrew will likely be targeting a newer base In my experience youre likely better off by just using it and updating until theres some rumors about people finding security flaws that may lead to said homebrew Its also possible if somewhat unlikely that nothing gets found publicly,ml2ai7g,1.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml11142,frankchn,,6,2025-04-02 14:27:55,,,,I think the MSRP is probably the easiest thing to change about the system compared to hardware specs or even the packaging box art I dont think they mentioned any pricing on the launch livestream today either vs the OG Switch announcement where they stated the price in stream probably to preserve some flexibility I wouldnt be surprised if they were targeting 399 but raised it to 449 late in the process,ml0y786,6.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml5iie0,Saskatchewon,,0,2025-04-03 05:07:59,,,,and this is preTrump Tariffs Americans And announcing an MSRP of 450 might have given them some wiggle room for the tariffs that are expected to happen Trump literally announced a universal 10 tariff on all US trade partners today and that pushed what could have been a 400 MSRP up to 440 by itself Listing it at 450 now looks better than listing it at 400 and then having to bump it up last second because of new tariffs,ml12y5b,5.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml4xu8v,LeeMeReddit,,1,2025-04-03 02:36:18,,,,You misunderstood Im not saying the only reason it doesnt have an OLED display is to midgen refresh it Im saying its simply the easy refresh for them and to that point it is Supply constraint and scale will undoubtedly play some role yes the bigger factor is likely cost Nintendo doesnt sell their consoles at a loss Tossing in an OLED VRR display is going to affect price theres an almost zero percent chance Nintendo can get that device out the door for the 449 US MSRP unless theyre selling at a loss By the time 34 years rolls around which is on par for a midgen refresh not only will these displays likely have more than adequate supply theyll be significantly cheaper for Nintendo Which brings it back to its an easy midgen refresh Switch 1 OLED showed them that consumers will happily buy a product even if its lacking a feature they might want and then spend more to double dip or have those that didnt buy buy in for a larger cost when that one comes out,ml4th7g,5.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1393m,lunarpi,,3,2025-04-02 14:39:14,,,,I guess that makes sense The switch 2 will hardly push any of these handhelds out of the market though imo To me it really seems like 2 different user bases and the other handhelds serve a different purpose A lot of people want the Nintendo exclusives others want the freedom of nonexclusive software I dont see them replacing each other but filling these 2 different spaces Not to mention Nintendo products will sell millions no matter what to put it into perspective switch sold 150 million units and the deck sold 4 million units No one is replacing Nintendo and the switch 2 will not shrink the amount of people buying decks by much in my opinion Theyre different users,ml10pxh,5.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml16b7j,Manovsteele,,11,2025-04-02 14:54:34,,,,Honestly I dont think Nintendo cares about these as they are nowhere near as popular The Switch has sold on average 20m units a year 150 million since 2017 and the combined handheld PC market so Steam Deck ROG Ally and others was circa 15m last year,ml0r8pj,1.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml1yye0,Phoenix__Light,,2,2025-04-02 17:16:10,,,,Id argue that it needs to do both A big reason the switch was successful was because it could at least sorta get ports from current gen hardware onto it Look how the WiiU went without third party support,ml13b4j,8.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml0zwfa,VietOne,,-1,2025-04-02 14:22:11,,,,More like on between PS3 and PS4 its clear that the model polygon count is far lower than the base PS4 The Steam deck can do gaming and have discord open with multiple high resolution and 60fps videos there shouldnt be any reason the Switch 2 couldnt provide 30 or even 60 fps video feeds of theyre using an nVidia chip that already has built in decoders,ml0x36p,3.0,1jpolgt

comment,ml86cid,Dependent-Mode-3119,,1,2025-04-03 16:43:39,,,,I mean the switch is litterally getting the 20 cyberpunk DLC that was abandoned on ps4 for it not being performant enough to run it People dont understand how CPU constrained the PS4 was Yeah the gpu may have been better in raw power but the deck have a better CPU RAM Storage and much more modern architecture with the switch having DLSS,ml85crl,8.0,1jpolgt
comment,ml87ul3,VietOne,,1,2025-04-03 16:51:01,,,,Doesnt change the fact that its not running at PS4 levels Visually its far below even from the limited preview its clear its a lower fidelity version even with DLSS,ml86cid,9.0,1jpolgt
