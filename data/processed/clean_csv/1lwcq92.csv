comment,n2di7r2,RyuzkN,,1,2025-07-10 15:01:15,,,,Itll most likely never happen since theres neither a reason or a market for it ence why Samsung is also killing it I can understand them supporting stylus on the iPads since they have big screens which are good for both notes and drawing but thats really not the case on the iPhones That would also be a big Fuck you from Apple to Steve Jobs who really disliked them After all one of the main selling points of the first iPhone was not requiring a pen to use its screen,n2df5kq,2.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2d36ty,_turmoil,,10,2025-07-10 13:48:22,,,,They probably mean the entire display stack What theyre saying is that if the new one is componentwise the same as previous Folds then it probably has the same digitizer that recognizes SPen input and so removal of the actual SPen was made for commercial physical form factor reasons,n2d1wu4,1.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2h7u0n,gtedvgt,,5,2025-07-11 02:14:05,,,,Its not though the digitizer has been removed the ultra thin glass is thicker the internal are probably redesigned theres no reason for them to software lock this,n2d36ty,2.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2emakp,WisestAirBender,,-30,2025-07-10 18:05:56,,,,I very rarely digitally need to sign something And for that I use ilovepdf and an image of my signature Never tried annotating using a pen on my phone so cant say But now that Im not studying formally i dont think Ive had the need to digitally annotate something I live in a hot climate So gloves have never been an issue with any phone If my hands are greasy how is a pen going to help How do i hold the phone How do I get the pen out And wont I need to hold the pen too making that greasy Finer detail for what exactly Most apps are made with fingers in mind And if I mis touch i go back and touch again Im not trying to argue Im just listing down how your points dont really apply to me or I would assume many people The last phone I had was the Note 4 that had an s pen I really like the pen but to be honest I dont think its very useful for the vast majority of people,n2drnwi,4.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2emydh,cosmos7,,30,2025-07-10 18:09:01,,,,Finer detail for what exactly Most apps are made with fingers in mind On this one in particular there are plenty of IT emergencies where Im not near a computer and need to use my phone to remote into something to fix a problem Pen makes it much easier to use shrunkdown controls that arent designed with touch in mind,n2emakp,5.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2dv59e,tubbis9001,,18,2025-07-10 16:01:28,,,,Drawing cropping and annotating are obvious But its also got amazing practical uses too such as a remote camera shutter clicking tiny links on non mobile optimized websites using the phone with gloves on and many many more,n2dqj2p,3.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2e8qtb,tubbis9001,,16,2025-07-10 17:05:11,,,,I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say here Youve never had a mobile site not function properly and need to force the desktop site to get the link you want,n2e8bdx,5.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2eac0w,RandsFlute,,-13,2025-07-10 17:12:20,,,,Come on man if a website has not taken mobile devices into account you can just zoom in with your fingers if you cant zoom in then the links should be plenty of big because they did take mobile into account Like the only real reason you would want a pen is to draw stuff if you got one without that need then you are just coping for reasons I guess the other guy saying that using it with dirty hands may be applicable but honestly a dedicated rugged tablet would be a better device for that kind of environment,n2e8qtb,6.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2eavx1,tubbis9001,,15,2025-07-10 17:14:46,,,,An S pen is not for everyone and thats okay You dont NEED a pen but its a very nice quality of life feature for those of us that use it If you want a truly unique example you cant get with just a fingerit acts like a mouse cursor when hovered over the screen allowing mouseover functionality like drop down menus,n2eac0w,7.0,1lwcq92
comment,n33g2oi,Droidlivesmatter,,1,2025-07-14 15:54:21,,,,Its the same as headphone jacks and SD cards When more people moved away from them they stopped supporting it Samsung likely listened to the majority of their audience who haad Fold devices They wanted it thinner more durable screen Most people likely didnt use the S Pen on the fold anyway Like I have the S23U and I barely use the S Pen I use it here and there but honestly its faster to use voice to text other parts of the phone and hell Even a literal notepad with a pen because notes tend to be longer than what you can write on a little screen,n2eavx1,8.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2esnr9,Oniryuu,,4,2025-07-10 18:35:53,,,,I was eyeing the fold 7 to draw while on the bus to and from work bus is faster than driving and I would have to pay a lot of money to park downtown as there a waiting list for the company parking lot I have a S23 Ultra and while its okay for some doodles theres a long personal project I am working on thats detailed and finding it difficult with the screen size to get those details I was trying to avoid lugging my S9 Ultra tablet around but it looks like this is what I will have to do,n2dqj2p,3.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2gnbhn,None,,1,2025-07-11 00:14:33,,,,I use it to jot down notes constantly at work If I need a gate code or someone wants to give me a phone number its faster to pop out the pen and start writing on the locked screen than to unlock the phone and get to the dial pad or notes app to start typing Also super useful for DS and 3DS emulation Its not a feature I was looking for when I picked up the phone Hell I forgot it was even a thing while looking at phones in the store I noticed it when I got home and was looking it over I went with the S25U because of the sharper lines and smaller pinhole over the pixel series In the end I use it every day though,n2drt93,4.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2gf8mj,Zoe_Bulbs,,0,2025-07-10 23:28:46,,,,I use it a lot for translating copying text from photos drawing and taking photos Its very useful I dont think I will be able to live without It,n2dqj2p,3.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2dplcm,titeywitey,,43,2025-07-10 15:35:26,,,,I genuinely wonder how many people used the S Pen regularly on their FoldUltra Judging by the comments youd think a huge percentage I used a fold4 and loved the phone I used the pen once to try it out and never touched it again that I can recall,,0.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2e2yj7,GameBoiye,,27,2025-07-10 16:38:21,,,,Pretty sure thats why they got rid of it They can see in the data they get exactly how many people use it or use it once and never again When it was included in the phone it probably gets more use but when you have to buy it separateand get a bulky case to carry it Im sure the numbers are abysmal You could say they should keep it because the thought of it being there helps sell the phone but Im sure they looked at the numbers and saw 96 of people never used it,n2dplcm,1.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2ep2o3,ogpotato,,17,2025-07-10 18:18:54,,,,the problem is that the reason why the majority of users dont use the spen is because the fold did not come with a dedicated slot for the spen like the note series so youd have to carry that separately or buy a bulky case for the already bulky phone to carry that around So its kind of a selfinduced problem On the other hand adding a slot itself also adds to the size of the phone so I can see why Samsung did not add that to begin with I got the spen for my fold5 and after the first two weeks I forgot that I even had it because it was just sitting in a drawer But back when I had a note Id always use it because it was readily available to me,n2e2yj7,2.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2h8jnd,gtedvgt,,3,2025-07-11 02:18:18,,,,Leaks are aaying they might phase out the s pen on their non foldable phones soon too and the note series got canned and merged into the s series before that While I would love for it to stay its sadly clear that the number of people who use it is so low that samsung is willing to ditch it without fear of too much backlash,n2ep2o3,3.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2l0pcf,foreign_malakologos,,1,2025-07-11 17:19:18,,,,There should be relatively compact cases for the Fold5 that store the pen without getting too bulky I managed to find a thirdparty case for my Fold 4 that allows me to store the Fold5 pen which is much more compact than the Spen they sold with the Fold4 My phone felt like new that way highly recommend it Now I really hope it holds out for at least another year,n2ep2o3,3.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2exsq9,psychocopter,,2,2025-07-10 19:00:17,,,,When I had a note I used the s pen a bunch for mock ups of projects or quick notes I wanted to write down Almost daily I would use it to just record a small note whether that was a shopping list lyrics to a song on the radio in a store to look up later or plansappointments so I didnt forget them I still occasionally miss it now that I have a different phone but its not as much of a deal breaker as removing the audio jack and expandable storage,n2e2yj7,2.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2f68vh,the_wyandotte,,9,2025-07-10 19:40:59,,,,On the Fold I almost never used it because it didnt have a slot to fit right into and the pen was rather bulky besides On the 24 Ultra I use it constantly I imagine its like most other tech things the people that dont use a feature are the majority and never have and never will the people that do use it are vocal and its a necessary or critical part of their workflow Im not even upgrading to the 25 Ultra because I use the Bluetooth part of my Spen approximately 250x a day controlling camera,n2dplcm,1.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2eoplb,theninal,,5,2025-07-10 18:17:12,,,,Its going to be a bummer moving forward for me since I use the pen every day Using an Ultra as a work phone so Im constantly taking notes and annotating photos for changes my crews need to make in the field Having a phablet in the future was something I looked forward to because the workflow has been great but now I have no desire to get a Fold,n2dplcm,1.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2kzeg0,foreign_malakologos,,1,2025-07-11 17:13:20,,,,Im using the pen to take notes on pdfs and sometimes when following presentations lectures etc Also for shopping lists although for that it would be more comfortable if they activated the front screen for pen input as well Ive got the Galaxy Fold 4 I find the original spen for that one a but bulky so was happy around the end of last year to find out that the Fold 5 pen also works on it and I also found a thirdparty case to actually have it on me all the time Not using it daily but I see no reason to buy a folding phone without pen input So I guess for now its bye bye Samsung unless they come to their senses next year The Honor V5 supposedly supports pen input on the front screen so that might be a decent option to consider Unfortunately it appears to be hardexpensive to get the pen for Honors folding phones,n2dplcm,1.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2ql6uh,The8Darkness,,1,2025-07-12 15:06:12,,,,Its actually quite convenient when you have a galaxy book with pen support The book pen is quite big so you either have extra prockets ti put it or leave it at home Here you can just take the smartphone spen,n2dplcm,1.0,1lwcq92

comment,n2pz0lr,Jankyfumunda,,1,2025-07-12 12:58:29,,,,Kind of a travesty they are slowly getting rid of the S Pen across all phones now Its one of those things that made them unique I get its a niche thing and I am one of those avid users of the spen and its Bluetooth functionality In fact i am writing this with my spen Its the main reason I went with an S24U over the S25U but in the same breath if you are paying a premium price for a device they shouldnt be removing useful hardware and support and if they do it should be replaced with something more useful and powerful I cant imagine the bluetooth spen costs all that much to manufacture and implement either Especially since they have been doing it for over 10 years,,0.0,1lwcq92
comment,n2qg49x,enlightened84,,1,2025-07-12 14:39:14,,,,How are people surprised by this The Fold SE was literally the test bed for the Fold 7 It was launched in only two markets but it didnt launch in a vacuum As soon as it sold like hot cakes with no S Pen support it was game over for support on the Fold 7,,0.0,1lwcq92
