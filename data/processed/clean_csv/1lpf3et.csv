comment,n0v4y5w,EbonBehelit,,202,2025-07-02 01:15:39,,,,People were skeptical about the Switch when it initially launched and its predecessor the Wii U was one of the worst commercial failures in Nintendos history Its not _that_ surprising,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vutum,quotesforlosers,,65,2025-07-02 03:54:43,,,,I dont remember anyone being skeptical about the first switch I thought the consensus was that it was really ingenious,n0v4y5w,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0w93ln,Suspicious_Owl_5740,,41,2025-07-02 05:46:12,,,,At first lots of people were saying like whats the point but then Steam and sony is now following Nintendos footsteps in handhelds,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wcmwd,quotesforlosers,,18,2025-07-02 06:17:28,,,,Not saying it didnt happen but this is all news to me Maybe its an age thing because I thought young kids their parents and established adults loved the initial thought of being able to game on the go without loss of graphical performance,n0w93ln,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wdsyn,unripenedfruit,,5,2025-07-02 06:28:06,,,,being able to game on the go without loss of graphical performance I mean thats not exactly true Docked performance is higher than handheld mode Regardless I dont know how much scepticism existed at the launch of the original switch but I can understand if there was at least some And understandably less with the switch 2 after it proved to be incredibly successful when the switchs predecessor was ultimately a flop,n0wcmwd,5.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0y4iz4,APRobertsVII,,2,2025-07-02 14:22:37,,,,I remember some of that being discussed but I dont think it was as common as some people remember As someone who has always preferred handhelds the love was ingenious to me Switch 1 sold nearly 3 million in its first month which was at or near record levels for the time so it obviously wasnt so controversial as to impact sales out of gate,n0w93ln,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wlehd,mschuster91,,-3,2025-07-02 07:39:45,,,,and sony is now following Nintendos footsteps in handhelds If anything its the other way around remember the PlayStation Portable The Switch is a carbon copy off of that concept just with fancier controllers and better battery life,n0w93ln,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wry07,Tecnoguy1,,3,2025-07-02 08:44:52,,,,PSP wasnt a hybrid it was taking notes from the Nintendo DS The Wii U definitely took some features from the PSVita though as that could be a PS3 controller as well as a console,n0wlehd,5.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0wkjc9,JamesHeckfield,,6,2025-07-02 07:31:13,,,,Zelda was the killer app for switch I played that game for months A brand new first of its kind open world Zelda and you can play it on the go or on your TV I didnt even use the dock for like the first month I was so blown away by the game on handheld No there wasnt a ton of compelling software right out of the gate There was more than enough however to sell people on the concept,n0whfss,5.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0zo0fo,baldeagle1991,,1,2025-07-02 18:45:44,,,,Tbh even then it was a port of a Wii U game What Switch only games were even out on release,n0wkjc9,6.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0ztbje,JamesHeckfield,,1,2025-07-02 19:12:12,,,,None that I can think of In hindsight this was a good thing They didnt rush out any games to meet a launch window 3DS didnt have much in their launch window either Both were launched in spring so it can be seen as a soft launch And a lot of folks skipped the Wii U so they never played Mario Kart 8 BOTW is an exceptional case here it was developed for Wii U like you said But the Wii U version is an afterthought It wasnt like the it came out for switch a year after release For all intents and purposes BOTW is a Switch game,n0zo0fo,7.0,1lpf3et
comment,n12ecqm,DaCody_98,,1,2025-07-03 03:35:23,,,,No one tell them that the switch literally uses WiiU emulation for BOTW,n0ztbje,8.0,1lpf3et
comment,n12miha,JamesHeckfield,,1,2025-07-03 04:33:23,,,,No one cares about the Wii U I had one At launch You can go on and on about technicalities but its a switch title,n12ecqm,9.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0yho47,bluedestiny88,,3,2025-07-02 15:25:17,,,,While I wont argue against the weak launch lineup as a whole Breath of the Wild was a unprecedented and monumental achievement in terms of what it did for the Switchs future BOTW had an attach rate of over 100 meaning the games Switch version sold more in its initial sales period than the total number of Switch consoles sold in the same timeframe People were buying the game even if they didnt have a Switch to play it on,n0whfss,5.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0xnh9l,Ganon_Cubana,,3,2025-07-02 12:51:34,,,,To be fair people are pretty meh on the lineup of switch 2,n0vvzsn,4.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0wvufw,Lusankya,,6,2025-07-02 09:23:18,,,,In retrospect yeah Before it happened not so much A system trying to play console quality on the go was still a big risk and Nintendo wasnt exactly known for portable graphical fidelity with the 3DS A lot of critics thought we were going to get a mid tier mobile phones worth of gaming experience stuck to some uncomfortable controllers and an hour of battery under realworld conditions S1 was the only Nintendo console I didnt preorder during my adult life I wasnt convinced itd pan out Instead I wound up stalking websites chasing the restocks once BotW made it clear that they had a winner on their hands,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n132ol8,quotesforlosers,,1,2025-07-03 06:48:59,,,,I was the opposite It was the first Nintendo console I purchased since the N64 Seeing all of these contrasting opinions about launch makes me think we were just in different marketing categoriesplaces in our lives at the time,n0wvufw,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0x2n2h,Programmdude,,1,2025-07-02 10:25:50,,,,I mean its still not console quality assuming graphics The switch 1 was a far cry from ps4xbone graphics and is closer to a high end 2017 phones graphics Its certainly far closer to dedicated console graphicsperformance than the previous portable console attempts and its got enough performance that you can actually port games to it without much loss in qualityfeatures,n0wvufw,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n11es82,Spider-Mike23,,2,2025-07-03 00:08:30,,,,I remember them being sought after and demanded like mad and everyone was popping up with one Switch 2 I havent seen any discourse online for them meet high demand immediately nor have I have even seen one people with one actually Its weird,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0ykk4h,hyperforms9988,,1,2025-07-02 15:38:35,,,,I dont know that everybody was fully confident that the Switch wasnt going to bomb the same way the Wii U did I certainly didnt rush out to get one after I got stung by having purchased a Wii U I think I waited maybe a year or two before I bought the Switch The Wii Us issue was partly software You werent going to know how the Switch software support was going to pan out just from its launch Not long after its launch they started having slam dunks for Nintendo Directs showing all the new upcoming software they were coming out with at the time and I feel like thats when things really started to snowball and the last assurance was out there for people that yeah theyre working on some good shit and theyre going to be keeping us busy for a while Ironically the failure of the Wii U was a blessing in disguise because that opened up a ton of opportunity for Switch ports of the better Wii U games that relatively nobody played because they didnt buy the Wii U so Nintendo at one point was pumping shit out between regular releases and ports and it made the Switch look very attractive for a lot of people They dont have the same luxury for the Switch 2 Its backwards compatible they got all those ports out of their system from the Wii U and its much more capable in hardware so its going to be a little weirder in terms of software support this time around at least in theory anyway,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n10oz2q,sentient-sloth,,1,2025-07-02 21:48:33,,,,I recall a fair amount of skepticism especially amongst Nintendo fans The Wii U left a bad taste in peoples mouth I had a Wii U and was mostly unimpressed with its lineup of exclusives It was about 23 years before the Switch library was deep enough that I was willing to buy one Doesnt mean it was all bad though there was a lot of hype behind it too and it was sold out for a while after release but once stock became readily available it took a few years to really get going,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n11kvzj,LoudAndCuddly,,1,2025-07-03 00:41:38,,,,Its was novel some of the first promos ads were a bit cheesy and unrealistic,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0w2pf8,mediocre-referee,,-2,2025-07-02 04:53:20,,,,With gamers yes Casuals didnt know what the Switch was yet by April 2017,n0vutum,3.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0wpz2z,THExPILLOx,,4,2025-07-02 08:25:06,,,,Honestly if it didnt have the backwards compatibility I dont think it would sell nearly as well as it has Knowing that I already owned 30 games for it definitely made it more appealing,n0v4y5w,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0xqu8f,Rybread52,,4,2025-07-02 13:10:52,,,,The Switch also didnt have nearly as many units in stock at launch It was sold out for pretty much the first several months,n0v4y5w,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0v5wkw,Lankpants,,30,2025-07-02 01:21:19,,,,Im not surprised about either The main constraints on S1 sales was supply Its still the main constraints on S2 sales but the difference in total supply between the two is huge,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0v7jhu,fire2day,,13,2025-07-02 01:31:05,,,,The switch was popular at launch but even then it was nowhere near pandemic Animal Crossing popular,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0uzjhv,Rixien,,22,2025-07-02 00:43:38,,,,I wasnt following Nintendo too closely around then never got a Wii U and only kept my 3DS for Pokemon but ended up getting the Switch for Christmas later that year I think or at least was under the impression back in the day that a lot more people assumed the Switch was gonna be the actual end of Nintendo following the Wii Us performance until it came out and people started seeing it in the wild,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vb0sw,Coliosis,,4,2025-07-02 01:51:15,,,,Same boat funnily enough what actually got me to buy a switch was Tetris 99 It just scratched an itch I didnt know I had and hooked me instantly lmao Im not looking forward to the day they shut down those servers,n0uzjhv,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vajb2,pitterpatter0910,,4,2025-07-02 01:48:29,,,,Whats the competition to the switch Genuine question I have no idea,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vh3xm,Tankninja1,,10,2025-07-02 02:26:27,,,,Steam Deck and some of the other handhelds think Asus and Lenovo make along with other even smaller brands Some of these dont technically play Nintendo games but yarrrr PS5 and Xbox are also technically competitors in the console space Maybe debatable since they arent portable but there are a lot of really popular games with cross play,n0vajb2,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0w4dj5,Blanche_Cyan,,5,2025-07-02 05:06:42,,,,Can those even be considered actual competition Like at best they are competition in the same way the first trainer of the first route in a Pokemon game is competition I will give them the benefit of doubt and wont say they only have bug types,n0vh3xm,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wbjq2,TaiyoT,,-2,2025-07-02 06:07:40,,,,from a marketing stance No not really from a hardware stance Yes It serves the same purpose as a switch 2 would Portable gaming If people do choose between owning a handheld pc over a switch 2 then it kinda is All competition has to start somewhere edit to reference pokemon theyre like a trainer hiding in a cave thats quite powerful and actually a challenge but nobody knows theyre there,n0w4dj5,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wiiqv,Bdr1983,,3,2025-07-02 07:11:44,,,,Nintendo lives in a separate space from those The Nintendo IP is so strong that people will buy their consoles simply for the Mario Zelda and Pokemon franchises While other console makers have focussed on realism graphics etc Nintendo has stuck to their idea of making good games and putting graphics and all that in second place While I can enjoy the graphical orgasms of the newer consoles and AAA titles on PC if a game is not enjoyable to play no graphics onslaught can make it a good game to me Ive always enjoyed Nintendo games though,n0vh3xm,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vhodj,pitterpatter0910,,2,2025-07-02 02:29:48,,,,Are the first ones you listed also consoles or is switch the only thing that does both,n0vh3xm,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vvbo6,TaiyoT,,6,2025-07-02 03:58:10,,,,Theyre technically handheld gaming PCs so you can plug them into any monitor or tv with hdmi and bluetooth any controller or keyboard like you would with a computer,n0vhodj,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n10cwv5,Realistic_Condition7,,1,2025-07-02 20:48:46,,,,I mean in a broader sense it would be the other consoles Nintendo is putting their innovation and exclusivity up against other consoles power and exclusivity Could say that handheld PCs compete with them in the portability space but thats still a massive difference in game library As long as they have Mario and Zelda nobody will really directly compete with them in the way maybe that Xbox and PlayStation compete,n0vajb2,2.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vk1ex,Unfair-Banana-1505,,6,2025-07-02 02:43:59,,,,Yeah Nintendo is the king of the console market and thats not changing anytime soon,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0vhbby,Willyscoiote,,1,2025-07-02 02:27:39,,,,Everyone of my friends wanted a Switch 1 in my country The only issue was that Nintendo wasnt selling it here so people had to import one after stocks normalized,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0wcqta,NoobensMcarthur,,1,2025-07-02 06:18:27,,,,There was only one game worth playing when the Switch launched hot off the heels of the colossal failure of the WiiU Switch 2 not only benefits from the Switchs success but it got the advantage to launch with a lifetime worth of games to play,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0xrij4,qualitypi,,1,2025-07-02 13:14:40,,,,Why Switch is a proven concept now and theres a hell of a lot more confidence in the platform both from consumers and partners,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0xxmf3,AthearCaex,,1,2025-07-02 13:47:51,,,,Switch 1 had very few units available on launch and Nintendo scrambled afterwards to meet demand Nintendo prepared for this launch and has been producing units for over 6 months which is why there was so many leaks They have likely 10million units out there that they can sell when for the switch 1 it was likely around 3 million At the pace nintendo is going if they keep up production they could hit 30mil units in a year which is impressive but I do feel like this system could plateau quickly with sales as everyone who wants one might already have one or at least has access to them but we shall see once winter hits to see if people are still rushing out to buy them,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0yn0fg,lyons_vibes,,1,2025-07-02 15:49:48,,,,friendly reminder nintendo considers all shipped units as sales meaning those bulk orders walmart target gamestop etc place are considered sales whereas sony and other competitors count sales as units actually being sold to customers from any retailer,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0zk359,lyons_vibes,,1,2025-07-02 18:26:13,,,,typically sales numbers are used to represent how popular a product is based on how many consumers buy the product at the register by including these wholesale orders from walmart target gamestop its into their units sold numbers artificially inflates the sales numbers to make it look like the product is more popular among consumers than it actually is nintendo can take these numbers to investors and pretend their console is selling more than it actually among consumers classic ryan howard move,n0yze2h,3.0,1lpf3et
comment,n0zrff3,Tankninja1,,1,2025-07-02 19:02:38,,,,Unit sales isnt the only metric Nintendo uses to measure their sales and growth as a company not even really their leading statistic they show investors Page 1 of their annual report is all Net Sales and various Operating Profits in billion of yen or And again the units have been sold Nintendo already made all the money theyre going to make on the console when they sold it to Walmart The important statistic for Nintendo is that retailers keep ordering,n0zk359,4.0,1lpf3et
comment,n10bpiw,Realistic_Condition7,,1,2025-07-02 20:42:59,,,,Feels like the PS1PS2 PS1 took the world by storm and then PlayStation didnt try to pull any punches just put out a next generation system with a 2 on the end of it and people went bananas Switch finally taking a page out of PlayStations book rather than its ownXboxs with goofy naming conventions and deviations from what made their previous device successful,n0ux8ip,1.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0uzr6y,Scorpio989,,11,2025-07-02 00:44:55,,,,Its a combination of a lot of reasons but I think its mostly that Nintendo products are just more practical for Japanese Many people are just too busy to commit to hardcore games A lot of people spend hours every day traveling by train and then a majority of their free time is still at workschool They simply dont have the time or space to enjoy a Playstation,n0ux9b3,2.0,1lpf3et

comment,n0un8l7,wirelessfingers,,-2,2025-07-01 23:31:58,,,,Waiting for an entire console generation or cpu generation is not the same as waiting a couple months for christmas Ultimately if the value is there for you then good for you I think the price of being locked into all the new stuff is not worth the premium youre paying in experience and cost For console launches you just have to look at the 360 with its serious hardware issues Nintendo games do better than most but its not hard to find examples of their games being released in unfinished states I cant remember where I heard it but someone said that most of their enjoyment in movies and games comes from discussing them online In that case the newness of the experience is worth a lot to you and I cant argue anything against that,n0ukkox,4.0,1lpf3et

comment,n13foca,Yellowspawn,,0,2025-07-03 08:53:59,,,,PS5 is already 800 in my country switch 2 being only around 500 is actually super cheap here so never really understood the uproar for the console price I mean sure its alot but so are the other consoles Although did order it from another country because it was even cheaper there On top of that theres already been 90 games not collectors editions or anything just the base games on PS store for a while now so nintendo diddoes not set this standard either So the price inreases have been a problem for a while now nintendo did not create this problem they just joined in on it becoming a part of the problem People have been buying games for outrageous prices for a while already Welcome to 2025,n0udrzs,1.0,1lpf3et
