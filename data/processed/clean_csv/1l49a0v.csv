comment,mwasst7,Nephyness,,10,2025-06-06 11:39:57,,,,Agreedwhen I opened my Switch 2 I was so surprised that the screed was facing the front part of the box and without any decent protection,mwagg4r,4.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwbgd76,Legitimate-BurnerAcc,,1,2025-06-06 14:00:25,,,,The fact that not one customer caught the staple in the box before leaving the store is also a testimony that most people wouldnt think of their Nintendo switch screen being centimeters away from the elements,mwb4uhv,15.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwct33z,bobfrankly,,4,2025-06-06 17:55:08,,,,Since when does being new or not affect if something is a good practice or not My last few smartphones have come packaged in thin packaging but by design they spaced the outer shell of the package a respectable distance much more than a staple away from the product within Bad packaging practice is bad packaging practice regardless of how long its been going on,mwbw94v,7.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwbfh7y,TheCoolOnesGotTaken,,1,2025-06-06 13:55:47,,,,Right the real money is in accessories when it comes to stuff like this In the 90s I worked for Wolf camera and Ritz and cameras were like 2 margin but straps and camera bags were like 60 The same model hold true with electronics today that case those rubber thumb stick pads the screen protector irony here you grab at the same time is where the store is paying its rent,mw9zhlg,9.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw9lpx0,geoelectric,,5,2025-06-06 05:07:13,,,,Sure that makes sense though Id argue its 500 again when you add in the opportunity cost of not selling the replacement unit But its definitely not 100k per the comment I replied to,mw9in5r,6.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwa15cp,Buuhhu,,3,2025-06-06 07:25:59,,,,The worst part is if they already sold their stock you now need to wait for the restock to get the replacement A lot of people who buy day one really wanted to play day oneover the weekend but now cant I feel for them cause this just sucks unless ofc that they allow you to keep it till the replacement arrives,mw76ktz,2.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwn5xpb,migsmog,,1,2025-06-08 12:00:24,,,,Offering is still appropriate to use because its not like they are automatically issuing replacements to everyone whose screen was damaged You have to come forward as a victim and go through whatever replacement processincluding bringing back the original unit For whatever reason not everyone who was affected will necessarily take part,mwaeixl,3.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw7ba2u,Sky_Rose4,,116,2025-06-05 20:49:35,,,,They didnt use tape because it wouldnt stick due to the high temperature and the store AC not working so they stapled them to boxes still not okay as they still could have stapled to GameStop bags but I do feel bad for them being forced to work on a hot day without proper cooling Source,mw74qo4,1.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw7cddx,Will2LiveFading,,55,2025-06-05 20:54:50,,,,How hot does it have to be for tape to not work Seems like the store should have been closed to begin with,mw7ba2u,2.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw7d96j,Sky_Rose4,,30,2025-06-05 20:59:04,,,,Corporate sometimes takes forever to fix anything store related coming from someone who works in retail I remember a week after Christmas a few of the lights in the Walmart parking lot I work at went out when it was dark out you could only see the headlights of the other cars putting cart pushers in even more danger they didnt fix the lights until around MarchApril maybe its a similar situation where they know the conditions but just taking forever to do anything,mw7cddx,3.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw8m2rl,DonJuanEstevan,,11,2025-06-06 01:11:53,,,,It was probably the higher humidity inside the store from the AC not working causing the tape to lose its adhesion more so than the high heat Gorilla tape is really weak to moisture One extremely humid but fair temperature night in Florida I had a roll lose its adhesion the second the sticky side was exposed to air,mw7cddx,3.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw9vmm6,fuqdisshite,,7,2025-06-06 06:33:26,,,,giving me PTSD i was in the ICU for an extended stay a few years ago and it was 80 on the ward my home is usually between 68 and 70 the tape they use to hold the IVs in wouldnt adhere quite literally had a six pack of IVs slide out of my neck in the middle of the first night they ended up having to wrap my head like a mummy until AM nurses came in and we could figure it out my night nurse found me a portable air conditioner and made sure no one took it when i was asleep i had to keep the hose in the sheets with me and by my face when i slept man it is weird the shit that will just flood your memories,mw8m2rl,4.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw91jn5,Murph-Dog,,17,2025-06-06 02:46:45,,,,If youre gonna staple staple into the corneredge of the box But for all GameStop knows you want a pristine inbox Switch 2 to sell as a collectors item 50 years from now and they done stabbed it I hate even the tape Receipt that Best Buy puts on pickup items,mw7ba2u,2.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw9vvuc,fuqdisshite,,3,2025-06-06 06:35:49,,,,i just sold one each of the boxes for the mini consoles that came out a few years ago the NES SNES PlayStation and Genesis boxes and all the original guts no consoles for all four boxes as a lot i got 100usd just for the boxes,mw91jn5,3.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw8ki3t,RhetoricalOrator,,9,2025-06-06 01:02:28,,,,A lot of people also consider the box as much of a collectible as anything else If I were a collector Id be pretty displeased having it messed up right off the bat A know its slight but slight imperfections can seriously affect value later on I inherited the first issue of playboy which featured Marilyn Monroe It was almost in mint condition A small amount of rust on the spine side of a staple kept it from grading that high and knocked a lot of money off the value It was a speck the size of a period I know thats not the same as a console box but just saying it was a dumb move in every way Management had plenty of options other than staples,mw7ba2u,2.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw9liia,tlst9999,,2,2025-06-06 05:05:31,,,,A lot of people also consider the box as much of a collectible speculation vehicle as anything else A know its slight but slight imperfections can seriously affect value later on,mw8ki3t,3.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw7gyfo,Blunderhorse,,33,2025-06-05 21:17:11,,,,The packaging was enough to get them safely from Taiwan to Staten Island and there wasnt a problem until someone decided to deliberately puncture the packaging with a sharp piece of metal,mw76yas,2.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw7vyu5,Blunderhorse,,15,2025-06-05 22:37:08,,,,Obviously they shipped in large containers likely shrink wrapped on pallets and the box was sufficient protection to handle the stacking loading and unloading process Again the protection was sufficient until someone decided to jam a sharp metal object into the box Adding more protection for a retailers potential terrible decision would have resulted in fewer units per container and a higher price for everyone,mw7huzy,4.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw8lof7,PropaneSalesTx,,3,2025-06-06 01:09:28,,,,To add they were most likely packed in boxes of 612 to be palletized Adding more but not much protection,mw7vyu5,5.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw7nt84,-popgoes,,11,2025-06-05 21:52:04,,,,How were they supposed to know that anything needed to be improved if over 100000000 Switches were shipped without this issue There is obviously no incentive to change what was considered completely adequate packaging,mw7cr7v,4.0,1l49a0v
comment,mw7o2f4,Denimcurtain,,11,2025-06-05 21:53:24,,,,Spending more on packaging to avoid someone stapling your product is dumb from a business perspective This way neither the customer nor Nintendo pays more than necessary Would you want to pay an extra 5 bucks when you dont get any benefit for it Similar concept Dont worry about the amount,mw7cr7v,4.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw9anhm,Denimcurtain,,2,2025-06-06 03:44:22,,,,Depends It honestly might increase sales as is which could affect the price more than youd think This isnt really Nintendo specific packaging and its possible that they end up with more money due to Gamestop needing to restock Doesnt really matter Point is that theres not really any upside from a business point of view to follow your advice,mw9ab0a,6.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwb081j,Danzego,,5,2025-06-06 12:29:26,,,,How many times have you heard of this being a problem in the past 8 years Because Nintendo have been using this exact same packing on the Switch 1 for that long It doesnt seem to be a problem as long as you dont do something stupid like punch metal staples through the face of the box directly into the screen But somehow its all Nintendos fault,mw9v71b,2.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwb96tj,Danzego,,1,2025-06-06 13:21:49,,,,Everyone knows that except for that GameStops employees apparently If the low tack tape wasnt working and they were indeed as worried about damaging boxes as you suggest they could have switched to scotch tape instead which they certainly have in store or at least able to get nearby with little effort instead of punching holes in the box with metal staples I dont think theyre as smart as youre giving them credit for,mwahyf7,4.0,1l49a0v
comment,mwazc3r,Danzego,,1,2025-06-06 12:23:48,,,,Ok let me get your scenario straight they were so mindful that they decided to use painters tape to avoid damage to the box the low tack tape wasnt working so they went right to punching holes in the face of the box with a stapler Do you work at GameStop,mwahyf7,4.0,1l49a0v

comment,mw7pcao,Denimcurtain,,11,2025-06-05 22:00:08,,,,Packaging design would probably endorse the idea since theyre job IS handinhand with marketing This probably doesnt cost Nintendo anything and the other comment just pointed out that this is the trend Gamestop has to deal with its customers unhappiness and probably any associated costs The consumer and Nintendo likely wont be impacted financially,mw7iwlj,3.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwc5hj3,Jirekianu,,1,2025-06-06 16:02:21,,,,Honestly the ones really at fault are whatever idiots designed the packaging You have a six sided box where four of those have virtually no impact resistance Sure stapling receipts to boxes is stupid but thats far outweighed by the fundamental errors of the packaging design Three sides are right up against the main body With only a thin subquarter inch piece of cardboard to act as cushioning While the fourth side is the one flush to the fucking SCREEN,,0.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwegp9y,Danzego,,1,2025-06-06 23:08:11,,,,Once Probably not A few times maybe A bunch of times because the packaging is creating a legitimate outstanding problem Definitely And thats exactly the point If it was a big enough problem it would have already been highlighted in a bad PR way But it hasnt So thinkwhat does that tell you,mweg1jd,3.0,1l49a0v

comment,mwgfacz,Jirekianu,,0,2025-06-07 07:43:43,,,,because youre not hearing about a problem it isnt a problem Do Do you not realize how ridiculous that sounds Thats effectively what youre arguing here If someone is smoking next to a leaky propane tank I dont have to wait for there to be a multifatality explosion to realize thats a bad fucking idea Obviously this isnt quite that level of incompetent stupidity But dropping this box from 34 feet up on 4 out of its 6 sides has a solid chance of causing damage to the console Thats garbage design man Much more durable components for other things are packaged with more crush allowance to prevent there being a problem Any kind of shipping of these things outside of a nonpalatized method is a recipe for losses in transit,mwe9rvb,2.0,1l49a0v
comment,mwh7goc,Danzego,,1,2025-06-07 12:10:05,,,,Yes lets talk about ridiculous You think thats ridiculous Whats even more ridiculous is the counterstance complaining about a problem that doesnt exist just so you can rage on the internet If there WAS a problem you think it wouldnt have come out already over the last eight years This thread proves that argument This is ONE STORE on ONE NIGHT and it got around within hours of it occurring with major gaming news sites like IGN covering it If any substantial problem existed with the packaging we would have heard about it But no it hasnt happened and the Switch packaging is fine Despite that people need to complain like it has happened so they can have a made up problem and have nerd rage Now THATS ridiculous FINALLY lets talk about losses during nonpalatized transit This is actually perfect timing I had my last Switch 2 arrive yesterday direct from Nintendo I bought multiple for family and a coupe for friends who couldnt get preorders Whoever packed the box packed it with the system face down toward the bottom with no cushion below my GC controller on top of that and air pillow whatever theyre called packing on top of that The bottom of the box clearly had incurred some impact because it was pushed in a bit That worried me As I unpacked the box I couldnt believe their warehouse workers would put the system on the bottom face down That absolutely IS a problem But despite that guess what arrived in perfect condition Yes the Switch 2 is just fine CLEARLY there is no issue with the packaging and Ill take my experience as proof I did examine the box carefully and noticed that the system doesnt sit quite flush with the lid It actually does have a bit of room between the lid and the screen But hey that must all be nonsense Believe what you want to believe but after that experience yesterday and no outstanding issues over the last 8 years Ill believe realitynot angry dorks with some weird antiNintendo vendetta posting online,mwgfacz,3.0,1l49a0v
