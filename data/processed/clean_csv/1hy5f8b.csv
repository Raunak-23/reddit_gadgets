comment,m6o83a3,danceswithtree,,12,2025-01-12 01:22:17,,,,Took out can mean taken out of commission The plane was damaged and needs to be repaired before it can used to put back in service Edit take out can mean so many things in different contexts For example taken out on a date taken out like by an assassin or an angry hockey player food can be taken out from a restaurant Wording was perhaps a bit vague but far from misleading,m6gi0zq,2.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6jix0x,ornryactor,,2,2025-01-11 06:55:50,,,,What does this mean I dont know anything about drone ownership so it seems incredible that a tanker could smack into a hobbyist drone which I assume gets nearly vaporized into a bazillion bits and have to go land at an airport then the crew talks their superiors who then tell CalFire executives who then tell the FAA and by now surely its hours later if not days so how the heck do they track the drone pilot down,m6hy60d,3.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6k6l5g,EverLiving_night,,2,2025-01-11 11:08:35,,,,I feel like its more an evolution of that People are taking the anonymity of the internet and its often lack of consequences And are applying it to real life where they actually are getting away with it Minimal jail time just being released onto the street again getting Rewarded with 100s of thousands of views and taking troll comments seriously,m6ip8t6,6.0,1hy5f8b
comment,m6kl3rn,Immersi0nn,,2,2025-01-11 13:19:34,,,,Aye generally its rather true that being a fuckwad is rewarded in society Pushback is rare due to people not wanting to get involvednot wanting conflict or being unable to process conflict This results in fuckwads thinking their behavior is just fine since they rarely get pushback and any pushback is perceived through the lens of Ive done this 20 times and this is the first time anyone has had a problem with it they must be wrong not me Bring back public shaming Not really but Im sure you understand my feelings on the matter,m6k6l5g,7.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6hk0cf,randompersonx,,0,2025-01-10 23:12:25,,,,I agree its good that the language was used this way but I think another takeaway from this event is that the emergency management protocols need to be updated Drones exist and are common place Its already illegal to fly them during a wildfire and during a TFR so this was illegal for at least two reasons It was also probably beyond visual line of sight and probably flying above 400 feet and probably with visibility less than the required amount So probably even more reasons Idiots are going to do stupid things even if drones are banned plenty of them exist Even if geofencing is enforced more on DJI people will DIY things that dont have geofencing etc IMHO the news media and all emergency management notices should all be clear that it is a no fly zone for drones and for most other flights as well People may simply just not know what the rules are and its a good time to remind people in a timely manner,m6f5sxd,1.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6f9xqu,mlorusso4,,-6,2025-01-10 16:26:44,,,,I agree putting in new laws to punish users probably wont help much But they should pass new regulations for manufacturers Something like every drone capable of flying a certain distance from its operator or above a certain height has to have a transponder active And I know people might be nervous about this but every drone should have a backdoor for police to be able to easily take control of any drone they want and land it You cant fix stupid people but you can do things to make these collisions and incursions into no fly zones like when some idiot kept flying their drone over the ravens game last year and they had to keep stopping play much less likely,m6ert8p,4.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6h2pfm,tastyratz,,1,2025-01-10 21:41:00,,,,smart features stops you accessing restricted airspace Would that be dynamic like in the instance of the fires it all becomes restricted airspace through some kind of connectivity Id imagine you can always have some custom firmware and cheap Chinese drones that arent following regulations Its a start though for the average person I also dont know anything about drones here or if similar regulations already exist,m6h0j5y,2.0,1hy5f8b

comment,m6fyenk,bradley_j,,2,2025-01-10 18:24:06,,,,As a Canadian I appreciate your recognition of the relationship our nations share My whole life I have seen our neighbors to the south as friendly allies and trading partners with whom we share the continent Suddenly the friendship with the nation we share the longest unprotected border in the world has shifted and we all live under strain from the stated goals of our annexation into a 51st state The American people voted for a regime that has turned our perspective of living next to a common friend into living next to an adversary with all the stress of potential upheaval unrest and division that goes along with that,m6fodec,1.0,1hy5f8b
