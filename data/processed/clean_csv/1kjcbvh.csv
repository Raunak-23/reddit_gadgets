comment,mrlpft0,Hour_Reindeer834,,91,2025-05-10 15:33:40,,,,Funny the place I go to recently got this or a similar machine It seems to have helped the nurses a fair amount from what I heard You know what would actually help speed up waits improve care and reduce costs for patients and clinics Not sticking to this outdated expensive and inefficient daily dose clinic model that requires people to spend 10 hours a week in a waiting room It really sucks for tons of jobs andor trying to build a career once your back on your feet because there are always times your stuck for hours while they deal with messed up paperwork or billing or signing something oh and appointments they schedule and dont tell you Anyways not meaning to rant I guess any improvement is a step in the right direction Its just such an unpleasant system to go thru but it really does wonders for people and getting their lives back so you put up with it Most of us just want to live normal productive and peaceful lives and being on MAT people think you collect welfare fraudulently and steal scrap metal all day One day maybe Ill be able to just pick up my prescription once a month like the regular person I am rather than an inmate in the med line,,0.0,1kjcbvh
comment,mrmb7vj,notyogrannysgrandkid,,54,2025-05-10 17:32:02,,,,I was a counselor at a clinic in AZ for a while I have no idea how my handful of successful clients managed it We opened at 430 AM and the line with our two nurses at the dispensing window moved so insanely slow I had people that started work at 8 sitting in the waiting room at 5 hoping theyd get their dose in time It was a terrible system but we were completely hamstrung by state laws that Im fairly certain were written by the Moral Majority Its fairly clear that the model was designed to be punitive to addicts and to set them up for continued failure,mrlpft0,1.0,1kjcbvh
comment,mrmrir2,windyorbits,,6,2025-05-10 19:02:11,,,,Was there just an enormous amount of people who go there I dont think Ive ever spent more than 30 45 minutes at the longest waiting in line at my clinic Unless something crazy happens like the computers are down or the power is out And Ive curtesy dosed at a few other places around California and have never experienced have to wait 3 hours I wonder what the difference is,mrmb7vj,2.0,1kjcbvh

comment,mrnk8bq,TooStrangeForWeird,,6,2025-05-10 21:48:51,,,,With the social safety net and advancement of mental healthcare we have now What are you even talking about Its getting worse not better Also a good number of addicts are created by the healthcare system itself Sometimes caused by the rules that are supposed to prevent it Someone needs painkillers and theyre cut off while still in pain so they go looking elsewhere for relief Then they get hooked and it spirals,mrnagmu,3.0,1kjcbvh
comment,mrr58rt,Sklibba,,0,2025-05-11 14:29:08,,,,The irony here is that its attitudes like your own towards addicts and addiction that have led to reactive policies which hamstring prescribers and make it impossible for them to sufficiently manage patients pain driving them to the streets,mrnk8bq,4.0,1kjcbvh

comment,mrlz33p,Ebonyks,,2,2025-05-10 16:26:13,,,,Just to ask the question what are your thoughtsfeelings on suboxone Through micro induction protocols the transition from methadone is relatively painless and the daily dosing model is typically not used for outpatient suboxone or especially sublocade I very much agree and empathize with your frustration with the daily dose model,mrlpft0,1.0,1kjcbvh
comment,mrnmwwp,shitposts_over_9000,,1,2025-05-10 22:05:09,,,,Making the clinics more efficient would generally be a good thing but extending the takehome rules for methadone particularly in new treatment cases would be a hard no for me That was a massive issue locally when that was allowed during COVID After taking almost 20 years for the rate of street trade in methadone to triple we managed to more than double it in a single year just by allowing it out of the clinics That was pretty bad for a while,mrlpft0,1.0,1kjcbvh
