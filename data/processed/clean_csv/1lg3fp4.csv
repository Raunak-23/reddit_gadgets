comment,myua0e8,Scary-Boysenberry,,278,2025-06-20 16:54:01,,,,Its got an insanely large battery From the article Im guessing it was the 214 kWh version By contrast my EV sedan with 300 mile range that actually gets 300 miles with real driving has a 75 kWh battery But my sedan doesnt weigh almost 5 tons either,myu8uin,3.0,1lg3fp4
comment,myub3h4,bangbangIshotmyself,,135,2025-06-20 16:59:02,,,,Which is exactly the problem as the battery size increases so does weight which decreases efficiency Its ok when the vehicle is aerodynamic and has low loss of power aka its highly efficient otherwise But with a tank like the hummer that shit gets limited by all the efficiency loss throughout the vehicle But I agree with the other guy they might as well have tossed something absolutely stupid in there like a 350kWh battery and have the vehicle weight 20000lbs lol,myua0e8,4.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myutazs,No_Syrup_9167,,1,2025-06-20 18:25:14,,,,You cant make it much bigger honestly its already at the gross vehicle weight limit for a passenger vehicle of many countries IIRC in the US its 6k kg but many countries have a 45k kg limit for a regular passenger vehicle and its specd out at like 43k IIRC if they made the battery much bigger it would start having roads it couldnt go on countries it couldnt be sold in or require another axle and therefore a different license in some countries and yes that matters since generally vehicles like this have to be made to be sold in multiple countries to be anywhere near financially viable for sale the US is a big market but not really big enough to support its own model of such a niche vehicle it already requires special and expensive tires IIRC that would normally be used on things like motorhomes,myub3h4,5.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myxrmus,Edythir,,1,2025-06-21 04:45:18,,,,Square cube law coming into effect Imagine you have a cube it has the dimensions of 1 on each side The unit doesnt matter say its feet meters or barleycorn for all that matters Its dimension is 1 on each side To double its size you first place an identical cube to its side now the whole has the dimensions of two wide one high one long Next you make it two lonh as well meaning both the cubes you have get copied behind them now you have a total of 4 cubes Two wide one high two long Finally stack a copy of those four on top of each other Now there are two blocks up in any direction two wide and two blocks long You have a total of 8 cubes from doubling 1 cube Furthermore each Side is made up of four cubes each For every doubling of a three dimensional object its surface area increases by a factor of four and its weight by a factor of eight For every material there is a point where it does no longer support itself because its strength to hold itself or propel itself grows slower than its weight This also has implication for waste heat both for batteries and for life forms Because the surface area only increases by a factor of four while total material increases by a factor of eight the heat it can radiate out is proportionally less compared to the heat it generates,myub3h4,5.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myucu77,PrairiePopsicle,,16,2025-06-20 17:07:12,,,,I have a sneaking suspicion that the owner of this hummer drives at 70mph regularly doesnt check their tire pressure and drives generally horribly If they drove like a sunday driver they may not be getting the mileage claimed but I dont believe even a hummer would be getting that bad of mileage naturally without a dumb driver who doesnt respect the weight of the fucking thing,myua0e8,4.0,1lg3fp4
comment,myuhsmv,bi-moresexesmorefun,,17,2025-06-20 17:30:17,,,,Expecting someone to drive that carefully I think is a bit much in general It should be expected that a person will only fill their tires when they get an alert and drive 75 on highways Not that those are best practices but I think its best for a review to be based on a regular person who doesnt know much about cars and treat it like they would Thats especially true I think with a hummer where the car I think attracts a generally reckless owner That being said I think the guy talking about charging using 110v is absolutely insane Plus its not a great vehicle to make into an ev in general,myucu77,5.0,1lg3fp4
comment,mywcuqn,PrairiePopsicle,,0,2025-06-20 23:14:47,,,,EVs Ive been in tend to have driver feedback mine starts turning the speedometer red as you go faster than 60mph because people expect the efficiency to work the same way as gas vehicles speed is the biggest thing Im pointing at here and no its really not that much to expect people to drive well to hit rated mileage numbers its been true for my entire life I do think that EVs are rating higher than they should but experience tells me the vast majority of bad EV mileage numbers is caused by the driver The other core issue as other comments have said is that the damn vehicle is just too huge,myuhsmv,6.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myug8xa,Lifesagame81,,3,2025-06-20 17:23:06,,,,That reduces tire wear and can reduce surface damage but more wheels doesnt change the wear caused to the roadway Roads are ultimately a more rigid layer on top of a less rigid layer Wear is caused by flexing that rigid layer as its pressed down into the less rigid layer Adding more wheels doesnt change the weight the axle is applying to the roadway Its like stepping on someone wearing a larger shoe That similarly wouldnt dramatically alter the stress the 200 lbs of weight applies to the body in the same way that standing on two feet so only 100 lbs is applied to each area would,mytye71,6.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myszy16,LurkerFromTheVoid,,963,2025-06-20 13:02:59,,,,From the article When you drive the Hummer you see the dash eat about 3 miles off the counter for every half mile you drive I was once driving and from the time I saw an exit sign that said ½ mile to the time I crossed the exit I had lost 4 miles off my range I dont know who calibrated these Hummers but they must have been using kilometers not miles This means if you have to drive anywhere over 100 miles you will have to stop and recharge Dont get me started on rechargingIf you plug the Hummer into a 110 V it adds 2 miles per hour of charging It takes a week to get to 80 If you plug the Hummer into 220 V it charges 8 miles an hour and still takes 24 hours to fully charge This means if you need to drive over 100 miles you have to charge for 24 hours minimum,,0.0,1lg3fp4

comment,mzectdg,Kaesix,,1,2025-06-23 20:59:41,,,,Assuming youre copying the same numbers off of Google for a fair comparison cause MPG should vary just as much as towing capacity I know for certain the HummerEV numbers are wrong Why I own one Its why I first posted on this article it was complete nonsense For example my 2X SUV is rated for 10000lbs can easily do it Mileage probably drops by 50 not 66 Its probably somewhere around 30MPGe while towing but I havent bothered calculating it cause it doesnt change my usage Truth be told if I was going to be towing a boat all the time Id have gotten a diesel But to head down to the lakes and back on vacation Super easy and convenient Again though everything is a trade off I didnt get a diesel cause the EV is a shit ton more convenient I didnt get a Ford Lightning cause the HummerEV is much roomier and more comfortable for trips with the family I can probably go through most similarly priced SUVs and trucks cause I looked at them all Again I was just shocked at the amount of misinformation out there on the HummerEV,mzduweo,8.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myushf3,jacknifetoaswan,,1,2025-06-20 18:21:11,,,,Space available is generally just a physical inspection unless the box is overloaded with high capacity breakers A sub panel might cost 2000 in labor and materials Adding a second panel is much more expensive and labor intensive I cant imagine a single instance where an electrician would tap into an existing 110v circuit to extend it for use as an electric vehicle charger Also running a high current 220v line isnt rocket surgery and while the materials copper are expensive it would cost the same in terms of labor,myu45qo,9.0,1lg3fp4

comment,mythxyk,CubbyNINJA,,1,2025-06-20 14:38:27,,,,So I was reading the article and I was like theres no way its that bad because I have a 2023 KIA EV6 GT that nonGT drivers like to shit on for having terrible range compared to the lower power models So I did some math using my EV6 as a reference The 24 hours seems to be 100 accurate with a battery size of 245kWhI know its actually 246 but 245 is cleaner math and a 40a240v charger a pretty typical Level 2 home charger mine goes up to 50a It is generally bad practice to be driving to empty you should be charging for about30 at a time up to 8090 capacity unless you plan on needing the full 100 for a trip I30 of a Hummer battery capacity is still 735kWh or about the same electricity a 3 bedroom 4 person household will use in 3 days It would still take 758 hours to charge with the same 40a240V charger IMO that is the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM of practical if the real world range was decent The Hummer EV sees25kmkWh or about 183km mixed driving 113 in freedom units with the same 30 charge If your daily commute is within that round trip or you can charge at work I can see that working for some but not many My daily commute is 70km each way and I would be getting very anxious if I had to run errands and stuff or had a busy weekend for sure The Hummer can also fast charge at a maximum of 350kw so going from something like 2080 or about 350375km of range while driving further will take about an hour Again right along the lines of practical Like youre not doing a cross country expedition through the mountains but its manageable if you have to drive out to the inlaws for Thanksgiving and want to flex on your fatherinlaw kind of thing What I will say is if you had to charge a Hummer 30 every day and you have a L2 charger at home its about 560 CAD to charge during offpeak hours overnight in my area Lets say you drive to work 5 days a week thats about 112 CAD a month Keeping in mind the cost to fill a H2 with regular gas ONCE is about the same depending on gas prices So I do think the writer is being a bit overdramatic but anyone who buys an Hummer EV as a commuter or daily driver might actually just have brain damage anyways,myszy16,1.0,1lg3fp4

comment,mytkywv,ekobres,,53,2025-06-20 14:53:06,,,,This reads like the dude just wanted to write an EV hit piece so he leased the stupidest possible EV and took the stupidest possible approach to charging and driving it The Hummer has 350KW charging capability and an 800V architecture It can charge reasonably quickly at the newer fast chargers Even considering charging this with a level 1 charger is a joke Not saying the Hummer is in any way a practical vehicle but for someone who wants this type of vehicle the EV aspects of it are predictable and reasonable,,0.0,1lg3fp4
comment,myuqlj0,wesgtp,,5,2025-06-20 18:12:03,,,,Exactly my thoughts about this article Reports like this make people more hesitant to adopt an EV If you have access to 220V in your garagehome then youll hardle ever have to worry about external chargers You plug it in and itll charge overnight to 100 or close enough This guy seemed to avoid even the most basic research on living with an EV while going allin this 100k giant SUV Even mentioning 110V charging in the article shows how ignorant he is about the subject Seems like a guy that is intentionally writing a hit piece on EVs by as you say reviewing the most energy inefficient EV and having no idea how to set up proper charging at his home,mytkywv,1.0,1lg3fp4
comment,myy1uup,slmplychaos,,1,2025-06-21 06:13:53,,,,I agree but knowing whats possible with 120 is helpful We have a model Smine and a model Xwifes And we have only one 240 outlet in the garage She only drives about 2030 miles a day so she can typically keep up with the 120 outlet charger no problem I drive about 100 miles a day but charge at work mostly so our 240 charger mostly just sits there and is only used in special cases,myuqlj0,2.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myy5z0q,no-name-here,,1,2025-06-21 06:52:49,,,,The article also says a number of positive things about the Hummer EV Ryans experience underscores a truth many new EV owners face range anxiety As Jason Harrell shared in the comments that anxiety is realhaving to plan your days around charging stations Zachary Zimmerman noted An 80 amp 240 V will charge a Hummer much more quickly Thats good news if you have the means and knowledge to install such a system But most people especially firsttime EV owners like Stewman arent electricians When your only reliable option is a household 110V outlet adding 2 miles per hour youre not living the Jetsons dream youre stuck in slow motion And when the charging app wont work on your iPhone Thats not an inconvenience Thats stranded He wanted the emotional echo of his old H2 but he ended up with a technological tour de force that demands more planning than he bargained for His frustration is honest But so is the achievement of this machine Overall the article is quite mixed but Id overall say bad since 1 its about taking one of the most energyguzzling vehicles with the largest batteries and trying to charge it via the slowest possible method and 2 they dont investigate the claims that the vehicle is only getting a tiny fraction of the official EPA numbers,mytxfkx,2.0,1lg3fp4
comment,myui3fq,Jaerba,,0,2025-06-20 17:31:40,,,,Its not an EV hit piece Its a Hummer EV hit piece And the hits seem perfectly fair Obviously a Hummer is going to have limitations but it seems like these ones are extreme enough to criticize releasing it as a product If your car is going to be guzzling energy like that your range prediction better be accurate,mytkywv,1.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myyq498,CptUnderpants-,,1,2025-06-21 10:18:19,,,,And the hits seem perfectly fair Most of the hits are about charging and the same old charging issues which all EVs have just on a larger scale The fact they didnt mention once the alternative of using a DC fast charger when they forgot to charge and was lucky to own other cars is what turns this into a hit piece An example of a balanced article is this by Ars Technica They managed over 300 miles on a full charge and did mention that they can add 100 miles of charge in about 10 min at a DC fast charger,myui3fq,2.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myutfkq,GrumpyGenX,,2,2025-06-20 18:25:51,,,,I have the 7000lb Ford F150 lightning which has some of the same issues as the Hummer mainly that its really heavy and about as aerodynamic as a building but the author just sounds like he was unprepared to own an electric vehicle Not having a 60 or 80 outlet setup at home ahead of time IS going to cause you headaches because 110v charging will never work Also fast chargers are all over the place in more densely populated areas which can charge your vehicle from 2080 in about 2030 minutes Once you work out the kinks range anxiety goes away completely and my F150 is my favorite vehical Ive ever owned I drive by gas stations which have been raising prices like crazy due to the trouble in the Middle East and am relieved that I dont have to worry about gas prices at all anymore Also factor in theres NO maintenance except for window washer fluid and tires even your brakes last forever due to regenerative braking My next step is probably adding solar to our home which will make driving virutally free,,0.0,1lg3fp4

comment,myvddfs,manchegoo,,4,2025-06-20 20:05:00,,,,I think the problem is that we havent socialized the idea of an EVs efficiency to the same consistency we have with gas cars Everyone from ecogreen hippy to redneck can estimate the mileage that a car will get be it a gas guzzler at 12 mpg to a Prius at 45 mpg or an RV at 8 mph We all know the unit and we all know how to read it on a window sticker and how to compute it Its simple and agreed upon Oh and we know that lower is crappier Sadly when it comes to EVs the world has not agreed upon such a simple metric that even moves in the same direction as mpg Lets start with the fundamental unit of energy for EVs analogous to the gallon of gas for gas cars For some reason marketers thought the kWh would word for consumers for a unit of energy Its atrociously stupid First no one can even write it correctly the Watt part should always be capitalized in SI since its named after a person yet people will often write kwh yes Im nitpicking here But also it mixes the hour which is a stupid unit to begin with and not even part of the SI WTF is with that The Joule is the correct unit of energy except its just way too fucking small to use on its own since there are 3600000 J in one kWh noticed its not even a power of 10 since that stupid hour is in there No problem why just decide on the megaJoule the MJ In my opinion the MJ should be the only unit of energy we use for cars A fully charged Tesla MYP has 270 MJ of energy Simple Now lets get back to full economy The dipshits building EVs decided to invert the convention weve had for decades around mpg Why not stick with mpg but swap out the g with MJ That way we stick with the same idea where lower is crummier and bigger is better just like with mpg For example a Tesla MYP can go 320 miles on a full tank so thats 320270 12 MPMJs The Hummer on the other hand the Hummer has a 882 MJ tank and can only for 100 mi according to this author Thats 01 MPMJs 10x crappier than the Tesla Why arent these number pasted on the windows and socialized on every EV Thats the only number you need The Range is far less important No one discusses how big their gas tank is they talk about their MPG If you saw a Tesla has a full economy of 12 and the Hummer is 01 which one would you buy Thats like seeing 45 MPG vs 45 MPG,,0.0,1lg3fp4
