comment,ma0d02o,everstillghost,,2,2025-01-30 13:57:36,,,,Environmental impact of rocket launch is gigantic as rocket launches have emissions equivalent of hundreds of airplane flights However these Rocket launches would happen anyway as most of them are for deploying sattelites or nasascience missions the only useless launches are for things like space tourism or nasa artemis program so spaceX reduced the environmental impact a lot by building their reusable rockets more than half the cost reduction and more efficient engines for less fuel consumption Starship will use liquid methane and oxygen which will reduce the carbon footprint by a lot So we are MUCH better having spaceX existing and developing these greener technologies than using legacy rocket tech If It was for me and probably you too I would stop shit like space tourism or nasa moon base as we have more real problems to solve but most people like these things so,m9w5tzx,11.0,1icvt58

comment,m9ug23p,ymmvmia,,-6,2025-01-29 16:30:46,,,,Thankfully custom roms exist for android phones You can have a maximally degoogled experience Its just not for everyone And only certain phones allow their bootloaders to be unlocked I switched to Apple 6 months ago for my main daily driver phone for a much better overall experience after being android for most of my life As well as a more secure out of the box experience compared to Android Android is only really more secure when using a custom rom I do still have and USE an android tablet with a custom rom LineageOS And I use Linux for most everything else for all nonphone and nontablets I realized quickly and have heard for years that for iOS apps just work so dramatically better its wild So many less bugs less weird crashing of apps the UI is designed perfectly and updated more often for apps password managers work so dramatically better etc And honestly iMessage is so great as the android messaging services are so fractured Im forced to text with SMS most of the time on android as many dont have rcs on on android and even though apple enabled rcs it doesnt work encrypted via rcs from apple to android or vice versa The MAJORITY of people have iPhones in the US so therefore the chance my messages can be encrypted is way higher on iPhone And for whomever is on android and that I can convince I can message them through Signal or less ideal WhatsAppmessenger So with a combination of SignalWhatsapp and iMessage I can get 90 encryption with very little SMS with the rest being for mandatory bs verification codes or android folks I cant convince to use anything besides sms The best privacy feature is for sure the App Tracking Transparency feature which Google was SO upset about You can just deny apps access to the rest of your phoneother apps Semisandboxing them which was normally only a feature for android custom roms though custom roms are still way better as custom roms can fully sandbox with fully featured control over the sandboxed app Google SAID theyd be adding a comparable feature they even launched a beta of it back in 20212022 then presumably abandoned it So PLAINVANILLA iOS as of now is just MORE SECURE across the board compared to a NON CUSTOM ROM Android phone You just should never use Apple cloud services if you care about privacy though Use other cloud services or self host your own as best case But besides Apple cloud servicesstorage iOS is the better privacy option most of the time,m9u2sxc,2.0,1icvt58

comment,m9ubfx9,VampyreLust,,3,2025-01-29 16:09:13,,,,I was in the UK a few weeks ago and whenever I couldnt get a signal a satellite icon appeared where the bars usually show TMobile user on iPhone Ive never noticed it before FWIW I often couldnt get a signal Pretty useless device even in London This is a different thing Apple along with all other manufacturers sell phones by area iphones specifically have 3 versions of the same device that are sold the US version the International and the countries with specific requirements version Each version uses different bands and frequencies for service so your US iphone would have some different bands and frequencies than what they use in the UK which would use the international phone This is not a new thing all phones have been sold in this way since the 90s Usually theres one or two bands out of say 5 or 6 that are used everywhere but most of the time thats it which is why it was switching to satellite otherwise youd just have terrible service,m9u53uw,1.0,1icvt58
