comment,m3zdagg,CosmicCreeperz,,125,2024-12-27 03:53:24,,,,Jeez In theory it could run a very reasonable Linux kernel entirely from cache I have worked on set top boxes and other embedded devices that had a lot less than 96 MB Hell my first Linux PC had 4,,0.0,1hn52fv
comment,m3zu22d,lordraiden007,,52,2024-12-27 06:04:51,,,,Unfortunately cache isnt quite the same thing as addressable memory so you cant install a kernel on it or at least not a Linux kernel You also would be giving up the ability to use an entire tier of cache even if it were theoretically possible so your performance would actually probably suck even more than running from a simple RAMDisk,m3zdagg,1.0,1hn52fv
comment,m426udr,CosmicCreeperz,,29,2024-12-27 17:30:33,,,,Yes obviously I know its an associative cache not fully accessible RAM I am a computer engineer And moreover installing has nothing to do with it its SRAM not flash storage I was just pointing out how crazy it is that even in the 90s no one could conceive of 96MB DRAM in their PC it was 30 a megabyte let alone 96MB of in die L3 cache heh no one had heard of L3 cache at that point I suppose,m3zu22d,2.0,1hn52fv
comment,m447sko,extopico,,6,2024-12-28 00:13:59,,,,Its not about installing Its about being able to hold the entire binary file thats controlling the work that the cpu has to do inside the cache without needing to swap it out The speed up achieved by this is very high in the order of 2030 on my older systems when compiled with gcc with Os vs O3 highest optimisation,m3zu22d,2.0,1hn52fv
comment,m45c49i,lordraiden007,,-1,2024-12-28 04:40:26,,,,I know that They were asking about running an entire OS kernel in cache only not just running more in the cache or specific programs running with more cache optimizations I was explaining that running an entire OS out of L3 cache isnt possible using any of our current OS models and possibly not possible period given the way caching works on an architectural level,m447sko,3.0,1hn52fv
comment,m4bsfnj,Hattix,,2,2024-12-29 08:18:17,,,,If you managed to install your own UEFI you could do this The CPU runs cacheasstorage mode until DRAM is initialised and trained If you never exit this mode into associative mode your cache remains addressible,m3zu22d,2.0,1hn52fv

comment,m3zuayo,lordraiden007,,46,2024-12-27 06:07:07,,,,Honestly if youre getting spinning disk Id recommend finding a good online vendor that sells refurbishedused drives You can buy really large capacities for dirt cheap and even if one fails youll have a 23 spares ready to go if you spent the same amount of money as buying one new If you are already intending to run some kind of redundant storage the risk is even smaller,m3zqq4e,2.0,1hn52fv

comment,m3zxy7k,lordraiden007,,14,2024-12-27 06:41:36,,,,Usually refurbishment in my experience I was a SME for data sanitization for electronics recyclers means they wiped the data usually 13 passes per NIST standards depending on the datas sensitivity and possibly vendor contracts checked the SMART values for any flaws or indications of future failure and removed any physical evidence of the last owner So generally drives might have an acceptable number of active hours otherwise they dont sell it writes power cycles etc but might have scratches or damage to the labels and casing from them removing things people put on them labels stickers writing etc Id imagine that first party refurbished drives have even stricter standards for what gets let out the door although they likely are also willing to replace internal components as necessary,m3zxbu1,4.0,1hn52fv

comment,m41uf61,TripleSecretSquirrel,,3,2024-12-27 16:24:02,,,,If theres a microcenter anywhere near you check there Idk what it is but they seem to have pretty frequent sales on the 9800X3D 7900x3d that are instore only I cant find the receipt and I dont remember the exact price but I paid 230 for mine It was a low enough price that the guy pulling it out of the locked cabinet for me said woah holy shit thats great deal Edit I had the sku wrong sorry yall,m3zqq4e,2.0,1hn52fv
comment,m47favi,A_Nice_Meat_Sauce,,2,2024-12-28 15:52:54,,,,When you say theyre in store deals do you mean you have to actually go in to see them or are they listed on the website I have one near enough to get to but its a bit of a trek to wander in regularly,m41uf61,3.0,1hn52fv
comment,m47nuwk,TripleSecretSquirrel,,2,2024-12-28 16:41:17,,,,My CPU price at least was listed online but I couldnt buy it at that price online The listing said something like instore only,m47favi,4.0,1hn52fv

comment,m48dbfh,A_Nice_Meat_Sauce,,2,2024-12-28 18:59:32,,,,Ahh got it I bought one of those for 400 last January so you had me running for the microcenter website lol,m485w5x,7.0,1hn52fv
comment,m481c2w,paycadicc,,1,2024-12-28 17:54:57,,,,Are you sure you mean the 9800x3D It just came out like a month ago and it retails for 480 I also literally just bought one at micro center for 480 yesterday so please dont tell me I couldve gotten it half off,m41uf61,3.0,1hn52fv
comment,m485gdp,TripleSecretSquirrel,,1,2024-12-28 18:17:21,,,,Oof Im sorry I did get the sku wrong When I wrote it out I thought is that right I meant the 7900x3d It still sells for well over 600 at most places so my 230 price is still a great deal but ya not nearly so good as it would be for a 9800x3d,m481c2w,4.0,1hn52fv
comment,m48607e,paycadicc,,2,2024-12-28 18:20:19,,,,Ok thank you lol but yea still a crazy good price for that,m485gdp,5.0,1hn52fv

comment,m40kisc,Plank_With_A_Nail_In,,-66,2024-12-27 10:47:53,,,,Outside of benchmarks an 7600 non X isnt a bottleneck 1440p and above Most people wont notice the extra a X3D gives unless they are playing a low GFX demanding title at 720p Edit 7600 outperforms the 5800X3D in most games ffs Seem to have triggered all the people who wasted money on X3D cpus,m40bgik,1.0,1hn52fv
comment,m40mp0z,SurturOfMuspelheim,,21,2024-12-27 11:11:06,,,,Thats blatantly not true I saw massive improvements in certain games and no change in others The point is its better or the same cheaper than intel and uses less power Unless youre doing nongaming activities often that get better results from an intel chip over the x3d chip its better I nearly tripled my FPS going from a 3700X to a 5800X3D on Tarkov for example Paradox titles run faster and better Conan Exiles and some MMOs are giving 2050 more FPS And for the record I switched from 1080p to 1440p at the same time,m40kisc,2.0,1hn52fv

comment,m3ztrk9,alvenestthol,,20,2024-12-27 06:02:12,,,,For CPUintensive tasks other than games the non3D CCD is the good CCD since it clocks higher or at least it was on the 7950X3D things might be different with the new design I dont think we have games that can take up 16 whole cores yet without also being hammered by the betweenCCD latency too having 8 gaming cores and 8 compute cores is better for folks who want to do some work or decompress some archives outside of gaming,m3zr4uw,1.0,1hn52fv

comment,m40xwci,The_JSQuareD,,2,2024-12-27 12:57:36,,,,Based on their naming conventions a 9990X3D would be a 96core nonpro threadripper CPU with 3d vcache and probably cost around 10000 Consider the 7980x and 7995x for reference It probably wouldnt be very good for gaming because the clock speeds cant go anywhere near as high as on the Ryzen 9s In fact this CPU would essentially be a Zen 5 consumer version of the Epyc 9684x so the Epyc 9685x a 15k enterprise Zen 4 cpu Maybe you can find some gaming benchmarks for it,m3zr4uw,1.0,1hn52fv

comment,m43fu94,akgis,,1,2024-12-27 21:31:25,,,,booooo single CCD on cache at mercy of Windows scheduler and game mode And boost of only 56ghz isnt enough imo to warrant the cache less CCD And gonna cost a fortune because Intel is no threat it should had been double cache CCD as the cache stack is now in the back and isnt as much hindrance to clocks,,0.0,1hn52fv
