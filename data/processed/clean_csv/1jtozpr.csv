comment,mlw9zwh,PashaB,,6,2025-04-07 17:34:27,,,,Didnt the plastic gears wear down over time and cause drift I got drift on my pro controller and disassembled it I sprayed contact cleaner into the little joystick box with 2 plastic gears It worked but I imagine theyll wear down eventually,mlw98sx,2.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwagch,Henry-What,,39,2025-04-07 17:36:40,,,,Nah theres a little graphene sensor in the joycon that gets completely rubbed away from friction no matter what Thats where the drift will come from,mlw9zwh,3.0,1jtozpr
comment,mm2uc88,PashaB,,1,2025-04-08 18:35:20,,,,Oh wow yeah that makes so much more sense Why am I cleaning plastic gears with contact cleaner anyway I see so it worked cuz it cleaned the graphene sensor I was following directions without really thinking I guess I would use isopropyl to clean the gears if needed,mlwagch,4.0,1jtozpr
comment,mm2uvxm,Henry-What,,3,2025-04-08 18:37:58,,,,Yeah the simplest fix for the graphene sensor is to stuff cardboard under it so the sensors touch again,mm2uc88,5.0,1jtozpr

comment,mlwfl0p,Kamakaziturtle,,110,2025-04-07 18:01:54,,,,I mean if they actually do up the quality then its fine The drift issue isnt due to not using Hall Effect its due to how cheap hardware is these days That said I will believe it when I see it Not just against Nintendo either seems like all of em are cutting corners these days,,0.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwmda3,DudesworthMannington,,39,2025-04-07 18:36:37,,,,Its not that theres no drift its just the drift its smoother and more reliable,mlwfl0p,1.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwphhe,Qwirk,,31,2025-04-07 18:52:26,,,,Hall Effect controllers use magnets rather than mechanical parts Its literally the issue causing drift No matter how expensive the parts are they will be subject to wear,mlwfl0p,1.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwrlrk,Kamakaziturtle,,31,2025-04-07 19:03:14,,,,Potentiameters are fine the issue is how cheap the hardware is A Joystick in general is prone to wear and tear theres a lot of moving parts and all of them will degrade over time The issue with drift is just due to overall lack of quality that is causing these parts to fail much faster than the rest of the joystick Its the current weakest link Hall effect removes said link altogether which can obviously help But improving the potentiameter hardware so it lasts as long as the rest of the joystick would have the same effect on the longevity of the joystick,mlwphhe,2.0,1jtozpr

comment,mly223g,Kamakaziturtle,,9,2025-04-07 23:14:01,,,,They dont There are plenty of high quality manufactures out there that make good quality controllers that dont fail Unfortunately Sony Microsoft and Nintendo arent one of them Because Sony Microsoft and Nintendo dont make the pots The two big manufacturers are Favor Union and Alps Alpine Sony Microsoft and Nintendo all use both FU and ALPS in their controllers Both of these companies make pretty cheap pots The three console giants use them because they are dirt cheap Surprise surprise the answer for why manufacturers are doing something anticonsumer is Because Money,mlxyzx8,4.0,1jtozpr

comment,mlwub9f,Kamakaziturtle,,18,2025-04-07 19:17:23,,,,What RD Its not new technology controllers have been using potentiameters for decades The reason why its become such a big issue as of late is them cutting corners to cut costs,mlwt9f4,4.0,1jtozpr

comment,mlwvkk1,Kamakaziturtle,,12,2025-04-07 19:23:57,,,,By doing what they used to do Sometimes rolling back a design is an improvement especially in the modern era This isnt new technology it exists and has been implemented in the past They just made a decision to use cheaper materials,mlwuiki,6.0,1jtozpr

comment,mlzg2qz,nero40,,1,2025-04-08 04:35:03,,,,The joysticks in the old JoyCons was a low quality one that they had to use in order to fit a joystick in such a small space that the JoyCons had Thats the problem it wasnt good joysticks to begin with By going back to established joystick designs that arent so easily prone to wear and tear we MIGHT see an improvement in joystick durability in the Switch 2s JoyCons We shall see how Nintendos claims of higher durability works in the future when we finally get the device in hand to test,mlwuiki,6.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwshvx,popupsforever,,9,2025-04-07 19:07:54,,,,The vast majority of controllers going back to the dawn of the analog stick dont use hall effect sensors and dont have widespread problems with stick drift Its not a fundamental problem with mechanical analog sticks its a problem with Nintendos and Microsoft and Sony to a lesser extent shit design and part quality in the modern era,mlwphhe,2.0,1jtozpr

comment,mlwc0t9,Eric1180,,8,2025-04-07 17:44:21,,,,He doesnt because hes making shit up see my comment response to his original statement Hall sensors would have zero issues working near the magnetic rails Its a known interference which can easily be cancelled out Just like how we cancel out the earths magnetic field on other hall sensors,mlwaxsk,2.0,1jtozpr

comment,mm0s0y7,Ab47203,,2,2025-04-08 12:09:02,,,,Unfortunately theres not exactly confirmation on the magnet strength Logic would lead almost anyone to believe that a magnet strong enough to hold the console up strong enough they only used them on one side then its strong enough at an inch or two away to interfere with the magnets in the hall effect stick Would likely mostly be an issue on the left controller Edit tested on my switch 1 and magnets an inch or two from the hall effect sticks I put in my joycons do indeed start interfering It needs recalibrating when removed from the console too,mlx95rn,4.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwbf85,Eric1180,,20,2025-04-07 17:41:24,,,,Thats complete bullshit I am an electrical engineer Hall sensor avoids interference by simply normalizes outside influences Having a magnetic field next to a hall sensor doesnt make it IMPOSSIBLE to cancel out interference If that were true nothing would work due to the earths magnetic field Dont talk out of your ass,mlw4myp,1.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlwuqjh,TheBoBiZzLe,,2,2025-04-07 19:19:36,,,,Interesting Is that the same with say gamesirs mag res tmr sticks Always assumed that a strong magnet like the ones holding joycons on could pull on something somewhere Kinda reminds me of the new MacBook connections and those are pretty sturdy Also remember seeing a video of when gulikits first started on the switch and people had to use external magnets to calibrate them But guess those did go like right up on them,mlwbf85,2.0,1jtozpr
comment,mm2853o,Ab47203,,3,2025-04-08 16:50:05,,,,I tested it with my switch hall effect sticks The magnet the same distance as it would be on the switch 2 makes the left thumbstick start pulling to the right It would need recalibrating every time its disconnected or reconnected to avoid this especially if the magnets to hold the controllers on the console are so few Four in total and no matching magnet on the other side No hardware connection points Those magnets are going to be POTENT and I would be shocked if you couldnt just stick the switch 2 to a fridge Not exactly what I would call usable needing to recalibrate the controllers every time you connect or disconnect them from the console,mlwuqjh,3.0,1jtozpr
comment,mlx2buh,Ab47203,,4,2025-04-07 19:58:56,,,,It would change the magnetic field EVERY time you disconnect or reconnect the controllers If anyone is talking out of their ass its you A magnet near sensors that RELY on magnets to function not interfering is insane levels of cope If its not strong enough to interfere then how would FOUR of said magnets be all that holds the two controllers to the console It would fall off at the drop of a hat Maybe instead of slinging insults you could try talking next time As it is you opened the conversation with the equivalent of THIS DUDES A STUPID FUCKIN ASSHOLE MAKING SHIT UP and I dont care to continue talking to you,mlwbf85,2.0,1jtozpr
