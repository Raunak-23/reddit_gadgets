comment,ms26e2a,Lester822,,13,2025-05-13 08:52:23,,,,While year over year changes have gotten small thats become true of most smartphone manufacturers as the tech matures if you take the iPhone 16 Pro and compare it to the 12 or 13 Pro the updates add up and they start to feel really different If you compare it to the last time they raised prices on their flagship iPhone X theres a TON new,ms0o6nu,4.0,1kl3lxz
comment,ms2k0ej,thejaga,,12,2025-05-13 11:01:20,,,,They also dont raise prices because year over year they find ways to reduce costs to increase profit So 16 probably costs less to make than 10 did at that time,ms26e2a,5.0,1kl3lxz

comment,ms752zj,gbeezy007,,2,2025-05-14 01:43:14,,,,Apples top flagship phone X was 1000 today its 1200 Tech historically has almost been anti inflationary Look at TVs computers and so on Its not like they havent raised prices 20 is fair in that time span but its also not like they havent And the cheaper phones would be much more subjective to the fact tech gets cheaper as they really push much cheaper dated screens and such in them where cost savings is probably better then leading tech flagships,ms0b1zq,3.0,1kl3lxz
comment,ms9bcqo,alc4pwned,,0,2025-05-14 12:23:33,,,,Apples top flagship phone X was 1000 today its 1200 The top flagship back then was the equivalent of todays Pro There was no bigger version back then The X was a smaller phone and it wasnt until the following XS model that they released a bigger XS Max phone that is equivalent to todays top Pro Max flagship Todays Pro is a continuation of the X todays Pro Max is a continuation of the XS Max So yes Ill concede that the Pro Max phone has gotten a 100 price increase compared to the 2018 XS Max But the regular Pro has stayed the same Tech historically has almost been anti inflationary That really depends on whether its stagnant tech or something that is quickly advancing I think Obviously phones are pretty stagnate now But the price staying more or less the same over the last 78 years does mean that prices have gone down in real terms ie after considering inflation,ms752zj,4.0,1kl3lxz

comment,ms2tnri,alc4pwned,,0,2025-05-13 12:10:54,,,,I strongly disagree I actually also switched from iOS back to Android around 6 months ago and have a long list of annoyances There are absolutely things that long time iOS users got used to that are missing from many Android phones as well For example there is no option to adjust volume without using physical buttons on my Adnroid phone without using 3rd party software There is no physical mute switch Face unlock is much worse than on an iPhone Lock screen shortcuts dont work as well,ms0l3b9,3.0,1kl3lxz
comment,ms44eq4,miuyao,,1,2025-05-13 16:18:49,,,,I never had an issue with lockscreen shortcuts and actually prefer physical buttons Especially a power button for ifwhen the phone acts up and needs to be turned off Iphones off button is on screen so if it freezes I cant access the button On iPhone there is no option to raiselower media volume separately from the ringtone So if I want to watch a video my ringtone is automatically on blast as well And I absolutely will never use face ID so that is lost on me,ms2tnri,4.0,1kl3lxz
comment,ms4t2kf,alc4pwned,,1,2025-05-13 18:17:04,,,,But surely you see how much of this comes down to what you were used to before switching right You never had access to good face unlock so its not even something youre thinking about Whereas thats very much something Im thinking about coming from an iPhone Similarly I never got used to adjusting mediaringtone volume separately so its not something I care about,ms44eq4,5.0,1kl3lxz
