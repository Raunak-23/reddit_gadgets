comment,mr7sb4c,Will2LiveFading,,9,2025-05-08 09:21:46,,,,The Xbox version seems to be considerably more powerful than the stock Ally 2 From the article The listing also reveals some of the specs which include a 7inch 120Hz LCD display an 8core 36W AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme CPU in the Xbox version and a 4core 20W chip in the regular ROG Ally 2 Theyre likely running full versions of Windows 11 too and the molded grips are thicker than those in the original ROG Ally,mr6qxix,1.0,1khdvca

comment,mr63ufl,Marcysdad,,6,2025-05-08 01:13:16,,,,How do these specs compare to the specs of the Switch 2,,0.0,1khdvca
comment,mr9t6vc,hobx,,8,2025-05-08 16:46:05,,,,More powerful but keep in mind Switch games will be optimised for the specific hardware So basically youre probably looking at similar experiences This has a larger battery so will probably have more than the two hour playtime the swiich 2 gets,mr63ufl,1.0,1khdvca

comment,mr8vq0r,SaveHogwarts,,-1,2025-05-08 14:01:28,,,,Ive got no horse in the race but why does that matter Apples and oranges when you factor in what each handheld is trying to accomplish Not trying to be a dick genuinely curious,mr63ufl,1.0,1khdvca
comment,mr92ffc,Marcysdad,,3,2025-05-08 14:35:21,,,,I was asking a question without sarcasm or wanting to offend anyone Just a comparison of these specs to a switch 2 Why is everyone so touchy nowadays,mr8vq0r,2.0,1khdvca

comment,mr92xmq,SaveHogwarts,,0,2025-05-08 14:37:51,,,,I literally just asked you a question as well and included the fact that Im not trying to be rude and thats your response I was genuinely curious why you were interested in comparing the two as Im thinking of getting a switch 2,mr92ffc,3.0,1khdvca
comment,mr9f1qm,Marcysdad,,5,2025-05-08 15:37:02,,,,Because Im on the fence what handheld console i should buy Especially for games like ff7 remake or cp2077,mr92xmq,4.0,1khdvca
comment,mrau429,xanas263,,2,2025-05-08 19:45:22,,,,Especially for games like ff7 remake or cp2077 If you want a handheld for non Nintendo games then dont buy a Nintendo console Nintendo generally has very poor 3rd party support and is mainly going to be serviced by 1st party studios,mr9f1qm,5.0,1khdvca
comment,mraxkpl,Marcysdad,,-1,2025-05-08 20:02:16,,,,Not according to the reveal There are a lot of 3rd party titles coming,mrau429,6.0,1khdvca
comment,mraycju,xanas263,,3,2025-05-08 20:06:07,,,,There are always lots of 3rd parties that come out with the launch Its not the launch window you should be caring about but year 28 of ownership The Switch 2 is already known to be significantly less powerful than the current Xbox and PS That difference will only widen with the next gen in a few years while the Switch 2 will be in mid cycle,mraxkpl,7.0,1khdvca
comment,mrb17zm,PenguinDeluxe,,-2,2025-05-08 20:20:22,,,,I dont think thats going to be an issue this generation with sooooo many games still releasing on Xbox One and PS4 I think the Switch 2 is going to see very strong 3rd party support and for awhile too,mraycju,8.0,1khdvca
comment,mrb0zm1,PenguinDeluxe,,-1,2025-05-08 20:19:12,,,,If it helps the devs of Cyberpunk have said Switch 2 is the best way to play the game portably,mr9f1qm,5.0,1khdvca
