comment,mpdmgf1,jc-from-sin,,45,2025-04-27 21:12:46,,,,Fake I had a zip drive as well using a parallel port which is much slower than usb It would take a few minutes to an hour to write a 100mb disk,mpczxgn,4.0,1k95429
comment,mpe1tli,Hansmolemon,,13,2025-04-27 22:36:33,,,,Wasnt the writing that took that long it was the encoding and constantly having to swap memory to a RAM disk Depending on the length of the song it took 37 hours,mpdmgf1,5.0,1k95429
comment,mpe71ir,PMmeYourDunes,,6,2025-04-27 23:05:55,,,,But you could have downloaded the song off Napster and it would already have been encoded as an mp3 in significantly less time if your memory of time is accurate Lol Maybe your computer labored a lot harder encoding but it didnt take particularly long in my experience Man I remember prenapster days downloading literal pieces of mp3s and stitching them together with a tool That was fucking crazy and so painfully time consuming I also remember VoIP phone calling friends across the country when long distance rates threatened anyone who didnt phreak It was like being a digital wizard,mpe1tli,6.0,1k95429
comment,mpe8tm9,Hansmolemon,,10,2025-04-27 23:16:17,,,,Napster came about 2 years later And it was faster but still got a lot of partial or corrupted files I was living in a pretty rural area at the time and the phone line quality was crap so I got a lot of dropped connections and could rarely negotiate a connection faster than 144k,mpe71ir,7.0,1k95429

comment,mpekb01,Hansmolemon,,1,2025-04-28 00:24:37,,,,At that point it was really more of a novelty than anything else Cheapfree encoders had just become a thing previously it was expensive commercial software with little consumer use I think I had like a 1 or 15 gig hard drive with about a hundred megs of free space Mostly used it for photoshop dreamweaver and pagemaker so most of the space was taken up with image files so even as mp3s I couldnt store unlimited albums and there werent any portable players It really did not offer any significant advantages over just playing cds on your computer I will say that I still miss soundjam to this day my favorite music player,mpef468,9.0,1k95429
comment,mpjfbt1,AnonymousMonk7,,1,2025-04-28 19:58:27,,,,Had a middle of the road Mac at the time barely took longer than normal playback to encode 1 hour album would take maybe 115 minutes,mpe1tli,6.0,1k95429
comment,mpee0ap,im_thatoneguy,,3,2025-04-27 23:46:36,,,,An mp3 was like 23MB back then A 100MB Zip disk could hold 33 MP3s If it took an hour to write a Zip disk then it would take 2 minutes to transfer a song not 8 hours overnight,mpdmgf1,5.0,1k95429

comment,mph2gxt,troyunrau,,1,2025-04-28 12:42:24,,,,I had a Pentium 100 and it would take more than an hour to encode a four minute song on it I basically didnt even bother on the 486 It wasnt just the CPU time it was also the encoders If you take modern encoders and run them on old hardware they are faster But that is because the code in the encoders got faster E just had a random memory of overclocking my 486DX 33 with the motherboard jumpers just to get it to be able to decode an MP3 with a slightly higher bitrate without stuttering in real time Decode,mpfg7rw,8.0,1k95429
comment,mpfhoar,Hansmolemon,,-1,2025-04-28 04:02:16,,,,Wasnt copying mp3s to the Zip disk was copying and converting tracks as uncompressed aiff files which took a while on its own that ran about 3050mb at 16 bit Most songs at 24 bit wouldnt even fit on a Zip disk So you are dealing with a 40ish mb file thats on an external drive while having to use part of the actual hard drive as a ramswap disk because the computer only has 16mb of memory Once the software was able to convert files directly from cds it sped up the process quite a bit but the process was still significantly slower than the cds read speed,mpee0ap,6.0,1k95429

comment,mpfsfwe,Hansmolemon,,0,2025-04-28 05:31:32,,,,Had about 100mb free because I did a lot of work on uncompressed image files with photoshop hence why I also had a Zip disk Ripping mp3s was a novelty thing Either way the transferring to the Zip disk wasnt the bottleneck in this process The readencode to aiff took longer than copying to the zip disk which I ran on scsi rather than parallel Not really sure whats so hard to understand,mpfpt6q,8.0,1k95429
comment,mpft1vx,im_thatoneguy,,1,2025-04-28 05:37:08,,,,I guess Im mostly struggling to understand where in 2001 USB 20 being faster than USB 10 fits into your situation Like is this a random anecdote from 1995 about the limitations of the early PowerPc platform and experimental software running terribly slow on it,mpfsfwe,9.0,1k95429
comment,mpdo419,Hansmolemon,,3,2025-04-27 21:21:38,,,,Not satire this was on a Motorola starmax Mac clone with a 603e processor and if I remember correctly 16 megs not gigs of ram There wasnt enough space on the hard drive to copy the audio file and have space for a swap drive which was necessary since it couldnt hold the audio file all in ram to process it and it couldnt rip directly from the audio disk This was roundabouts 1997 and that was actually a pretty decent rig for the time Though what I really wanted back then was a Mac 9600 with dual 604e processors and an ati rage 128 video card but that would have cost more than my car at the time,mpczxgn,4.0,1k95429

comment,mpec6zt,NeuHundred,,9,2025-04-27 23:35:58,,,,I have a certain nostalgia for the era where computer functions took time I would sit in my dads office for hours loading programs from disk drives when we got a new computer reading or watching TV between swaps and restarting Needing to watch the clock to sign off before spending too much time online downloading the filespages you want to read and maybe even printing them out bc others needed to use the computer too,mpbmabl,2.0,1k95429

comment,mpdblw4,im_thatoneguy,,6,2025-04-27 20:17:24,,,,Wut Thats total nonsense In 2001 I had SD card based mp3 players USB 10 was at worst 100KBs An MP3 was usually around 3000KB That would be like 30s per Mp3 An album would take at most 5 minutes or so to write,mpbmabl,2.0,1k95429

comment,mpe77fn,im_thatoneguy,,-1,2025-04-27 23:06:52,,,,Moving mp3s between computers implies you werent using USB you were networking so thats already suspect that something weird was happening So maybe you were using a 1KBs Ethernet cable even though 10000KBs networking was pretty standard by that point But the bottleneck would be the network connection not USB1 In 2001 we would have LAN parties and grab dozens of albums at a time Also moving a single album was less common in 2001 than grabbing an entire aformentioned mp3 collection Thats the beginning of the first iPod era so taking hours to move a single album would be crazy when mp3 players could hold 1000 songs Thats would take days to fill I dont know what you were doing in 2001 that was so slow but that was a U problem not a USB problem Edit also a quick search doesnt turn up any weird non standard ultra slow USB 10 network adapters which makes sense because why on earth would a business deploy some bizzaro token ring network or something when you could get 10100 Ethernet usb adapters,mpddko8,4.0,1k95429
comment,mpe8kir,RaymondBeaumont,,5,2025-04-27 23:14:49,,,,i was using a usb data transfer cable it was and still is an alternative to networking it would have taken you way less time to use google to find out what i said i was using was actually what i was using instead of all that its weird how invested you are in this even going so far as thinking nobody would have albums instead of just realizing that maybe things existed that werent good especially since you didnt even know the thing described existed,mpe77fn,5.0,1k95429

comment,mpdcdds,MSgtGunny,,5,2025-04-27 20:21:19,,,,Ok I think your comment was slightly misleading then Having either the connector or port be broken causing it not to behave correctly is expected Based on the thread it seemed you were saying that in certain situations a standard usb c cableport needed to be oriented a specific way All bets are off if things are broken If you look up a usbc pinout wiring diagram youll see that the ground and power pins are all symmetrical so you would need both the port and the cable to be faulty in similar ways to cause it to not support power delivery at least at the base 5v,mpczxt4,5.0,1k95429

comment,mph34t2,TheCrimsonDagger,,1,2025-04-28 12:46:40,,,,Not their fault The reason USBA is this way is because it made the port significantly cheaper which was important when convincing the big computer manufacturers like Dell to include it Its a chicken vs egg problem where nobody wants to pay to put a port on a computer than doesnt have any devices to use it with but also nobody wants to pay to have their device use a port that computers dont have,mpgys9a,2.0,1k95429

comment,mpiov08,TheCrimsonDagger,,1,2025-04-28 17:46:19,,,,Well it wasnt the only reason but it was a big one The reason it costs more is because you have to double the number of pins which also means double the number of wires So not only the port itself but also the cables become more expensive If you dont do this and have a symmetrical cable with more than 2 pins and plug it in the wrong way theres a good chance you fry something So you make an asymmetrical port that cant be plugged in backwards Another thing that increases cost is that by making the connectors double sided the manufacturing becomes more complicated with tighter tolerances required You could make the port bigger to give more room for error but thats going to increase material costs and take up more board real estate Then after the standard becomes accepted and cost doesnt matter as much nobody wants to switch to a different design because it breaks backwards compatibility Another reason it ended up this way is they just didnt realize it would be such a big issue At the time most connectors were trapezoidal in shape which made them easy to distinguish the correct orientation at a glance,mph8f4f,4.0,1k95429

comment,mpgso6b,mbergman42,,1,2025-04-28 11:33:32,,,,Odd article in that it sort of pretends that USB 10 wasnt a thing wasnt groundbreaking wasnt supported on Windows USB 20 was certainly an improvement and could do more faster but USB 10 brought the innovation of grouping multiple devices on a single connector And 12 Mbps was kind of a big deal at that time I get it that its USB 20s birthday its a little bit like one of the bridesmaids complaining that the wedding is all about the bride But not even mentioning where 20 came from USB 20 was incrementally better than 10 not something new that sprang out of the earth Kind of odd,,0.0,1k95429

comment,mpfw9yl,Ned_Sc,,2,2025-04-28 06:07:29,,,,Ignoring the obvious waste reduced by standardized devices that used USB for charging all sorts of products used their own propitiatory cables Digital cameras had their own cables Mac and PC keyboards required active adapters MP3 players various toys medical devices every manufacturer was just out there winging it People had drawers full of random cables for fear of needing that one specific one When you got rid of an old device all the cables that went with it were basically useless There was no confusion with USB cables for USB 20 You only needed to see the physical connector to see if one side was USBA or USBB USB 20 was still a 4 pin connector just like USB 10 and 11 It wasnt until USB 30 that you actually had different cables and worst case was that a 30 device would fall back to 20 speeds USBC has some issues that could have been avoided with mandated labeling on the cables themselves and using much saner namingversioning for to consumers but even then USBC helped replace all of the different chargers for higher powered devices like laptops The idea that it caused waste is just pantsonhead Things were far worse before USB was around,mpfv5pb,3.0,1k95429
