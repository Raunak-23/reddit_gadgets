comment,n23kv54,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,28,2025-07-09 01:50:43,,,,I guess if youre Ok with he limits of a Chromebook but want something nice then this might make sense But I dont think most people would want to spend this much on a computer and then run into limitations of what you can do because it doesnt run a more feature complete operating system like Windows or Mac OS,,0.0,1lv6h74
comment,n23pmol,CandyCrisis,,16,2025-07-09 02:17:28,,,,When I was working at Google I had a really highend Chromebook for a while and it was actually way more capable than I expected I kind of miss it,n23kv54,1.0,1lv6h74
comment,n290a95,misak_,,9,2025-07-09 21:14:25,,,,you miss Google Pixelbook Maybe Ive used some kind of different one but it SUCKED for remote work during covid Small screen for the form factor lowend camera it would overheat during calls and grind to a halt if I tried to present anything It had Intel i7 CPU so it should be capable right Nope that was just a deceptive marketing as i77Y75 is on par with i37100U when it comes to performance I would often choose Gmail Basic HTML because even the standard Gmail webapp could be laggy I do not miss it,n23pmol,2.0,1lv6h74
comment,n29et8k,CandyCrisis,,4,2025-07-09 22:27:13,,,,I always plugged it into a 4K monitor I heard others talk about overheating but mine never had that issue Maybe I just got lucky,n290a95,3.0,1lv6h74
comment,n269dl9,RoundTableMaker,,-16,2025-07-09 13:38:19,,,,I dont really know what the limitations are at this point Almost everything can be ran in the cloud What are people running into as limitations If i need anything serious i will run on a vps Yea gaming is crap but its crap on macbooks and windows computers You end up on Nvidia streaming service for all of them And even if you get a laptop with a gpu its going to be trash in a year or two,n23kv54,1.0,1lv6h74

comment,n26ac8l,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,4,2025-07-09 13:43:15,,,,If youre going to pay for a VPS then go ahead but thats an extra cost that you have to pay monthly My son has a Windows Laptop and it plays games just fine Mostly Marvel Rivals right now Lots of other games run fine too Its a year and a half old at this point and has zero problems Chromebooks are fine if they fit your needs but theres a lot of stuff that just works better local I like to be able to do various programming tasks using locally installed databases and Visual Studio or other IDEs,n269dl9,2.0,1lv6h74

comment,n23s6ul,PresentSquirrel,,9,2025-07-09 02:32:21,,,,For the same price as the cheapo chromebooks that kids got in school do you honestly think anything windows would be any better I bought a 300 chromebook and it has been very pleasant to use No hiccups even with 15 tabs open and music streaming and an external monitor plugged in as well,n23qdsj,1.0,1lv6h74

comment,n262sa9,Matty9180,,4,2025-07-09 13:02:57,,,,It 100 depends on your use case I personally will never buy a chrome book but for people that are just using them for basic computer functions they should be just fine,n23y5or,3.0,1lv6h74

comment,n2n68sd,Manderlin99,,2,2025-07-11 23:56:06,,,,This Chromebook is very appealing for someone who travels a lot and is focused on little more than writing and consuming media entertainment Its simplicity is its appeal,,0.0,1lv6h74

comment,n2i48f7,crymachine,,1,2025-07-11 06:04:02,,,,Im still using my original Chromebook flip because its portable and does what I need it to when Im out but god damn Every so often I go and look how old it is how much it costs and then cant believe what these modern do nothing devices cost,,0.0,1lv6h74
comment,n6457kn,Lee_Benj003,,1,2025-07-31 05:26:44,,,,The new king for doing simple tasks Id say ChromeOS seems more for the simpler stuff like browsing and using some AI and ChatGPT maybe playing some light games and working across the Google Workspace which I mostly use for work its great Overall a device for someone who wants something simpler for work and can do so within its limits And I dont really need that but for those so who do it looks good enough I havent really heard of heating issues or battery issues in this one but one issue is that the speakers are not up to the mark compared to the rest of the hardware Its portable and comfortable to carry too Its great that they used an OLED screen not super bright for working outside but solid otherwise The camera isnt a highlight but Chromebooks arent cameracentric devices anyway As for performance the Kompanio Ultra SoC is fast and smooth and UFS4 and 256 storage are good the essentials for good performance have been given The battery is a highlight Ive heard it lasts almost a full day of work and some overnight They couldve given microSD but the headphone jack is there at least I wouldnt have minded something like this in Uni edit grammar,,0.0,1lv6h74
comment,n2vqrci,Nail_Biterr,,1,2025-07-13 11:27:37,,,,Ive always thought of a Chromebook to be kind of like a 150 webbased computer But for 750 couldnt you just get an actual laptop,,0.0,1lv6h74

comment,n4o891n,olismismi,,0,2025-07-23 07:21:08,,,,from the moment you see its sleek design and vibrant 14inch OLED screen you know its something special The displays sharp 1920x1200 resolution paired with a 1610 aspect ratio makes working streaming or just browsing really enjoyable everything looks crisp and colorful Whats impressive is how smooth this Chromebook runs with Mediatek chip inside I wasnt expecting the kind of performance that feels close to highend Intel or AMD machines but it handles multitasking with ease and stays cool without a noisy fan The battery life is a bonus easily lasting through a full day of heavy use which makes it perfect for students or professionals on the go The keyboard and overall build quality feel premium without the bulk and little touches like the fingerprint sensor and Dolby Atmos support add to the experience Plus AI powered features Lenovo rolled out make managing tabs and projects way easier So yeah plus 14 strikes a great balance of power portability and style definitely worth checking out if you want a smooth and premium ChromeOS experience,,0.0,1lv6h74
comment,n4o8nm2,BrownLucas123,,0,2025-07-23 07:24:53,,,,This is really a great chromebook My sister Lora has it she visited me a week ago she cant stop bragging about the overall performance She said during the sleepover she tried to play some songs in her chromebook and with quad speakers with Dolby Atmos its really amazing With Kompanio Ultra SoC and long battery life the Lenovo chromebooks 14 Plus is amazing I guess if I ever change my current one I will replace with this one,,0.0,1lv6h74
