comment,n5rbdd5,arthousepsycho,,5,2025-07-29 08:21:14,,,,Interesting reason that started Early in the internet people were gaming the search results by hiding an enormous list of every keyword people might search for on their pages meaning they would get suggested for any query So the algorithm was tweaked to avoid suggesting pages with just lists of stuff which then also impacted recipes that were just seen as lists by the programs so they added the stories to stop them being auto cut out of results Really did get out of hand after a while Ive read about so many dead grandmas,n5prew4,2.0,1mbxl2y

comment,n5r2z7v,Kiki1701,,2,2025-07-29 07:00:54,,,,Youd think that with all the household connectivity in 24GHz someone would be first to get OFF AND MOVE AWAY FROM IT Theres just too much shit cluttering up that frequency in todays home Doorbells Alexa monitor cams the more the merrier in some upscale homes headsets etc The amount of clutter on todays home internet server makes for a difficult So if something wanted to be truly better theyd find a different frequency to use that isnt on everything elses Am I stupid for thinking this Edit If so why I just learned that frequencies are highly regulated Any other reasons,,0.0,1mbxl2y
comment,n5raruq,PhasmaFelis,,8,2025-07-29 08:15:21,,,,Im not sure theyre allowed to Theres heavy regulations on what frequencies wifi is allowed to transmit on for example,n5r2z7v,1.0,1mbxl2y

comment,n684gey,Neo_Techni,,1,2025-07-31 19:57:53,,,,I just learned that frequencies are highly regulated Any other reasons To prevent interference with other devices Parts of the spectrum are dedicated to specific things others are purchased,n5r2z7v,1.0,1mbxl2y
comment,n68e8pk,Kiki1701,,2,2025-07-31 20:43:54,,,,But arent there a boatload of frequencies I mean theres an entire spectrum of them I dont know shit about this obviously but the reason I asked is because I get all kinds of overlap in my home from too many things loaded in the 24GHz to such an extent that my cable guy told me that this happens a lot in homes because so many things are piggybacked on that frequency And it must be a serious problem with gamers who have a ton of shit on their computers plus the other stuff in the home like cams doorbells Alexas etc Im guessing that the military has hijacked a bunch of them and then theres the sciences telescopes lasers and so forth but theres still a huge spectrum So whats left for the consumer We have 24 but we also have 50 and 60 What happened to 60 Theyre in a few phones but I dont see it that often anymore,n684gey,2.0,1mbxl2y
comment,n68gsrz,Neo_Techni,,1,2025-07-31 20:55:57,,,,But arent there a boatload of frequencies No Its why things use 24 and not 25 The area around a frequency causes interference too So theres some blocks and some blocks are owned by companies Others dedicated to specific things ie military purposes the flight industry And then after a certain frequencyamplitude the things just become EMPs and can interfere with wired devices,n68e8pk,3.0,1mbxl2y
