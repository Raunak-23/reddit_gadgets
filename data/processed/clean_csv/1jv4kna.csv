comment,mm8c6oi,Spanky2k,,28,2025-04-09 15:58:59,,,,Itll all come back just with higher prices to factor in the tariffs America cant build this stuff It doesnt have the factories it doesnt have the worked knowledge it doesnt have the refineries for the raw materials and in many cases it doesnt even have the raw materials it would need in the ground It also doesnt have 10 years to try to build all the infrastructure it would need to even be able to produce this stuff at home in a perfect world Manufacturers will continue to build this stuff in china but they will just raise prices and try to reduce costs cut as many corners as possible to try to keep the prices slightly lower Unless everything is rolled back basically now Americans will be buying tech manufactured in China in a years time for double the price and with 50 of the component quality,mm7mx6j,1.0,1jv4kna
comment,mmgbfs8,878_Throwaway____,,9,2025-04-10 20:44:24,,,,I was just watching a review of the Light phone 3 and in the review the reviewer talked about how this 700 phone was the product of a 16 person shop in Brooklyn Obviously using imported industry standard phone parts Whats a tariff going to do for a company like that Kill it The cost of the phone is a luxury and with tariffs it becomes an impossibility 16 advanced economy American workers will be out of a job Even the fear of something like that would stop me from buying a product knowing that theres a real risk its going to be unsupported soon Reminds me of the Fisker electric cars This economic shock will just kill a whole bunch of small innovative American companies who cant afford to onshore manufacturing or bribe the president,mm8c6oi,2.0,1jv4kna
comment,mmgyc6l,Spanky2k,,8,2025-04-10 22:46:26,,,,Yeah exactly The big companies will have been able to stockpile goods ahead of the tariffs coming in but thats just not possible for small companies Everyones been trying to do exactly that and the ports have been clogged up as a result The big companies have their own logistics though just look at Apple and its last minute flights with high value items Meanwhile Trump openly brags about how two of his buddies made billions through his stock manipulation The ultra rich are making money hand over fist through all this Everyone else be they poor or rich suffers But theyre not who Trump and his Republican buddies care about Its honestly unbelievable at how successful the Republicans have been in convincing those worst off in society to vote against their own interests,mmgbfs8,3.0,1jv4kna

comment,mmb1jiv,beefjerky9,,6,2025-04-10 00:15:46,,,,Counterpoint I had a razer blade 14 that was by far the least reliable laptop Ive owned Expanded battery in less than a year that deformed the trackpad a defective screen not long after that and a defective fan not long after that And even ignoring that we shouldnt forget about the deficiencies of the design broken Thunderbolt that was unreliable poor cooling design that required the fans to sound like a jet engine if you dared actually use the laptop hot enough chassis to nearly burn you despite the ridiculous fan situation I feel like theres something else Im missing too but Ive been free of that monstrosity for awhile now I dont think Id ever buy another razer product after that fiasco,mm95avk,2.0,1jv4kna
