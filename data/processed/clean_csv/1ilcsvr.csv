comment,mbuhbzj,CoasterThot,,69,2025-02-09 15:12:11,,,,Im blind and this is great People keep saying why not stay home and listen to the radio Would you want to be stuck in your house all the time,,0.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbunign,None,,39,2025-02-09 15:43:53,,,,Exactly People seem to have this strange notion that disabled people seek convenience over an experience,mbuhbzj,1.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbuwwow,shadowscar00,,32,2025-02-09 16:29:42,,,,Ive got a mobility disability not a visual one but people say this same fuckin shit Why dont you just instacart your groceries instead of taking up space in the line Idk Deborah maybe I like saying hello to my favorite cashiers and checking out the meat and bakery sales Disabled people arent halfpeople We deserve the luxury of being in public and taking up our own space,mbunign,2.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbv8d8a,Punman_5,,6,2025-02-09 17:23:25,,,,Also online shopping for groceries is always a bit of a crap shoot You basically cant trust them for produce and meats because theyll never be as fickle as you would be when it comes to quality We just ordered some groceries yesterday and when we picked them up the lettuce was all bad They just pick the first one without really checking,mbuwwow,3.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mc2dmbr,shadowscar00,,2,2025-02-10 19:27:18,,,,Dont forget the classic theyre out of stock in produce I asked for two bulbs of garlic it was immediately refunded as out of stock as soon as the instacart person got the order along with a few others I sent my partner to the store the garlic bin was FULL Or substitutions Asked for a gallon of whole milk had my substitutions as other whole milks there was no way the store had 0 gallons of any of the 7 brands of whole milk they carry This guy brought me almond milk I have a fucking nut allergy,mbv8d8a,4.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbvwp7o,None,,3,2025-02-09 19:16:11,,,,Yeah Ive got a handful of mental disabilities that make being in public a workout and people say why dont you just do insert anything that would isolate me Because I want to be around people even if its hard Even if Im hallucinating and extremely paranoid I still want to be around others,mbuwwow,3.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbyinuz,youzongliu,,2,2025-02-10 03:32:18,,,,Honestly that sounds pretty nice I dont have any impairments but I would much rather stay at home and play video games all day and have my groceries delivered to me rather than going outside if I can afford it lol,mbuwwow,3.0,1ilcsvr

comment,mbypci6,RednRoses,,1,2025-02-10 04:14:25,,,,When a person struggling to be treated like a full person who should be included in every day life that the rest of the world gets to take for granted the correct response isnt to say that the issue theyre facing sounds good to you especially since it isnt a choice theyre making but a legitimate and incredibly isolating experience,mbyorcw,6.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mbyq0r8,youzongliu,,1,2025-02-10 04:18:52,,,,I dont take it for granted I enjoy being isolated and thats the opinion I voiced Im sure their situation is tough but why does that prevent me from sharing my perspective Maybe they feel more relatable knowing that I choose to be isolated,mbypci6,7.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mc39c3o,CoasterThot,,2,2025-02-10 23:16:27,,,,No I dont relate to you at all because I constantly cry that Im not allowed to do the things sighted people can do I would love to grocery shop without help or be allowed to drive a car or to be able to pick out my own clothes at the store Instead Im housebound not out of laziness or fault but because I am blind and I cant drive a car in a carcentric country that doesnt give one single fuck about blind people,mbyq0r8,8.0,1ilcsvr
comment,mc2cyrt,shadowscar00,,1,2025-02-10 19:24:11,,,,Nah I feel like that was pretty tone deaf People treat me like Im a waste of space less than human and like I dont deserve to be in public man that sounds great Im complaining about something that seriously negatively impacts my life and how others mistreat me All you could read was instacart I dont want to use instacart I can but there is an independence that I deserve to feel when I can go pick out my own oranges or speak to the butcher or check out sales I will gladly trade you my constant pain gastrointestinal issues mobility issues mental health issues and everything fucking else and you can have instacart so that you can stay home and play video games Ill take your able body so I can reach shelves without help do more than one chore a day walk outside without worrying about accessibility and exist in public spaces without being deemed an immediate nuisance,mbyq0r8,8.0,1ilcsvr

comment,mbv3pkl,CoasterThot,,10,2025-02-09 17:01:35,,,,Again being around others is the entire point Also listening to something be described to you is much different than having the autonomy to check the score yourself when you want and keeping up with tactile feedback in real time Theyre completely different experiences Listening to the radio is like having someone read to you boring,mbv3cdt,2.0,1ilcsvr
