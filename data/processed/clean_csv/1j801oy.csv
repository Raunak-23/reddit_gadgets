comment,mh3xxws,FlyingBishop,,-15,2025-03-10 23:06:46,,,,Thats some both sides bullshit Trump isnt just attacking liberals hes also attacking Japan and pretty much every decent person in the world over bullshit Some things are inherently political Trump starting trade wars is a direct attack on this sort of thing He hasnt directly attacked Japan like this but my beef with Trump is precisely because he wants to stop us from importing nice things from our friends in Canada And obviously Japan too when he thinks of it,mh1byz1,1.0,1j801oy

comment,mh1k1zf,scswift,,56,2025-03-10 16:14:19,,,,Toyota made Miraidon but its kinda lame because they didnt make the wheels functional Koraidon looks better built and the legs appear to be mounted to motors so they can move Im not sure if they can just move down to make it stand or if theyre intended to move as if walking I believe they said the intention was to have it appear to walk,mh1ht2s,2.0,1j801oy

comment,mh2rwg1,Jiopaba,,-1,2025-03-10 19:39:58,,,,Im always torn between this is neat and who cares Its cool that some Motorcycle designers want to do a specialist project but other than knowing that in theory at least one realworld scale model of Koraidon which is actually a motorcycle exists and is probably going to be a show piece put on a display stand somewhere it has no impact on me at all When I see something like this I get a few seconds of how cool followed by the enormous disappointment of knowing that this is almost certainly going to be a oneoff art piece and there is not the slightest chance in heck that Ill ever be able to get my hands on one The Miraidon one was even worse when Toyota I think did it because I dont believe that was even a functioning motorcycle that you could ride around on,,0.0,1j801oy
