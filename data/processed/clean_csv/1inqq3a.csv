comment,mcie2it,veryniceperson123,,-6,2025-02-13 06:28:38,,,,And you get every cent that you dont pay for Anyway AWS being expensive is somewhat of a canard Its true if you are doing a lift and shift but their managed services when leveraged properly are extremely costeffective And Azure barely even competes there,mcibwa8,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcilz4b,Ikea9000,,6,2025-02-13 07:43:41,,,,Meh The services I use in Azure has been roughly as solid as the ones I use in AWS Both works fine most of the time Both fails pretty regularly AWS definitively have managed stuff which is much much more expensive than available Azure options S3 is enormously much more expensive than some Azure options as an example I feel you dont know what youre talking about Do you use both in your job,mcie2it,7.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcio8gv,veryniceperson123,,-2,2025-02-13 08:06:59,,,,I use Azure extensively unfortunately including managing marketplace offers for a large org for many years now Its hot garbage S3 is not really the kind of managed service people are referring to when they talk about lift and shift vs cloud native architecture Illustrates pretty clearly who doesnt know what they are talking about here so I wont be wasting any more of my time with this conversation,mcilz4b,8.0,1inqq3a
comment,mciq4hl,Ikea9000,,1,2025-02-13 08:26:45,,,,S3 is a managed service typically not used in a straight lift and shift Wasnt this the type of service where you argued that AWS would be cheaper,mcio8gv,9.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcgn6rc,TryingT0Wr1t3,,15,2025-02-13 00:00:01,,,,Old outlook was much more powerful new outlook has less features and is more tied to outlook in the enterprise cloud When I moved from Lotus to old outlook I could at least get some of the folders and automation I had going but new outlook had a look and feel that isnt practical has tons of issues with scaling and it seems it has less things or things moved around too much I was forced recently to move to its interface and I dislike it a lot I would be happier using Thunderbird if I could,mce1zoa,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdqtac,sorrylilsis,,19,2025-02-12 15:46:41,,,,Kinect was actually an acquisition of an Israeli startup MS actually did a pretty good job at both reducing the cost of the hardware and doing some software around it It ended up gimmicky but from a hardware POV Pretty impressive features considering the costs There was a reason why it ended up incredibly popular in research circles The Surface line is pretty much second to none in the PC world when it comes to build quality and finish one of the few that rival with Apple It has its issues they usually lag behind in terms of adoption of new chips by several months but all in all Pretty much the best PCtablet hybrid you can find on the market for the last decade They have kinda abandoned it since last year but their PC accessories line was usually pretty damn good too Another example that I have is their whole line of hardware aimed towards handicapped people Its been a silent game changer for a lot of people They may not have met a lot of commercial success in the last few years but in terms of hardware MS has been a top tier player since the 80s If anything its more the software that has been dragging them down,mcdn8l4,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdrzvs,CT4nk3r,,10,2025-02-12 15:52:24,,,,The hardware itself was good for windows phones surface and xbox its just that the marketing is so shit you dont even know what the new surface is and then if you try to buy and use one you realize you have to use windows or just there are not enough good apps for it to function well locked down microsoft store only windows installation,mcdn8l4,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcd8kyu,dandroid126,,40,2025-02-12 14:12:09,,,,Now they are after decades of success I wouldnt call that a huge failure The first two Xbox consoles were massively successful It was after that someone else came in and started making horrible decisions,mcd7gh5,4.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdzq2b,tobi1k,,6,2025-02-12 16:29:16,,,,Decades of success Is 1 plural The original Xbox launched in 20012002 the Xbox 360 in 2005 and the Xbox One in 2013 Even the Xbox and 360 were outsold by their competitors Definitely not massively successful,mcd8kyu,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcebljb,Punman_5,,3,2025-02-12 17:25:06,,,,Xbox 360 was only really outsold by the Wii with which it wasnt really in direct competition,mcdzq2b,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcednep,tobi1k,,4,2025-02-12 17:34:46,,,,No it was outsold by the PS3 as well despite having a massive lead due to releasing earlier and being cheaper,mcebljb,7.0,1inqq3a

comment,mchcyi2,tobi1k,,1,2025-02-13 02:19:45,,,,Why do you think they stopped reporting numbers And VGchartz arent the only ones to report that the PS3 outsold the 360,mcgxh20,9.0,1inqq3a
comment,mchn5gj,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-02-13 03:17:45,,,,Same reason nobody else is reporting sales of hardware from 2000 yet Sony kept reporting the meagre PS2 sales until 2023 because literally nobody except Sony and console warrior fanboys cares lol this whole thread is based off the flawed premise of a guy denying the 360 was successful due to it being outsold by the PS3 and Wii when that has nothing to do with anything it actually DID help Microsoft gain their foothold in the home entertainment space,mchcyi2,10.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcgimgj,tricheb0ars,,0,2025-02-12 23:35:02,,,,That doesnt mean it wasnt profitable,mcednep,8.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcgyy2y,tricheb0ars,,1,2025-02-13 01:03:21,,,,Things can not be a best seller and be massively successful For instance mobile phones Lot more androids out there but Im pretty sure Apple is making money hand over fist Yalls idea that if you aint first your last is ridiculous If something is profitable its successful full stop,mcgnke9,10.0,1inqq3a
comment,mch8xeo,tobi1k,,1,2025-02-13 01:57:12,,,,I mean the Xbox 360 was literally last Your comparison of Apple makes no sense because Android is an operating system not a mobile phone seller Something can be not profitable and a massive success eg Uber and something can make a profit and be a failure eg box office films which barely break even The Xbox and Xbox 360 werent failures but they were not massive successes in the context of their competitors The same way Motorola androids arent failures but theyre not massive successes given the market dominance Samsung and Applehave,mcgyy2y,11.0,1inqq3a
comment,mch9wzx,tricheb0ars,,1,2025-02-13 02:02:45,,,,Uber makes money Listen to the acquired podcast about the company Also venture capitalism has nothing to do with what we are taking about Profit Thats the marker of successful products My understanding is all the Xboxs are sold at a loss yet make money long term through software sales Please list any sources you have stating the Xbox division is a failure Id love to read about it Ive been reading about recent bad sales figures but original Xbox and Xbox 360 and even the Xbox one The financials make it seem like expensive purchases are why Microsoft isnt as profitable in 20242025 Activision Blizzard was expensive Gotta be one of the biggest purchases ever in gaming Xbox cloud investments should be tied to azure in my opinion not gaming,mch8xeo,12.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcgc42r,RoySFNR,,1,2025-02-12 23:01:02,,,,Xbox 360 was more a timing thing than a display of hardware excellence The 360 was by far the most unreliable of the three home consoles with their red ring issues,mcebljb,7.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcebeoj,None,,0,2025-02-12 17:24:13,,,,Remember first Reddit is its own echo chamber and has been wrong about A LOT of things going on in the real world Its been proven so many times Here we have competent and tech savvy people but Gen pop is incredibly stupid Go to the airport or mall and spend some time look at the arguments for how many people are functionally illiterate Theres a reason theyre confused beyond just using google And then google newest Xbox and see if it doesnt pull up the 2 s and x current consoles And when you did this a couple years ago you also got the Xbox one Xbox one s Xbox one x series s and series x Its not hard to see how normal parents who dont care about games didnt know which was which People always say this because it was extremely confusing for a couple years So parents got their kids ps5 Its too late to judge it now that they discontinued the old consoles and cleaned up the search engine results,mce35ep,9.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcef4dm,boyyouguysaredumb,,2,2025-02-12 17:41:36,,,,Again that doesnt seem like something thats happening Mom i want the new xbox I couldnt figure out which one was the newest so I did some research and found out they have a competitor called play station and i looked up what the newest one of those was and I ordered it instead Any mom going to physically shop for presents would just ask the person working in that department which was the newest one and they would be fine And yes if you google what is the newest xbox the Series X S comes up immediately and theres no confusion at all,mcebeoj,10.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcehw2z,None,,1,2025-02-12 17:54:23,,,,Kids dont tend to care if they get one console over the other 10 year olds arent arguing for the posterity and loyalty of their favorite console brand If mom who doesnt pay attention to consoles goes online for pricing and sees that one console has 5 similar options and one console has 12 options then they could always ask the kid if they wouldnt mind one or the other And the ten year old kid wont know which Xbox is the new Xbox s x or sx Its not that hard to grasp Youre arguing from a point of understanding the tech with todays lense If you werent there when it dropped then its hard to explain how confused people were by the naming scheme,mcef4dm,11.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcgv0jz,MrSirViking,,1,2025-02-13 00:42:22,,,,The problem for Microsoft is that if you have a good gaming PC there is ZERO reason to get an Xbox Like all of the games on Xbox you can get on PC Where as a lot of PlaystationNintendo games you cant get on PC and so gives more reason to buy a PlaystationNintendo over an Xbox if you own a good gamer PC Which is probably why Sony and Nintendo outsells Xbox,mcd79d6,3.0,1inqq3a
comment,mci1swh,theartificialkid,,1,2025-02-13 04:50:43,,,,You can see how fucked up it is for the planet though right to say we need to make our games exclusive to our locked down gaming box so that even people who have a high end desktop that would run them better will have a reason to buy another box of metal and plastic that consumes electricity If we were optimising as a species while still allowing games all games would be playable across all suitably powerful platforms,mcgv0jz,4.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcnhwcv,MrSirViking,,1,2025-02-14 00:54:37,,,,Sure but then Consoles would likely not really be a thing They made sense back in the day when computers that could really play games where 5000 dollars in the 80ties and 90ties And so buying a Nintendo Entertainment System for 300 dollar or what ever was much smarter and it played just as good games These days when you can get a decent PC for 1500 dollars that can do much more than gaming buying a console when you could play those games just as well on a PC would make little sense Which is why people with a gaming PC would not buy an Xbox they buy a Nintendo or a Playstation instead If all of the PlaystationNintendo games all played on PC as well most consoles would go bust real quickly,mci1swh,5.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcemelv,DarthBuzzard,,2,2025-02-12 18:15:21,,,,Problem is if we went with the full immersive neural interface version your IRL body would be literally inactive during your time in VR thats even greater isolation I dont really think the headset isolation problem is going to be much of a problem as it matures Bit of an issue today but the tech has made strides in recent years and will continue to do so where headsets will easily allow you to see your petsfamily around you while immersed in VR by having them overlayed into the experience when nearby and of course theres MR functionality where you can always see the real world Of course I wouldnt suggest you go play some crazy 360 degree VR boxing game with a pet in the room even with such tech but its not like you couldnt use the VR headset for its many other applications It would just be a small minority of gamesapps that wouldnt work well in a circumstance like that Most of my VR and most of my friends VR usage is done seated sometimes laying in bed The size weight and hassle are definitely issues but they will be solved many decades before VR works through a neural interface,mcekz6x,8.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcebto0,ZgBlues,,5,2025-02-12 17:26:11,,,,Well VR always had a limited use case scenario And we have had many technologies like that in the past Does anyone remember the push to sell us 3D TVs But still I can see VR having some application and user base in video games But even then there will be very few developers who will spend a fortune on developing fully fledged VR games On PlayStation 5 VR is basically just a Gran Turismo 7 controller maybe Resident Evil too And thats it For productivity AR was always a better bet But again developing anything for AR is vastly more expensive than just making an iPad app or whatever Its been years and years and years and barely anything other than expensive tech demos was ever made for AR So there is a sliver for hope for VR But probably not even that for AR,mcdfpog,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mced32v,agitatedprisoner,,1,2025-02-12 17:32:06,,,,Theres lots of money in a good enough ARVR headset The reason it hasnt caught on yet is because the headset has to be lightweight and comfortable to wear for hours without it bothering you and because there has to be a flagship application or game The tech with Apples headset might be good enough but it was too heavy and lacked that flagship application Otherwise I expect it wouldve caught on Get one to catch on at the high end 3000 price tag and the cost can come down later But if itd double as headphonesTV I expect lots of people would pay 3000 for one that all those criteria Make the compute and battery detachable so you can run a power cord to it to make it lighter maybe,mcdfpog,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mce43xv,hamiltonisoverrat3d,,7,2025-02-12 16:49:57,,,,Well the current device was never meant to be a mass production device They should have just called it a developer unit to begin with The hard part is you need entire product and engineering teams working on multiple different devices concurrently So Apple surely already had teams working on both VR and AR devices So youre right but I would not read into it And while Meta sells a good number of units they never share daily usage numbers A lot of them sit on shelves or just come out for short sessions of 3D video content of you know what I mean,mcdd1vw,3.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcfl21p,Morialkar,,1,2025-02-12 20:54:37,,,,The hard part is you need entire product and engineering teams working on multiple different devices concurrently And in todays landscape companies have less and less the freedom to release a new product category like AR without having an OS providing a large SDK for developers What I mean by that is when the iPhone released and even to a point subsequently the iPad it was in a semi gated way where very little that youd use on a computer would work out of the box The initial iPhone only supported phone maps and web browsing and the web was far from rich on the first iPhones But it was still inovative enough to bring in the masses and let them take more time to bring everything together in the next couple iterations and for the iPad early the SDK wasnt that far from the iOS one so very little work in comparison to provide it to devs it was treated like a large iPod Touch for a while and competition didnt really start directly until Google came in and developed a large offering of apps for Android which is when Apple actually started facing comparable competition in the space The Watch segment had the advantage of being a lower function device so you can get most of the benefits of owning one without installing any apps on it since the OS health data offering allowed syncing their data back to the phone app in the worst cases But this this is a totally different paradigm stuck between gaming entertainment and work not unlike the PC but in a way that is thoroughly more invasive to your personal space both in the way the information is presented and in the way it impacts your experience of the world I believe its gonna take a while and well need something that is way less in the way like the Google Glasses were for this to become more ubiquitous but I agree with you them leaving those spaces every other year and coming back be it MS Apple Meta or others is nothing more than them trying to see what form will stick Once one of those becomes actually mass produced we can expect all the others to follow suit and have that segment start becoming identical,mce43xv,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcfhhxc,rebbsitor,,1,2025-02-12 20:38:25,,,,It was meant to 1 get developers building on the platform For a consumer facing product that only works if you have an install base Otherwise why would someone waste their time developing on a device that no one has This can for a device thats designed to be sold to businesses and integrated into things and not sold to consumers but the way Apple Vision was marketed it sure seems like its meant to be a consumer device If you want to get developers using a device you send them one early on before release like a year or so so they can develop on it and have stuff ready for the device launch Its like Nintendos Switch 2 thats coming out this year Developers have had the devkits for it for some time already so on launch day there will be third party games for it,mcen6qn,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcfk9j6,hamiltonisoverrat3d,,1,2025-02-12 20:51:02,,,,You develop for the platform first and the specific device second For most XR apps this is Unity as the game engine but each platform has specific services like spatial anchoring streaming rendering etc Apple can do this because they are the most lucrative mobile platform to develop for Future devices need content and developers need to build for the platform to ensure good content is made and there is enough of it Emerging tech paradigms are different so dont think like this a new phone or tablet Its a fundamentally different modality of computing Source worked in XR for a half decade,mcfhhxc,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcfpdyr,rebbsitor,,1,2025-02-12 21:14:16,,,,Emerging tech paradigms are different so dont think like this a new phone or tablet Its a fundamentally different modality of computing I know Ive worked with a number of VR and AR devices starting going back to the Oculus Rift DK1DK2 and HTC Vive The thing is that developing for the platformengine isnt enough The input and interaction is so different from common modalities keyboard and mouse gamepad etc that its hard to develop something that works in VRAR and also on a traditional device At least its hard to develop something that takes advantage of what an XR system offers if you plan to use the content on something else The best experiences are going to be built to take advantage of the device Its a lot of effort to spin up something new like this and get 3rd parties on board unless they have another source of funding In my case most of my companys funding is for RD and were paid by our customers to develop applications for researching use cases without regard for a consumer market for them Its much harder to spend hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars developing software that may or may not sell in a consumer market If a companys trying to do that they aim for a platform with a large install base so theres at least potential for profit,mcfk9j6,7.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdz97k,alidan,,1,2025-02-12 16:27:04,,,,because they stopped making full custom silicon for consoles and went with a more universal approach there is very VERY little differentiating a console from a pc at this point other than hardware specific os,mcdo070,6.0,1inqq3a

comment,mceqtjo,alidan,,1,2025-02-12 18:35:36,,,,consoles are expensive because not every aspect of silicon manufacturing scales down linearly using off the shelf parts granted put together in custom way and not full custom solutions actually brings the cost down quite a bit if you want to look at something very interesting the original xbox was actually a pc about 800 worth of pc at the time it came out this was microsofts oh shit we require something now burn money moment,mcen5k2,8.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcemjia,JebusChrust,,1,2025-02-12 18:15:59,,,,Microsoft literally gave away HiFi Rush and Pentiment was a cheap passion project by Josh Sawyer that was critically acclaimed but not anything to ride on Microsoft at this point is trying to recoup lost money by going multiplatform and pushing universal Game Pass over being a console competitor If rumors are correct that they are pursuing a Steam Deck next console then they basically are changing who their competition is,mce8b5e,11.0,1inqq3a

comment,mce7sjk,jaaval,,1,2025-02-12 17:07:11,,,,In addition to just the basic 3d stuff you have to think about things like calibrating camera parameters in real time with changing temperature because otherwise your virtual parts wont properly align with the real world And in most of the imagined future applications sort of there with just a little bit of swaying and misalignment isnt good enough it has to be practically perfect VR is easy because you dont really need to be precise mixed reality stuff is a lot more difficult,mcdylcz,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcebjgf,onyxengine,,6,2025-02-12 17:24:50,,,,I think its a problem big companies dont really want to throw money at solving They have so much going on already they make forays into some tech and then cancel everything for numerous reasons related to quarterly reports stock price reprioritizing stuff based on trends Look at OpenAi there is no obvious reason microsoft facebook google etc should have not beaten openai to the commercialization of ai Corporations become beaurcratic and risk averse An entrenched corporation is actually one of the worst places to look when it comes to predicting future trends They have too many resources and little attention for much more than the bottom line on the services that generate them revenue Its a common theme in tech the players most equipped to usher in the next gen in innovation fail to do so though they attempt to Generally when they see the writing on the wall they just throw money at the horse race Institutions stabilize and then stagnate Their personnel are capped on personal investment managers micromanage and remove energy for exploration Ecosystems are proprietary so as a dev you cant really seek outside perspectives Game changing innovations create big corporations not vice versa My bet AR gets delivered by a team of people who crack a single problem in the approach and see the long game in terms of value,mcdvu2x,3.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdvd44,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-02-12 16:08:32,,,,You dont need open space for VR Only select VR games which accounts for a pretty small percentage of VRs overall applications In some ways having a small space might be a reason to buy VR I know I cant fit a movie theater let alone 3 monitors in my room but I can get that with VR Nausea can be fixed as the hardware matures specifically on the opticsdisplay stack side because its hard to move at the speed you wantneed while holding the door handle with your hand since youre not expected to move IRL those sorts of issues could only really be solved through a neural interface that doesnt need you to actually move anything to work Those can be fixed in software Valve has talked about the door problem and VR and how it worked on making it intuitive through its software design Sleek force feedback haptic gloves would also go a long way,mcdunct,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdy1c5,LightVelox,,1,2025-02-12 16:21:20,,,,Almost every single VR game has you moving and looking around so you need atleast enough space to be able to reach out and swing your hands in any direction without hitting anything so atleast a wingspan of free space and we should probably add atleast 50cm or so of safe space so if you bend over rotate or take a small step you still wont hit stuff Thats already quite some space for most small homes you can probably find that space somewhere in your house but almost definitely not in your room andor in front of your computer so that alones already rules out most VR headsets since they arent standalone like Quest 3 and the Vision Pro that by itself is already a hassle that you wont have with almost any other electronic VR has a bunch of these small issues that compound to make your experience not as seamless as youd want like how hand tracking usually wont work outside of your field of view and taking your headset out and putting it back will usually move everything around since it wont perfectly remember where everything was spatially or how most VR headsets wont work on mostly unlit areas,mcdvd44,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mce2rxf,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-02-12 16:43:44,,,,The vast majority of VR headsets that are sold are standalone More and more games are allowing seated play A most recent example is Batman Arkham Shadow a AAA game where you do tons of punching It sounds like youd need lots of space on paper but in practice it works fine in a small space And these requirements are mostly a games thing I dont need to worry about punching things if Im using VR for attending live events or socializing with friends On your last paragraph I agree theres plenty of issues there but that can all be totally ironed out as it progresses,mcdy1c5,7.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcde39y,Sylvurphlame,,3,2025-02-12 14:42:22,,,,Thats quite possible By all accounts Tim is a logistics guy and not a visionary guy or so the Internet tells me And while Im sure it couldve been a nightmare to work for Jobs the notorious asshole streak may have been the thing that just got shit done But the logistics thing actually factors into my pet theory about waiting out the market Apple has done that before Not been first but put out a polished version of what everybody was basically product testing on the market,mcd8pey,3.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdf1v0,NeverLookBothWays,,4,2025-02-12 14:47:33,,,,Agreed on all points there That wasnt to disparage Tim either hes an incredible asset for that company But Steve put himself in the consumers shoes first and foremost it seemed which is why all of the little things he obsessed about really paid off in the end His vision of technology was that technology should never be cumbersome or in the way His version of AR would have followed that paradigm much more strictly and if it couldnt be done up to that standard it simply would never be released,mcde39y,4.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdhjpp,Sylvurphlame,,3,2025-02-12 15:00:30,,,,I didnt think you were Companies need logistics guys Cook era Apple is an established big ass company not a scrappy startup or making a comeback as the Jobs eras were You could definitely make the argument that Apple means a logistics guy at the helm even more so during this phase of their development People missing the heady days of visionary yesteryear aside And on the other hand I look around and I still honestly see that most personal tech companies are plateauing on the hardware end Folding screens not to be a dead horse or neat and definitely have their application but I wouldnt exactly call them revolutionary Same for 50 telephoto that may or may not be AI enhanced on the sky It still boils down to bigger screen and better camera for me Good stuff Not revolutionary Holding out hoping Siri 20 and Apples ondevice approach is going to continue to evolve Come on iOS 184 lets go But the logistics thing actually factors into my pet theory about waiting out the market Apple has done that before Not been first but put out a polished version of what everybody was basically product testing on the market And yes for better or worse I dont think Jobs wouldve ever released Vision Pro in its current form,mcdf1v0,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdfff4,hikingforrising19472,,2,2025-02-12 14:49:32,,,,I think we tend to be too harsh on Tim Steve absolutely was a visionary with taste and flash But I would argue that the level of talent and all around innovative capabilities exist at most large companies today so its much harder to stand out as truly being innovative and visionary I used to work at an innovation studio that was hired by the Fortune 100 and 510 years back most companies didnt know how to do design thinking or had processes for internal innovation they outsourced it to agencies or consultancies Nowadays many big companies have beefed up their internal capabilities to do RD and crank out experiments and new products not to mention there are tons of innovation labs or startup incubators now All that to say competition is way more fierce today Companies can copy your tech fairly quickly I watched an interview with the founder of Uber saying he was impressed with the speed that Chinese competitors copied their features and processes and offerings Now with the VisionPro I truly think it was less on the inability to execute on the VisionPro and more on how fast AILLMs are changing computing and industry as a whole In my opinion you dont really need a crazy virtual way of doing work using your fingertips or a headset when you can just prompt or use voice to build apps and design something or an agent can do it all in the background for you Apples product was a new way to do computing but with all these tech advances of late its being relegated to an entertainment device which doesnt justify that price point,mcd8pey,3.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdhvog,NeverLookBothWays,,2,2025-02-12 15:02:13,,,,Agree And I made a quick edit to my comment there as I was not meaning to disparage Tim but moreso point out a difference in that strength Tim is somewhat better operationally and with delegation within the company I think For the VisionPro I also try to imagine how Steve would have approached it And I think his version would have been much smaller lighter and out of the waymore like the Xreal Meta RayBans Lucyd form factor were seeing hit the market today But I think Steve would have pushed what was possible with that form factor to its absolute limits where consumers could have something that was out of the way intuitive and useful while not standing out as a wearable computer or gadgetbut more of a style statement That said it might be the case that Apple is arriving to that conclusion as well just approaching it differently than they typically would have Apples AR smart glasses may not be dead after all Once the hardware catches up to the power of what they achieved with the VisionPro I can see them going this route for a trimmed down yet powerful version of what they accomplished with the bulkier headset,mcdfff4,4.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdtugw,hikingforrising19472,,2,2025-02-12 16:01:10,,,,Makes a lot of sense What the Meta Ray Bans were trying to do has been attempted many times before like Snap and even though the partnership with Ray Bans was the initial differentiator I think the promise is going to be around having AIs multimodal capabilities esp being able to see the environment and react to it real time And Meta doesnt have to be the only one proving out this tech ChatGPT and others showcasing the real time visual capabilities means that tech will end up in the glasses And Meta was in a really good place to be a leader with their Llama models But Im curious to see if Marks recent pivot in ideology impacts his sales at all Itd be a shame if Mark was the reason why it didnt take off,mcdhvog,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdf49i,Tolken,,1,2025-02-12 14:47:54,,,,I would argue the problem isnt about their visionary aptitude but their iteration ability Jobs was legendary at being able to evaluate identify product weaknesses and a path to iterate on it Tim on the otherhand from all accounts lacks this ability entirely and just governs by consensus,mcd8pey,3.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdfpk7,NeverLookBothWays,,1,2025-02-12 14:51:00,,,,Good point there too For me it comes down to how Steve was able to view products from our end quite adeptly If something bothered him while testing a prototype he knew that would be an issue for the consumer tenfold With Tim its unusual to even see him using Apples own products I think the only time we saw him with an AVP on was during a photo shoot To me that is something that separates them as well that is similar to your point Tim seems removed from the visionary part of the products allowing engineers or designers to take that role instead,mcdf49i,4.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcfsjmg,ValeoRex,,4,2025-02-12 21:28:35,,,,Definitely the HoloLens I unboxed them when my boss proudly put them on my desk I worked in a computer lab at the time I said nobody will use the current VRAR platforms for anything except entertainment That was the problem with the HoloLens Microsoft designed and marketed them for business and engineering purposes not entertainment However it was essentially a helmet that isolated the user from their coworkers Yes you could see through them and they were AR but to other people you looked like you were wearing a helmet My coworkers and I all felt that multiple monitors set up well did a better job for our needs It was cool and futuristic to have screens floating in my vision for about 30 minutes then the limitations of it started becoming apparent,mcf0yg9,2.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdw2u8,jmorlin,,6,2025-02-12 16:11:57,,,,Yup I definitely see the argument that maybe VR is too niche There are maybe half a dozen to a dozen standout games in VR And its quite possible that people just arent into them That said if theres anyone out there into rhythm games and curious about VR I cant recommend beat saber enough Such a fun game with lots of custom maps and is actually kinda decent for cardio too But anyone who says VR is too pricy is living in the past and is misinformed A quest 3s is cheaper than a lot of TVs and is pretty decent for entry level VR hardware Its entirely stand alone with the option to hook into a PC and the only real downside is having to sign in with a meta account and you can just use a burner account with a fake name and email,mcd768r,2.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcdfkay,DarthBuzzard,,-3,2025-02-12 14:50:14,,,,A hologram would lack physical touch and smell yes but otherwise everything else would be intact at least as the tech matures It would feel like being face to face with a friend on a gut level Peoples ideas of virtual communication need to be thrown out the window What weve experienced with videocalls and audiocalls doesnt apply to ARVR The studies done on things like zoom fatigue do not relate to this type of tech,mcdech4,5.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdgyod,miversen33,,5,2025-02-12 14:57:30,,,,They dont relate because this kind of tech isnt really used yet Unless something huge has happened in the last couple years my understanding of AR Holograms is literal facetime like apples facetime persona eg1 or an animated avatar like metas avatars eg1 You can talk about what you see the future potentially looking like all you want but the reality is that this tech is while technically incredible not even close to a drop in replacement for being facetoface on a gut level The kind of scifi hologram communication tech that you are imagining is a long ways off if simply do to the cost benefit,mcdfkay,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdil1m,DarthBuzzard,,0,2025-02-12 15:05:51,,,,if simply do to the cost benefit Its mostly a factor of software Quest 4 will have eyetracking and probably facetracking too Thatll be something like 500600 I would guess and it would be capable of near photorealistic avatars Its mostly now a factor of improving the scanning process and fidelity So yeah its a ways off but not a lifetime away Were talking 10 years maximum for perfected avatars,mcdgyod,7.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdmapd,roseofjuly,,3,2025-02-12 15:24:32,,,,I am a psychologist who has done product research on ARVR andno no it wouldnt In fact thats one of the current problems with ARVR it does not feel real your brain knows its not real and were many many years away from Ready Player One or whatever Also you are completely incorrect about fatigue not applying to this type of tech People get fatigued and sick faster in ARVR than they do on Zoom calls When we did research we had to keep ginger candies in our labs because people kept throwing up,mcdfkay,6.0,1inqq3a
comment,mcdo0s7,DarthBuzzard,,1,2025-02-12 15:33:02,,,,Ive been in contact with multiple neuroscientists and actual psychologists and they disagree with your analysis In fact theres tons of research that backs up my claim Mel Slaters work is a good primer in particular VR kicks our audiovisual systems into high gear and these being our two most dominant senses is why the illusion of VR works so well especially because of the brain making use of multisensory substitution This effect enables visual audio or audiovisual input to create believable perceptual experiences by using this limited set of data to fill in gaps for other senses Notable examples of this include phantom limb pain and supplying a fake arm to numb the pain the rubber hand illusion the McGurk effect Pinocchio illusion ventriloquist illusion and motion bounce illusion More specific to VR you have the body transfership illusion for remapping the brains sense of self onto a virtual body and phantom sense for feeling physical sensations based on what a user sawheard in VR such as heat from a virtual campfire or a tingle from an avatars finger on your face This audiovisual information can deviate from the real world and still provide convincing perceptions as described in this timestamped Valve talk Ultimately VR taps into our sensorimotor systems to enable a natural and cohesive experience of a world that when done right the brain simply treats as I am here This is my model of reality from which I infer information from I do not care what world the data came from just that the data is parsable enough for me to treat it as a reality Also you are completely incorrect about fatigue not applying to this type of tech People get fatigued and sick faster in ARVR than they do on Zoom calls Read up on specifically why zoom fatigue occurs and youll instantly know that aside from audio latency none of this applies to VRAR Sickness is a different story VRAR does indeed suffer from this,mcdmapd,7.0,1inqq3a

comment,mcd842k,DarthBuzzard,,3,2025-02-12 14:09:31,,,,For me at least the loss of expreasiveness makes it inferior to a video call Thats more of a current tech thing than anything inherent to the medium In the next 510 years nothing will be lost on the expressions side as avatars will be indistinguishable from reality And maybe youve never been a fan of movie theaters in general I take it,mcd4ylk,3.0,1inqq3a
