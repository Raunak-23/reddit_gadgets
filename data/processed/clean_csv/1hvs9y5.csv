comment,m5vh76i,EditedRed,,21,2025-01-07 14:16:48,,,,Meh ill just stick with my 4090 and buy a 7070 in 2 years for 549 to match the future 6090 4090 must be better at higher res bacause of the vram anyway i dont play at 1080,,0.0,1hvs9y5

comment,m5vm3la,dertechie,,1,2025-01-07 14:45:36,,,,With a 4090 you probably could wait for the 8070 Both Ada and Blackwell have had absolutely huge 90s compared to the rest of the lineup,m5vi5i3,2.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vn13j,Pheonix1025,,2,2025-01-07 14:50:51,,,,Just depends on how long you want to wait considering two years between generations 8 years is a really long time in video game graphics,m5vm3la,3.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vvt79,dertechie,,1,2025-01-07 15:37:59,,,,It is a long time But at the same time the 4090 has so much headroom that it can remain competitive for a long long time The 1080 Ti is 8 years old now and while no one would consider it top of the line any more its still spitting out frames well enough that it can absolutely hold the fort with properly managed expectations A 4090 beats its contemporaries by similar amounts to the gap between a 1080 and the Ti,m5vn13j,4.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5y4vn8,Themasterofcomedy209,,1,2025-01-07 22:11:05,,,,Maybe in 2 years well be able to get the 5070 not scalped up the ass,m5vh76i,1.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5y5xj7,PARANOIAH,,1,2025-01-07 22:16:24,,,,Interestingly LTTs video pointed out that if you invested the price of the 4090 at the time of launch into nvidia stock youd have over 10x your money now Pretty sobering when I look at my own 4090,m5vh76i,1.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vkbca,Blarg0117,,8,2025-01-07 14:35:18,,,,5070 only has 12gb VRAM vs 24gb 4090 I doubt it will keep up for all applications,,0.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5wexxf,diacewrb,,1,2025-01-07 17:12:48,,,,That is because it is the same as apples special magic ram which is double the equivalent of regular ram s,m5vkbca,1.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vil16,I_R0M_I,,4,2025-01-07 14:25:05,,,,Ill believe it when I see actual benchmarks Has a 70 ever outperformed the previous 90,,0.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vkyzi,Vitss,,7,2025-01-07 14:39:08,,,,Nvidia has already shared a performance graphic on the product page It shows that for Far Cry 6 without DLSS and the fancy new multiframe generation the card is about 20 faster than the RTX 4070 putting it close to the RTX 4070 Super so not even close to the RTX 4090 As for your question the GTX 1070 did come close to and in some cases surpass the Titan X from the previous generation That said the GTX 1000 series was exceptional for its time making it more of an outlier,m5vil16,1.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vmgem,NorysStorys,,8,2025-01-07 14:47:38,,,,Im not gonna believe anything Nvidia says about performance they have no reason to not exaggerate to drum up sales So until Gamers Nexus Jayz2cents Hardware Unboxed and Wendel get their hands on them and review them then they might as well not exist,m5vkyzi,2.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vnw5m,Vitss,,2,2025-01-07 14:55:39,,,,I mean you shouldnt blindly believe anything they say This particular claim about the 5070 having the performance of a 4090 is an example of how egregious their statements can be That said their benchmarks for Far Cry 6 and A Plague Tale Requiem should be fairly accurate because unlike their other claims these are actually based on direct comparisons of the 5070 against the 4070 with the same features enabled So theres no MFG magic boosting the 5070 in these cases And it shows the performance improvement drops from a claimed 100 in games like Alan Wake 2 to a much more reasonable and expected 15 to 25,m5vmgem,3.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vqa44,I_R0M_I,,3,2025-01-07 15:08:46,,,,Still miss my 1080Ti tbh,m5vkyzi,2.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5y56uf,duderguy91,,1,2025-01-07 22:12:39,,,,I could see the 5070ti being somewhat interesting Looking at the costspec changes between it and its neighboring models in the stack it looks like it could be something Will have to wait for benchmarks of course to see how it all translates,m5vkyzi,2.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vl21k,Tobi97l,,4,2025-01-07 14:39:38,,,,No never They never even touched 80ti cards They are comparing the 5070 with multiframe generation to a 4090 with normal framegeneration The 5070 is faking 3 frames between every real frame while the 4090 only fakes 1 frame between every real frame This isnt even close to a fair comparison,m5vil16,1.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5vqnit,I_R0M_I,,2,2025-01-07 15:10:48,,,,Really not a fan of frame generation We have spent years hunting for fidelity and fps now were being force fed artificial frames I generally turn it off along with DLSS,m5vl21k,2.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5xilla,Tobi97l,,1,2025-01-07 20:24:16,,,,I feel the same Although it could be way better now with Reflex 2 Which is basically asynchronous space warp from VR If done properly it would eliminate input lag that you can feel completely There is a great video from 2kliksphillip from 2 years ago called the future of upscaling where he showcases this,m5vqnit,3.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5y4ij8,cronoes,,1,2025-01-07 22:09:16,,,,Frame generation is basically an improved version of your TVs motion interpolation feature One of the benefits of higher framerates is lower input latency and this does nothing of the sort in the last iteration and there was no comment made about improvement of input latency so I am not holding out any hope there Though i will say that smoothing out motion to increase clarity has its benefits 30fps absolutely obliterates motion clarity on mid to far distance objects when you are panning,m5vqnit,3.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5ybgei,joomla00,,1,2025-01-07 22:44:33,,,,It might have happened The pascal chips were a crazy leap in performance,m5vil16,1.0,1hvs9y5

comment,m5y4yqr,None,,0,2025-01-07 22:11:31,,,,Fake frames tho I got a 4080 and have zero interest in buying a 5 series the marketing gimmick with DLSS was lame Feels like selling a new jug of protein powder at a higher price and you open it to find out that its 70 empty and the powder itself is mostly fillers to get you bloated,,0.0,1hvs9y5
comment,m5y75tv,CookieKeeperN2,,1,2025-01-07 22:22:38,,,,I fought tooth and nails to get my 3080 but honestly see no reason to upgrade either,m5y4yqr,1.0,1hvs9y5
