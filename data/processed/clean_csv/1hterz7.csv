comment,m5d0d9u,noeagle77,,12,2025-01-04 15:04:15,,,,Give it a few years and we will see the budget oled market start opening up,m5cxeia,1.0,1hterz7
comment,m5eq8uq,lemmegetadab,,-15,2025-01-04 20:33:28,,,,The budget oled market has been open for a few years Cheap OLED TVs are basically the same price as mid range LEDs these days With the highend LEDs being way more expensive than the low end OLED,m5d0d9u,2.0,1hterz7
comment,m5iebxn,Runningback52,,6,2025-01-05 12:10:12,,,,I think TV prices across the board have gotten cheaper but Oled is still pricey and in no sense a cheap market yet,m5eq8uq,3.0,1hterz7
comment,m5iqdb0,lemmegetadab,,-1,2025-01-05 13:46:23,,,,We got our stepson a 65 inch LGOLED for Christmas and it was well under 1000 That wouldve been unheard of even five years ago If you consider that pricey we can just agree to disagree,m5iebxn,4.0,1hterz7
comment,m5jsllj,None,,2,2025-01-05 17:24:09,,,,lol People dont generally give 1000 gifts Why couldnt he pay for it himself if theyre so cheap,m5iqdb0,5.0,1hterz7
comment,m5lkj85,Oops_I_Cracked,,2,2025-01-05 22:30:17,,,,You understand why that doesnt represent a budget market when you can get QLED 65 TVs for under 500 right,m5iqdb0,5.0,1hterz7
comment,m5iqvc3,Runningback52,,3,2025-01-05 13:49:58,,,,Definitely a lot cheaper than 5 years ago But like I said the whole market is cheaper now You can get good 85 TVs for under 500 now which was also unheard of 5 years ago I still think Oled is relatively expensive compared to other TVs on the market 1000 is still an expensive TV for what options you get for a lot less,m5iqdb0,5.0,1hterz7
comment,m5jh0eb,lemmegetadab,,0,2025-01-05 16:25:05,,,,You cant get a good 85 tv for under 500 Oled is obviously more expensive compared to led in general I just said that theres a budget market for oled the past few years,m5iqvc3,6.0,1hterz7
comment,m5jhm4h,Runningback52,,4,2025-01-05 16:28:14,,,,1000 is an expensive tv Doesnt matter if it used to be 5000 Saw a Samsung and Vizio 85 going for 499 before Christmas We might just have different definitions of a budget market,m5jh0eb,7.0,1hterz7
comment,m5jiz9x,lemmegetadab,,-3,2025-01-05 16:35:17,,,,Yeah I think we have different definitions of what good means as well lol Like me personally I wouldnt consider that 85 inch Vizio with dismal reviews and quality a good television Lucky for us the definition of budget has a little bit more clear definition If you go by averages from last year the average person spent about 800 on their 65 inch TV 1000 is not expensive Its considered mid range for a television This isnt up for discussion either lol This is a literal fact that you can go verify,m5jhm4h,8.0,1hterz7
comment,m5jkxjn,Runningback52,,1,2025-01-05 16:45:23,,,,Lmao didnt even say what model of tv it is and you bringing up bad reviews LG has made a lot of dog shit in their day too Enjoy your tv and your 80 adamantium hdmi cables you probably got talked in to,m5jiz9x,9.0,1hterz7
comment,m5m7wwr,amazing_sheep,,1,2025-01-06 00:35:35,,,,Yea everyone gets that youve got money now get outta here with the humble bragging Well under 1000 is not a budget tv,m5iqdb0,5.0,1hterz7

comment,m5k65jq,ymmvmia,,1,2025-01-05 18:29:24,,,,Considering we had many oleds drop into the 450650 range with sales this holiday season we can probably expect the same next yearif tariffs dont mess everything up lol There are even WITHOUT sales a couple options in the 550 range aoc being the only good brand option though without going for a sketchy innocn or KTC or something But 600700 is where a TON of good oleds are available right now The big con is that almost ALL of them are 1440p or 1440p ultrawide and 1440p over 27 inches is not ideal 1440p is great AT 27 inches though Or a 1440p ultrawide is basically the same PPI But for a true 32 inch youll really want a 4k display at 32 inches And as a caveat 1440p oled 27 inch is good for gaming But ive heard many many complaints about 1440p 27 inch oleds for viewing text productivity work web browsing etc Also even for gaming ai upscalers like dlssfsr look better and work better for 4k then they do for 1440p Upscalers are closing that gap where it might make sense to goto 4k over 1440p There are even these new monitors that have a sorta dual mode feature where they can switch between 1080p super high refresh rate and 4k lower fps on a hardware level Idk 4k 27 inch is clearer and sharper Especially for productivity It is very very close in PPI to the socalled Retina Display Resolution Apple coined the term for At that specific PPI at a specific distance from the eye it is impossible to discern pixels consciously or subconsciously OLED 4k 27 inch monitors are JUST releasing this week though They are probably THE best choice for most folks as a monitor upgrade Crazy deal though I believe that is still going on is the Alienware aw3423dwf A revision of the best oled monitor from two years ago that many big YouTubers got and went nuts over specifically Linus of LinusTechTips It was the first QDOLED quantum dot oled to release for monitors Also MonitorsUnboxed has been using it continuously these past couple years even with better monitors releasing Its a curved 3440x1440 ultrawide QDOLED 165hz Freesync Premium Pro monitor From Dells website and a promotional code MONITORS15 it drops to 55249 without tax Best oled monitor deal PERIOD right now But for you to get anything below 500 dont know what price youre looking for but youll need to wait for next year And itll be the 1440p models dropping into that range Of course tariffs will more than likely screw this all up raising monitor prices 100200 That would likely lead to the same deals next year as this year rather than an actual drop in prices,m5dzo1s,4.0,1hterz7
comment,m5dr5qg,CheesyRamen66,,1,2025-01-04 17:30:37,,,,I got a 4K 144Hz miniLED for 400 2 months ago its not as good as OLED but damn is it pretty,m5d0wxt,2.0,1hterz7

comment,m5gihck,yungfishstick,,11,2025-01-05 02:34:42,,,,Given the price Id assume its for people with budget to midrange PCs that prefer framerate over resolution or people with GPUs that arent quite capable of 1440p Despite how cheap 1440p monitors are nowadays 1080p is cheaper easier on GPUs and is still the most widely used resolution,m5g8faa,4.0,1hterz7
comment,m5grx2m,WorriedHovercraft28,,4,2025-01-05 03:31:04,,,,Id rather get a 24 inch monitor instead 27 is too much for 1080p,m5gihck,5.0,1hterz7
comment,m5i52f0,yungfishstick,,1,2025-01-05 10:39:57,,,,People on a budget dont really care if 27 is too much for 1080p realistically,m5grx2m,6.0,1hterz7

comment,m5gy6zr,Cry_Wolff,,-1,2025-01-05 04:10:40,,,,Im the crazy one who always says even 24 is too much for 1080p,m5grx2m,6.0,1hterz7
comment,m5j11nr,WorriedHovercraft28,,0,2025-01-05 14:56:44,,,,I agree with you I had a 215 inch monitor that stopped working so I had to replace it and the only thing I found was a 24 inch panel It looked terrible But it seems like its getting harder to find anything smaller than 24 inches these days,m5gy6zr,7.0,1hterz7
comment,m5h3jo3,DisillusionedBook,,1,2025-01-05 04:47:20,,,,Yep if it was an ultrawide 2560x1080 Id be all in for it I far prefer the smooth framerates over the inevitable pixelpushing GPU arms race,m5gihck,5.0,1hterz7
comment,m5g87wa,PigSlam,,1,2025-01-05 01:34:36,,,,I guess I was being silly looking for numbers 105 for a 1080p 180hz monitor seems reasonable,m5g7tbd,3.0,1hterz7
comment,m5gcw9x,kanakalis,,1,2025-01-05 02:01:49,,,,i was shocked thought it was 105 for 1440p 27 would blow the g2725d pricing out of the waters,m5g87wa,4.0,1hterz7
comment,m5lkrvu,Oops_I_Cracked,,1,2025-01-05 22:31:30,,,,People who play first person shooters on budget to mid tier hardware near exclusively and care about refresh rate more than resolution,m5g7tbd,3.0,1hterz7
comment,m5kp5dq,Skelly1660,,-2,2025-01-05 19:58:12,,,,Can someone just make a 24inch 360hz 1080p OLED That would absolutely rule,,0.0,1hterz7
comment,m5pusb3,UnsorryCanadian,,1,2025-01-06 16:33:19,,,,Why do you need 360hz,m5kp5dq,1.0,1hterz7
comment,m5pvtoh,Skelly1660,,1,2025-01-06 16:38:28,,,,I think it looks smoother and my GPU can push it because 1080p is much less taxing than 1440p Some people prefer smaller monitors but theyre mainly IPS OLEDs look much better so an OLED picture quality at 1080p resolution would be a cool sweet spot Faster response times higher frames People who play shooters would like that alot Gaming is a luxury None of us need any of this stuff The point is that I want it,m5pusb3,2.0,1hterz7
comment,m5pwlhm,UnsorryCanadian,,1,2025-01-06 16:42:18,,,,Okay but you could probably get a 240hz monitor and itd look almost the exact same and your computer wouldnt heat up nearly as much 300hz is insane,m5pvtoh,3.0,1hterz7
comment,m5pznpc,Skelly1660,,0,2025-01-06 16:57:19,,,,You do realize theres TN Panels that do 540hz right And several OLED monitors do 360hz Its pretty easy to hit those frames on shooters like OW and CSGO on low settings ESPECIALLY on 1080p which is why I think an OLED at 1080p would be very cool Not everyone can tell the difference and thats fine But theres a market for people who can tell the difference If you dont need those HZ save your money and get something lower Its totally cool to have different preferences lol,m5pwlhm,4.0,1hterz7
comment,m5pvb20,Skelly1660,,1,2025-01-06 16:35:54,,,,why am I getting downvoted That type of monitor doesnt exist and it would be cool if it did Why does that offend people,m5kp5dq,1.0,1hterz7
