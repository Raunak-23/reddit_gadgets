comment,mdd4yer,punktual,,15,2025-02-18 02:41:44,,,,Screens like this come apart into individual smaller modules the article says it has 374 which makes each module approx 38cm15 square so while you still need a truck to carry all the modules it isnt like you have to ship it all in one single piece like you do with a consumer tv,mdc378n,1.0,1irq0xv

comment,mdbzw8z,heartagram_ben,,18,2025-02-17 22:53:59,,,,You didnt need to do the math 39mm pixel pitch refers to the distance between the Center of a led pixel and the Center of the next one Infiled AR 39 is 50cm x 50cm panel so 168px x 168px per panel so at 17m x 9m youre looking at an actual resolution of 5712 x 3192,mdb2lka,1.0,1irq0xv
