comment,mq4fx79,Umbra_RS,,6,2025-05-02 01:29:42,,,,I bought one a few days ago from CCL for 736 Sold my EVGA FTW3 3080 10G for 350 It was kind of an impulse purchase and I wasnt expecting any to be in stock at a reasonable ish price and hadnt been searching It was about 8AM 8 Gigabyte Windforce SFF in stock The more expensive AIB cards are definitely not worth it Id rather undervolt than go for a massive OC no need for an overpriced model,mq0vb9c,1.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq4qyyp,Honest-Ad1675,,-6,2025-05-02 02:35:32,,,,Consequence of Brexit unfortunately Its literally the cost the not being part of the european union any longer but you can be mad about it I guess If the UK were still part of the EU they wouldnt be in the position that they are,mq0vb9c,1.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq0vq6x,tea_snob10,,282,2025-05-01 14:29:10,,,,weak demand push GPU prices down Weak demand pushing GPU prices down to where they should be realistically Nvidias got them overpriced by at least 30 to begin with more actually and was mostly cause of the cryptomining hype That and the fact that GPUs are a duopoly,,0.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq15axl,thedoc90,,105,2025-05-01 15:16:32,,,,That and this is arguably the first generation that the average consumer sees AMD as a viable alternative to Nvidia,mq0vq6x,1.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq1pwq9,GearsFC3S,,67,2025-05-01 16:57:47,,,,Im really hoping intel keeps pushing into the GPU market The B580 is a great card for lower end systems and Id love to see something that can compete in the mid range,mq15axl,2.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq3e4ko,PaulR79,,6,2025-05-01 21:51:56,,,,I went from a 3070 Ti FE to an XFX Mercury Magnetic Air 9070 XT I was struggling in newer games if I wanted higher graphics settings For comparison I can play Cyberpunk 2077 in 1440p at highest settings Ray Tracing Overdrive and get a steady 55FPS average without frame generation of any kind If I enable frame generation I can double that to about 111FPS average With the 3070 Ti that was Ray Tracing Medium I think the one before Psycho and while it was smooth to play it had some moment where it was sub30FPS That was also with DLSS at performance mode,mq2351b,3.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq2eig6,hihirogane,,1,2025-05-01 18:56:31,,,,I havent bought AMD yet since 590s But I know theyve been steadily improving over the years The recent reversal of the infamous AMD GPU drivers I havent had any issues when I was using the 590s makes me excited Plus the their GPUS are amazingly priced VS nvidia I hope AMD knocks Nvidia down several knotches and gets them to adjust their gpu prices Its the same with AMD for me as well If they ever become something like Nvidia does I hope nvidia knocks em down too Similar all round situation for AMD VS Intel CPUs,mq15axl,2.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq25xth,thedoc90,,16,2025-05-01 18:14:16,,,,Ive been an AMD buyer since the mid 2010s so youre preaching to the choir but sales IMO show that the average nonenthusiast buyer did not see it that way,mq231jt,3.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq2d31v,Derseyyy,,8,2025-05-01 18:49:31,,,,There are also certain applications where Radeon cards do not work or are less efficient From personal experience most 3d rendering software blender etc tends to run better on NVidia I also know that local image generation with say stable diffusion is either incredibly difficult or impossible on Radeon cards Keep in mind I had Radeon cards all through the 2010s and loved them but since getting into 3d modelling and the like I keep seeing this imbalance between NVidia and Radeon,mq25xth,4.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq2gg5i,thedoc90,,1,2025-05-01 19:06:06,,,,Absolutely true for the standard use case though its worth noting that I have relatively little experience with that side of things since I havent used windows on my gaming PC in quite a while so I didnt want to talk about it with any kind of authority I have the opposite experience since Nvidia is pretty hit or miss on Linux and AMD drivers are quite good and you also have the option of building software such as Stable Diffusion Dont really use it since I didnt find it to be very useful as a drawing aid it seems to be mostly geared as a drawing replacement but Ive tested it with ROCM yourself as a replacement for CUDA in order to effectively use your gpu,mq2d31v,5.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq2ijxj,Derseyyy,,1,2025-05-01 19:16:27,,,,Totally good points Ive only just started dabbling in Linux mint xfce in response to Microsofts inability to not just leave windows in a working state That and that recall feature they keep wanting to implement I hadnt actually heard that a replacement to CUDA exists thats kind of what I based my comment on Cool to know,mq2gg5i,6.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq3ffcj,thedoc90,,1,2025-05-01 21:58:53,,,,Its a bit more like complicated than a drop in replacement but it does work with some elbow grease,mq2ijxj,7.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq2dz3x,BoodyMonger,,0,2025-05-01 18:53:52,,,,Might want to look into stable diffusion on amd again from what Ive heard this generations gap in VRAM between the two brands made AMD very compelling and a couple of people got it to finally work fast with a CUDA equivalent Edit ZLUDA,mq2d31v,5.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mqlq3g6,Rhellic,,1,2025-05-04 21:24:41,,,,Wasnt ATI and then AMD literally ahead of Nvidia in market share for a couple generations Edit Huh Turns out that didnt quite happen after the mid 2000s Couldve sworn they fell behind one of those times they tried to release the same card three times in a row,mq25xth,4.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq3ko72,Behacad,,5,2025-05-01 22:28:03,,,,Theres no should be price Its capitalism The value is what people are willing to pay for People need to let go this idea of some true GPU price and what is fair and what isnt NVIDIA is a mega corporation and will always try to get as much money as it can Its doing that now and it was doing it 10 years ago,mq0vq6x,1.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq693zm,raydialseeker,,0,2025-05-02 10:34:57,,,,If its actually available at that price AMD used decoy pricing for the 9070xt,mq4i24j,3.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq6bqsm,OffbeatDrizzle,,1,2025-05-02 10:56:52,,,,I got 2 at 20 above msrp in the UK a few days after release so Im not sure what to tell you The initial sales were all at MSRP and then stores were free to raise it If you wanted one at a decent price when they dropped then you could definitely get one if you kept an eye out they werent THAT scarce unlike Nvidia who literally ship about 5 units at a time,mq693zm,4.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq6hdl2,raydialseeker,,1,2025-05-02 11:39:34,,,,Funnily enough its been easier to get a 5070ti at msrp NOW than a 9070xt,mq6bqsm,5.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq1q65c,LordOverThis,,-2,2025-05-01 16:59:01,,,,Yeah but not because Nvidia do much thats anticompetitive consumers are just really goddamned stupid we live in the world of digital flex culture and their wouldbe competitors make the boneheaded decision to engage in creating artificial scarcity The B580 should be walking all over the RTX 4060 and 5060 series but you cant find the damn things in most stores even if you want one the same for the RX 9070 XT and for the rest of consumers aka idiots they demand Nvidia because of some asinine social media perpetuated belief that Nvidia is for gamers,mq19zyz,2.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq2a66f,GroundbreakingBag164,,3,2025-05-01 18:35:16,,,,Yeah but not because Nvidia do much thats anticompetitive consumers are just really goddamned stupid AMD has always been really really bad at marketing while NVIDIA was always really good at that Not a good combo And this isnt the fault of the consumers AMD was way too late to raytracing,mq1q65c,3.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq2v6jg,GroundbreakingBag164,,2,2025-05-01 20:17:16,,,,Intels RT is however very good and has been from the outset That doesnt matter if they wont compete in the highendenthusiast space Same with AMD RT also sucks and I refuse to enable it lol Itll be the default lighting technique in 10 years anyways,mq2j1fs,5.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq3fgs9,LordOverThis,,0,2025-05-01 21:59:06,,,,That doesnt matter if they wont compete in the highendenthusiast space Same with AMD See my comment about flex culture The 1 GPU on Steam oscillates between some 4060 variant and the 3060 12GB The majority of gamers are not playing at the high end Itll be the default lighting technique in 10 years anyways And in ten years Ill probably use it But for now its stupid even on halo tier products Ten years ago was what the first Titan X That card is barely usable in current rasterized games the RTX 5090 will be the same way in a decade and the tech will have matured to the point its actually usable and the fake frames used wont suck and everything will be upscaled from 360p but look amazing,mq2v6jg,6.0,1kc9ya1
comment,mq4qjwn,Honest-Ad1675,,-1,2025-05-02 02:32:59,,,,Their gpus are like apple iPhones To get one better than the competitors offering you have to buy top of the line for double or quadruple the cost and the rasterization isnt that much better for the premium theyre charging Just like iPhones Theres arguments to be made about the features but if were talking about performance,mq0vq6x,1.0,1kc9ya1

comment,mq16hlk,None,,9,2025-05-01 15:22:17,,,,They are overpriced everywhere It hurts I was waiting on the 5000 series to replace my 3080TI Super disappointing that the 5080 is meh and far over an already high MSRP and the next step up is far outside of what I am willing to spend,mq15tce,3.0,1kc9ya1
