comment,lzj8xrx,SgtTreehugger,,20,2024-11-29 08:39:31,,,,Well the somehow make it into a ring is the part thats adding the price You have so much less space to work with so you need to engineer every single aspect smaller while maintaining as much performance as possible,lzi3ksy,2.0,1h22ak6

comment,lzk0cq0,SgtTreehugger,,6,2024-11-29 13:20:38,,,,Its not a feat but its the main issue Also watches shouldnt need processing powerand to be fair neither should toasters Theres still the elements handling the screen and adjusting etc and chips only go so small while remaining functional Or you could over engineer into something super tiny,lzjzkgg,4.0,1h22ak6

comment,lzr0lm0,Win-Objective,,1,2024-11-30 18:43:50,,,,Looking up the definition of watch I see nothing about it needing movement Definition says its a small timepiece typically worn on a strap around ones wrist A timepiece an instrument such as a clock or watch for measuring time I get your point but there is no mention of a movement needed in any formal definition Ive found it only needs to be around your wrist and tell time,lzqxtqz,4.0,1h22ak6
comment,m02r334,Count_Bloodcount_,,1,2024-12-02 18:49:53,,,,Those two definitions seem pretty circular Dictionary definitions often lack nuance which is why its good to refer to an expert on some topics For example the definition of a car a fourwheeled road vehicle that is powered by an engine and is able to carry a small number of people This suggests that a truck is a car or a large fourwheeler or gaspowered golf cart But we know that a truck is not a car its a truck Sundials cant and do not measure time They only reflect external inputs To measure time there must be movement Additionally if you were to ask Google Does a watch me need movement to become a watch Yes a watch needs a movement the internal mechanism that makes it work to be considered a watch without a movement it would simply be a piece of jewelry with no timekeeping functionality Does a timepiece need movement to be considered a timepiece Yes a timepiece absolutely needs a movement to be considered a timepiece as the movement is the internal mechanism that allows the timepiece to function and tell time without a working movement a device cannot be considered a timepiece Key points about timepieces and movements Definition of movement The movement is the internal mechanism within a watch or clock that powers the hands and keeps time accurate essentially the engine of the timepiece Importance of movement A timepiece cannot function without a movement regardless of its design or appearance Different types of movements Movements can be mechanical handwound or automatic or quartz batterypowered each with its own characteristics and level of precision Watches need movement to be considered a watch,lzr0lm0,5.0,1h22ak6
comment,m02wm0h,Win-Objective,,1,2024-12-02 19:18:18,,,,The movement is the movement of shadow It would simply be jewelry with no time keeping capabilities that is false as a sundial can keep time Definitions flawed AI answers,m02r334,6.0,1h22ak6
comment,m085q88,Count_Bloodcount_,,1,2024-12-03 17:06:56,,,,Incorrect A sundial does not keep time It reflects it You might think that that is silly but its what it is,m02wm0h,7.0,1h22ak6
comment,m087y0n,Win-Objective,,1,2024-12-03 17:18:37,,,,So it uses light How do you think you tell time looking at a watch Without light reflecting off the hands you cant use it And whats the have to do with the definition of a watch Just because you werent trained to fix a sundial doesnt make a sundial watch not a watch,m085q88,8.0,1h22ak6
