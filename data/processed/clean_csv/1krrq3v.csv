comment,mthquw9,Xero_id,,75,2025-05-21 15:53:44,,,,What is with this gen and not wanting to go above 16gb vram It wont even affect pricing for 4gb more,,0.0,1krrq3v
comment,mtkrfmc,Affectionate-Memory4,,59,2025-05-22 01:00:30,,,,For AMD its the bus width They have 256bit busses on the 9070 cards and 128bit on the 9060 cards The 9070GRE is the only weird one at 192bit To do 16GB with the 9070XT its just 8x 2GB modules like normal The 16GB 9060XT gets the same number of modules just with 2 per memory controller in a clamshell mountmounting The only other capacity AMD really couldve done on these cards wouldve been to make a 32GB 9070 variant which does exist as the R9700 I guess a 24GB 9070GRE variant would also be possible as well,mthquw9,1.0,1krrq3v

comment,mtkr93t,ArseBurner,,1,2025-05-22 00:59:27,,,,AFAIK it wasnt in the pipeline and its probably too late to start working on it now,mtgtc66,1.0,1krrq3v

comment,mthfzd8,Shatterphim,,3,2025-05-21 15:01:55,,,,So theyre banking on it undercutting the ti versions,,0.0,1krrq3v
comment,mtie6dh,alman12345,,12,2025-05-21 17:44:12,,,,Yep the AMD strategy has not ever changed This card will likely perform in line with a 5060 Ti for 80 186 less similar to the 7900 XTX being 200 166 less than the 4080 for just about the same performance,mthfzd8,1.0,1krrq3v
comment,mtnpukc,OffbeatDrizzle,,5,2025-05-22 14:13:28,,,,This new line of AMD cards have been such a good deal compared to Nvidia because you are actually able to buy them,mtie6dh,2.0,1krrq3v
comment,mtnqgd2,alman12345,,1,2025-05-22 14:16:30,,,,Both the 5070 Ti and the 9070 XT have been coming back in stock recently with the 5070 Ti about 100 more expensive and the 5070 FE was up at actual MSRP for hours the other day making it a better FPS proposition than either of AMDs GPUs at their 700ish prices I dont believe there have been any stock issues with the 60 class cards theyre just expensive for what they are and the 9060 XT will likely barely improve upon that,mtnpukc,3.0,1krrq3v
