comment,mnl0mmb,TheSyd,,1,2025-04-17 13:41:51,,,,Having 20 apps open is not a problem as the system automatically manages them and will kill them when resources are needed The app switcher is basically a list of shortcuts to recent app activities not a task manager The problem youre seeing is caused by something else probably a rogue background process,mnh9s7v,3.0,1k0nxse

comment,mni9odo,Scurro,,1,2025-04-17 00:51:59,,,,Ironic There used to be a time when the recommendation to save battery was to not reboot your phone as it cleared cached data in RAM Now it is because of that data cached in RAM you want to reboot,mnfo3oo,2.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnited0,rebbsitor,,27,2025-04-17 02:52:27,,,,Opposite actually When phones reboot the encryption keys in memory are wiped until theyre unlocked If your phone is lost or taken by someone say the police who cant immediately unlock your phone it will become much harder to crack when it reboots itself Police will plug them in and put them in RF shielded environments to keep them on and avoid someone remote wiping them The phone automatically rebooting and locking down makes hacking it with currently available tools much harder Also iPhone already do this,mnicwhx,2.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfvk6f,itinerantmarshmallow,,4,2025-04-16 17:15:49,,,,It seems like unless youre concerned about someone making calls using your phone its safer to disable nowadays Made more sense when the SIM PIN was the only security on a phone,mnfv9vt,6.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnftipb,Senrakdaemon,,1,2025-04-16 17:06:09,,,,You cant call a locked phone Of course you can ring it most peoples phones are locked including yours when you receive a call no,mnfshdp,5.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnftpba,itinerantmarshmallow,,17,2025-04-16 17:07:02,,,,When a phone reboots and you have SIM Pin active I dont think it will dial until you unlock the SIM The SIM lock and phone lock are two different things SIM Pin was or is historically active unless you disable it If you disable it once it will carry over to any other phone you put that SIM in,mnftipb,6.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfvgrg,kr4ckenm3fortune,,3,2025-04-16 17:15:22,,,,Ive always thought SIM Lock was to prevent another sim card from being inserted if the original was removed,mnftpba,7.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfvrot,itinerantmarshmallow,,6,2025-04-16 17:16:48,,,,I dont know what SIM Lock is Im talking about the PIN that comes with your SIM card It also comes with a PUK 68 digits for when you enter the PIN wrong multiple times,mnfvgrg,8.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfue07,pychoticnep,,10,2025-04-16 17:10:17,,,,Isnt one of the security features encryption that only unlocks after the pin is entered after boot I would assume the system isnt fully active until then right Or am I misunderstanding the encryption stuff,mnftipb,6.0,1k0nxse
comment,mngnw3l,xyierz,,5,2025-04-16 19:35:37,,,,I just tested it and Find My Device works before the device is unlocked after rebooting It requires you to enter the phones PIN before it shows the location though So I guess location is part of the encrypted data somehow,mnfue07,7.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnh17r8,ahj3939,,2,2025-04-16 20:41:29,,,,You might get the call but it wont show the contact from your phonebook And since the phone is encrypted company apps that are used for calling such as Teams may not work,mnfue07,7.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfv6xj,itinerantmarshmallow,,5,2025-04-16 17:14:05,,,,This is my read That screen specifically is also before the phone fully boots up IIRC So you cant use Find My Phone because it wont have connected to data as SIM is locked or WiFi,mnfue07,7.0,1k0nxse
comment,mngerop,M8753,,1,2025-04-16 18:49:14,,,,Im pretty sure my phone reboots itself from occasionally at night and it doesnt ask me for my SIM pin code I only have to input my pin when I remove my sim card or reboot the phone myself,mnfshdp,5.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfu9qz,None,,-1,2025-04-16 17:09:43,,,,When you call a sim thats in an encrypted phone a phone that has rebooted and no pin entered yet it will ring but will only show the full number and no contact name even if its saved as a contact,mnfshdp,5.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfuopo,itinerantmarshmallow,,5,2025-04-16 17:11:42,,,,Hmmmm I think youre wrong and a quick search agrees with me The PIN unlocks the SIM and that is for receiving and making calls etc,mnfu9qz,6.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfywd0,None,,3,2025-04-16 17:31:31,,,,Acrually think i misunderstood you Im not familiar with sim pins Thats probably the case then But if you didnt have a sim pin rebooted your phone and called yourself from a buddys phone it would still ring just not show their name even though the device is still encrypted My bad homie,mnfuopo,7.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfucgd,itinerantmarshmallow,,5,2025-04-16 17:10:05,,,,I cant spend time testing if Find My Phone works when the SIM PIN screen hasnt been bypassed but my current guess is that it doesnt EDIT They would need data or WiFi neither of which will be active if the SIM PIN isnt entered I think,mnfu15k,6.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfoa9i,shmightworks,,19,2025-04-16 16:41:03,,,,This is just one of the common idea of what to do with old phonetablets You can probably look in play store theres probably an app just for that purpose Another thing is to use it as a camera monitor I did that for my baby cam back in the days when IP cameras arent all cloud based My samsung phones screen got burnt in marks from the cam app from using it so much lol,mnfnicf,2.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnl6ovc,shmightworks,,1,2025-04-17 14:13:49,,,,OHH I did exactly that before during covid days I used my laptopchromebook and a long usb to a webcam Logitech c920 Now despite that webcam being a better than entry level webcam it wasnt able to show the details I have black hair and its hard for the camera to show the details I even added an extra light at the back to help it out but it still wasnt that good So at most it helped with showing me if I cut the edges correctly but it cant show me if I buzzed my back side evenly I think I ended up just using lots of mirrors If you want to try this make sure you get a good camera maybe even use a DSLR if it supports usb live view Also grab any standing lamps and really light it up back there Good luck,mnis5jw,4.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfjgya,ad895,,88,2025-04-16 16:17:06,,,,Genuine question why do they need to restart the phone Can they not just put the phone into that before first unlock state manually Does this have something to do with fully cleared ram or something,,0.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfktif,Quintuplin,,125,2025-04-16 16:23:51,,,,Yes as a simple answer A lot of apps mess with memory and could have leaks bugs tie into processes create vulnerabilities just by being run Rebooting clears all that out Until you unlock the device and start opening stuff and the problem stsrts over again In an ideal world it wouldnt make a difference but Computers and OSs arent perfect they just mostly work most of the time,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfx9k6,NinjaLion,,13,2025-04-16 17:23:49,,,,It isnt windows where processes are able to just kind of do whatever pretty true Windows and x86 in general are vastly less secure than ARM because of ARMs sandboxing smarter low level commands and much more structured access levels Android app processes are isolated and arent able to do any of those things not true like at all Android apps do in fact use the system memory and that alone is a common vulnerability pathway for malicious purposes one that is nearly impossible to completely close off without shutting down wiping the RAM the whole point of the change in the OP post I mean just pass it through the sniff test for a second if android didnt have ANY of those things malware functionally could not exist on Android and it blatantly does,mnfpqmv,3.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfpnwj,ThirdEyeClarity,,16,2025-04-16 16:47:43,,,,Restarting is more secure because the before first unlock state has all of the data encrypted until you unlock it It also disables fingerprint or face unlock features which can be vulnerable you can be forced to unlock it that way against your will etc And yes a lot of exploits take advantage of memory so restarting wipes the temporary RAM making those kinds of attacks less possible,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfr7dz,nicuramar,,4,2025-04-16 16:55:06,,,,Before first unlock could be reached by simply wiping the keys from memory But restart is the simplest,mnfpnwj,2.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfqmy4,ElusiveGuy,,5,2025-04-16 16:52:25,,,,In theory you could go back to a clean state without an actual reboot yes But its hard and requires effort to implement If youre throwing all your state away anyway why not just reuse the existing mechanism to do so There arent any significant downsides,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfshoq,leo-g,,4,2025-04-16 17:01:13,,,,Not too sure of Googles implementation yet but its not a visual restart as in you see the logo screens and all that UI fluff Its supposed to be done silently as the phone sits alone for 3 days Assuming you do leave your phone alone for 3 days you will not notice any difference except asking for your passcode again Before First Unlock BFU state is supposed to be unusable for anything On the iPhone BFU state means Bluetooth Antenna and USB ports are deactivated,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnglxis,suid,,3,2025-04-16 19:25:55,,,,In this case the reboot serves an important purpose On modern phones the disk is encrypted and is decrypted ONCE on system startup when you type in your passwordpin which is why you have to do that at least once before things like fingerprintsface ID work Once its decrypted that decryption key is cached in memory for use by the programs in the phone Any malware that might sneak into your phone at that point can read anything on disk Also youre more susceptible to phonebreaking tools Rebooting it causes that cached decryption to be reset So if your phone has been idle for a while eg when its stolenconfiscated the autoreboot helps protect the disk contents from whenever the attackers get around to actually breaking into the phone,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfn3en,SicilianEggplant,,3,2025-04-16 16:35:10,,,,I have no idea what Android does these days but on an iPhone this would be a good option to have as biometrics are disabled when rebooted and require passcode for first unlock My first assumption is that either company took the idea from the other and both do it now,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfop27,whiskeytown79,,10,2025-04-16 16:43:04,,,,This is the case for Android too Unlocking from BFU state requires the passwordcode and cant be done with whatever other convenience unlocks youve set up like biometrics unlocking when bluetooth connected to your car etc,mnfn3en,2.0,1k0nxse

comment,mngpmcd,DemoBytom,,1,2025-04-16 19:44:24,,,,In sorta eli5 way So when you turn your phone on after a restart its completely encrypted The data on your phone is pretty much inaccessible and the only eay to decrypt it is to put in your pin which is the only decryption key No face scan no fingerprint neither of those are the exact numbers your pin is and phone doesnt store it to use So no one can take your phone point at you and unlock it for example Nor can they read the memory other ways to get to your files When you do unlock the phone for the first time with your pin that memory is decrypted until you restart the phone again Thats why then you can use other ways to unlock phone face id fingerprints etc The screen lock alone does not encrypt anything This also means that someone can try and read the memory of your phone then and get to your files Its not simple but its much simpler than trying to decrypt the memory on its own Google could probably make a feature that would encrypt the phone without restarting But then the phone would end up in the same pretty much unusable state since everything is encrypted including apps and data so they might as well just leverage the restart feature that already does all that on top of restarting apps clearing memory etc Theres no incentive to try and get those benefits when restarting already does all that and more,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnflisb,FdPros,,1,2025-04-16 16:27:19,,,,im no expert and have no idea about googles BFU implementation outlined in the article but it just says in the article that the device will be fully encrypted in this state so Im guessing that might be why I know samsung does a similar thing with its samsung knox where it encypts and asks for your passcode before actually booting into the OS,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnjgc21,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-04-17 05:50:51,,,,Google answer for security Real answer because Android is a pig and leaks memory so it will perform better if you reboot once in a while I heard Dish Network did this with some their DVRs a while back literally because they couldnt figure out how to fix memory leaks Heh they also rebooted at every daylight savings change but I think that was just a kernel panic,mnfjgya,1.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfyam9,tastyratz,,2,2025-04-16 17:28:39,,,,So this is simply a problem of principle not a problem if actual use An on call phone is going to be looked at or unlocked at least once over 3 days and its only a reboot This isnt every 3 days this is 3 days of inactivity after its been unlocked This really doesnt cause any risk to an on call device any more than if you just restarted it for acting up If anything it makes the device more reliable without excessive uptime It also is better for your company A phone thats more secure is less likely to have company secrets extracted for it if its lost or stolen The people who use their phone for hotspotting Thats a legit disruption They can schedule reboots for when its best for them at least,mnfm013,9.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnfiu7f,egnards,,4,2025-04-16 16:13:57,,,,Will it though My iPhone locks after 5 minutes of inactivity and Im sure Android phones have similar features It doesnt need a restart to do that Im not saying Im happy if the police confiscate my phone and go snooping for things but I am saying how is this any different than what is already happening while charged and turned on They turn my phone on And are met with the same lock screen theyd be met with if it were charging and on Edit A lot of people mentioning biometrics I have a funny feeling that the people most concerned about police confiscation are more likely to have biometrics turned off I have nothing to hide on my phone at all if my phone were ever confiscated the only thing anyone will find is pictures of my cats endless memes and years of phone conversations about groceries And I still have biometrics turned off for that very reason,mnfhqc6,2.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfjxpj,fafarex,,5,2025-04-16 16:19:26,,,,My iPhone locks after 5 minutes of inactivity not the same thing at all security wise this just lock acces but everything is still in memory and some attack will be easier like that when you phone is off it doesnt charge anything personnal until you do your first unlock that first unlock will trigger the phone to use your encryption key to render your files accessibles,mnfiu7f,3.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfpeck,xantec15,,3,2025-04-16 16:46:27,,,,I have nothing to hide on my phone at all You dont need to have stuff to hide to want to keep unauthorized individuals out of your phone including law enforcement Our phones today are much more than a phone They are an access point to everything we say see or do online Theyre an address book a calendar a note pad and photo album rolled into one Our phones are a major focal point of our lives and everyone should be uneasy about people they didnt authorize gaining access to them,mnfiu7f,3.0,1k0nxse

comment,mnhrn7q,squish8294,,1,2025-04-16 23:04:36,,,,Even if you dont have biometrics the BFU state is still a far more secure state than being booted and unlocked even once Reboot it and everything is encrypted from AZ and from what Ive read the antenna USB port and Bluetooth are disabled until its unlocked with the passcode,mnfqbaw,5.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfjkxf,bizarro_kvothe,,9,2025-04-16 16:17:39,,,,There are different levels of locking iPhones for example have different heuristics for asking for your passcode example you changed WiFi networks since opening the phone You dont want to just rely on biometrics Different things happen in the background also regarding encryption when the passcodeharder lock is engaged Source former research leader at a leading phone forensics co iPhone pro tip if youre in a situation where you think law enforcement or anyone else is going to snoop around in your phone hold the power button and volume up button for a few seconds to get to the shutdown screen then cancel out of it Now theyll have to enter the code to get in,mnfiu7f,3.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfjg8a,el_sandino,,15,2025-04-16 16:17:00,,,,Your iPhone locks after five minutes but then can be unlocked via biometrics If you restart the iPhone you must enter your passcode The cops can make you use your face or fingerprint to unlock they cannot make you use your passcode to unlock because you use a complex alphanumeric code that you probably forgot,mnfiu7f,3.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfjt41,egnards,,6,2025-04-16 16:18:48,,,,Your iPhone locks after five minutes but then can be unlocked via biometrics If you choose to enable biometrics Im not even concerned about police confiscating my phone and I still have biometrics turned off,mnfjg8a,4.0,1k0nxse
comment,mng1nev,el_sandino,,1,2025-04-16 17:44:26,,,,then it shouldnt be a problem but your position that I dont have anything to hide on my phone is problematic insofar that we have rights and protections to prevent them from looking at all so by saying sure have a look officer nothing to hide over here means you are ceding that right and are inviting the authorities to freely examine the thing that often holds such personal information,mnfjt41,5.0,1k0nxse
comment,mng2xt7,egnards,,1,2025-04-16 17:50:24,,,,That isnt my position I used that to illustrate the point that even though I have nothing to hide I still keep biometrics disabled for this reason I thought I kept that relatively clear but I guess not,mng1nev,6.0,1k0nxse
comment,mnfqpr9,leo-g,,3,2025-04-16 16:52:46,,,,Major difference Generally for iPhones the content of the iPhone remains securely encrypted until the moment the user taps in their screen lock passcode The screen lock passcode is absolutely required to generate the encryption key which is required to decrypt the iPhones file system In other words almost everything inside the iPhone remains encrypted until the user unlocks it with their passcode after the phone starts up That state is called Before First Unlock The decryption key then is stored in RAM which can be softunlocked again with passcode or biometrics That state is called After First Unlock This state exists so your iPhone can actually do background stuff like getting your sms getting your notifications etc Well by rebooting quietly it jumps back to Before First Unlock state The phone has no decryption key in the RAM and all the possible hackable areas like Bluetooth or whatever is turned off,mnfiu7f,3.0,1k0nxse
