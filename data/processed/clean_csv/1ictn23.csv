comment,ma03adi,gerwen,,3,2025-01-30 12:57:45,,,,Its fairly well known in the homeserver crowd that shucked drives external drives with the enclosures removed are lower quality than drives purchased bare These are guys that routinely buy used drives to plunk in servers and tend to avoid externals Not sure where the knowledge stems from but I expect it comes from reality and not some nonsense reason,m9uey0j,3.0,1ictn23
comment,ma0ak86,kermityfrog2,,7,2025-01-30 13:43:23,,,,I think it was more that external drives only listed their capacity as a spec Not usually drive speed or other specs So it was a grab bag what you could end up with Slower speed drives ones that ran on less power etc,ma03adi,4.0,1ictn23

comment,m9wn2pc,SatansFriendlyCat,,3,2025-01-29 22:29:03,,,,I loved the feel of those drives They looked so structural with huge ridges And they were always extra cold to the touch when not in use because they are a big heatsink which wicks the warmth from your hand Nice and heavy too Just fun to hold,m9vpgoo,5.0,1ictn23
comment,m9xlpr5,ol-gormsby,,1,2025-01-30 01:27:51,,,,I was sysadmin on an IBM AS400 in the late 80s to about Y2K Big ol things they were about the size of a large upright refrigerator We ordered a storage upgrade and I watched the field tech do the replacement Winchester 5 14 drives When I asked why IBM didnt make their own he said it wasnt the drives that made the difference it was the storage controller He must have been right we only had one failure and the controller gave us plenty of warning Ring the support number quote the machines serial number and the error code and a replacement was onsite that day But I suspect those Winchester drives were special IBM orders,m9vpgoo,5.0,1ictn23
comment,m9vbg1y,Dickulture,,7,2025-01-29 18:53:15,,,,Glass platters right Seemed like a good idea in theory but bad idea when you consider theres a chance glass can shatter even if youre not doing anything One tiny flaw one weird temp fluctuation one temblor from shifting tectonic plate or even a fart from an ant in your computer and its dead and unrecoverable,m9u1f05,4.0,1ictn23
comment,m9umrq0,Aimhere2k,,9,2025-01-29 17:01:45,,,,I remember the stiction problem where hard drives would fail to spin up at poweron unless you gave them a sharp tap The manufacturer applied too much of a lubricant coating to the platters so when the heads parked in the landing zone at poweroff they became stuck in the lubricant I forget which manufacturer that was though,m9tk5qc,3.0,1ictn23

comment,m9vp6mq,DonutConfident7733,,6,2025-01-29 19:55:44,,,,Just a month ago I booted up one of my old pcs one last time before taking it apart has 20GB IBM Deskstar from 2000 It worked well and I made a backup of the files only one bad sector corrupted one file and it tried a lot to read it I had installed Win Xp on it around 2017 or so Its amazing it still works well XP used 250MB out of 756MB installed but had trouble with expired root certificates had to install a different browser to use the internet Meanwhile WD 1TB Blue hdd from 2018 had 6 weak sectors recently after just one year since a similar problem that forced me to backup all data format it and copy back After format the weak sectors get considered good so no bad sectors increase But I dont trust it What happens is signal degrades after one or two years and it cant read properly the data in some sectors So I made a partition in that area and labeled it WEAK to avoid placing important data there Another funny story Seagate Barracuda 320GB from 2007 had some strange chirping sounds from time to time After I bought it I went back to store and tell the seller it makes strange noises He said if you have any trouble with the data just bring it back and we exchange it on warranty After 17 years the hdd still works and chirps from time to time the shop I bought it from is no more,m9tk5qc,3.0,1ictn23

comment,m9ur1ex,AlexZhyk,,3,2025-01-29 17:21:14,,,,Yes it was external drive in USB casing I dont remember details of revovery but I had to buy USB to serial cable remove the drive and connect to dedicated i2c port on that hard drive and then send some commands through terminal But the change itself was about changing few bits at certain address The reason of failure in my case was faulty controller firmware I didnt use any encryption,m9tzuen,4.0,1ictn23

comment,m9ttyql,this_dudeagain,,4,2025-01-29 14:42:35,,,,Seagate sorted out their issues a long time ago I had a Seagate compute drive die recently after getting constant use in a Plex server over almost 6 years It did about as good as any enterprise drive wouldve and cost only 90 bucks when I bought it More important to have a good warranty and redundancy these days,m9tia32,2.0,1ictn23

comment,m9tto7d,Buckminsterfullabeer,,2,2025-01-29 14:41:00,,,,Maybe 20 years ago their QC at their thai plants went to crap after the tsunami and it persisted for years after Expecially on their drives with an odd number of gbs Backblaze did a great analysis of the problems they were seeing Ive only bought Hitachi since,m9tia32,2.0,1ictn23

comment,m9tleah,sorrylilsis,,30,2025-01-29 13:55:00,,,,Looks like its more a reseller scam than a Seagate one If I had to guess some marketplace vendors got their hands on used disks from datacenters messed around with the software and tried to sell them as new You dont blame the car manufacturer for a used car salesman messing with the odometer,m9tgnik,1.0,1ictn23

comment,m9z0xu1,Zomunieo,,3,2025-01-30 07:00:49,,,,WD had their own scandal with passing off SMR disks as CMR without informing customers This most works until a drive fails meaning the RAID arrayZFS pool has to be resilvered which almost certainly cause a cascade of other SMR failures Fortunately they owned up to it and replaced their shit on demand anyway But many people lost a lot of data due to this Toshiba is the devil I dont know but I may order my next batch from them anyway,m9uk2go,2.0,1ictn23

comment,ma0a3uz,N2-Ainz,,3,2025-01-30 13:40:42,,,,No this is not the case These were drives sold as new with a normal label FARM data was available while SMART data was wiped Seagate clears both if its refurbished This happened to multiple major sellers in Germany Seagate Support also said that they werent refurbished as I had this issue too with my last drive They were sold to a chinese company and apparently they resold them to other sellers even official partners from Seagate This is a huge issue rn because Im sure that it affects other countries too and its not a received a refurbished instead of new drive issue but a very big scam where used drives get sold as new by third parties,m9tlnla,1.0,1ictn23

comment,ma0gvgo,N2-Ainz,,2,2025-01-30 14:19:27,,,,We dont have a lot of information about this rn but it hints at the sellers buying drives from an unverified non Seagate source Some of the listed shops are known for refurbished drives eg JB which hints at an issue with their listing where they either purposefully or accidentally forgot to add that they sell refurbished drives but these drives had the correct label on them Other shops like Boettcher add to their listing that they sell OEM drives Mindfactory is no official partner so its expected that they get their drives from non official sources However official partners like Reichelt Alternate etc are apparently selling drives from non Seagate sources which is a huge no go especially as non of them list these drives as OEM drives which lets you expect to receive retail bulk for Exos but with 5 years of warranty drives,ma0g332,3.0,1ictn23

comment,m9tmzco,zoobrix,,237,2025-01-29 14:04:08,,,,Before people grab their pitchforks Seagate does sell officially refurbished drives at discount prices clearly marked on their website So while this could be Seagate pulling a fast one its also quite possible that retailers are trying to pass off used drives as new or that someone sold them claiming they were new and the retailer assumed they were The article makes it clear what happened here isnt really known other than that people got used drives listed as new but third parties trying to profit off reselling used items as new is an old scam Id give it a good chance of being the explanation here,,0.0,1ictn23

comment,ma0ajmq,N2-Ainz,,1,2025-01-30 13:43:17,,,,The original german article mentions this exact scenario They arent refurbished drives but normal drives with a normal label getting sold as new Refurbished drives also wouldnt have FARM data on them I was affected by this issue too and they were originally sold to a chinese company according to Seagate Support This hints at a massive scam going on rn and it probably affects more countries,m9tt7eb,3.0,1ictn23
comment,m9uwyhd,Dt2_0,,3,2025-01-29 17:47:56,,,,Also its pretty common knowledge that actually well done refurb drives are pretty dang reliable The biggest issues with hard drives are manufacturing errors which often effect the entire batch of drives So generally you buy 20 drives at a time and one by one each of them fails But you replace them with drives out of different batches and they last years This is a pretty common occurrence in the data center world Refurb drives are 1 all from different batches and 2 have been refurbed after whatever manufacturing error they might have had has been discovered and corrected Officially refurbed drives are very reliable You wouldnt buy them for a Data Center but they are an excellent avenue for a home user with their own mass storage system IMO the only reason to buy HDDs these days SSDs are so cheap now there is no reason your primary and secondary storage devices in your computers and external storage devices should be an HDD,m9trv53,2.0,1ictn23

comment,m9xh1j6,DemIce,,2,2025-01-30 01:02:54,,,,The problem with pretty much all of the anecdotal reports is that they are anecdotal and other than the manufacturer name and possibly capacity they couldnt tell you anything more about it You can check things like Backblazes drive reports but unless youre using drives from the same batches they do and use them in the same manner as they do what do their reports even tell you The reality of the matter is that short of some very obvious issues whether thats an HDD quickly dying with a clicking sound IBM Deskstar 75GXP or an SSD slowing down as the data on it ages Samsung 840 EVO or in this case reports of drive activity times being out of line with what one would expect from a new drive that quickly get discussed any one drive an option is as good as another given the same characteristics Any one of them can die an early death if the lottery is against you and any one of them could outlive your systems natural upgrade paths So if your choice is between a 4TB HDD from Seagate Western Digital or Toshiba figure out what the differences between them are in terms of features its an HDD theres not going to be a whole lot some might claim higher endurance but see previous statement warranty support and budgetfitness and choose based on that rather than manufacturer brand Also make sure you have a viable backup strategy if the data is important No amount of Curse you Brand A who was highly rated when I bought this drive that just died in hindsight I should have bought Brand B can bring back data backups can,m9uhpz8,2.0,1ictn23

comment,m9u7ppv,fault_finder,,1,2025-01-29 15:51:34,,,,This isnt new news I bought an external Seagate in 2006 One day it got corrupt and so I had to recover data from it There were tons of family photos and documents on it Nothing out of the ordinary I wrote to the family to ask if they had lost the photos and documents from a failed drive Never heard from them The drive did eventually fail and so seagate replaced it I immediately did a recover on it but it was blank It wouldnt surprise me if all manufacturers did this,,0.0,1ictn23
