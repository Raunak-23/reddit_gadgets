comment,mbnudi3,thisischemistry,,713,2025-02-08 14:24:52,,,,Houston we have a problem very reasonable starting price of 900 I dont enjoy this being made the new normal and being framed as reasonable Yes I dont need a focus on AI but this is the price of a higherend phone with a focus on AI if its leaving off features then shouldnt the price be lower Or is the articledevice just BS,,0.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbsuz03,nokeldin42,,7,2025-02-09 07:26:08,,,,Holy irony lmao Just to spell it out the If at the beginning is key whk1992 is inferring from the comment that privacy might be the primary concern as it is for many people with AI ref Microsoft recall fiasco Its a reasonable inference given the fuss surrounding AI in consumer tech even predating consumer facing LLMs Also for the fact that there really isnt much valid criticism of AI tools outside of privacy and data security many people view other criticisms as old man yells at cloud fallcies This skill is called inferring from context and is a critical part of reading comprehension in the real world,mbrobz0,4.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbusvys,dakoellis,,1,2025-02-09 16:10:15,,,,My issue with the Ai crap is that it takes resources and adds nothing of value I dont really have the other concerns you mentioned on a phone specifically because they can already get all that info without it,mbsuz03,5.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbo89p5,Ajreil,,114,2025-02-08 15:39:56,,,,Buying an Android flagship feels like more of a choice because there are perfectly usable 200400 phones Apple doesnt really have a budget option Flagship technology trickles down into the budget space I dont mind letting the rich people play with tech while its still expensive,mbo48ze,2.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbpe05u,thisischemistry,,3,2025-02-08 19:01:43,,,,The SE should continue the small formfactor it had in past versions this new one you might as well get the base iPhone since its the same size anyways,mbona8j,7.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbpefjt,kamilo87,,1,2025-02-08 19:03:45,,,,You missed the point that this phone is going to be cheaper than base Also all the SE has been using old tech for the screens not just bc is the smallest one,mbpe05u,8.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbpgndx,thisischemistry,,1,2025-02-08 19:14:26,,,,I did not miss the point You missed the point that it was the only small phonefactor available and now thats going away Apple will have no options for anyone who prefers a smaller phone its large or larger The price is a separate concern but they could still do a lowcost phone in a small phone factor in fact it would probably be even lower cost than a larger phone,mbpefjt,9.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbsb274,Eurotrashable,,1,2025-02-09 04:43:28,,,,Agree But i think is worth getting a flagship and be good for 46 years though Ive spent 200400 and 2 years later get another one my s22 ultra is still rocking Definitely skip 25,mbr3h22,4.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbpjbsv,DieuMivas,,-1,2025-02-08 19:27:15,,,,But isnt a choice between a Samsung and an iPhone already a choice No one is forcing people to buy an iPhone If I want a jacket or something from a luxury brand but its too expensive I will just buy a less expensive jacket from another brand and I would see no reason to complain about the fact that that luxury brand dont have less expensive jackets,mbo89p5,3.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbpty4z,swagglepuf,,9,2025-02-08 20:18:50,,,,An 800 dollar phone in 2025 that is stuck with a 60hz screen deserves to be criticized Especially when sub 300 android phones have 120hz,mbo48ze,2.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbobbnd,Diplo_Advisor,,39,2025-02-08 15:55:12,,,,Im not American but in my country iPhone 16 is priced much higher than some flagship killers Yet iPhone 16 screen is only 60hz refresh rate A low midrange Android today comes with 120hz refresh rate,mbo48ze,2.0,1ikndsi
comment,mboxeek,None,,-22,2025-02-08 17:42:56,,,,Refresh rate really doesnt matter if you are just web browsing streaming or using social media apps If you are playing games where you need that refresh rate you shouldnt be on a phone lol There are points to be made But that should not be a selling point for really anyone Usages like office work editing photos or standard video content for YouTube and slowerpaced games dont benefit significantly from a high refresh rate and a 60Hz display will likely work well for you Since Im being downvoted Here Its objectively not that important for people who just scroll through social media If you want to have a higher refresh rate to have a higher refresh rate go ahead Its just not that big of a deal Its like having a car that can go 90mph or 120mph Youll never really need to go that fast so either is fine If you are trying to play competitive games on a phone you are already at a disadvantage so why even play them on that device instead of a pcconsole,mbobbnd,3.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbq0ng2,memeita,,14,2025-02-08 20:51:54,,,,People want it because its nice You dont really need your display to be over 400 ppi of pixel density or the back of the phone to be made out of metal and glass but theyre much nicer than a low res display or a plastic back,mboxeek,4.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbq3s8x,-Badger3-,,20,2025-02-08 21:07:26,,,,Refresh rate really doesnt matter if you are just web browsing streaming or using social media apps Hard disagree People on their phones do a lot of reading while scrolling and the eye strain relief you get from reading smoothly moving text on a high refresh display is alone enough of a justification Like I dont game on my phone at all and Im never going back to a 60hz display,mboxeek,4.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbr3osv,Deftek178,,-19,2025-02-09 00:18:09,,,,What could you possibly need 120hz refresh on a phone Its not a gaming monitor man,mbobbnd,3.0,1ikndsi

comment,mboav4a,poorperspective,,6,2025-02-08 15:52:54,,,,I think it because Android gives a much wider spread of options for pricing but also really its expressed in more or less features You can either pay high for all the features with possibly some plus of the current flagship IPhone or you can easily by a newer but still feature less model Apple focuses on releasing a new product yearly with upgrades You can also buy a used IPhone which has similar specs and features for a lower price Its just two separate marketing strategies Apple like other luxury goods focuses on small yearly updates similar to a car model that is updated yearly Apple would just suggest buying an older model Of course they are going to try to upsale you but everyone is marketing Almost all apple products follow this model Android phone companies focuses on providing a variety of options You can buy a new phone that may actually be a couple of years behind on the latest features of smart phones They also market many other aspects that hit the variety mark Consistency is a huge market appeal to apple products Its why certain design elements are evident that they focus on this aspects Yes they may not have the latest features but they arent going to add a feature that may be just a fad Updates to their OS tends to be incremental and well laid out I cannot say the same experience with Android products So it often just comes down to what people want Consistency or options,mbo7hjz,3.0,1ikndsi

comment,mboa5ax,None,,14,2025-02-08 15:49:17,,,,Just off top of my head most android phones have better quality screens with higher resolutions and refresh rates Often android phones have more storage and more ram My point was more that an iPhone and android phone thats re the same price the android is usually the better value because you get more,mbo9rvs,4.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbos7nr,FaxxMaxxer,,-9,2025-02-08 17:17:45,,,,Its a simple fact iOS has always been better optimized and able to deliver a smoother and snappier experience with as little as half the RAM Not a surprise given that Apple makes both the hardware and software and can tailor iOS for just a handful of processors running their silicon Even Android Authority recognizes this,mboj5gz,7.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbovcx7,KiW3,,5,2025-02-08 17:33:04,,,,Even Android Authority recognizes this Your source briefly mentions that the apple phone they tested had a lower amount of ram compared to the other phones in the test But the actual test which is not even directly the source you linked only tests their CPU speed So the actual source has nothing on whether their ram is actually performing better,mbos7nr,8.0,1ikndsi
comment,mboycwm,FaxxMaxxer,,-1,2025-02-08 17:47:31,,,,Were talking about an observable user experience just bc its something that hasnt been scientifically tested in a lab and peer reviewed doesnt make it less true Android Authority themselves plainly state it are they lying Would you not expect the worlds richest company who designs their own leading edge silicon to run specifically with their own code to be more efficient at delivering a more efficient end product I think so many of yall are up your own asses about your choice in consumer products you cannot come to terms with the simple fact that iOS is as fast or faster with half the RAM Its honestly kinda pathetic,mbovcx7,9.0,1ikndsi
comment,mbp1nak,KiW3,,4,2025-02-08 18:03:06,,,,Android Authority themselves plainly state it are they lying My brother they are talking about CPU speed in the test the article uses as its basis for stating iOS is generally faster and smoother You are misquoting them I had heard that wars between android and apple fanboys would easily get heated but is it funny to see it for the first time myself I merely pointed out that the source you produced did not support your claim about ram Are you sure you shouldnt look inwards when you afterwards make comments like its pathetic when we are merely having a discussion,mboycwm,10.0,1ikndsi

comment,mbo7zuz,ThatLaloBoy,,16,2025-02-08 15:38:34,,,,The closest competitor to this is probably the S25 and thats selling at 999 And Id argue that the OnePlus 13 offers more for the price It managed to be slightly thinner and lighter than last years phone while packing in a much bigger battery better cooling for the SoC and pretty much the latest tech for everything except the camera That SUPERVOCC charger is amazing for charging your phone in less than 20 minutes And for anyone that doesnt mind last years SoC and camera to save money the 13R looks like a much better value offering a smilar experience at 599,mbnudi3,1.0,1ikndsi

comment,mfwkpu7,edwbuck,,1,2025-03-04 03:51:38,,,,Im a bit late to the party but remember that 900 today is nearly 750 five years ago And yes 750 was ridiculous for a phone back then but there were plenty of topend phones in that price range 2020 One Plus 8 Pro 899 2020 Samsung Galaxy Note 999 2020 Google Pixel 4 799 The main problem isnt the price its that the earnings we all take home are just not enough for these small luxuries to be considered worth the value Back in the day the wow factor was higher not much new in cell phones today aside from AI that seems to be wrong more often than right and the costs might have been adjusted for dollars a slight bit higher but more importantly the ability to pay them was a lot lot higher,mbnudi3,1.0,1ikndsi
comment,mboiavt,Crintor,,1,2025-02-08 16:29:36,,,,I havent looked into the phones specs but if its an actual flagship tier device with full flagship specs thats extremely reasonable Nothing recently did a little collab thing with MKBHD where they asked what his dream phone specs would be and then Nothing priced what that would actually cost an at scale brand to produce and the Bill of Materials for it was about 500 And thats just the actual cost of materials Thats no margins no RD no marketing no distribution no assembly,mbnudi3,1.0,1ikndsi
