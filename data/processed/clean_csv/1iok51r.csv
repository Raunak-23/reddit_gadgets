comment,mcpgqtg,BrokenDownMiata,,3,2025-02-14 09:47:49,,,,Not if youre big enough and agree to the rules Apple and Tesla are not joint ventures Chinas whole joint venture scheme is designed to extract knowledge from Foreign Company and use it to develop Domestic Company to make a better product domestically which ends up pushing out Foreign Company But iPhones are considered status symbols in ways that no other Chinese brand can quite match Theyre not the most affordable but that Apple icon means a lot,mcn19p0,2.0,1iok51r

comment,mckambw,PineapplePizza99,,17,2025-02-13 15:33:50,,,,Yeah sorry Apple Intelligence is not fully out yet and it is not going to be anywhere near done even when iOS 19 comes out Half of the features that were advertised are out now they are half baked but the truly important stuff like Nextgen Siri is not out yet and I dont think it will be out soon So what you tried on your Mac was literally old dumb Siri with a visual makeover,mck7x5e,4.0,1iok51r
comment,mcknvp7,Sylvurphlame,,5,2025-02-13 16:36:59,,,,I am coming around to the opinion that doing the visual overhaul first might have been a bad idea after all,mckambw,5.0,1iok51r

comment,mcpqgu4,PineapplePizza99,,1,2025-02-14 11:25:48,,,,It literally is a skin of old Siri Look it up The improvements to Siri are coming in 184 and LLM Siri is not coming out until 194 Currently Siri is as dumb and useless as ever it is just shinier and can connect to ChatGPT for things it cannot do,mcnqiq1,6.0,1iok51r
comment,mcw0vxg,SlovenianSocket,,1,2025-02-15 12:02:27,,,,Nextgen siri comes out next week,mckambw,5.0,1iok51r

comment,mckj3r1,Pineapple_Assrape,,3,2025-02-13 16:14:45,,,,No classic reddit comment is you not understanding youre doing shit wrong and then coming on here with fullmouthed declarations on the state of things declaring it useless Seems like youre just as confident as Siri while spouting bullshit how fitting,mck7x5e,4.0,1iok51r
comment,mckpe1t,Zealousideal_Bad_922,,1,2025-02-13 16:44:02,,,,lol google it Im sitting at my computer looking right at it They had me opt in I tried it Its useless,mckj3r1,5.0,1iok51r
comment,mckqu4c,Pterodactyl_midnight,,2,2025-02-13 16:50:49,,,,lol google it Apple Ai doesnt answer questions yet Siri update isnt released Only writing tools notification summary and image playground is out So your test of Apple Ai is faulty Test the things that are released,mckpe1t,6.0,1iok51r
comment,mcksqnf,Zealousideal_Bad_922,,-1,2025-02-13 16:59:36,,,,Sorry when I said ask it questions I meant feeding it prompts in general This was a few weeks ago but I remember I asked it to summarize an email which it didnt understand I DID ask it a question because it had a check box for integrating ChatGPT The image creation is a different app on Mac and I havent had a need for that yet so maybe that works but Apple AI on Mac right now just seems to be a glowing Siri button Even when I ask it what it can do it says resume book pause timer what time is sunset send a message,mckqu4c,7.0,1iok51r
comment,mckti38,Pterodactyl_midnight,,1,2025-02-13 17:03:12,,,,How are you feeding it prompts There is nowhere to feed prompts Like I said Siri update hasnt happened yet Maybe dont be so arrogant and tell people to google it when you dont know what youre talking about Edit And ChatGPT is for writing tools when it cant do it locally,mcksqnf,8.0,1iok51r
comment,mcoscuz,Zealousideal_Bad_922,,0,2025-02-14 05:50:22,,,,Wow how cool of you to edit a message after the fact to make yourself look big what a fucking loser,mckti38,9.0,1iok51r
comment,mckyiao,Zealousideal_Bad_922,,-1,2025-02-13 17:26:36,,,,Pineapplepizza99 already responded and clarified that its essentially just a visual makeover for Siri right now That was my experience Is Apple ai out for Mac Yes Is it functional as an ai experience Not unless you bend the current public understanding of the definition of ai I apologize if my comment upset others not saying you but I am the layman here Ive had my Mac for 4 months I was getting prompts every couple of days to activate AI I activated it Tried to get it to do the things I had heard it could do tried to get things Ive used GPT for tried to use it as a search engine it couldnt do any of those things People can argue with me about the semantics of useless or say I dont know what Im doing but that doesnt change the fact that it is just a reskinned Siri for now If theyre planning on adding additional features thats great They shouldnt have pushed it out and advertised it if its key features arent there No hate I just think it was a mistake,mckti38,9.0,1iok51r

comment,mclhcdg,SneakyFcknRusky,,2,2025-02-13 18:55:54,,,,I did have it enabled for a while and periodically reenable it but it is truly awful for me It doesnt understand what Im asking it at all and gives completely wrong results most of the time The summarisation feature gives incredibly wrong summaries Siri is truly awful and it no longer understands me when I ask it to turn on and off home automations,mck2od8,1.0,1iok51r
