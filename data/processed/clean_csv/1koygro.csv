comment,msu94z6,sargonas,,5,2025-05-17 19:25:12,,,,As of last quarter their gaming desktop GPUs revenue specific way was 68 While reports dont indicate with the exact profit from that revenue is it has to be assumed its 3 or less Their datacenter revenue is 90 of revenue as well In the last two years their total revenue has gone from 7 Billion to 42 38 of that 42 billion of that is data centerenterprise sales The explosive growth of enterprisedata center sales means that they could take a huge hit on consumer GPUs over 4 fiscal quarters and still come out higher than they started a fiscal year and meet most of their growth expectations by making up the difference in enterprise sales The exponential growth and the seemingly continualness of it as of last quarter speaks to this,msu1o6y,3.0,1koygro
comment,msvla9h,Bloody_Sunday,,7,2025-05-18 00:05:24,,,,That doesnt mean they are disregarding their prestigious leading position in gaming GPUs at all I hope you dont actually mean or think that Nvidia will ignore its yearslong leading position in GPU sales and its considerable associated revenue and prestige Or that it has any intention of giving it up to its competitors Theres no way this market position and revenue can be considered to be either negligible or even worse one to simply give up,msu94z6,4.0,1koygro
comment,msu3w0h,techieman33,,-10,2025-05-17 18:55:36,,,,Thats revenue not profit And Im guessing they make much higher profit margins on the AI stuff Wouldnt be surprised if graphics cards were closer to 5 of actual profits,msu1o6y,3.0,1koygro
comment,msu6ogi,zoobrix,,3,2025-05-17 19:11:17,,,,Their consumer graphics cards were 13 of total revenue so in terms of profit it would almost certainly be less than 5 of their total profits but if Nvidia suddenly lost it all somehow losing 13 of that revenue and the corresponding profits would make for a brutal year financially and their stock price would take a huge hit Now given the lack of competition thats not going to happen but when the market expects constant growth losing over 10 of your business would still be considered a big hit regardless of how well other divisions were doing,msu3w0h,4.0,1koygro

comment,msu4m18,Hattix,,2,2025-05-17 18:59:37,,,,Yes absolutely Their game is still selling silicon so they dont want to flood the market with H100s as then the price customers are willing to pay will drop In GAAP you cannot go from this product line to 5 of actual profits when the same overheads and RD are responsible for all product lines,msu3w0h,4.0,1koygro

comment,mt15c43,jcdoe,,3,2025-05-18 22:52:59,,,,Im guessing theyre using frame gen and AI upscaling to replace actual cores in budget cards Makes sense if youve never played a video game Why cram all of those expensive CUDA cores onto your GPU when you can use AI Last I heard frame gen can make 2 frames out of every 1 and 720p upscales to 1080p nicely So all you should really need to manufacture are cards that can generate 10 FPS 720p We can make those hella cheap and make a fortune s Yeah these guys really suck Theyre controlling the reviews because they dont want people to see the sleight of hand under the hood That RX 7900 XTX looks better and better each day,,0.0,1koygro

comment,msvufoq,Haelphadreous,,11,2025-05-18 01:06:35,,,,Its probably just that 8GB is no longer enough memory I honestly thought it was fine for 1080p and some 1440p gaming until the 5060 Ti reviews came out and I saw just how bad the 8 GB 5060 Ti was even at 1080p in a surprising number of games I honestly didnt expect 8gb to have issues like this for at least a few more years The Intel B580 is a decent choice if you can find it for close to MSRP and your CPU is newer and fairly high end it has some CPU overhead issues though so older CPUs really seem to hold it back in some games Maybe the 9060 XT 16 GB is going to have an aggressive price point and be good and have decent stock and sell for close to MSRP thats a lot of maybes but it looks like we should find out a lot more in the near future Other than that you could hunt for a bargain last gen or even 2 gen old card as long as your getting at least 12GB of memory it could be a decent option A quick check on BestBuys website found some 6800 non XT 16 gb cards on clearance for 386 as long as you have a decent PSU and dont mind that its not super power efficient its a pretty solid card Edit I also found some new 3060 12GB cards going for right around 300 amazing how long certain cards can stay relevant Good luck with things I hope you manage to find a good budget option that will last you for a while,msv8puh,1.0,1koygro
comment,msxcmf6,shotouw,,2,2025-05-18 08:48:21,,,,Thank you so much for all that additional info Didnt even have the 9060 xt on my watchlist but as I will wait for benchmarks of the 5060 anyways I can just as well wait for what AMD has to offer and if they are trying to milk the dried up market or if they try to undercut Nvidia For older gens PSU is decent but my girlfriend ist gaming as well so the heatproduction in a smaller room is rather the problem I also dont want to miss out on newer features so latest generation definetly has it pros For CPU im running a 5700x3D so that should still be decent to deal with some overhead Im also gaming in 1080p so far hoping to get some 60fps without DLSS to hopefully get to 144fps with DLSS depending on the game But the 8GB will be limiting at some point as in addition to textures the AI stuff should use some VRAM as well right But Ill wait for the 5060 benchmarks as well just a shame they dont have a 12GB Vram version of the non ti but I guess that would screw with their 5060ti 8GB version,msvufoq,2.0,1koygro
comment,msxfoo8,rincewin,,2,2025-05-18 09:20:45,,,,so the heatproduction in a smaller room is rather the problem I also dont want to miss out on newer features so latest generation definetly has it pros Based on these viewpoints I would go with the 5060ti 16GB Yeah I know its a good 120150 pricier than the regular 5060 but in the long term this would be the safest investment due to the bigger VRAM and the feature set Or you can wait another year and hope for a 5060 super with 12GB VRAM,msxcmf6,3.0,1koygro
comment,mt0u3so,Haelphadreous,,2,2025-05-18 21:47:28,,,,Depending on how you end up deciding to go the B580 seems to run reasonably well on a 5700x3D Hardware unboxed video they test the 5700x3D in the second half its a solid budget option if you can find one close to MSRP which is 249 12GB of memory is a huge bonus in the MSRP price range the card is not perfect the reviews I have looked at show performance being very good in some games and kinda low in others but near MSRP its definitely excellent value The 9060 XT is 100 on my radar best case looks like performance only a bit lower than the 5060 Ti but in a rumored MSRP range between 329 and 379 for the 16 GB version with significant stock for launch but how much of that is accurate is still very much up in the air but if its all true it might be a really strong value option AFAIK GDDR7 has 3 GB modules available but they are currently pretty scarce and prices are elevated whenif production ramps up and prices normalize it would make sense to start seeing Nvidia offer 12 GB versions of their 8 GB cards and 24 GB versions of their 16 GB cards but that might be a while,msxcmf6,3.0,1koygro
comment,mt6hw0v,shotouw,,1,2025-05-19 20:08:46,,,,Just checked Back with the b580 seems Like it would Run decent with the 5700x3D BUT my Board Has 16 pcie3 lanes of which the b580 would only use 8 So that would be crap again Ah i dont Like this at all lol seems Like a bigger Upgrade would be needed for decent Performance So now the 9060xt is my Last Hope for now,mt0u3so,4.0,1koygro
comment,mtb2muv,Haelphadreous,,1,2025-05-20 15:07:54,,,,Thats kind of a bummer rumors are that the 9600 XT will have a full 16 lanes hopefully we will have full details about the card in the near future,mt6hw0v,5.0,1koygro

comment,mtf7vmm,Haelphadreous,,1,2025-05-21 04:43:21,,,,Good news it looks like its 16x MSRP seems ok if the card actually sells for close to it,mt6hw0v,5.0,1koygro
comment,msw00ij,aToiletSeat,,5,2025-05-18 01:44:31,,,,Go Intel It will probably be as good or better than a 5060 and you dont support this bullshit,msv8puh,1.0,1koygro

comment,msxbvcb,shotouw,,2,2025-05-18 08:40:27,,,,As answered to the guy above the reason is the 12GB Vram of the B580 that no AMD card IIRC can offer at that price point Yes the 5060 would also only have 8GB but Id consider it if the performance is still decent enough as they offer better drivers for now than intel,msx2uzx,3.0,1koygro
comment,msxbqlz,shotouw,,2,2025-05-18 08:39:03,,,,VRAM is the answer The B580 is IIRC the only GPU that offers 12GB at that price point german prices,mswdtdo,2.0,1koygro
comment,msxeax9,rincewin,,1,2025-05-18 09:06:01,,,,Ive looked up the prices in Germany you can have a B580 for 300 or less while the cheapest 7700XT is 400 And according to TechPowerUp the 7700XT only 10 percent faster,mswdtdo,2.0,1koygro
