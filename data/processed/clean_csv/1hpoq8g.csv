post,1hpoq8g,chrisdh79,LG Reveals the World’s First Bendable 5K2K Gaming Monitor | The UltraGear 45GX990A from LG can go from a flatscreen to 900R curved monitor.

comment,m4j2am0,OrganicKeynesianBean,,110,2024-12-30 14:51:57,,,,Bendable sounds like a useless feature for a desktop monitor Surely someone would just prefer flat or curved not both,,0.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4j4lsw,None,,52,2024-12-30 15:05:37,,,,I dont like working on a curved screen but Id enjoy it for games Could be neat for a dual use station,m4j2am0,1.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4jj0ny,MHWGamer,,7,2024-12-30 16:24:47,,,,now that I got a 219 monitor for the first time curved lg top ips display I really dont get how the curvature is something bothering people Maybe there are more curved monitors maybe with ips you dont notice the color bending maybe you are on a regular 169 monitor maybe 329 monitor I at least have 0 problems with mine Maybe in the future for a different work load I will get it,m4j4lsw,2.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4l9tqj,snds117,,3,2024-12-30 21:45:32,,,,To me it depends on the radius of the curve 800r is too deep a curve 1000r is my preferred depth Depending on if this has a vesa mount point 900r might be ok Im holding out hope for a DellAW version more in my preferred radius,m4jj0ny,3.0,1hpoq8g
comment,mhoegig,milkybuet,,2,2025-03-14 01:52:19,,,,Im holding out hope for a DellAW version more in my preferred radius See I think thats a big use case for displays like this Everyone has their preferred curvature but traditionally displays are mostly stuck at a specific curve This will allow people to just pick their own curve no more if a display hits all the correct spots for you but the curve is too far off from your preference,m4l9tqj,4.0,1hpoq8g

comment,m4jg0ca,fullload93,,0,2024-12-30 16:08:46,,,,Thats for an extreme niche dual use situation where someone doesnt have enough desktop space for 2 monitors and wants both a flat and curved monitor AND has money burning a hole in their pocket I just dont see this being a hot seller,m4j4lsw,2.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4jgzri,None,,11,2024-12-30 16:14:03,,,,No reason for niche stuff not to exist Just like the five people who wanted a phone screen to hold paves the way for neat stuff later,m4jg0ca,3.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4j79yh,MultiMarcus,,4,2024-12-30 15:21:00,,,,I presume that it would work great for someone who is really into high refresh rate gaming while also wanting a flat high resolution work display So then you can switch from flat 5K to curved 1440p higher refresh rate,m4j2am0,1.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4j67tb,Corgi_Koala,,6,2024-12-30 15:14:57,,,,I typically set up a monitor and then I dont move it or adjust it once I have it in the ideal setup I guess maybe for some specific applications like gaming versus productivity you might prefer curved over not curved but being bendable seems like a lot more of a gimmick than something thats actually useful Id prefer they offer a flat and curved separate at lower price points,m4j2am0,1.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4nxtg9,Zaptruder,,2,2024-12-31 08:20:36,,,,its probably like a 10 to 20 percent add in cost but saves them from hav9ng to do multiple skus As a person used to the odyssey g9 I can say for sure Ill be bending this thing fully I imagine other users will keep theirs flat,m4j2am0,1.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m4s4pks,Funny-Bear,,2,2025-01-01 00:56:07,,,,I found the 1000R curve too aggressive on my Samsung 57 Im planning to use this at around 1800R or maybe flat,m4nxtg9,2.0,1hpoq8g

comment,m4m4g1i,IPCTech,,8,2024-12-31 00:35:09,,,,Corsair has had a bendable gaming monitor like this for awhile I assume its just regular 4k and not 5k but I dont think that difference matters,,0.0,1hpoq8g
comment,m5016ig,Yakkamota,,1,2025-01-02 12:43:58,,,,It does Because there was no reason to bend a regular 4k The whole point of it bending at 5kUltrawide is its actually wide enough to warrant it For example if you wanted to watch a show on a loveseat sofa you would keep the monitor flat as youre farther away And at 45 inches its not too small for that When you want to get serious at some gaming you bend the display sit closer and now with the display bent the screen is closer to your eyes and appears smaller and is more immersive,m4m4g1i,1.0,1hpoq8g

comment,m5patq9,Yakkamota,,1,2025-01-06 14:46:38,,,,Yes Two 4k monitors that you want both to be curved Although I would argue dual monitors especially of the same size Are generally for productivity or just content viewing And when you have two monitors you could just angle each monitor to your viewing angle Having two monitors needing to be curved the rationale for doing so is far less justified than the rationale for having one,m5ig9he,3.0,1hpoq8g

comment,m4x1ntr,imakesawdust,,1,2025-01-01 22:30:39,,,,In 2023 LG announced plans to transform its hardwarebased business into a platformbased service model that continuously generates profits In September the company started displaying fullscreen ads on its idle televisions Given this shift it wouldnt surprise me if LGs future products refused to operate if they werent able to connect to their ad servers Going a step further I can envision a scenario where LG partners with local TV stations to carve out lowbandwidth subchannels to broadcast nothing but ad information over the airwaves LGs TVs would automatically look for and tune into these channels to download ad content to present to you the next time you turn the TV on,m4of5ts,4.0,1hpoq8g
