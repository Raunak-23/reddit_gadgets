comment,lz4fd8j,ManagerSuper1193,,2,2024-11-26 19:25:27,,,,Retailers should include an import cost separate from the retail price on their receipts the same way they list sales tax currently That might ding a bell in some of the MAGA heads,lyxcpxp,4.0,1gzljth

comment,lz4v5wz,TheFirebyrd,,2,2024-11-26 20:46:41,,,,No Im being logical and comparing like to like Its not like there are a bunch of colors of the Microsoft adaptive controller The Dual Sense Edge only got a second color now with the 30th anniversary where basically every accessory for the PS5 got a limited edition color Most of those accessories were only available in one color variant outside that brief window of a few minutes in October The main controller for the Switch the joycon has a bunch of colors available just like the standard Series controller and Dual Sense controller have a bunch of colors Aside from all that Nintendo has allowed licensing of their tech to several reputable third party manufacturers allowing controllers to be made by outside sources without making them unusable at a whim as has been done by Microsoft with third party fighting game controllers There are countless color variants available that way many even with Nintendo characters Acting like theres no choice but a single black controller for the Switch is a dumb take full stop Why does it matter if Hori is the one making a particular controller if it works for the Switch is officially licensed has Mario on it and is even sold on Nintendos website,lz4nscp,6.0,1gzljth

comment,lz3b1gq,TheFirebyrd,,6,2024-11-26 16:00:53,,,,The figure is almost certainly wrong The article is stating verifiably false things claiming the Switch 2 was said to be released before the end of the fiscal year when it was just the announcement that was promised Other sources are saying they are planning to have 25 times as much stock as they did for the Switch launch Nintendo themselves have claimed they are making plenty of stock every company always claims this of course but I dont think anyone could say barely more than half a million globally is plenty,lyxvasu,2.0,1gzljth

comment,lyzaw7v,Klaphood,,8,2024-11-25 22:27:54,,,,Well the Switch 2 might end up being a lot more expensive And unless you plan on playing many games like Witcher 3 and the sorts on Switch instead of pretty much any other platform Im just not sure if youre gonna notice the increase of power on the new console I dont know if theyre gonna go the only for Switch 2 route for newer games right away because if they dont they will always have to restrict all the Switch games anyways for them to be able to still run well enough on the 1 and maybe only do some graphics improvement on top for the 2 which isnt much in my opinion if theyre still restricted in other fields of game design Also doing that is what Nintendo is pretty much best at when you look at most of the Switch exclusives Another point The OLED version of the 1 is by far the best iteration and its often the case that the original versions of any console are rather bad compared to the revisions coming out a year or two later,lyxbq44,1.0,1gzljth
comment,lyxgcbw,PradaWestCoast,,6,2024-11-25 16:45:23,,,,No its still a solid system with a large library if you dont need the latest its still a good purchase especially because its reasonable to assume there will be shortages at first like the ps5,lyxbq44,1.0,1gzljth

comment,lz290uw,Interesting_Ghosts,,1,2024-11-26 12:01:03,,,,Well If you wanna play it now A switch lite is a pretty inexpensive console especially on sale this time of year and will probably give you good use even if you owned a switch 2 later By the time the switch 2 actually comes out later than planned is sold out and hard to find for a long time the gen 1 new consoles almost always have issues that get resolved with the second gen Really you might not get one til 2026,lyxbq44,1.0,1gzljth

comment,lyxdrpp,Brandunaware,,1,2024-11-25 16:32:07,,,,Id imagine they will continue to use carts its not like theyre going to switch to UMDs but its possible the physical shape may change Theyve done that before numerous times It might be that for bigger games a bigger cartridge would help since theyre already seeing situations where companies are selling physical versions with material that has to be downloaded There are also rumors they might change the shape so people dont get confused and try to put Switch 2 games into Switch 1,lyxd5vc,5.0,1gzljth

comment,lyyfbrn,ChaosNomad,,3,2024-11-25 19:45:02,,,,Specs to allow modern developers to make less compromises on the switch version and improved joycon design eliminate the drift problem better buttons etc is what I would bet on,lyydsm1,1.0,1gzljth

comment,lyz3q42,Zalenka,,1,2024-11-25 21:49:55,,,,True but its been 3 years since Oled and 7 years since the initial Switch introduction so to not hit the holidays with all that lead time is pretty poor execution It may actually suppress sales of Switches and games right now if they dont release firm compatibility statements,lyyo45w,2.0,1gzljth

comment,lyy0wi1,None,,-2,2024-11-25 18:30:19,,,,This is so weird and nerve wrecking to me as a business major I always think about release windows and to me this one is a real oddity Im sure it also is for the folks at Nintendo Japan Back in the 90s and 2000s Console launches were a celebration on themselves a real multiple christmas celebration but now everytime they release a first party game one first party game they treat it as if theyre announcing the next big music festival dont want to pinch on any HC Nintendo Fans out here but maaan Back when the GBA and NDS was around they released these Mario and Luigi gamesvery good games btw and thats it you would just look at your Target store in mail with the game listed or your favorite online reviewer and thats it No need for a big marketing announcement no big push it was Here are these games heres your mario rpg game go buy it have fun Now its all this big fanfare and celebrity endorsements for ONE game omg chill out theyre spending so much marketing money on one gamebelieving its the next big thing everytime My point They clearly pushed the announcement to January because they didnt wanted to screw the holiday window for the Switch salesfor some reason a lot of folks disagreed with me even if it was pretty obvious lol reddit This Turboed Jan announcement March release is gonna confuse a lot of people imho I dont know if people will have enough money to rush into buying a Switch 2 right of the bat when there were other options I mean consumers wouldnt like to be empty handed for the holidays well maybe thats just my opinion,,0.0,1gzljth
comment,lyyg9jy,nipsen,,-5,2024-11-25 19:49:54,,,,This is going to be marketed the same way as an xbox pro no doubt I predict that it will have the same type of processor as before with actually the same number of graphics cores and nvidia instruction set additions as the previous one But that it will feature additional powersinks in a postprocessing filter that will AImagically smear the source up to a higher resolution stage Nintendo no doubt is not surpremely confident about this product but think it might have some appeal to make the Switch still viable and popular And that it will push more 3rd parties to want to develop and launch their games also newer games on the switch This is a terrible idea because no one buys a premium switch to play low detail PCgames What you buy a Switch for is for the same reason people bought a ps3 to play the inhouse developed games on the interesting hardware and the capabilities that it offered And nothing else It was the same with the ps2 never mind every single Nintendo product no one bought a SNES to play ported games You didnt buy a ps2 to play a lowres port You bought the SNES to play the inhouse developed games with the black box processors just as that you bought the ps2 to play SoTC or similar games No one who arent already super Nintendo fans are going to buy this But what would make people buy one is if they developed another Zeldagame that didnt play like theyve ran it through every focusgroup they could find Tears of the Kingdom for example how the hell did that even happen Its like a Hollywood movie that was written by committee with the explicit purpose of placating every possible moviegoer ever With the result that it has no identity and that it has about the same impact as a styrofoam tennisball And the sad part is that the game underneath that is actually really good Stop giving the reins to the US office Nintendo Just do your own thing God knows you have infinite amounts of money to spend on your idiosyncracies after all,,0.0,1gzljth
comment,lyykdgi,Briggleton,,4,2024-11-25 20:11:12,,,,You have lots of opinions being stated like theyre facts in your rant You should really stop doing that Also in my opinion grammar and punctuation are important keep that in mind,lyyg9jy,1.0,1gzljth
comment,lyywh45,nipsen,,-5,2024-11-25 21:12:58,,,,I dont care that you cant read sentences with subclauses Briggleton And if my opinion annoys you I dont care about that either But it is fascinating that anyone in this world could believe that someone buys a switch for the multiplatform games So by all means explain your thinking and let us drink from the wellspring of entirely objective facts straight from Nintendos marketing department on that subject So do share with us your reasoning behind this remarkable common knowledge that this uninitiated one here cant accept Really I cant have even one uncle working in Nintendo thats how ridiculous I am,lyykdgi,2.0,1gzljth
comment,lyz04jg,Briggleton,,4,2024-11-25 21:31:34,,,,To be very very clear I dont have a problem with your opinions as previously stated My problem is that you state your options as facts Also completely aside the fact that you said it is fascinating that anyone in this world could believe that someone buys a switch for the multiplatform games is entirely ignorant Take some time to think critically Think about how most of the worlds population is poor Think about how people in that position would have to save up for years to be able to afford a console Think about how maybe they would choose the switch over anything else because of the available games on it regardless of the fidelity graphics,lyywh45,3.0,1gzljth
comment,lz13dom,nipsen,,-1,2024-11-26 05:05:18,,,,Also completely aside the fact that you said it is fascinating that anyone in this world could believe that someone buys a switch for the multiplatform games is entirely ignorant Then go ahead and explain it Your argument so far is that someone will buy a switch because they have nothing else and would not buy a new console and cant afford one but they would nevertheless buy a switch premium plus console and pay a premium on the game prices as well just to play multiplatform games With the prices on other consoles being what it is you would then field a switch 2 as an upgrade but one that costs significantly less than an older ps5 or xbawkswhile those still completely outmatch the graphics on the switches on the multiplatform games That only makes sense to you if your name is Michael Pachter But to anyone else this is an internally inconsistent argument An argument that obviously contradicts itself So your argument really is that this is my opinion and it is correct because I say so in spite of no one possibly thinking this way And I really do find it fascinating if someone actually holds that opinion without being hired by Nintedo USA to have it for a reason that they genuinely think makes sense So far you dont seem to have that,lyz04jg,4.0,1gzljth

comment,lz11hxr,nipsen,,1,2024-11-26 04:50:34,,,,The Tegra series no longer exist right Let me be completely specific with my prediction then a the Tegra chipset they will use will have a newer ARMbase and therefore more cores But it will have b the same or a very similar core configuration as the Switch when it comes to the extended nvidia instruction set the Tegra does not have a gpu in the traditional sense it has embedded instruction sets on the extended cortex area next to the cpucores c however there will no doubt be additional streaming processor cores that will be exclusively used for upscaling d this will be sold however by Nintendo USA and Reggie as an upgrade in spite of it being no such thing from the point of view of whats actually used to generate the ingame scene and graphics complexity in it e A large element of this successful sale will be that the chipset will of course draw a lot more watts than the Switchs 15W and therefore a great deal of enthusiasts will be very enthusiastic about it As more watts clearly means more success and graphics power and shit Why can I make such a specific prediction you ask without even having as much as three uncles working at Nintendo Because this is how a great deal of hardware upgrades have been done on not just all of the consoleupgrades that have been pushed lately but also how the mobile sphere in general keeps upgrading their hardware So if youre a Nintendo guy who wants to add some steam to the portfolio but have no idea about how hardware works or even what makes your platform a good one or what makes it interesting to customers and you ask Pachter for advice or something you will genuinely be taken in by this bs and you will think that this is a good method to upgrade your platform What they could be doing of course would be to extend the Tegra project and develop exclusively for it Were talking realistic wavesimulations meshdeformation and so on that really has only been seen on the first Tegra launch demos They could partner with nvidia and develop the libraries they have for CUDA acceleration and work with them to make a more generic framework that could be translated to gpgpucontexts for realtime graphics and cpu resubmitconcepts running on very few Mhz basically reintroducing to the mobile sphere the type of graphicsthat is OpenCLintense cpu resubmitsadvanced math that you cannot run on dedicated gpus without heavy penalties even with BAR that we were promised and shown when the ION and Tegra precursors were first demoed in 2006 But whatever hahahaha,lyzqchp,2.0,1gzljth
