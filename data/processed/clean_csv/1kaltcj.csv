comment,mpnohak,CookieKeeperN2,,82,2025-04-29 13:38:19,,,,They dont like to accept hard facts And its nothing to do with whether they are in power or just the followers They all have the same logic Back in 2010 I talked to a farmer in Ohio who insisted that all the manufacturing should come back to the US I asked him how much he was willing to pay for his cheap stuff and he was silent Then I said even if manufacturing were to leave china it would go to an even cheaper country like Vietnam or Bangladesh Silence Im sure deep down he understood all of it Otherwise hed have a come back They knew even back then it wasnt gonna happen But its harder to admit they were wrong Especially now that we got a liar in chief with a loudspeaker,mpncj4g,2.0,1kaltcj

comment,mpoxniv,Gunfreak2217,,-6,2025-04-29 17:20:41,,,,The problem is that we let this shit go on so long that all manufacturing sites have been developed outside the US Even if labor is more expensive there than the US now its still pointless to move manufacturing to the US cause of the billions of dollars required for equipment and buildings The only way to fix this is to suffer for like 10 years and force companies to build here Its hard to swallow that pill There is no other solution This could be easily fixed for the consumer if we had more strong arm tactics to reel in companies but instead we let these guys run rampant and ruined consumer and worker protection laws,mpncj4g,2.0,1kaltcj
comment,mpp64et,swolfington,,16,2025-04-29 17:59:49,,,,The only way to fix this is to suffer for like 10 years i mean the government could just tax wealth more appropriately and that would solve a lot of issues in and of itself you could then take some of that tax money and subsidizeincentivize manufacturing that concerns nationalsecurity matters tanking the economy so hard that it no longer costs too much to manufacture locally is like taking chemo therapy because going to the barber is too expensive,mpoxniv,3.0,1kaltcj
comment,mpp8k8v,Gunfreak2217,,2,2025-04-29 18:11:33,,,,Oh youre right about the manufacturing thing Its a thing thats just like impossible to fix without a significant regression Ive always said fuck the taxes nonsense Rich people always find a way to avoid that shit and what not Ive always thought forcing a law in place that a companies lowest paid worker must at a minimum be 5 that of the highest paid worker so that fixes the minimum wage nonsense while wealth is distributed properly amongst employeees even those of the lowest pay And for companies in the sp500 wages of an employee must equate the growth of stock while not ever decreasing below their base pay so if an employee is paid 100k and the stock goes up 1 they now make 101k if the stock drops 5 they still make their base pay of 100k So if companies want to grow their stock at all cost with ever increasing value the people Who actually make that happen get a slice Not the excess getting their stock packages of millions for good performance And before anyone even says what I said is impossible yes it is We went to the fucking moon we can figure out the math logistics of proper wages,mpp64et,4.0,1kaltcj

comment,mpnnbxb,ArchusKanzaki,,30,2025-04-29 13:31:55,,,,Alot of people thought that iphoneproducing factory is one giant factory where everything is produced under the same factory Thats why they thought well just move that factory to US Problem solved They do not know or never thought of how many specialization happening in the industry to produce each individual components efficiently and how all those specialized factory poppingup close to each other that enable efficient production of an iphone The screw factory is located near to the metal stamping factory which is also clustered near the assembly plant You need to relocate ALL of that thing to produce it fully domestically And another factor of why China is that because China is the producing not just for US but also the entire world the individual cost of each things got driven way down across the entire industry purely because of economy of scale Given the rest of the world still want Chinese products US manufacturer will produce literally only for US which will drove the cost so much up that maybe even chinese products tariff is STILL cheaper than USmade product essentially making entire tariff purely about taxing US citizens without moving the production to US at all,mpn6bqg,1.0,1kaltcj
comment,mpntyfx,IchBinMalade,,21,2025-04-29 14:07:23,,,,Youll explain this to people and say that itll make everything way more expensive and someone will say well Id buy it if its made here and no no you wouldnt you liar Nobody would Or doesnt matter Too much consumerism anyway people need to buy less stuff And yeah Agreed But the fun part is big companies are getting exemptions but small businesses arent so next time something you own like a phone needs repair have fun finding out the repair costs as much as a new phone because the repair shop has to import the parts but Apple is exempt Sure fixed consumerism,mpnnbxb,2.0,1kaltcj
comment,mpnx7dw,ArchusKanzaki,,10,2025-04-29 14:23:53,,,,Alot of people just do not have any imagination of how much things may raise and it may even surpass their imagination even if they do Some people be like well I will buy an Iphone if its 2000 but made in America But what if its 2500 or 3000 Or even if 4000 People just do not have much imagination of how much something will cost A soldering system that only cost 200 if imported from china Now its 1600 Not to mention the potential lack of competition in short term that will make price stays up There are so much plethora of potential problems that the administration literally have not address before doing this stupid tariff that even people who may want it ends up against it And if people are just not buying stuffs because the price set by the producers are too high Then thats what economist called recession,mpntyfx,3.0,1kaltcj

comment,mpoujkh,Twodogsonecouch,,4,2025-04-29 17:06:03,,,,Obvious to anyone not out of touch with reality Apple is literally the prototype for moving production out of the US and globalization of markets They were failing and about to go out of business till they did that and became super successful with a good product produce using global markets and outside of the US production Then nearly everyone and their mother followed suit and guess what it was under republican administrations who lauded it and promoted it because it was and continues to be about short term corporate profits over long term benefits for citizens,mpn6bqg,1.0,1kaltcj

comment,mprdwmw,Programmdude,,1,2025-04-30 00:48:43,,,,Even if that was a success story it wouldnt work now in the US because the tariffs arent targeted Sure the iphone may no longer have tariffs but all the raw components sourced from those 26 or whatever other countries will be Moving the factory to the US would only be feasible if the tariffs were targeted to say finished phones or finished electronics,mpncqis,2.0,1kaltcj

comment,mpnhae7,rosen380,,10,2025-04-29 12:57:18,,,,Not exactly They can pay a tiny fraction of US minimum wage in other places because of CoL and the laws in those places If they opened factories here it wouldnt be at the 150hr Foxxconn starts folks at in China itd be whatever it takes to get employees in the building If similar work in Yazoo City MS pays 15hr theyll probably not get enough people at 725 to run a factory Maybe at 1113hr they get applicants but perhaps not who theyd need to do intricate work And even at 15 well supply and demand curves might say that such a thing is pushing up wages for them and others doing similar work so maybe it ends up being 17hr And then figure in the costs of benefits theyd have to offer and the difference probably ends up being 2025hr Itd be that they say there are 7 manhours of manual labor in every device which adds 160 to our costs and then the cost of the device would go up to compensate And itd probably be even more once you figure in the extra costs involved since now their part suppliers and such are on the other side of the world rather than the other side of the street and thatll go to 200 And then when Samsung and others dont build US factories incurring similar cost increases theyll either keep their prices the same and take away market share from Apple or theyll also raise their prices by a similar amount and just be more profitable than they were before,mpn8r92,1.0,1kaltcj
