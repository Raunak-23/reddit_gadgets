comment,m8qpert,Salahuddin315,,175,2025-01-23 15:57:12,,,,What improvements There is a handful of expensive titles like Cyberpunk although I for one havent forgotten what a disaster it was on release that actually offer some stunning visuals the rest use AI upscaling as a crutch to make up for dogshit optimization with the same quality of graphics we had 10 years ago,m8qdzhe,1.0,1i84usn

comment,m8tjdbg,KuouoHD,,9,2025-01-23 23:51:29,,,,Yall are gonna be the reason writers artists and voice actors lose their jobs in the video game industry All those things sports announcers npc chatter in the background pedestrians shopkeepers Written drawn modeled and voice acted by actual people who depend on doing that as a livelihood Meanwhile in the near future CEOs and their shareholders are laughing in your face because they managed to serve you slop at seventy fucking dollars a pop all the while laying off another 2000 employees for costreduction Dont stand for this shit man its not cool Theres talented people out there in the gaming industry and theyre already getting screwed by greed,m8sjwpc,5.0,1i84usn
comment,m8tkbd1,Invoqwer,,27,2025-01-23 23:56:25,,,,Its not really a matter of cost reduction but more a matter of scale and immersion Play a game long enough and you will absolutely hear the same background chatter lines over and over and over again You simply cannot have so much background chatter that there is no overlap and no repetitions IMO this is the perfect use case for AI generated voice stuff especially since it can make NPCs respond better to the goingons of the main story But obviously do not touch any named characters with this Leave it for nameless background NPCs only Using AI generated lines for names characters breaks immersion IMO because it will inevitably get a bit weird with the responses But it should be fine for Random Nameless Peasant 43 to generate some lines about how his pockets have holes or he heard someone took care of the nearby bandit camp yesterday,m8tjdbg,6.0,1i84usn
comment,m8ton4f,KuouoHD,,-15,2025-01-24 00:19:02,,,,Youre looking at it from a gameplay perspective for your own immersion when youre failing to see the bigger picture at hand here First it was High on Life using AI art for background props like movie posters then itll be something like Elder Scrolls 6 using it for Immersive NPC chatter or a 2K game using an AI gen sports announcer Before you know it the next GTA or Marvel Rivals is going to have voice lines completely generated by AI The moment these companies realize they can get away with it it wont be just for nameless background NPCs Thats why you cant buy into this AIgen crap Its already seeping into the industry and costing people their actual jobs or lowballing them into contracts where these companies can use their voicelikelihoods forever in AI generated content,m8tkbd1,7.0,1i84usn

comment,m91of13,ShitImBadAtThis,,2,2025-01-25 05:17:29,,,,This is too much of a slippery slope type of argument You do have a point with what youre saying but youre making up lots of things that havent happened and maybe wont happen Things like Call of Duty are already relying waaay too much on AI and I hope it doesnt become normalized but there are definitely legitimate uses for it that could be very entertaining,m8ton4f,8.0,1i84usn

comment,m8ut65d,MatteCrystal,,2,2025-01-24 04:12:17,,,,Not really The big and small companies that use the ai to make these kinds of features in games successfully will be the reason Also AI is expanding so rapidly and allows so much possibility that even smaller single dev indie devs could totally integrate it into their games in some way In reality the AI features will disproportionally effect and be useful to the smaller companies and make them more competitive with the larger companies The large companies will of course still try to sell 70 slop and microtransactions on top But Ai will only make the market more competitive Smaller devs that create and sell games at lower prices with be able to make higher quality products than they would otherwise And this in turn drives prices down Of course most AAA will try to maintain their high prices but in the end theyll prob just hurt their bottom line doing that Not saying this in any way benefits workers AI would replace just pointing out facts and likely outcomes,m8tjdbg,6.0,1i84usn
comment,m937kdb,Jaker788,,2,2025-01-25 13:47:46,,,,Theres a reason why SAG is striking right now for voice actors at least for studios that havent agreed yet Theyre asking for AI provisions mainly that the actor doesnt have their voice used in AI without consent and they get some amount of payment for it AI doesnt have to be the end of these jobs at all it allows more voiced work than theyd be able to do and potentially more money,m8tjdbg,6.0,1i84usn
comment,m954sds,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-25 19:38:57,,,,There will still be tons of jobs in the game industry they will just change focus as some things become easier to automate The whole point of open world games with thousands of NPCs is to appear unscripted and dynamic Why not just make it unscripted and dynamic Im sure a ton of people lost their jobs when cars replaced horses Im also sure there are many orders of magnitude more people employed in the auto industry today,m8tjdbg,6.0,1i84usn

comment,m8t8pw6,_RADIANTSUN_,,5,2025-01-23 22:56:27,,,,Problem is probably with rating something like that like e g thru ESRB they require a list of all voice lines to rate it I think there is some catching up the industry and regulation etc has to do Not to mention probably union related stuff like with voice actors Plus most ML frameworks are made for CUDA only and nobody really supports ROCM or OpenCL So Nvidiaonly,m8rlz81,4.0,1i84usn

comment,m91o43v,ShitImBadAtThis,,4,2025-01-25 05:15:06,,,,I was not at all into the voice acting everyone had this weirdly smug attitude with everything they would say and then a lot of the dialogue had waay too much exposition and filler stuff that i felt no incentive to pay attention to A lot of the missions I played which to be fair were not too many were go here talk to this person Then go here talk to this person Then come back and talk to this person I mean Im sure theres a lot to like but I dont think its immune to criticism I put it down because I could not stop hearing exposition after exposition of stuff I truly did not care about but Ill probably go back to it at some point soon,m8xmc9d,5.0,1i84usn

comment,mofr5to,DelinquentTuna,,1,2025-04-22 14:36:18,,,,There is a handful of expensive titles like Cyberpunk You should take a look at what can be done w local AI on good GPUs IDK where to even suggest you look for a showcase but maybe start at CivitAI Pretty much any artistic task you require from retouchingcolorizing old photos of your greatgrandparents to a photorealistic gender swap of your PE coach Its mindboggling and these cards can spit out images with lightning speed Some of the locally hosted models are also nothing short of amazing wrt their ability to help with research or coding tasks particularly important for working with proprietary data and ideas _______________________________________________ Leave you with a bit of mediocre but bespoke AI poetry He sees the hype the fervent quest For silicon brains put to the test These shiny GPUs row on row For tasks that future AI might know While others chase the teraflops so grand He holds a joystick in his hand Let algorithms learn and slowly creep Salahuddin has biases hell surely keep He sees the benchmarks numbers climb For problems abstract out of time With fragging noobs and epic loot His priorities bear different fruit These fancy cards he might just sigh For tasks that tickle the digital sky I need my frames my smooth display Not endless bots to ruin my day So let the models learn and grow His skepticism continues to show A grounded soul amidst the fray Salahuddin simply wants to play Perhaps one day hell see the light When AI wins a gaming fight But until then with chuckle and with grin We tip our hats to Salahuddin,m8qpert,2.0,1i84usn

comment,m8thb3l,LordTommy33,,1,2025-01-23 23:40:41,,,,I would disagree actually I think weve seen a progress push of More power For a while that culminated in the 4090 a huge honking beast that took up a good amount of space and had some issues with overheating and small fires from that stupid connector I think this is a good amount of fore sight but game dev hasnt quite caught up yet I dunno I guess working directly in game dev Im a bit more helpful but these new AI based cores are better for more of the Machine Learning style brains and AI from my understanding These are tools we can develop and use in game dev to make them more performant and give us room for the other nice bells and whistles Currently behavior trees are pretty much industry standard maybe a state machine for simpler logic They still require a decent number of ticks and when multiplied across multiple npcs in game it can add up You start to hit a limit at how quickly your game can run when you have complex AI mixed with the high end graphics mixed with audio etc I think GPUs have already hit more of the upper limit on what they can do with ray tracing and lighting and handling beautiful graphics Now the next logical step is to take some of that burden off and simplify some things like AI behaviors or maybe even frame interpolation through ML models that make the program run even faster I can think of one form game that would benefit heavily from that VR With VR basically needing to render two different views in the game simultaneously some sort of AI based frame generation would give some massive performance gains and let developers add some really detailed large worlds into them Combine that with the level of artistry you can see in Half life Alyx and I think youd have a pretty amazing experience,m8qdzhe,1.0,1i84usn

comment,m95b690,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-01-25 20:10:57,,,,No its not its split in 4 Its a bit confusing but 8k is 4 times the pixels as 4k since both vertical and horizontal are doubled So it really is just rendering 2 4K frames Though for VR the displays are much more square or even a bit larger in the vertical dimension The Q3 is around 2000x2200 pixels per eye which is basically 4k resolution total ie combined is 4000x2200 Double that and you have 4k equivalent per eye already,m8s5bfn,5.0,1i84usn

comment,m8wy1is,R1ddl3,,1,2025-01-24 14:30:11,,,,Youre arguing gear doesnt matter So theres no difference in the picture coming out of a Nokia bar phone from 2005 vs a modern mirrorless camera say Its the same picture,m8qr1ih,2.0,1i84usn
comment,m8y8uys,Onetimehelper,,1,2025-01-24 18:11:38,,,,Yes Use the most extreme example Because that definitely is the difference between what graphics you get from a modern GPU vs top level 5000 series Any modern camera from the last 1015 years can make a decent even award winning photo Anyone whos a photographer can tell you that Gamers are just finding out what GAS is But you do you Upgrading every time to chase the latest specs usually doesnt lead to an actually better experience If that makes you mad not sure what else can be done,m8wy1is,3.0,1i84usn
comment,m8ya48u,R1ddl3,,1,2025-01-24 18:17:30,,,,Well you seemed to be making the blanket statement that gear doesnt matter with the its the same photo comment so yeah an extreme example is where youd start to disprove that There are absolutely people who play at high resolution and refresh rate who can use as much extra performance as they can get and are seeing a benefit from upgrading every time But also its not like every 5090 buyer is someone who upgrades every time,m8y8uys,4.0,1i84usn
comment,m8ybxpt,Onetimehelper,,1,2025-01-24 18:25:55,,,,No not really unless you want to be argumentative The deeper point is that the push for gear is ignoring the reason why gear is bought in the first place the games There are plenty of video essays on the topic of the inflation in video game engine inefficiencies driven mainly because of these spec heavy AI heavy GPUs Where are the games that are actually pushing realism Even CP 2077 isnt that visually impressive given the amount of horsepower that was needed to run other visually impressive games a decade ago Yes the textures are sharper and light can bounce in real time instead of relying on a dev to bake them in But we havent seen a major jump in graphics to warrant the huge jump in power and price of GPUs Its like focusing on the camera than the actual subject But feel free to argue Just want an example of what game experience is worth these 1k2k GPUs Cant think of any Maybe you can educate me,m8ya48u,5.0,1i84usn
comment,m8yd3c2,R1ddl3,,1,2025-01-24 18:31:15,,,,Cyberpunk would be my example I strongly disagree with you that its not visually impressive Its not just the textures and the lighting its the fact that its happening on such a massive scale in this incredibly detailed city with no loading screens where you can have many things happening on screen at once There were no games a decade ago that were doing anything on that scale,m8ybxpt,6.0,1i84usn
comment,m8yf93i,Onetimehelper,,1,2025-01-24 18:41:16,,,,The cars still become 2d billboards in a visible distance away NPCs are just vomited up in large batches with no clear scheduling at all Cars have no pattern and go no where It isnt rendering that far Its just made to look that way Again many videos on YouTube pointing this out Its an amazing looking game but the energy spend rendering it is not what you think its being spent on GTA V is more advanced than it Increase textures use more high polygon models and for lighting everything baked in as much as possible and youd have a better looking better composed game that will probably run much better Unfortunately no incentive for that type of game exists because everyone is focused on how many rays and AI frames are being pushed Cyberpunk is a great story game but its not that great a technical achievement even with the patches We can agree to disagree,m8yd3c2,7.0,1i84usn
comment,m8ygmyj,R1ddl3,,1,2025-01-24 18:47:40,,,,I mean you say that yet in what other games are there similar amounts of stuff being rendered at once Go into the densest part of night city and clearly there is a ton of stuff being fully rendered I dont know of any similar games Certainly not GTA V In what way is GTA V more advanced I have no problem with RT being a focus by the way It significantly contributes to the atmosphere in Cyberpunk,m8yf93i,8.0,1i84usn

comment,m8rc4wl,JerryLZ,,1,2025-01-23 17:42:00,,,,Its still on my radar for a 4k gaming card I dont hold high hopes for the 5080 anymore and I know this is what nvidia wants which is for xx80 people to move into the xx90 bracket but what I want is actual playable 4k ultra I have a 3080 which serves me well but Im still disabling shadows and other settings to get my fps in a comfy spot Playing enshrouded right now pulling 50fps I want to do better without crippling my quality completely If you have a 4090 you shouldnt even be in the market but some people be like that and thats on them Its not the best value especially for me since Id be paying more for a aib and even more for a waterblock but from what it seems if I were to buy one of these I could pull a easy 6 years from it Im sure until the bug starts hitting me again By then id have rebuilt the other components as well,,0.0,1i84usn

comment,m8v88yd,corut,,1,2025-01-24 05:57:49,,,,I can afford it but the cost 4kAUD is not worth it for performance uplift on my 3080 If it was half the price Id get one but for now Ill wait for the 6090 and try again,m8sxhq4,2.0,1i84usn

comment,m8vksrf,m_csquare,,1,2025-01-24 07:50:20,,,,It isnt 4090 was almost 60 better than 3090 5090 doesnt provide that much of an upgrade,m8sxhq4,2.0,1i84usn

comment,m8vnt8a,m_csquare,,2,2025-01-24 08:19:58,,,,Sigh the ones who deny this are those couldnt afford 4090 Why do ppl find this 5090 underwhelming if the uplift is as great as prev gen uplift 4090 was heavily praised because its insane generational upgrade,m8vm2r8,4.0,1i84usn
