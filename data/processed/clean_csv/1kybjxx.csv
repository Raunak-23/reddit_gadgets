comment,muxdaub,Endonae,,82,2025-05-29 18:13:55,,,,As someone who already streams their games from their PC the experience is a lot better,,0.0,1kybjxx
comment,muztm12,pokerawz,,12,2025-05-30 01:52:31,,,,Ive had some latency issues mainly with crackly audio Does your PC have a wired connection,muxdaub,1.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv2k06x,Xanthon,,9,2025-05-30 14:08:42,,,,If you gonna stream games its highly recommended that your host computer be on an ethernet connection for stability,muztm12,2.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv852qk,Prodigle,,1,2025-05-31 10:58:10,,,,You can get away with this if you use something like moonlight on your steam deck and sunshine on your host PC Its really low latency even on wireless,mv2k06x,3.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv85qgl,Xanthon,,1,2025-05-31 11:03:55,,,,It really depends on how far your PC is from the router And youll need at least WiFi 6,mv852qk,4.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv8m9pg,Prodigle,,1,2025-05-31 13:05:50,,,,I have wifi 6 but I get imperceptible latency and my PC steam deck and router are all in 3 separate rooms across 2 different floors Does wonders,mv85qgl,5.0,1kybjxx
comment,mva8k8x,pokerawz,,2,2025-05-31 18:18:37,,,,I use moonlight and sunshine and have WiFi 6 and it sucks for me Specifically the crackling audio,mv8m9pg,6.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvac381,Prodigle,,1,2025-05-31 18:37:30,,,,I dont get any audio issues but for delay make sure your TV is on whatever game display mode it has Standard TV settings add like 05s of latency,mva8k8x,7.0,1kybjxx

comment,mvbv6sw,sCeege,,1,2025-05-31 23:39:07,,,,What are the specs on your host and client machines I also have zero issues with SSML on WiFi6 and 6E when I crank up my bandwidth its imperceptible from native up to 1440p120 I even play VR games on a quest 3 over WiFi,mvbqudf,9.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvbw1m7,pokerawz,,1,2025-05-31 23:44:12,,,,Host Machine is my PC 4090FE 7800x3d Client Machine is my Steam Deck OLED Ive tried God of War and Starfield both games had the same crackling audio issue you can find a lot of troubleshooting of the same issue on Reddit In all honestly I havent tried too much Im moving next month and will definitely hard wire my PC,mvbv6sw,10.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvc3b45,sCeege,,1,2025-06-01 00:29:20,,,,Damn that sucks I have a similar setup 7800X3D and ASUS 4090 I will say though I had a lot of trouble with Sunshine in the beginning I would get random disconnects and laggy picture For a while I was using Nvidia GameStream as the host for Moonlight I only switched back after Nvidia discontinued it and this time around it became fine for me I wonder if another software set might work better for you Im interested in trying out ArtemisApollo next because I stream a lot to my MacBook and it supports custom resolutions better I wonder if it would change the situation on your end Regardless best of luck on your next setup friend,mvbw1m7,11.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvc3qt9,pokerawz,,1,2025-06-01 00:32:07,,,,Thanks will make more of an effort once we move next month,mvc3b45,12.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvbywjn,Prodigle,,1,2025-06-01 00:01:39,,,,I stream from my host PC to my steam deck which is docked to a TV Took me a while to figure out they have a lot postprocessing normally,mvbqudf,9.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv5ll91,GuiltyGecko,,1,2025-05-30 23:07:04,,,,What types of games do you stream I got a year long subscription of Playstation Plus a few years ago to play some Playstation exclusive games and the experience was kind of a mixed bag At the time games like Until Dawn and Persona 5 played fine because they werent that reaction time heavy but trying to play something like Bloodborne or God of War just wasnt working out because of the latency And before anyone mentions it Im aware most of these games have PC ports now but they didnt when I wanted to play them years ago,muxdaub,1.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv9v8l0,Endonae,,2,2025-05-31 17:10:19,,,,Ive streamed games like Elden Ring Cyberpunk and Wukong and havent had any issues with latency Honestly the bigger issues for me is the resolution Detailed environments are harder to resolve with so few pixels to work with and the Steam Deck uses a 1610 display for some reason which not all games support Some UE5 games have also been super finicky about streaming properly I think because of how the engine handles full screen and windowed modes,mv5ll91,2.0,1kybjxx

comment,muydwug,speculatrix,,4,2025-05-29 21:08:59,,,,And Nvidia are blocking VPNs,muxlmpk,3.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv221h3,Danger_Mysterious,,8,2025-05-30 12:30:15,,,,Dont think so but any vpn is going to negatively effect the streaming experience of GeForce now pretty significantly Wont make it unplayable if your connection is good but if you need to go from EU to NA that will be a sizable and noticeable increase in ping,muydwug,4.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv75e4z,dat_w,,4,2025-05-31 05:15:14,,,,The extra hoop makes it essentially impossible to use it I use Shadow cloud PC a lot and my Frankfurt machine was a harsh experience from USA for desktop tasks nevermind gaming,mv221h3,5.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv8oprs,koltzito,,2,2025-05-31 13:21:13,,,,You only need a vpn to connect to connect to the game thru geforcenow after that you can close the vpn,mv221h3,5.0,1kybjxx

comment,muxik6z,Tetra_Gramaton,,23,2025-05-29 18:38:55,,,,Downloaded and gave this a go earlier UK Absolute garbage with horrendous lag and terribly stuttery streaming My connection is semi decent 600mps but just wont handle this sort of service well enough to ever feel right for me I know its going to be heavily used on its first day but man terrible introduction to the service for some taking it for a spin today,,0.0,1kybjxx
comment,muycpax,DeathKringle,,20,2025-05-29 21:03:04,,,,To much goes into how well these run and goes way beyond your internet speed Latencyping to the servers ping and latency for your local wireless network How many devices are actively being used on your wireless network Even if your not doing large transfers on your network many active devices take up time slots to as well So for the avg user their home network is not optimal at all,muxik6z,1.0,1kybjxx
comment,muyrg8u,Tetra_Gramaton,,1,2025-05-29 22:18:15,,,,Yeah Im aware its a mix of quite a few factors Wired my Deck straight to my router so Im doing all I can to maximise the experience without any other device actively using the internet and cant seem to get it to work well Perhaps in a decade or so the average person may well be running their games this way but for now its about as relevant to me as Stadia was and well look how popular that turned out to be,muycpax,2.0,1kybjxx
comment,mvd3tam,PatSajaksDick,,2,2025-06-01 04:32:17,,,,Really depends how close you are to one of the servers I just tried it out with Marvel Rivals and barely noticed any lag when playing Its just physics really,muxik6z,1.0,1kybjxx
comment,muzuuom,CMDR_omnicognate,,0,2025-05-30 01:59:27,,,,Internet uploaddownload speed isnt so much of an issue as latency and packet loss The Nvidia servers are probably in the US somewhere so that will definitely be causing issues with the streaming quality I actually remember using GeForce now with a Nvidia shield tablet also from the uk about 10 years ago now Still broadly the same experience I genuinely dont believe game streaming will ever be consistent enough to be useable regardless of internet speeds just down to the nature of how the internet works,muxik6z,1.0,1kybjxx
comment,muzx4we,tinyturtletickler,,2,2025-05-30 02:12:38,,,,I think theres a future in local streaming but like The server is in your house kind of local Moonlight stream client works remarkably well and is a great way to play more intensive games while on my couch from my PC in another room The WiiU was also a flawless example of this in terms of performance Subframe latency and you could shit your guts out with next to no interruption despite being in another room,muzuuom,2.0,1kybjxx
comment,muzzkgw,CMDR_omnicognate,,1,2025-05-30 02:27:01,,,,Eh idk The main benefit of game streaming as it is at the moment is you just spend some money every month and get access to a whole bunch of games whenever and wherever broadly you want If youre streaming games locally from your house youd need to have some device to run and stream the games from Theyd have to be pretty powerful basically a games console and also likely wouldnt have any games on it unless you bought them and at that point why even bother with the streaming aspect,muzx4we,3.0,1kybjxx
comment,mv1hs2o,Naojirou,,1,2025-05-30 10:01:50,,,,My PSPortal is used exclusively for playing games while shitting Thats enough pros for home streaming,muzzkgw,4.0,1kybjxx
