comment,m93ogjc,fantasybro,,682,2025-01-25 15:26:40,,,,Looks like Im skipping another generation,,0.0,1i9oky5
comment,m9403gv,MVPizzle_Redux,,324,2025-01-25 16:24:18,,,,This isnt going to get better Look at all the AI investments Meta just made I guarantee next year the performance gain year over year will be even more incremental,m93ogjc,1.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94676t,Mrstrawberry209,,110,2025-01-25 16:53:08,,,,Hopefully AMD might catch up and give Nvidia the reason to give us better upgrades,m9403gv,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94dz2n,FrootLoop23,,136,2025-01-25 17:30:36,,,,AMD is smartly focusing on the mid range Thats where the majority of buyers are,m94676t,3.0,1i9oky5
comment,m96o55p,ak-92,,6,2025-01-26 00:31:32,,,,Good as someone who has to buy highend GPUs for professional use as performance literally means money earned to live so no choice but to buy highest performance possible I see that NVDIA convincing gamers to buy pro grade hardware as somekind necessity is the biggest con any company has pulled in recent decades Having slightly lower game settings or few fos lower is not a tragedy and saving hundreds or thousands for it is definitely worth it For an average person paying 2k for a gpu to game is crazy,m94dz2n,4.0,1i9oky5
comment,m9emui1,saints21,,3,2025-01-27 05:19:55,,,,Yeah it always cracks me up when people act like a game is broken and unplayable because it barely gets over 80 fps Meanwhile millions of people manage to enjoy gaming as long as its stableish around 30,m96o55p,5.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94x9e6,wamj,,3,2025-01-25 19:02:27,,,,I do wonder what thisll mean on the low to mid range long term Between intel and AMD they might be able to build brand loyalty for people who arent in the high end market now but will be in the future,m94dz2n,4.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94yw8f,mexodus,,-4,2025-01-25 19:10:21,,,,Well brand loyalty doesnt really do anything when you do not provide the high end,m94x9e6,5.0,1i9oky5
comment,m954kiy,NotAComplete,,3,2025-01-25 19:37:53,,,,Why,m94yw8f,6.0,1i9oky5
comment,m956s7p,mexodus,,0,2025-01-25 19:48:48,,,,What do you mean why The statement above my comment says build brand loyalty for non high end in order to keep them when they move to the high end But they dont offer 5090 level high end this is not a judgement just a simple thing Unless they sell something like a 5090 which I would very much welcome the brand loyalty will just not do what the statement says You cannot convince people to buy products you dont have,m954kiy,7.0,1i9oky5
comment,m957tf2,NotAComplete,,4,2025-01-25 19:53:57,,,,Im having a really hard time interpreting what youre trying to say but it seems like youre saying theres no brand loyalty on midrange cards that give you more performance for your dollar only high range cards Is that accurate,m956s7p,8.0,1i9oky5
comment,m9592oj,mexodus,,2,2025-01-25 20:00:17,,,,No sorry if I did not describe correctly I am saying even if a customer is loyal to a mid range GPU brand this loyality will NOT drive his decision when heshe decides to buy a highend card because the midrange GPU brand simply does not offer one eg if intel doesnt produce a 5090 like GPU the intel loyal customer that wants a 5090 like GPU will still switch despite intel loyality,m957tf2,9.0,1i9oky5
comment,m95shok,half3clipse,,2,2025-01-25 21:38:52,,,,The high range GPU market your referring to basically does not exist Nvida chases it because they can divert a small fraction of their fab time that would otherwise go to high end server cards for a marketing opportunity And thats mostly brand recognition for the managers in charge of procurement who want the best Almost none of Nvidas sales were consumers buying 4090s Infact almost none of the 4090s sales were consumers either they were not ai models bought by people using it as an alternative to the export restricted server cards Globally the number of consumers with 4090s maybe a couple hundered thousand Theres about as many 4090s in consumers hands as there are 1660s still in use Theres far less than there are 1050s still being used Almost all 4000 series cards in consumer use are the 4060 the 4060TI and the 4070 customer is loyal to a mid range GPU brand this loyality will NOT drive his decision when heshe decides to buy a highend card This isnt a thing that happens The conversion rate is so low its irrelevant The vast bulk of consumer sales is in the mid range and they tend to not replace cards every generation,m9592oj,10.0,1i9oky5
comment,m95bqz9,NotAComplete,,1,2025-01-25 20:13:54,,,,There is a high end market and a mid range budget value and Im sure more Its seems like youre saying brand loyalty only exists in the high end market,m9592oj,10.0,1i9oky5
comment,m95i8kg,mexodus,,0,2025-01-25 20:46:55,,,,Nah I will give up since I cannot convey my thoughts in an understandable way I am saying if you are buying mid range cards and are loyal to one brand that only offers mid range cards you are required to break that loyality if you want a high end card and you will be star you simply cannot get it from the brand you are loyal to So I very much believe that brand loyalty exist in every budget category Just saying I dont believe people despite desiring high end will stay with mid range just for loyality reasons,m95bqz9,11.0,1i9oky5
comment,m967wk5,FrootLoop23,,1,2025-01-25 23:00:47,,,,Im glad that AMD doesnt offer a GPU that starts at 2k because in the real world it will be much higher I hope they never do,m956s7p,8.0,1i9oky5

comment,m954oi8,Numerlor,,71,2025-01-25 19:38:25,,,,amd is not doing anything smartly they completely fucked up their current launch presumably because of nvidias pricing,m94dz2n,4.0,1i9oky5

comment,m9685r9,Numerlor,,3,2025-01-25 23:02:11,,,,Stores already have stock while basically nothing has been revealed about the GPUs and the first release date mention was in a tweet it has been obviously pushed back as a reaction to nvidias roundup,m9674d7,6.0,1i9oky5
comment,m96bk80,FrootLoop23,,21,2025-01-25 23:20:59,,,,Considering Nvidia hasnt released the 5070 models yet its probably smart that AMD decided to wait Get it right on price and have the support for FSR4 day one Let Nvidia go first with their competing product Personally I dont want an Nvidia monopoly like they currently have AMD doing well can only benefit us,m9685r9,7.0,1i9oky5
comment,m97gq1e,QuickQuirk,,9,2025-01-26 03:16:42,,,,yeap AMD keeps rushing products to launch just because nvidia is launching thats hurt them in the past Release a good product well priced when its ready,m96bk80,8.0,1i9oky5

comment,m9hme9z,ChefCurryYumYum,,1,2025-01-27 17:56:08,,,,We dont know that AMD fucked up their current launch They have delayed the launch presumably so reviewers will test the current 50x series against Nvidias last gen cards where AMD doesnt think they will look that impressive for gen over gen We already are hearing of massive shortages of the 5090 while AMD has been stockpiling units of their next gen GPUs since December Im reserving judgement until the AMD products launch,m954oi8,5.0,1i9oky5
comment,m9c34a8,themortalrealm,,0,2025-01-26 21:19:38,,,,Youd be better off buying a mid range nvidia card unless you enjoy your games having optimization issues,m94dz2n,4.0,1i9oky5
comment,m9cxath,FrootLoop23,,1,2025-01-26 23:41:21,,,,I have a 7900XT Dont know what optimization issues youre talking about unless you mean the sorry state PC games sometimes release in GPU brand cant save you from that,m9c34a8,5.0,1i9oky5

comment,m958tun,juh4z,,12,2025-01-25 19:59:02,,,,I want the most competition possible be that AMD Intel or any other company fuck NVidia That said other companies just dont stand a chance they can make good options for those on a budget maybe even something mid range if you dont really care about ray tracing performance although you should cause we already have games that require ray tracing capable gpus to run but if you wanna play at 4k with ray tracing and all those shenanigans Intel or AMD will never get you what you need,m94ek4r,5.0,1i9oky5
comment,m963ezh,TheKappaOverlord,,4,2025-01-25 22:36:18,,,,Realistically theyll release like one high end card in 2026 assuming they dont nope out realizing its too far gone but they wont seriously return to high end card business If they give now theyll never reclaim what little foothold they had to begin with Instead their home will be midrange cards Its either Intel or bust And unfortunately the calls indicate its bust,m94ek4r,5.0,1i9oky5
comment,m95rh2a,ZaeBae22,,1,2025-01-25 21:33:39,,,,I have more faith in Intel AMD thinks 5070 undercuts are enough lmao,m94676t,3.0,1i9oky5

comment,m95o625,epraider,,20,2025-01-25 21:17:00,,,,To a degree its kind of a good thing The technology is mature and your purchase holds its value longer and isnt rapidly outclassed by new hardware right around the corner which in turn means the performance requirements for new games or tools arent going advance past your purchases capabilities for longer,m9403gv,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94oeqd,Vosofy,,4,2025-01-25 18:20:22,,,,Good Means I have no reason to drop 800 My 3080 can carry me until 70 series at least,m9403gv,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m96f8nx,Faranocks,,2,2025-01-25 23:41:36,,,,Kinda doubt it Nvidia is stuck on same node next Gen should be up a node or two Im sure it will cost too much but it might still at least be a decent uplift in performance,m9403gv,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m949pd3,The_Deku_Nut,,12,2025-01-25 17:09:55,,,,Its almost like were reaching the limits of what can be accomplished using current materials,m9403gv,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m94ffh3,sdwvit,,32,2025-01-25 17:37:32,,,,Or there is no competition,m949pd3,3.0,1i9oky5
comment,m963sbz,TheKappaOverlord,,4,2025-01-25 22:38:18,,,,Nah We really are reading the Limit as far as what can technically be done with current materials The most we can do as far as genuinely improving computing now is either make the already crazy big cards even bigger or we start figuring out how to shove quantum computing cores into our computers There being no competition means theres no reason for Nvidia to give a shit about quality control So they can shit out the biggest turds imaginable now and theres no recourse until people either beg AMD to come back wont happen or Intel produces a competent alternative wont happen,m94ffh3,4.0,1i9oky5
comment,m999qbu,V1pArzZz,,1,2025-01-26 12:41:55,,,,AMD or Intel could come back eventually happened on cpu market where AMD was far behind and suddenly outperformed Intel 7900xtx is pretty much a 4080 equivalent with bad RT so its not that hugely behind either,m963sbz,5.0,1i9oky5

comment,m97420l,MVPizzle_Redux,,1,2025-01-26 02:01:45,,,,No thats not what Im saying What Im saying is theyre all investing in AI so the hardware will be geared less towards gaming from Nvidias end since thats where the profit is coming from,m972a2v,3.0,1i9oky5
comment,m977kkj,DonArgueWithMe,,2,2025-01-26 02:22:18,,,,Do you think major AI farms are running 4090s5090s Sure somebody running a home ai project might but anybody making an actual investment would be running professional hardware Look up the nvidia h100 for an example its tens of thousands per chip with entire stacks costing up to nearly half a million example,m97420l,4.0,1i9oky5

comment,m97h75x,QuickQuirk,,13,2025-01-26 03:19:39,,,,Given that the 50 series so far seems to be both 1 Stagnant on performance per dollar 2 Performance per watt then the biggest competitor to the 50 series is the 40 series Getting a 4070 might be a very reasonable choice Well know more after the 5070 releases,m967ffz,2.0,1i9oky5

comment,m96cvsm,thedoc90,,8,2025-01-25 23:28:23,,,,Frame generation in general is not going to ever be used in competetive shooter games Some support it like marvel rivals but if you were to say get 90 fps in Marvel rivals at 1440p on a 165 hz gsync monitor without framegen and activate framegen it would in the case of single framegen drop your rendered frames to 82 fps so youre losing 8 frames per second of input and frame data because input can only happen on rendered frames not on interpolated frames You also lose 8 frames of reaction time per second because lets say someone fires a projectile in your direction during and the timing coincides with an interpolated frame The actual information that the projectile was fired will only be communicatwd on the next real frame 3x framegen to 165hz will lock your fps to 54 and 4x will lock your fps to 40ish Below 60gps interpolated frame quality massively degrades even on 2x frame generation and the input lag becomes much more obvious This is a lower fps example but itd be much the same for high fps users If youre playing on a 480fps monitor and you can achieve 300 fps natively itll be a net loss to add framegen It also introduces rendering overhead so you will always lose some amount of real frames for fake ones Best usecase for multi framegen is say you hit 120fps in the witcher 3 and you 4x framegen to 480 Not a competitive game no advantage lost and a high starting framerate Its a sink or swim technology that massively favors the high end cards,m95ag0s,5.0,1i9oky5

comment,m93u8ly,CMDR_omnicognate,,6,2025-01-25 15:55:48,,,,yeah i know that and you know that but my point is 90 of people dont know that even people who are pretty into tech dont often get into the details of these sorts of things to understand they just assume well get similar performance increases every generation hence it not being unreasonable that people would think that way,m93q5ki,3.0,1i9oky5
comment,m93wtdf,EnigmaSpore,,1,2025-01-25 16:08:20,,,,True but the 30803090 used the same gpu chip 3090 is always going to be an outlier due it not really being a typical 80ti90 class chip The 1080ti 2080ti 4090 5090 are all separate bigger chips than their xx80 counterparts,m93k2ji,2.0,1i9oky5
comment,m93lvpv,JerryLZ,,1,2025-01-25 15:13:00,,,,They are saying we knew this just from the specs they released already Barely anything changed and we already knew it wasnt a big enough bump to matter Normally once those specs come out you would get a good idea of how much better the new card is but its nearly identical on paper You would also be right about the assuming from the previous patterns but nobody should be assuming anymore since nvidia gave the specs,m93k2ji,2.0,1i9oky5

comment,m93tkqz,Asleeper135,,5,2025-01-25 15:52:34,,,,Specs dont always paint the whole picture The 900 series was a pretty big boost in both performance and efficiency over the 700 series despite the specs being a relatively modest boost and being made on the same node By the specs the 30 series should have been an astronomical leap over the 20 series but in reality it was a pretty normal generational leap for graphics performance That said they usually are pretty telling and based on the 5090 that is certainly the case with the 50 series,m93j5g7,1.0,1i9oky5

comment,m96187v,Asleeper135,,1,2025-01-25 22:24:35,,,,No looking at the specs leaves out the very important detail that they doubled CUDA core count per SM or whatever they call them Its a major architectural difference which is exactly the kind of thing left out by just checking the specs,m95y0gs,5.0,1i9oky5

comment,m967k80,Elrric,,2,2025-01-25 22:58:55,,,,Im in the same boat as you but if the 5080 performs worse than the 4090 maybe a secondhand 4090 is not a bad option as they are roughly the same price in my area Brand new they still go for 21002200 at least I was down for the 5090 but 3300 is just unreasonable imo,m93nkqt,3.0,1i9oky5
comment,m93mw6x,-FourOhFour-,,1,2025-01-25 15:18:26,,,,Good upgrade sure good value upgrade not really getting a 40 gen card would likely be better between the age and people still upgrading to the latest and greatest for the sake of it decent chance theyll go down in price and with comparable stats to the 50s cheaper card wins,m93ldrz,2.0,1i9oky5

comment,m94oyi1,Kiwi_In_Europe,,2,2025-01-25 18:22:57,,,,It might be worth trying again with DLSS4 it basically lets you use the NVIDIA app to override a games native implementation which can vary widely in quality RDR2 for example has famously shitty DLSS and run it direct from the app,m94o4kq,5.0,1i9oky5

comment,m94bw82,LeCrushinator,,2,2025-01-25 17:20:32,,,,The 5000 series is a minor performance bump like 2030 and it was accomplished mostly though increased die size which means more power consumption and because of heat the clock speeds were not increased They were only able to go from a 5nm to a 4nm process which didnt give much room for efficiency improvements For the 5000 series theyre mostly relying on increased compute power and DLSS 4 to accomplish gains Because of the minor gains its no surprise that a 5080 isnt faster than a 4090,,0.0,1i9oky5
comment,m98blez,None,,1,2025-01-26 07:08:16,,,,Its more like 1015 if that in applestoapples comparison The 5090 has 33 more CUDA cores nearly 30 more power consumption and massively improved memory bandwidth due to being on a 512bit bus Thats the only reason it was able to beat a 4090 by 30 The 5080 has none of that The spec sheet looks very similar to a 4080 Super Very minor CUDA core count very minor power increase and very minor memory bandwidth increase relative to the 4080S means itll be a slightly better 4080 Super,m94bw82,1.0,1i9oky5

comment,m94bbt6,MachineStreet7107,,2,2025-01-25 17:17:48,,,,Where did I say I expect to see 1080ti levels of performance improvements every gen All I stated was the improvement between gens is diminishing which is expected but is still noteworthy And what card gets 4090 performance with less power draw and half the cost You must be referencing something utilizing 4x frame gen 5070 It still doesnt reach the same performance as it compromises latency IMO Frame gen is a great innovation and Im excited to see it grow more but right now it has a notable trade off in latency Youre right tho it is a cool feature that will be beneficial to consumers,m945gu4,3.0,1i9oky5

comment,m97nq17,SigmaLance,,2,2025-01-26 04:00:57,,,,Its all relative really Not everyone is upgrading year to year so a new release might fall within the timeframe of when people want to upgrade Its much the same with any product TVs are refreshed yearly cars refrigerators etc Year to year adoption does seem frivolous but there are so many people buying things that yearly refreshes arent necessarily a bad thing,m96hesw,1.0,1i9oky5
