comment,mscj3y3,tastyratz,,7,2025-05-14 22:04:52,,,,From what I can find it looks like some users have done the math and spelled it out on NS1 Based on this thread Docked 786Gflop Undocked 460Mhz 471Gflop,msbz5yy,2.0,1kmo64m
comment,msc3o66,SQL617,,24,2025-05-14 20:46:02,,,,For anyone else curious in my hears in computing I dont recall seeing this measurement A teraflop TFLOP is a unit of measurement that expresses a computers ability to perform one trillion floatingpoint operations per second,msbz5yy,2.0,1kmo64m
comment,mscao8d,Wottiger,,10,2025-05-14 21:20:55,,,,Thank you Im still stuck in the days where processor GHz was the only measurement that seemed to matter 1GHz athlon processor paired with my voodoo3 graphics card gave me a pretty sweet setup,msc3o66,3.0,1kmo64m
comment,mscbyyd,danielv123,,23,2025-05-14 21:27:29,,,,Counting GHz doesnt make much sense when Nvidia GPUs in current gaming products run at 07 24ghz on 256 21760 cores The 100x difference on the core count makes the frequency pretty irrelevant,mscao8d,4.0,1kmo64m
comment,msceej1,Wottiger,,9,2025-05-14 21:40:00,,,,Those numbers are crazy What a giant leap from those days I look at PC specs nowadays and am completely lost in comparison shopping Lol,mscbyyd,5.0,1kmo64m

comment,msgvh34,dreadcain,,1,2025-05-15 15:57:02,,,,GHz never made all that much sense as a comparison except when directly identical or near identical chips Different architectures can do a lot more or a lot less in one clock cycle than others,mscbyyd,5.0,1kmo64m
comment,mscfw5r,AmNoSuperSand52,,6,2025-05-14 21:47:42,,,,The issue with frequency is that its a description of the operating parameters rather than the output So it only means something when the other parts of the chip are along with it Teraflops arent a super important measurement but it describes what kind of output power the system has which is a little more comparable across different devices,mscao8d,4.0,1kmo64m
comment,msnh00p,Low_Surround998,,1,2025-05-16 16:40:12,,,,It has been discussed in every chip announcement since Ive been alive Thats basically the only time Ive ever seen it used and I never paid 1 second of attention to it Its just raw theoretical computing power Real world benchmarks are a much better measurement for comparison purposes,msc3o66,3.0,1kmo64m
comment,mscqbm2,Interstellar-Metroid,,4,2025-05-14 22:45:19,,,,This wrong the Switch is 045 Tflops Docked and Handheld is about 015 Tflops I dont trust these socalled Switch 2 specs at all from DF,msbz5yy,2.0,1kmo64m
comment,msd43pc,DimiBlue,,1,2025-05-15 00:04:02,,,,I hope the switch 2 has the option to keep switch 1 games in docked mode while undocked,msbz5yy,2.0,1kmo64m
comment,mseurmt,meltymcface,,1,2025-05-15 07:34:51,,,,Even in undocked mode switch 2 would be running those switch 1 games with more than twice the resources than the Switch 1 docked,msd43pc,3.0,1kmo64m
comment,msd9i5s,Chickat28,,1,2025-05-15 00:35:23,,,,Switch 1 is less than half of what you said Its not even 5 tf in docked,msbz5yy,2.0,1kmo64m

comment,msc1vra,Realistic_Condition7,,21,2025-05-14 20:36:32,,,,A lot of switch 1 games run better undocked because theyre essentially running in the same device at a lower resolution,msbtpxq,1.0,1kmo64m
comment,msby1b4,flac_rules,,5,2025-05-14 20:16:29,,,,The story is how much,msbtpxq,1.0,1kmo64m
comment,msbxnvp,psychocopter,,5,2025-05-14 20:14:41,,,,I didnt see anything online confirming or denying the switch 2 having a built in fan That really seems to be the only thing that might would raise concerns but again its neither confirming nor denying it The dock have a fan is meant to cool the dock itself as its a power delivery system much like the power supply for a laptop or computer Of course taking the switch off of the dock and having it run on battery will drop performance to extend battery life,msbtpxq,1.0,1kmo64m
comment,mscmqjz,motorboat_mcgee,,1,2025-05-14 22:25:00,,,,Well its certainly causing a stir on the internet so I guess the story has done its job,msbtpxq,1.0,1kmo64m

comment,msbyyhq,Kamakaziturtle,,-8,2025-05-14 20:21:00,,,,Not really least to any notable degree but the current Switchs dock is more or less just a connector for the TV not much more The Switch 2 Dock actively increases performance So it showing a dip in performance when going undocked is just things working exactly as advertised It means the dock works The story is nothing,msbtpxq,1.0,1kmo64m

comment,msc26sa,bonesnaps,,46,2025-05-14 20:38:13,,,,Gcube is about 10 gflops of power and switch 2 is 3 tflops So the nonjoke answer is actually about 300 Edit My 5 year old 3070 gpu is about 2000 gamecubes Sure doesnt feel like it Anyone have 2k cubes to trade me,msbulr2,3.0,1kmo64m
comment,msc9jav,Tenziru,,14,2025-05-14 21:15:11,,,,Nope its only 2160 game cubes you were close gamecube is 94gflops and 20300gflops for you gpu divided by the GameCube power you get the number of GameCubes which is 1833 more GameCubes powerful then switch 2,msc26sa,4.0,1kmo64m
comment,msd4k8q,bonesnaps,,1,2025-05-15 00:06:43,,,,The wiki I saw said that was peak gflops so yeah its likely lower on average like you stated,msc9jav,5.0,1kmo64m
comment,msc92dw,Tenziru,,6,2025-05-14 21:12:47,,,,This a good joke but if anyone is wondering you would need 327 GameCubes,msbu3zf,2.0,1kmo64m

comment,mscx7ei,Fedoraus,,9,2025-05-14 23:24:20,,,,roughly 300 in terms of flops which makes me wonder why the switch OS is so much more unoptimized The Wii U is less than a third as powerful as the switch iirc but BOTW runs significantly better on it,msbqbmq,1.0,1kmo64m

comment,msc19a9,Realistic_Condition7,,19,2025-05-14 20:33:07,,,,Well many games on Switch 1 ran better undocked my guess is because of the lower resolution Im actually surprised it runs worse undocked because the resolution is still going down I dont know if these tests measured plugged in handheld vs handheld running on battery power,msbp0r3,1.0,1kmo64m
comment,msbrzfb,your_evil_ex,,24,2025-05-14 19:47:03,,,,doubt the fan in the dock blowing on the plastic shell of the Switch 2 will make that big of a difference Im guessing battery life is one of the main issues here,msbp0r3,1.0,1kmo64m
comment,msbtziv,None,,24,2025-05-14 19:56:45,,,,Id imagine it heats up more due to the battery discharging as well,msbrzfb,2.0,1kmo64m
comment,msdfm8m,stellvia2016,,12,2025-05-15 01:10:37,,,,The whole discussion around the hardware has been really disappointing to me because so many people have no idea what theyre talking about Also lots of completely made up info When making a mobilecapable device there will always be tradeoffs for price size heat and performance The docked Switch2 is very close in performance to the current flagship Snapdragon8 Elite SoC Which you cant buy in a device for less than 650 and usually a lot more Nvidia hasnt even released another Gen of SoC chip newer than the Switch2 uses yet,msbrzfb,2.0,1kmo64m

comment,msbtccd,Gheta,,8,2025-05-14 19:53:39,,,,From what Im seeing its worse on Switch 1 than 2 Switch 2s GPU looks like it goes from 307 TFLOPS down to 171 TFLOPS Switch 1s GPU goes from 768Mhz down to 307Mhz unboosted GFLOPS roughly similar Thats a 60 loss on Switch 1 and a 44 loss on Switch 2,msbq6py,2.0,1kmo64m

comment,msceapr,Dirty_Dragons,,73,2025-05-14 21:39:27,,,,Its the current trend of making gaming news negative The article could have been titled Switch 2 has significant performance gains when docked,msbyj9j,1.0,1kmo64m

comment,msdmacl,krigr,,10,2025-05-15 01:48:50,,,,It removes battery constraints and improves the cooling performance It isnt doing any processing like an eGPU but nobody said it was The external cooling alone is a pretty good innovation External cooling accessories for laptops have been around for decades but theyre usually onesizefitsall designs from third party companies I dont remember seeing a gaming laptoptablethandheldetc with ventilation fans shifted to an external dock as part of the factory design before,mscbswo,2.0,1kmo64m

comment,mscz3tg,HopelessRespawner,,-1,2025-05-14 23:35:27,,,,S2 is going to get hot when it upclocks The body of the Switch 2 wont efficiently transfer heat to the dock to get active cooling from it but its going to heat the dock all the same Dock will need active cooling to reduce heat on its internals Need to remember that the dock is passing much higher wattage this time plus handling 4k Ethernet and peripherals,mscw7rs,3.0,1kmo64m
comment,msd02jl,TorpeAlex,,-4,2025-05-14 23:41:10,,,,But it doesnt do any lifting in regards to performance right,mscz3tg,4.0,1kmo64m
comment,mseiy6g,Phoenix__Light,,6,2025-05-15 05:40:18,,,,I mean technically no You could in theory just plug it in to unlock docked mode performance in handheld The only thing the dock does is send the signal to the switch to trigger it,msd02jl,5.0,1kmo64m
comment,msd5f13,HopelessRespawner,,4,2025-05-15 00:11:43,,,,What answer are you looking for here The dock is a glorified usb hub with a cooling fan Are you trying to prove some point,msd02jl,5.0,1kmo64m

comment,msexl0m,HopelessRespawner,,1,2025-05-15 08:04:21,,,,It is very unlikely that the fan in the dock will provide enough cooling to do anything but keep the dock from overheating To be of any use to the console it would need really good contact with the system and a better medium to transfer heat If thermal throttling is a problem with this console Im sure well hear about it soon after launch but no one at any event has said anything yet Hope the fan isnt too loud,msex1ct,7.0,1kmo64m

comment,msc8pw7,lan60000,,0,2025-05-14 21:11:02,,,,What do you mean theres never been an issue for switch 1 The console forced games to run at 30fps and limited resolutions whilst having stuttering issues as well You literally pointed out the performance difference and is willingly dismissing it due to personal bias Switch 2 is attempting to push games towards higher fps performances and a higher resolution whilst tackling more hardware intensive games on a portable console and you never thought what would happen if the device cant handle it,msc7lea,7.0,1kmo64m

comment,msdckbj,haahaahaa,,0,2025-05-15 00:53:02,,,,Its a console Performance isnt important In handheld mode it will change its power profile because its running on battery In the dock games will be running at 4k In handheld mode they will be 1080 The question will be how the games feel Like others have said handheld is sometimes better on the current Switch because rendering the game at 720p is significantly easier With the Switch 2 the question will be how upscaling is utilized I assume 4K will actually be 1440 or 1080 upscaled Then what happens in handheld mode Does it try to run natively at 1080 Is it 720 upscaled I assume upscaled So the question to ask is going to be how much worse do the games look in handheld mode On desktop 720 upscaled to 1080 kinda sucks Fewer pixels to upscale from so details get lost,,0.0,1kmo64m
