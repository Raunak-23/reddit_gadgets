comment,m0ilm0e,None,,-11,2024-12-05 09:50:04,,,,Thats stupid you dont need a a cat nor do we have the slightest use for asteroid mining Asteroids even in asteroid fields are spread out hundreds of thousands of miles even if going in and out of earths gravity ever made space mining make sense The Earth is already a giant ball of resources where you dont have to fight orbit and reentry energy costs All human mining is just a fraction of 1 of the Earths crush There is no real scenario where you needo space in space until you have like like robots making robots and swarms of unlimited labor in post scarcity future utopia dreams where you build space megastructure just because you ran out of anything else to do For real productivity or money making space mining make zero sense Its 100 a scam to get investor money with promises that make no sense There is no space economy space tourism or space mining happening because there is no need and no Earth like destination in this solar system worth expanding to just like expanding to Antarctica or the bottom of the ocean is possible and much easier than space but nobody is interested because its a dumb idea that would just suck for people to live and cost infinite money for no reason Once money doesnt matter you can do silly shit like that but until then no chance and youll almost certainly never need a robot cat to do any of that,,0.0,1h6yphl
comment,m0iusew,YZJay,,8,2024-12-05 11:28:01,,,,With space mining you dont need to worry about land rights environmental impacts ancient burial grounds ecological harm etc You just exhaust the entire asteroid and move on to the next,m0ilm0e,1.0,1h6yphl
comment,m0j6v5e,Spectrum1523,,1,2024-12-05 13:08:14,,,,Land rights are only not an issue because nobody cares about asteroids now As soon as it becomes economically viable to mine them people will very much have an opinion on who they belong to,m0iusew,2.0,1h6yphl
comment,m0j671l,Spectrum1523,,2,2024-12-05 13:03:28,,,,Ignoring that other useful tech has come from space engineering Id say the biggest argument for space mining is space manufacturing Once you have orbital industry its easier than bringing the material up off of the planet I cant see how this would be a practical concern for centuries though youre right that we wont be doing any astroid mining any time soon,m0ilm0e,1.0,1h6yphl
