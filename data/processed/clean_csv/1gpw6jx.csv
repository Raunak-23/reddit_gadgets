comment,lwtwr5t,NancyPelosisRedCoat,,37,2024-11-12 23:25:45,,,,We find that even with a few hundred demos the model is able to learn the procedure and generalize new environments it hasnt encountered Added Krieger The model is so good learning things we havent taught it Like if it drops the needle it will automatically pick it up and continue This isnt something I taught it do The model could be used to quickly train a robot to perform any type of surgical procedure the researchers said The team is now using imitation learning to train a robot to perform not just small surgical tasks but a full surgery Before this advancement programming a robot to perform even a simple aspect of a surgery required handcoding every step Someone might spend a decade trying to model suturing Krieger said And thats suturing for just one type of surgery I wonder how good it can recover from things going wrong Picking up the needle by itself is impressive but could it also recover from puncturing an artery or something as well It is still pretty cool though,lwthicy,1.0,1gpw6jx

comment,lwvwz8q,aksdb,,8,2024-11-13 07:53:14,,,,A conceptual problem nowever is that we will get more and more robots and then less and less surgeons First because hospitals will not pay for both But more important if most procedures or even just specific procedures are mostly handled by robots under supervision how would new surgeons be trained After a while we would have few surgeons and most of them dont have realworld experience So if anything goes wrong they cant even really jump in anymore,lwv0bkc,4.0,1gpw6jx

comment,lwtupma,JukePlz,,8,2024-11-12 23:13:52,,,,I think its more accurate to say it can be trained for anything in the data its feed But even with a million videos if none of those includes the specific mistake or unexpected problem the robot wont be able to learn to recover from it Recovering from a suture point moving to an unexpected spot is one thing because all it has to do to recover is just find the string again and perform the same operation it was performing in the first place but suppose something happens like a foreign object falls in an object that was never in the training data Does the robot know it has to remove it from the patient Can it distinguish its a spongepiece of the ceilinginsectbroken instrumental that has to be picked up or thrown out and tell it apart from something like a tumoral growth that it must not touch There are probably solutions to training for these but its quite more complex than just make it watch more videos AI can imitate humans but unless we finally develop AGI the AI will be limited in understanding based on its training and not be able to handle complex creative situations a human could device on the spot The good thing is that these types of robots dont need to be completely perfect to be useful and can be implemented in lowrisk surgeries with human supervision while the technology continues to be perfected,lwtjrdf,2.0,1gpw6jx

comment,lx01cqc,GuerrillaRodeo,,2,2024-11-13 23:27:03,,,,surgery lol The video in the article shows a robot suturing a wound While that alone is admittedly pretty impressive by itself keep in mind that surgeons often let med students do that and mostly unsupervised too This is by comparison not a big deal compared to the actual surgery and you have perfectly welltrained medical staff around you if something really really goes wrong surgeon typing the report anaesthesist keeping the patient sedated nurses cleaning up instruments all in the immediate vicinity like if you puncture a big artery or something and this rarely ever happens during stitching up Thats only surgery in the broadest sense from a physicians point of view Its relatively trivial even a decadeslong psychiatrist should be able to remember basic stitching techniques from med school Point is The robot has been taught the most basic surgical task Its a first step and it looks promising but theres still a LONG way to go before I would even trust it with just removing my gall bladder already a rather trivial task for visceral surgeons,,0.0,1gpw6jx
