comment,n6ahre7,SupremeDictatorPaul,,3,2025-08-01 03:57:02,,,,An alternate version of this is when a private equity firm buys the company and then fires everyone not absolutely required to take money for the subscription service They have zero interest in the long term of the company their only goal is to squeeze all of the money out they can today and let the company collapse once it cant extract enough to make any more profit,n65tfix,2.0,1mdxtek

comment,n654gn0,Whoisrefah,,205,2025-07-31 10:46:50,,,,Not only this but Ive been a customer for 14 years with whistle I get an email last week telling me I have 45 days to migrate before they shut down None of the whistle tacking history achievements will migrate to Tractive There is NO way to archive or backup this data Whats worse all my Whistle dog trackers stopped updating location and activity on the morning of July 29th and the sync wheel just spins but the collars never blink blue indicating a sync Its like just shut off the backend without the 45 day grace period My subscription is still valid just doesnt work anymore Seems like Whistle told everyone to GTFO and walk away whistle was owned by M M Mars They sure now how to piss off a long time customer Their communication is horrible around this acquisition FFS MARS and Tractive,,0.0,1mdxtek
comment,n65mngx,Zestyclose-Novel1157,,77,2025-07-31 12:47:31,,,,I would send an email requiring a fix within 48 hours and then dispute the remaining value of the subscription when they dont fix it,n654gn0,1.0,1mdxtek
comment,n65rhr4,Whoisrefah,,25,2025-07-31 13:14:30,,,,It wont even reset so its either dead technically or bricked its was bought June 30th 2024 so its OOW Not uncommon for these to die Ive literally bought 5 of the trackers due to failure with this model for my two dogs About once every 18 months Ive had serversl version of Tagg and Whitsle trackers and this was the only model to fail about every 18 months,n65mngx,2.0,1mdxtek
comment,n666byq,Chuckelb,,-39,2025-07-31 14:29:30,,,,I have three whistles They are all still working just like whistletractive said they would Tractive is giving free devices for anybody with a whistle Im pretty happy about it Higher quality devices with more battery life and more features Tracking shows mine should arrive tomorrow In addition any subscription time you have left is rolling over to tractive This really all seems like a win to me Im pretty happy with it,n654gn0,1.0,1mdxtek

comment,n66o65d,Chuckelb,,-5,2025-07-31 15:52:56,,,,No But Ive been looking to get away from Whistle for awhile The constant failure of the trackers the barely functional app and the abysmal gps tracking theyre almost more of a novelty than a functional tracker Ive been interested in Fi trackers but you have to use their collar and I find their collars ugly I have no experience with Tractive for all I know they could be worse than Whistle Their trackers have an IP rating though instead of trust us bro theyre waterproof Tractive also uses 4GLTE networks instead of whistle 2G Even in areas of good reception a Whistle tracker would take 35 minutes to report its position if your dog was out of range of your home Wifi,n66k3c4,3.0,1mdxtek
comment,n670lgm,Vandrel,,2,2025-07-31 16:51:35,,,,I havent used Whistle this is honestly the first Ive heard of it but Tractive has been great in my experience Been using it for years to keep tabs on a stray cat we kind of take care of and on foster dogs just in case we get one that tries to escape the fence Theyve generally been pretty reliable had one tracker stop working over the course of 3 years but we have the higher subscription tier which means theyll replace the tracker once per year if something happens to it so it didnt cost us extra Sometimes the app struggles to connect to the tracker for live tracking but that might be more because of being in a semirural area,n66o65d,4.0,1mdxtek

comment,n671f41,Chuckelb,,1,2025-07-31 16:55:22,,,,The employee of who Whistle Tractive The Whistles were garbage I stuck with them because its been too expensive and too much work to switch My family has a total of six different dogs with trackers all with their subscriptions starting and stopping at different times Switching would have meant 500ish in trackers using multiple apps for a couple years while subscriptions run out our abandoning subscriptions and wasting that money This is perfect for us We get new trackers without spending the money and the subscriptions are just transferred over to tractive I have no idea if tractive trackers or the app are better Ive never used them Im happy with how the transfer has gone so far I had all six trackers ordered and subscriptions transferred in about 10 minutes The new trackers havent arrived yet so I cant speak to how well they work Their specs are much better and Im hopeful though,n66kxnk,3.0,1mdxtek

comment,n65t9oo,Hvarfa-Bragi,,30,2025-07-31 13:24:05,,,,What i hear is they killed their biggest competitor and will get some to most of their customers Seems like a fair trade for a little money which is immaterial to large corps,n65cyh2,1.0,1mdxtek

comment,n67qx6j,Calaheim_Koraka,,1,2025-07-31 18:52:23,,,,Honestly for shit like this customers should be allowed to return owned devices for a significant percentage of the orginal purchas price Oh want to nuke your competition then pay for the proper recycling of all the hardware people bought,n65cyh2,1.0,1mdxtek
comment,n666lx2,Chuckelb,,-12,2025-07-31 14:30:49,,,,The service isnt turned off And all whistle subscribers are getting free devices and having our subscriptions extended,n65cyh2,1.0,1mdxtek
comment,n666zsq,Bdr1983,,5,2025-07-31 14:32:40,,,,I read from others that their devices already no longer work so might be that Anyways it will be turned off and the new service misses quite some functions Besides that its insane to just throw away that many devices Absolutely insane,n666lx2,2.0,1mdxtek
comment,n668ylf,Chuckelb,,-3,2025-07-31 14:42:03,,,,I have 3 whistle devices that are still working Tractive is giving us new devices for free with better battery life and more features though physically they are a bit large for my taste There are a couple features the whistle had that tractive doesnt but personally I think the tractive feature lineup is better Im sure others would disagree If I remember right Im trading whistle tracking how much my dog drinks for tractive having bark monitoring and heart rate monitor And instead of just throwing them away taking them to an e waste recycler seems like a better idea to me,n666zsq,3.0,1mdxtek
comment,n66cb7s,Bdr1983,,5,2025-07-31 14:57:41,,,,Oh yes please recycle them But its still very wasteful that these devices are going to be destroyed before end of life,n668ylf,4.0,1mdxtek
comment,n66kgpo,Chuckelb,,2,2025-07-31 15:35:47,,,,The whistle devices were notoriously bad Ive had 9 of them over the last five years Support always replaced them for free so thats cool They would also lecture you not to get the devices get wet even though they were advertised as waterproof It seems more wasteful to me to keep using a device with such a high failure rate that generated so much waste,n66cb7s,5.0,1mdxtek
