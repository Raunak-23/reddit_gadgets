comment,m4177wv,Ben_Kenobi_,,182,2024-12-27 14:06:16,,,,Yeah I mean I dont think mainstream was their goal with that price point Im not fully sure what their goal is Maybe just RD and releasing something to recoup some costs then come out with a mainstream model later Also testing the water with enterprise adoption Oculus has a much better chance with their price point but idk whats going to get them there I bet something smaller lighter with better battery life and perfect hand controls instead of using controllers would help but thats probably still a bit off Also obviously some killer apps,m416afk,1.0,1hnfbds
comment,m419ub0,ExtruDR,,75,2024-12-27 14:23:54,,,,I think the point was to kickstart the development of apps that could or would become killer apps compelling people to buy an Apple VR unit in the future Most people certainly most of their customers are awash in screens the have an iPhone probably an iPad maybe a MacBook maybe an Apple Watch might very well have Apple TV really I mean more devices Better have a good use case even if money was no object,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41f8qc,pinkynarftroz,,37,2024-12-27 14:58:02,,,,The only good use case Ive seen are games where your avatar is stationary basically racing game and flight sims Every single other use case is better with a real screen and actual objects It really hard to convince people VR is cool when almost every experience with it is worse than the alternative right now,m419ub0,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m444vs3,kevihaa,,13,2024-12-27 23:56:08,,,,It really hard to convince people VR is cool when almost every experience with it is worse than the alternative right now Ive found the bigger issue to be that folks underestimate how social an experience gaming can be even if youre playing a single player game Kids roommates friends significant others etc can dip in and out and watch what youre doing ask whats going on etc the same as they would if you were watching a movie Whereas VR is extremely isolating The benefit is that the level of immersion even in lower resolution games is absolutely astounding The problem is that the cost of that immersion is to be completely cut off from the rest of the world Like I think VR is awesome I have had gaming experiences in VR that are unmatched by 30 years of playing pancake games and yet my VR headsets gather dust because its just too challenging to find time where I know I can be completely isolated vs just booting up Steam and knowing I can dip out if something comes up,m41f8qc,4.0,1hnfbds

comment,m41pwb9,DarthBuzzard,,18,2024-12-27 15:59:08,,,,The only good use case Ive seen are games where your avatar is stationary Maybe thats because youve only seen VR and havent tried it If anything its the opposite Many of the most popular and highest rated games are ones where you move fast,m41f8qc,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m47esax,pinkynarftroz,,1,2024-12-28 15:49:53,,,,Ive tried it extensively I wanted to like it and was excited but there are just so many compromises for games its actually anti immersive,m41pwb9,5.0,1hnfbds
comment,m423uy2,Mother_Restaurant188,,5,2024-12-27 17:14:38,,,,Watching film and TV is great in VR and especially on the Vision Pro Comfort is still an issue for those sensitive to it But visually its stunning 3D content is particularly exquisite Still I sadly plan on returning my Vision Pro soon Its a fun piece of tech but Im disappointed by how lackluster Apples own efforts have been at investing in the platform I understand why third party devs arent going all in small user base low revenue potential But Im baffled at why Apple hasnt ported or created their own apps except for the few they did make The Immersive content has been nice but thats basically has been it in terms of new content And the episodes are like max 20 minutes Not even a single tv film or TV show shot in 3D Or hell at least converted to 3D Foundation would look stunning in 3D for instance So Ill just wait for the platform to mature a bit before hopping on,m41f8qc,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42o2th,DaoFerret,,5,2024-12-27 19:01:28,,,,Apple allowed phones to start recording in 3D for AppleVision with the 15 pro I think Definitely only the beginning of the maturity cycle,m423uy2,5.0,1hnfbds

comment,m42erk0,doge1976,,2,2024-12-27 18:12:12,,,,Sorry this isnt true at all Youre basing your assumption on your own feelings In truth if this was the case then the VR industry would be doing much better than it currently is I own a PSVR2 and a Meta Quest 3 but my goto is still PCPS5Xbox before VR gaming VR gaming is great for short stints but nothing longer than 12 hours at a time which isnt enough time to truly get into a game,m41ir9y,5.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42lqi4,DarthBuzzard,,2,2024-12-27 18:49:03,,,,then the VR industry would be doing much better than it currently is Thats not how it works Theres only so many parts currently in circulation for headsets to be manufactured and outside of Meta they are pricey Meta is doing decent enough but its a slow rollout because it logistically has to be its a new medium and you cant just have everyone turn up interested knowing what to expect its a try inperson thing,m42erk0,6.0,1hnfbds
comment,m45ket6,Radulno,,1,2024-12-28 05:46:23,,,,VR came back 8 years ago in 2016 with the Rift its not a new thing anymore,m42lqi4,7.0,1hnfbds
comment,m46o6it,DarthBuzzard,,1,2024-12-28 12:40:16,,,,Regardless most people have not tried VR and have no idea what its like And like I said there is no mass manufacturing going on right now because the industry has not hit a threshold of economies of scale MicroOLED displays Apple Vision Pros displays in particular are a big bottleneck with only several hundred thousand of these being manufactured worldwide annually currently,m45ket6,8.0,1hnfbds
comment,m43ldjp,Durzel,,1,2024-12-27 22:01:38,,,,Problem with that logic is that in order to kickstart development of killer VR apps on Vision Pro there has to be a viable market of buyers to sustain app makers If the only people that can actually afford the equipment are likeminded developers and a small cadre of influencers thats a pretty dry well to make a living off of All youre going to end up with is people doing proof of concept apps for an echo chamber of users Only way it would get off the ground in that scenario if Apple were resolute on the pricing would be if they subsidised development andor worked with a selection of key iOSiPadOS developers to get their apps ported over,m419ub0,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m44igi7,ExtruDR,,1,2024-12-28 01:19:14,,,,Given how much redundancy and unoriginality exists in software development I would think that a big part of speculatively developing new software is coming up with a killer app or an application category or work flow or interface mechanic that becomes revolutionary and sort of brings people to the product The stimulus like with other devices before might be the actual hardware I think that this is very much what the original Apple Vision Pro is about Putting enough of them out on peoples hands that are moreorless industry connected to come up with ideas and maybe pursue them,m43ldjp,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41jilo,Kamakaziturtle,,21,2024-12-27 15:23:13,,,,Actually the oculus 3 is pretty close to what you described I was pretty impressed with it Though the killer apps thing is still the stickler sure from a games standpoint VR does have some solid options now But theres still not enough outside of games to get people not just interested in games to want a headset And I dont think VR is ever going to be mainstream only as a gaming system,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41qm36,speculatrix,,12,2024-12-27 16:03:05,,,,I use my quest 3 more for nongames than games Virtual concerts Tourism 3D image viewing I have a 3D lenscamera combo I dont have tons of games but I do really enjoy them Im certainly happy with the money I spent on it I also bought the kiwi batterystrap which makes it much more comfortable,m41jilo,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42mbk2,turb0_encapsulator,,3,2024-12-27 18:52:09,,,,I have one that I use for VR walkthroughs When I get it working right it does the job But its such a halfbaked piece of shit with bad software and bugs galore Meta is the last company that should be building a product like this Their movefastandbreakthings dogshit culture really shows in the Oculus,m41jilo,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41xyhp,StarsMine,,10,2024-12-27 16:43:06,,,,The oculus 3 has a very damning feature though Its oculus The zuk buying it and changing the culture to push carmack out immediately doomed the brand,m41jilo,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42cnr4,drmirage809,,2,2024-12-27 18:01:09,,,,Never knew Carmack was pushed out of the thing I always thought he left as he lost interest Although I can totally see them getting tired of him very quickly He wants to be at the forefront of rendering tech pioneering new ways to further optimise code and squeeze every bit of power out of the hardware Stuff like that takes a team of skilled coders And those are expensive,m41xyhp,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42mi7p,StarsMine,,2,2024-12-27 18:53:08,,,,He lost interest because the culture changed It wasnt an antagonistic thing,m42cnr4,5.0,1hnfbds
comment,m420b5e,Kamakaziturtle,,3,2024-12-27 16:55:39,,,,Eh Apples not exactly that great Valve has been at the forefront of pretty much every shitty gaming practice and Vive honestly are they even seriously in the game And of all those only one really manages to keep the prices at a reasonable amount Yeah its lining another crappy billionaire CEOs pockets but thats kinda unavoidable,m41xyhp,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m44fnvf,locke_5,,1,2024-12-28 01:01:46,,,,The killer app will be monitor replacement Its already there for me but different people have different comfort levels theyll tolerate I use my Vision Pro during the work day to display my Windows desktop I can connect via kbm and use it just like I normally would 500 hits and I pull the screen into my living room turn on my controller boot up Steam and now Im gaming on the couch Its really fantastic,m41jilo,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m42gde0,hikingforrising19472,,2,2024-12-27 18:20:40,,,,Im convinced that AILLMs completely changed their plans Before ChatGPT Siri wasnt that helpful for voice only control but now that ChatGPT can handle natural language very well and with the camera able to interpret what its looking at real time it completely changed the ability to just use a camera vs needing to have a sizable computer on your head This is where Apple is going to be at a crossroads Will you really need hardware when these cloud based LLMsAI and agents can do many of the things you need,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m46rbax,DarthBuzzard,,2,2024-12-28 13:07:53,,,,This is where Apple is going to be at a crossroads Will you really need hardware when these cloud based LLMsAI and agents can do many of the things you need AI is limited if its on a phone because AI is all about inference The more it knows what the user wants the more it can provide utility If it can see through your eyes and hear through your ears it will be working at maximum efficiency and thats where smartglasses and eventually AR glasses come in,m42gde0,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m42vfre,Deferty,,4,2024-12-27 19:40:38,,,,In the keynote speech about the VR headset they explicitly stated that they have patents for all of the technology that they designed for the headsets In case Zuckerberg is correct and VR headsets are the future Apple will be in a great position to continue,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m421enw,sold_snek,,4,2024-12-27 17:01:31,,,,The amount of people saying the Apple headset was going to kill the Quest was hilarious There was no fucking way a 3500 was even going to make a dent in the market That was a wild ass fumble decided by someone who has already made more than I will in my entire life,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41bvdg,Sylvurphlame,,4,2024-12-27 14:37:02,,,,I tend to agree Theyre Apple they know people will buy them It looks like they sold the amount of units they were predicted to be able to produce How many people kept them is a different question perhaps But yeah theyll have to work their way to something more cost effective and easier to use for longer periods before they can truly mainstream it,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m44r7dc,Speedy-08,,3,2024-12-28 02:15:26,,,,Iirc they actually cut back on the production of Vision Pros a while back due to how lackluster the expected vs actual sales were,m41bvdg,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m421dwx,cat_prophecy,,2,2024-12-27 17:01:24,,,,Isnt Oculus its own ecosystem though Can you plug it into another system and get output To me the big reason why VR isnt attractive is that 1 I dont have a room that I can basically dedicate to it 2 it doesnt seem to lend itself to casual experiences,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m47s9o0,LeatherDude,,1,2024-12-28 17:05:35,,,,Oculus can do with PC VR and play games from Steam that have VR support You definitely dont need a whole room I play in the living room and have enough space if I move the coffee table The oculus is pretty casual friendly other wired headsets are not,m421dwx,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m42r669,Specialist-Rope-9760,,1,2024-12-27 19:17:53,,,,I think Apple saw competitors getting stuff together and they wanted to be ready with something in case the whole thing took off But it never took off,m4177wv,2.0,1hnfbds

comment,m45de9d,Triaspia2,,0,2024-12-28 04:50:09,,,,I imagine theyll release a 1000 version in a year or two alongside a vision pro for 3500 thats maybe got a bigger battery Original gets people excited about the concept and gives devs and early adopters a head start on the platform as well as bugfixes and usage data Basically repeat the occulus quest path but entirely in house,m41kk8k,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41lgh2,ThatLaloBoy,,10,2024-12-27 15:34:11,,,,Its not just the price since theyve had no problem selling expensive devices to the public in the past insert Steve Ballmer quote about how iPhone would flop for being too expensive It also needs to have a clear function and sell exactly why someone wants this Theyve running into the same problem Microsoft ran into with the Windows Phone Devs arent going to invest resources into a product with a small user base And that user base isnt going to grow if there are no apps they want to use Unless Apple finds that killer musthave app it wont matter how cheap it is Theyll be joining Oculus in making a relatively niche product,m416afk,1.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41s04d,nemoknows,,3,2024-12-27 16:10:49,,,,The stupid thing is they should know better all of their biggest products Apple II Mac iPod iPhone all shipped with a dedicated OS a well designed and intuitive UI and outofthe box useful functionalityapps The vision didnt Its like launching a console without a AAA launch title,m41lgh2,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41y4r0,Skellos,,1,2024-12-27 16:44:02,,,,Im pretty sure Apple were banking on Metas attempts to make it mainstream enough that they could have their luxury headset But thats not happened nor is it likely to happen,m41lgh2,2.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41xtaw,QuestionablePanda22,,3,2024-12-27 16:42:20,,,,Also for the average consumer these things just dont really add much to your life for the value These headsets needed to come out around the early era of smartphones and tablets to try to directly compete with those decives market share imo Phones are essential for modern life so people will shill out 1k PCsgaming consolesTVs etc arent essential but if you want to watch movies or play games you need one and the entry price is much lower I have a TV phone PC gaming console What is this or any headset going to do for me to justify the cost of pretty much upgrading my entire current setup,m416afk,1.0,1hnfbds
comment,m4199zo,Soaddk,,19,2024-12-27 14:20:09,,,,Everyone can afford METAs headsets but its still not mainstream VR is a niche product and will stay that way the last 15 years of tech history has shown us this,m416afk,1.0,1hnfbds

comment,m458ln4,click4dylan,,2,2024-12-28 04:14:16,,,,Keep at it I was the same way for years and someone told me to just keep using it and you will get used to it They were right and now I never get sick at all and can wear it for as long as I want I originally wanted to throw up after a few minutes Only took like a month or less of using it daily and its gone forever,m41c0z0,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m41c7i6,Soaddk,,7,2024-12-27 14:39:12,,,,Agree But I think it will be more in the form of augmented reality like ordinary glasses that displays information like a Headup display,m41bvd5,3.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41cg48,Undeity,,2,2024-12-27 14:40:44,,,,Id argue theyre two sides of the same coin Its just about how immersed you need to be for a given activity,m41c7i6,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41d0az,Soaddk,,3,2024-12-27 14:44:19,,,,True but the shape of the device will be a lot different if you need to go into full immersion compared to augmented Full immersion will need goggles to keep the real world light out while augmented can be achieved with ordinary glasses in the future,m41cg48,5.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41de4e,Undeity,,0,2024-12-27 14:46:43,,,,Maybe Its not like its truly full sensory immersion either way There might be more specialized products that prioritize as much immersion as possible but I dont see why you cant still get plenty of mileage out of VR in a glasses form Edit Our brains are already pretty good at tuning out irrelevant sensory information but if it truly is absolutely necessary for meaningful VR there are methods out there that can use light to unobtrusively wash out your peripheral vision Physically blocking all outside light is hardly the only option,m41d0az,6.0,1hnfbds
comment,m48ieox,None,,1,2024-12-28 19:27:06,,,,AR and VR have completely disparate use cases like theyre basically polar opposites within the XR sphere but i think googles making the right play by linking the two via Android XR giving devs all the tools up front for both technologies and putting both in the public eye simultaneously feels like it might help push one or the other over the edge the big hurdles remaining are that AR and VR face essentially opposite challenges too AR specs are awfully close to a oh i thought those were regular glasses form factor but theyre kinda a solution looking for a problem eg the appeal of live blended audiovisual translation just doesnt add much to the average persons life in total contrast VR could theoretically be funeducationaltherapeutic for anybody with the time and space to use it but the form factor and overall tech are just not there quite yet VR engineers gotta figure out how top mitigate the nausea and dizziness for one thing stops me in my tracks although i have tried in a couple years TBH it might have changed,m41c7i6,4.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41q30n,DarthBuzzard,,0,2024-12-27 16:00:10,,,,Not really Theyre separate things AR will be something akin to smartphones and VR will be more akin to PCs and tablets Smartphones may reign supreme but PCs and tables are still mainstream mega mainstream even,m41c7i6,4.0,1hnfbds

comment,m41rfu1,pinkynarftroz,,5,2024-12-27 16:07:42,,,,My assertion is that the headset form factor itself has too many inherent downsides to make mass adoption a thing There exist small comfortable headsets now but the form the technology takes has so many drawbacks that the majority of the people cannot see it as a serious tool for work or leisure Not sure you can argue this point Adoption and use has been abysmal for almost a decade,m41q9u6,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m41991p,lastMinute_panic,,189,2024-12-27 14:19:58,,,,I used to make VR games One of the biggest hurdles we couldnt ever solve was some intersection of fatigue and unease with shutting out the world With normal games after a given round you can traverse the world look at your phone take a sip of water talk to someone with relative ease That isnt true with VR headsets Its very cumbersome and the physical and psychological barrier of covering your eyes even partially is just asking too much of the user We concluded that people will say they want more immersion but only in acuteshort bursts We abandoned the market entirely a few years ago Games are hard enough,,0.0,1hnfbds
comment,m41wdow,Jlchevz,,27,2024-12-27 16:34:37,,,,Yeah Theres a reason why games have had the same format for decades A controller or device for input and a screen for feedback Its simple and it works well And unless something else comes that is as simple as that but providing a more immersive experience without more annoying drawbacks it will continue to be that way Thats my opinion VR gaming and life enhancing is too cumbersome,m41991p,1.0,1hnfbds
comment,m42nqu8,Horis_Schitt,,11,2024-12-27 18:59:41,,,,What Ive wanted from vr especially gaming is the ability to be immersed visually by the game but still interact comfortably with a controller I love that the game surrounds me and I feel like a part of it but I want to be able to sit chill and use my controller to interact and move around Having to stand sit squat throw etc gets tiring and limits how much time I want to spend with it,m41wdow,2.0,1hnfbds

comment,m46pccg,DarthBuzzard,,3,2024-12-28 12:50:53,,,,Im holding out until they dont need to do that 10 years out Theyll still be doing that in 10 years simply because these will be two separate product lines This passthrough AR is only really meant to be used indoors whereas what youre after is the seethrough outdoors AR We need two separate versions because seethrough will be a lot more limited youre adding photons on top of real world photons youre always going to have limitations with image quality color and field of view Passthrough AR gives you access to edit every pixel of the real world so essentially you can make people invisible remove a building and just have virtual objects that are indistinguishable from real ones Seethrough AR will struggle here but Im sure it will be very popular since its the mobile outdoor version of this,m45955z,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m44ufws,lastMinute_panic,,4,2024-12-28 02:37:01,,,,Haha yeeeep The reason this has stretched on for so long imo is people drunk on easy money chasing big wins This tech coincided with really lax monetary policy Debt was super cheap along with juggernauts like Meta just burning cash in this space The company I was with and some I consulted for were all too happy to take investor cash knowing full well the end product would go nowhere I knew it the first time I used the Vive that the tech wouldnt survive as a veil headset I was open about AR hybrids and thought if anyone would have a breakthrough it would be a company like Apple But they take on SO MUCH debt just to get the hardware prototype off the ground that they are willing to handwave fundamentals like fatigueanxiety Vision Pro is neat for watching a short video alone if you have an extra 3000 laying around How on earth does this pass the sniff test They throw around phrases like paradigm shift and choose to ignore such simple feedback Perhaps this is what happens when you have mountains of cash and a bunch of hits behind you,m43jjm3,2.0,1hnfbds

comment,m46t376,raziel686,,1,2024-12-28 13:22:20,,,,Finally someone pointed out the big one that gets ignored all the time in these threads Shutting out the world is a _massive_ impediment to the adoption of VR This directly conflicts with a key point of VR total immersion too The people who can afford these things are adults and the people least able to remove themselves from what is going on around them are adults Ive really wanted to play Half Life Alyx for a long time but I probably never will Between a wife kids a dog visitors work etc I am constantly getting pulled away from my PC No big deal with traditional games just pause and get up With VR my wife would have to walk over and smack me in the back of the head which would be justified The only people who can do that are kids and single adults without much going on Thats a poor and small market respectively The money just isnt there AR is a possibility but it wont take off until they can cram the tech into something that genuinely looks like a pair of glasses and can also function as corrective glasses for those who need them Couple that with good battery life and youve got a long long wait before tech like that is ready for the mainstream,m41991p,1.0,1hnfbds

comment,m44yhmf,lastMinute_panic,,2,2024-12-28 03:04:00,,,,I wouldnt say VR headsets are a general purpose tool They are a niche product shoehorned into some very narrow experiences In this way I think that places them pretty closely with 3D TVs in terms of utility Desktop PCs have the benefit of 50 years of development in HCI and ergonomics Phones are miniaturized versions of this and early smartphones mostly sucked btw Theres so much BS marketing attached to VRAR as an enhanced experience The tradeoff of immersion over fatigue just isnt there Can looking at a monitor or phone eventually cause eyestrainfatigue Sure but the delta between those experiences and VR is very wide,m41qgsr,3.0,1hnfbds

comment,m42l8lf,noflooddamage,,2,2024-12-27 18:46:23,,,,My issue with vr has always been the lack of centralization Youve got different hardware from each company and none of it is really standardized Everyone wants a piece of the pie and none care what the consumer wantsneeds This has led to a niche market becoming even more niche because of course you cant use your psvr with your oculus quest games so i guess well drop another 500 on a headset that will get limited game development and become obsolete in a few years I love vr There were a handful of times where Ive been legitimately blown away by a video game experience Going from ps2 to ps3 was one of them and another was the first time I used an oculus I just wish there was a single platform where there could be some meaningful and accessible development happening,,0.0,1hnfbds
