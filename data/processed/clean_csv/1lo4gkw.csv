comment,n0k580a,speculatrix,,248,2025-06-30 11:23:07,,,,I was watching the TechMoans YouTube channel and he basically concluded that modern cassette player mechanisms are badly made junk Some of the ones he tests dont even have stereo playback One example Just when you think it couldnt get worse mono tape head It would need to be 3x better than that to be complete crap Im not saying the one in the linked article is crap but I wouldnt be surprised,,0.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0k5mkz,r31ya,,108,2025-06-30 11:26:14,,,,Apparently the only existing tape player parts manufacturer are the one producing not that good of quality tape player Brand name might add features parts like good AMP or good bluetooth chipset but the core tape part would be the same not so good one,n0k580a,1.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0k6nqi,internetlad,,43,2025-06-30 11:34:08,,,,Yep I get that nostalgia is a hell of a drug and Im very into the idea that people want to preserve old ephemera but this seems like a cash in on the trend At the risk of sounding like a gatekeeper youre better off repairingretrofitting old quality tech because this is literally a case of dont make em like they used to By the way if you like these concepts of preserving things that werent really made to be preserved check out the podcast Ephemeral Its finished its run but it has discussions on so much niche cool shit that I wouldnt know about except for having tuned in,n0k5mkz,2.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0kcb1a,thisischemistry,,26,2025-06-30 12:14:32,,,,This isnt even nostalgia its young people buying this crap They somehow think that old technologies are somehow good just because they are old No they are bad but thats all people had back then,n0k6nqi,3.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0lpua2,-Badger3-,,29,2025-06-30 16:35:48,,,,I think they just think the old analog technologies are cool and they probably appreciate the perspective it gives them and the connection it has to their parentsgrandparents In my lifetime Ive gotten to see all these new technologies evolve whereas for gen Z everythings kinda stagnated and just been digital flash storage and streaming practically their whole lives,n0kcb1a,4.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0luekb,thisischemistry,,2,2025-06-30 16:57:36,,,,Theres nothing wrong with analog signals its really the cassette media that is the issue here Even in its heyday it wasnt great tapes would rapidly decay and break Youd have to clean the heads all the time to get good output and tapes would need to be replaced regularly The motors reels and associated mechanisms would often cause a good amount of wow and flutter as well as tangling stretching and breaking tapes Analog and digital technologies both have their flaws and their benefits We need to look at the implementations and use them where they are appropriate,n0lpua2,5.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0m2wml,-Badger3-,,24,2025-06-30 17:36:23,,,,Nobodys saying cassettes are more practical Im saying to a generation where everything has been digital theyre just cool Its a machine that when you press a heavy clickclacking button spins some gears and moves a magnetic tape that plays music Its more personal because you actually have to curate your own music instead of letting an algorithm decide what to play for you And people enjoy the ritual Its all the same reasons millennials still like vinyl Its the same reason some people prefer shaving with a straight razor and handthroffed shaving cream I think people appreciate having these tactile imperfect moments because they feel more human I dont think its all about nostalgia I think people are also rebelling against this feeling that technology has become overlyconvenient and thoughtless,n0luekb,6.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0n6fee,dood117,,9,2025-06-30 20:46:34,,,,People are arguing with you and giving their takes but this is exactly it Its more than nostalgia Physical media has real value My stack of records and my record player make every listening session an activity to be enjoyed What value does your Spotify Playlist have Can you physically touch and interact with your Playlist like I can my records and tapes Absolutely you cannot Nostalgia is certainly part of it but its more than that now It really is a rebellion against digital goods and the sterile feeling of listening to music pushed on you by some algorithm,n0m2wml,7.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0pev5r,projectfar,,3,2025-07-01 04:34:02,,,,Value is a weird word to use Do you mean tangible Cause basically anything can have value I would say my Spotify playlist has value since Ive curated it and added songs that I find enjoyable Someone else might not but thats irrelevant to whether it has value to me or not,n0n6fee,8.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n17nmls,dood117,,2,2025-07-03 22:58:11,,,,I see what you mean Vinyl has monetary value and is a tangible good You cant resell or touch a Spotify Playlist You cant display the artwork that is the album cover,n0pev5r,9.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0muril,Ajreil,,-3,2025-06-30 19:49:41,,,,Its more personal because you actually have to curate your own music instead of letting an algorithm decide what to play for you You can curate digital music by creating playlists or downloading MP3s and managing them yourself I think this is less a limitation of the digital age and more than people have forgotten how to seek out content,n0m2wml,7.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0mbhic,thisischemistry,,-8,2025-06-30 18:15:55,,,,We can have all that and still not need the magnetic tape which is the main issue Replace it with something solidstate and you can still have the tactile buttons and curated cartridges,n0m2wml,7.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0mu5zg,parisidiot,,9,2025-06-30 19:46:44,,,,youre missing the point they dont want that theyre not looking for fidelity theyre looking for something that to them is different to you it is worse its art it doesnt need to be technically excellent look at photography people LOVE polaroids polaroids kinda look like shit but theyre fun they like the lofi aesthetic they dont want an instant camera that takes a perfect picture and prints it without defects thats less fun,n0mbhic,8.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0nbz8k,10000Didgeridoos,,5,2025-06-30 21:13:20,,,,I think also with older music there is something they get out of listening to it on formats it was available on at the time it was made There is something to be said for listening to 80s synthy pop on a cassette tape or 60s70s classic rock on a vinyl for that physical connection to the period and experiencing how someone your age then would have listened to it vs a remastered digital stream or file you just transiently tap on your phone while doing 5 other things on it,n0mu5zg,9.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0mr5ui,QuerulousPanda,,4,2025-06-30 19:31:39,,,,youre kinda overstating how bad tapes were yeah they were problematic in some ways but i had tapes for years growing up and they never rapidly decayed and broke and cleaning the heads was really not something you ever had to do Everyone always knew that one tape player that would eat tapes but otherwise they all tended to work and keep on working Wow and flutter may have been a bit of an issue for portable devices but even still it was fine no one cared if it got a little wobbly when you moved too quickly I dont want to say they were perfect or anything like that cds were a revolution for a reason but tapes were fine,n0luekb,6.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0otoqx,FlyingBishop,,2,2025-07-01 02:13:16,,,,Eh vinyl has a lifespan of over 100 years Tapes last 1530 years Theres really nothing wrong with vinyl other than being inconvenient Tape is not sturdy,n0mr5ui,7.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0pbn3k,creeva,,2,2025-07-01 04:09:55,,,,I dont think they are arguing tapes are sturdy that the quality was fine No one is saying using them for long archival You quote the lifespan is 1530 years The time between the Walkman and the iPod is 22 years I have tapes that still play that are over 40 years old granted they hardly are played the last couple decades The answer is the format was fine for what it was and for those that enjoy the ritual,n0otoqx,8.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0rhdpk,FlyingBishop,,0,2025-07-01 14:21:53,,,,You have outliers but the average lifespans are the average lifespans You probably will have current vinyl that still plays 1000 years from now I doubt that any tapes will be that durable And the lack of durability translates into daily use tapes do wear out pretty quickly commonly,n0pbn3k,9.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0v0kdz,Riegel_Haribo,,2,2025-07-02 00:49:41,,,,I can put 35 year old cassette recordings in right now and they sound just as they did However the range of less distinguishable from CD than an MP3 from a digital rip was with 1996 adjusted for today 750 deck and 10 tapes And EVERYTHING before 1980 is pretty much analog tape,n0otoqx,8.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0na9q7,dale_glass,,2,2025-06-30 21:04:54,,,,Theres a lot wrong with analog signals its precisely why we dont do much analog anymore With analog everything interferes Theres no precise clock signal so wow and flutter are an effect of inaccurate tape speed Theres no error correction and precise tracking of things so head misalignment can make stuff sound bad Any kind of interference can make it into your audio including motor noise Analog always has the real world intrude into it somewhere so a copy always loses quality Digital basically makes everything perfect 441 KHz16 bit audio on CD came out in 1982 and is still perfectly good for playback Of course its not so terrible as to be unusable but theres just no real reason to use analog Its only got downsides to it,n0luekb,6.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n1unfc7,harkuponthegay,,1,2025-07-07 18:31:21,,,,It depends on what youre looking for perfect lossless audio that sounds exactly the same as if you were sitting in the recording studio in the same spot as the microphone the recorded it Thats one experience that modern digital recording technology makes it possible to get close to achieving but even that is not exactly a 1to1 experience of sound because it is more than just a function of how a sound is recorded it matters how it is played back as well are you wearing headphones sitting in front of studio monitors is there surround sound is the room that you are listening to the recording in treated to prevent echoes other acoustic anomalies from reaching your ear due to the way the sound waves propagate in the space The same digital file played by different speakers in different rooms will sound different Hell it will even sound different if you sit in a different spot relative to the speakers in the same room The fact of the matter is that it is not possible to recreate the experience of sitting in front of the instrument or person who is making the recording in real life feeling the subtle vibrations the the instrument itself is making pass through your body and bounce off of objects in the room This is why live music will always be a timeless and sought after way of experiencing music nothing else is really identical So if you give up the notion of perfection and concede that a recording cannot ever achieve that result you are then able to appreciate the unique quirks and flaws that each type of recording technology brings to a listening experience as worthy of merit in their own right Sometimes the crackle of vinyl or the hum of a motor moving a cassette tape becomes a part of the joy of those listening to music using that method it brings people back in time to a different era and connects them in some way with the past Polaroids are vastly inferior to taking a picture with your iPhone and yet still for many people the Polaroid is more fun Its not about the pursuit of perfection eliminating the barrier the technology present between what you seehead and reality its about savoring the intangible distance between the two worlds that remind you that everything in this universe is ephemeral and nothing can be perfectly captured or frozen in time we only get to glimpse the past we cant live in it Theres a beauty in being reminded of that fact,n0na9q7,7.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0rqt1v,kawag,,1,2025-07-01 15:08:01,,,,Well we dont have a skittles bag of physical media formats any more because we eliminated physical media but there is still plenty of technological evolution happening today The speed at which AI is improving and new tools like video synthesis are emerging is shocking to me and I see it as evidence that we definitely havent slowed down Theres even an argument that it may be happening too fast for human beings to keep up,n0lpua2,5.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0l426u,speculatrix,,8,2025-06-30 14:50:33,,,,Some old things are good because of survivor bias Like the radio channels dedicated to 70s 80s or 90s There were so many rubbish bands or rubbish tracks but have been mostly forgotten Lots of cars were just horrible with no redeeming features We mostly only notice the ones that were worth preserving,n0kcb1a,4.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0l5j7s,thisischemistry,,3,2025-06-30 14:57:45,,,,We mostly only notice the ones that were worth preserving Or the ones which werent used much so they didnt get the wearandtear of being left in the weather and driven through salty slush over lots of potholes,n0l426u,5.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0mtjae,parisidiot,,3,2025-06-30 19:43:38,,,,they dont think theyre good they just think theyre fun kids have gotten really into lomography 20 year old digital pocket cameras etc because they look different from phones and DSLRs for example theyre not looking for perfect theyre looking for something distinct there is also a subculture around tape collecting there are small indie labels that only release music on tape its fun like only derranged 40 year old audiophiles think vinyl sounds better whereas the vinyl resurgence is kids buying it,n0kcb1a,4.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n48fut8,iamnotevenhereatall,,1,2025-07-20 21:28:19,,,,Im an older person and all the above mentioned mediums for different reasons There is the nostalgia factor for both cassette and vinyl Then there is the fact that they are one function devices I get tired of being so distracted and pulled in different directions I love digital because its basically the highest quality you can get with absolutely no interference I bought a Sony NWA306 and I love that thing and I do use it However at the end of the day its an android device I had to lock the thing down with app pinning to make it the one function device I wanted Even with doing that my brain still knows its capable of more and that bothers me Anyway I get people wanting to correct others but its frankly a waste of time People will believe what they want to believe and it wont be until they decide to face their delusions that they will figure it all out It wont through some curmudgeon online ranting and raving about how cassette fidelity sucks,n0mtjae,5.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0nr7c8,Qwirk,,3,2025-06-30 22:32:37,,,,This is an excellent example of why competition is a good thing Back during their heyday cassette players were going through a ton of competition as major brands were vying for your purchase Now its a niche market with no competition so you arent going to get the same level of quality,n0k580a,1.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0ktfb3,calvinwho,,7,2025-06-30 13:56:20,,,,Arent tapes better for long term storage Even digital stuff can be saved on them so it surprises me no one is still doing this well enough to make a walkman,n0k580a,1.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0l5hal,speculatrix,,22,2025-06-30 14:57:30,,,,Its not the tape the mechanisms are poorly made which causes speed inconsistencies leading to wow and flutter I imagine the mechanisms are cheap copies of cheap copies When Philips invented the compact cassette it was for office dictation machines not music Technical advances meant it became possible for high end tape decks to be able to record audio from 20hz to 20khz with a relatively flat response and imperceptible wow and flutter Noise suppression systems from Dolby B and C or the lesser known dbx meant the dynamic range was good enough Those high end units would be over 1000 in todays money,n0ktfb3,2.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0l6v7f,thisischemistry,,7,2025-06-30 15:04:16,,,,It depends You can get magnetic tape which is specially formulated and stabilized so that it doesnt lose data and physical qualities over time If you store those in special environments with protection from light temperature extremes and moisture then they can last a good amount of time However the usual massmarket cassettes arent that great and they can leak their magnetic fields between successive layers as well as lose the ability to hold onto the magnetic domains and degrade the plastic tape so that it sticks stretches or tears Also if youre using the tape then every use will significantly accelerate that degradation There are much better mediums and formats for longterm storage but you have to choose between a balance of cost easeofuse durability and so on Archival quality digital tapes are a great balance between all of those at least for the mediumlong term,n0ktfb3,2.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0lvy6q,Hungry_Horace,,4,2025-06-30 17:04:45,,,,They have a finite shelf life unless you keep them in some superstable archiving environment Most tapes from the 90s and earlier are now fairly degraded with terrible flutterwow and noise Even digital tapes suffer older camcorder formats like DV are passing the threshold of playback The only ones that seem to be surviving are DATS which is odd as they were regarded as pretty fragile at the time Source I have a LOT of all of these and have been digitising them over the last few years If we want to bring back something retro lets bring back MiniDISC Far more reliable far higher sound quality the same make mixtape and give copies to mates experience,n0ktfb3,2.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0m2set,speculatrix,,5,2025-06-30 17:35:50,,,,A decent tape deck good quality tape and using the full dynamic range meant that hiss wasnt much of a problem Also because it was constant our brains would learn to ignore it Mpeg compression artifacts are a much worse thing than tape hiss Its why people prefer a good stereo radio broadcast than a low bit rate DAB radio signal,n0lgr3j,2.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0mvvso,Redeem123,,4,2025-06-30 19:55:11,,,,Theres just a workflow with tape that is different Its this 100 I know its a meme at this point but there is something to the tactile nature of something real Vinyl records film photography tape recording all of it can basically be 100 recreated by digital tools now However there is still something to be said for the benefit of having to take a little intentional effort Ive recorded to tape and its about a million times less convenient than using a DAW But the act of rewinding the tape getting the room ready then knowing that the next five minutes were going to be a take regardless of what happens then listening back to it it added to the performance Now overdubs and edits give me digital all day I dont miss splicing tape,n0liuz9,3.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0mxack,blue-coin,,3,2025-06-30 20:02:02,,,,Yes You get it The OP1 for example has a 4 track digital recorder that emulates recording on tape and it is absolutely fantastic I mean there is something charming about recording to real cassette or tape but I would take a modern digital multitrack recorder if it had a recording workflow like the OP1,n0mvvso,4.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0r7995,caerphoto,,2,2025-07-01 13:28:28,,,,However there is still something to be said for the benefit of having to take a little intentional effort Especially so for artists where the act of creation is a very significant percentage of the point Sure the end result is obviously important but how you get there is part of the artistic journey its part of an artists motivation to keep going,n0mvvso,4.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0l58f2,thisischemistry,,5,2025-06-30 14:56:18,,,,If you have these types of recordings and you care about them then you should prioritize converting them to digital Those old magnetic tapes have significant bleeding of the magnetic fields and degradation of the physical tape They will tend to stick stretch and tear I agree back in the day those magnetic tapes were great for recording mixing and copying music but they have been surpassed by better means of doing such things Those recordings would significantly degrade in less than a decade never mind 40 or 50 years I wouldnt dare put anything that old into a portable player instead Id be looking at an archival service to recover and preserve them as best as possible,n0kz34b,2.0,1lo4gkw

comment,n0kg23e,pwnersaurus,,5,2025-06-30 12:39:06,,,,Yes growing up with cassettes they were just the worst vastly prefer digital any day of the week But I wonder if people who grew up with vinyl LPs feel the same way about how people idealise themI guess for the average person LPs were easy to damage and hard to transport and store not the best quality either unless everything is done perfectly,n0kdbt7,1.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n0kj6yl,thisischemistry,,-1,2025-06-30 12:58:35,,,,I understand the desire for vinyl records but theres nothing inherently better about that format either Vinyl is an imperfect medium which has distortion from the original music it just happens to be a pleasant distortion which has a warm tone to it We could get the same effect with a digital filter if we chose to do that Now there are other advantages of vinyl that I appreciate For example liner art and the various materials they used to produce the record It can be nice to have physical materials to handle and appreciate However we could do the same with digital music if we made them into modules which could be physically handled and stored,n0kg23e,2.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n1kzio4,Smurfsville,,2,2025-07-06 04:12:55,,,,Because maybe you have a cassette or two or ten lying around and you wanna play them every once in a while without putting up with YouTube ads Not everything is nostalgia bait Not everyone wants to play Revolver on these things Also whats with the condescending tone Dont you think theres value in being able to listen to Revolver without paying 10 dollars a month,n0kdbt7,1.0,1lo4gkw
comment,n1l2iwq,thisischemistry,,1,2025-07-06 04:36:53,,,,No condescension just facts If someone cares about their cassette collection then the best thing they could do is to find some way to digitize it Cassettes lying around tend to lose their quality and become more fragile playing them hastens this process I agree that buying media once is a good value but you have to protect that investment and not just trust it will always be in good condition I have done just this in the past used my audio outs to digitize analog formats so Ill have them for longer,n1kzio4,2.0,1lo4gkw
