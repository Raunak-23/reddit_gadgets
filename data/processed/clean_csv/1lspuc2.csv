comment,n1lpuay,RedHotFooFecker,,17,2025-07-06 08:12:20,,,,The guy telling you a phone is fine is full of shit Ive a GX80 which is pretty old at this point and only cost me 400 in 2018 The difference between photos on that and my phone are night and day to me and it opens up taking photos in RAW file no processing so you can edit them as you like The size of the sensor and the size of the lens adds a lot to the quality of the photo It doesnt matter that phones are full of new tech my new iPhone is not capable of taking photos as good as the camera If youre using a proper camera for photography you will get more out of it than a phone for sure,n1kxlay,3.0,1lspuc2
comment,n1r9jr5,HuckleberryDry4889,,3,2025-07-07 04:50:47,,,,I love my Z8 but frankly for most people the latest iPhone with RAW is great for many styles and genres Some of my favorite shots are with my iPhone because I had it at the moment I needed it while my Z8 was at home I love my iPhone anytime I just need a few shots of something that doesnt move and I can control lighting and motion to get the shots I need such as quasimacro landscape street portraits need very good lighting iPhone is not good for True macro need a good lens Telephoto need a good lens Action need fast exposure and lenses very creative shots or shooting tons of frames over hours need a viewfinder andor ergonomics Challenging lighting the iPhone often surprises me in what it can do with combining multiple exposures and error correction but I usually prefer to use a fast prime lens on the pro camera if lighting is challenging Source I pulled this out of my ass so its probably neither accurate or complete but hopefully it helps somebody I dont do much video so I am not able to comment on it,n1lpuay,4.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1kyygc,Vinnie_Vegas,,32,2025-07-06 04:08:31,,,,Do you really need a standalone camera for that If youve already got a top of the line smartphone you might genuinely be better off taking a short course in phone photography Itll probably result in a greater improvement in your photography than the difference between a smartphone camera and an inexpensive camera thats neither mirrorless or full frame at that budget,n1kxlay,3.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1l1lge,Vinnie_Vegas,,10,2025-07-06 04:29:24,,,,My wife is a professional photographer and often works for rich enthusiasts who brag about owning a considerably more expensive camera than the one she shoots on While theyre paying her thousands to shoot for them because they cant achieve what she can despite having better equipment than her She shoots better photos on her phone than these rich guys with their Leicas and Hasselblads because she actually knows what shes doing The reason that camera options in the price range you specified arent very abundant is precisely because they often struggle to significantly outperform smartphone cameras particularly in the hands of amateurs Smartphones are doing a lot in software thats very forgiving to the average user whereas a mirrorless DSLR can be difficult to get great results out of if you dont know what youre doing If there are paid photographers there theyre always going to show up with an impressive looking camera because nobody wants to pay someone to come in and shoot on their phone It just doesnt feel like good value,n1l00u8,5.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1lbt4h,casualsax,,0,2025-07-06 05:57:13,,,,What the Your phone is a better camera comments miss is that taking a photo from a camera has a different feel from a phone Being in a particular mental headspace and feeling like youre a photographer has value The big question is how much time do you have to learn your gear Hobbyist level cameras require you to manage light levels and focus both items that smart phones and consumer pointandshoots handle automatically If I was grabbing a camera to shoot at farmers markets I would want something that brings a particular style Fujifilm cameras are great at getting a pleasant ascetic straight from incamera jpgs With an XM5 body and a XF 1650mm lens youll have a great platform to learn and build from and resale value if you decide to jump ship If you were going to be shooting moving subjects or needed more detail for your buck Id point you elsewhere but a famers market sounds like a place where the warm fuji color profiles would shine,n1l00u8,5.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1l083p,welp_im_damned,,5,2025-07-06 04:18:27,,,,Ah ok I see I have some you might be interested in then Used I would recommend apsc bodies like the Sony a6700 because it has ibis Sonys top tier autofocus cheap camera lens and mature lens line up If you want to have the latest technology If you prefer full frame the original S5 a7c a7iii are around the 1k mark used as well New apsc bodies there Nikon z50ii with decent autofocus and has growing lens collection There is also the Fuji xt30xt30ii which are sub 1k cameras has a good lens selection But both Nikon and Fuji lack ibis There are micro four thirds cameras like the om5 series which has a lot of tech and really good features like Ibis and computational photography Theres the Lumix g100d for 500 and the g97 for 800ish M43 I would say has a matured and cheap lens lineup I would recommend you look onask each of the camera brand subreddits rsonyalpha rlumix rfujifilm rnikon I use the Lumix gx9 While I enjoy taking photos with it and I have really good prime lenses To me Panasonic doesnt care much about m43 The autofocus is acceptable for shooting photos but terrible for video and I shoot manual in that case I think your best bang for the buck would be going with a used camera body and used lens,n1kxlay,3.0,1lspuc2
comment,n1lrxcw,Yummier,,2,2025-07-06 08:33:26,,,,Im not familiar with the US market but sub 1K you should probably look in the used market where you can often get real bang for your buck If I may offer a slightly different recommendation from the ones already made Look into modern compact cameras Many are marketed for streetphotography these days but they are excellent allrounders for daily use and fantastic when travelling due to fitting in a pocket They take much better pictures than phones especially in lowlight conditions and offer a great way to get into photography Examples Canon G7X Ricoh GR3 Sony RX100 the new Canon Powershot V1 especially if video is important,n1kxlay,3.0,1lspuc2
comment,n1lswdq,cuberhino,,1,2025-07-06 08:43:26,,,,How do these compare to like an insta360 camera Was thinking the one with the gimbal,n1lrxcw,4.0,1lspuc2
comment,n1m1xsi,Yummier,,2,2025-07-06 10:15:00,,,,I have never tried one myself But the insta360 is for wide angle videos these are for photography The Powershot V1 is great for video but has a very different form factor So it depends on what kind of videos youre looking to make Im betting the Powershot will beat the Insta360 in pictures though,n1lswdq,5.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1mi9vd,maqcky,,1,2025-07-06 12:32:14,,,,The insta360 is not a good camera at all It cannot be it has other purposes and its constrained in lens and sensor size If you plan on taking action picturesvideos going on a bike or doing some sport its perfect for that but only for that,n1lswdq,5.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1oq3mm,LeonMust,,1,2025-07-06 19:38:26,,,,For your budget youre looking at getting a camera with a 1 inch sensor or a Micro 43 sensor Cameras with these sensors will have great quality if the area is well lit but will suffer if the area youre trying to capture isnt well lit,n1ltmnh,5.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1o7x06,glytxh,,1,2025-07-06 18:04:49,,,,1015 year old gear is just as usable as long as youre conscious of working within its constraints Modern stuff makes for faster workflows more data per frame better dynamic range etc but at the end of the day its still just a sensor and a light bucket A really good camera 10 years ago is still a really good camera today,n1kxlay,3.0,1lspuc2
comment,n1lbrb6,Ire-Works,,5,2025-07-06 05:56:45,,,,It depends entirely on what youre trying to do with it If youre just trying to make content the DJI Osmo 3 is very tough to beat,n1kw0x4,1.0,1lspuc2

comment,n1m3989,pmjm,,2,2025-07-06 10:27:58,,,,Keep in mind that most of the money youll spend isnt on the camera body itself its on the lenses Youll need a kit of lenses at various focal lengths depending on what kind of work you want to do Personally I know when I buy a new Canon body Im going to spend somewhere between 35K but the lenses are typically 24K each and I have around a dozen of them There are more budget oriented lenses but this is one area where you really get what you pay for That said even the budget stuff is going to look 100x better than a smartphone and will differentiate your work You can buy all of this stuff used though which saves quite a bit of money Dont forget about lighting too if youll be doing indoor or lowlight work If youre doing video youll also need a good audio recorder and some microphones,n1kw0x4,1.0,1lspuc2
