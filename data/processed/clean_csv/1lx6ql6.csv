comment,n2pf3v1,HJJR31,,4,2025-07-12 10:24:34,,,,I used to do IT work configuring networks switches and used the original Micro PC too The size and only having to carry the db9 to rj45 serial console cable made jumping from switch to switch so easy Until the battery went out and GPD support was nonexistent common issue,n2p3fii,1.0,1lx6ql6

comment,n2t77zd,Yes-times-infinity,,8,2025-07-12 23:30:40,,,,I know youre just making a joke but this is an Intel N250 which is a low powered design with a PL1 of 6W max 15W Every time I see the same Intel CPU hot meme being upvoted I cringe because it promotes technical illiteracy,n2joo5g,1.0,1lx6ql6
