post,1kc6fjo,diacewrb,Leica Raises Prices in Canada Because of US Tariffs,1263,2025-05-01 11:30:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1kc6fjo/leica_raises_prices_in_canada_because_of_us/,133.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mq0252h,diacewrb,,780,2025-05-01 11:31:23,,,,They said they wanted price parity between Canada and the US which makes no sense If an American purchased a Leica product anywhere in the world and brought it back to the US they would still be subject to the tariff If they purchased in Canada they would effectively end up paying the tariff twice As bad as sony,,0.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq7xxw0,sioux612,,2,2025-05-02 16:19:54,,,,Dont worry there will be a lobbyists for some monopoly camera dealer Just like it was the US auto dealers who caused the 25 year import ban,mq0edww,3.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq0aq66,wsippel,,126,2025-05-01 12:31:00,,,,Its a bit more complicated Leica USA handles imports and distribution in North America The way they explain it they have to pay US import tariffs on cameras that end up in Canada so what are they supposed to do The obvious solution is to ship from the EU to Canada directly but that has to be set up and nobody knows how long the tariffs will stick around Once again the main issue is the uncertainty,mq0252h,1.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq0eokw,etzel1200,,63,2025-05-01 12:56:05,,,,They should get any tariffs back when they export the cameras again to Canada Or they can go from a FTZ in the US directly to Canada Are they just lazy unaware lying Am I missing something,mq0aq66,2.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq0s4lp,peacefulhectarez,,82,2025-05-01 14:10:59,,,,Nope youre not missing anything They or their customs broker and freight people are lazy The duty rate on a lot of lab equipment was zero or nearly zero so it was cheaper and easier just to import a bunch of stuff to the US and then reexport it as needed That gives you the freedom to sell it in the US if you want With higher duty rates youd want to put it in an FTZ pending reexport ship directly to Canada or as a last resort file for drawback for reexports This is Leica saying they dont give enough of a fuck about Canadian customers to set up a Canadian distrbution channel so theyre going to keep supplying dutypaid stuff out of the US Smart buyers in Canada will find suppliers in Europe willing to ship directly which will piss Leica off but hopefully theyre also too lazy to play games like cancelling warranties on greymarket equipment,mq0eokw,3.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq14byk,adjudicator,,15,2025-05-01 15:11:47,,,,Canceling warranties on grey market stuff odd illegal in much of Canada anyway which they should care about if they want to continue doing business here,mq0s4lp,4.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq57jfi,peacefulhectarez,,3,2025-05-02 04:30:50,,,,It can be worked around where the Canadian distributor is the manufacturer and wont warranty anything they didnt sell Car and motorcycle manufacturers did a lot of it 15 years ago during dollar parity when no one would work on Americanspec vehicles I had to threaten to complain to Germany when BMW wouldnt even sell me parts for my bike and they only backed off because I l lived in California and was on a road trip,mq14byk,5.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq2gpzl,JSteigs,,7,2025-05-01 19:07:26,,,,Further more cameras probably arent a big part of their business Their survey gear is spendy A single gps setup can run 40k Thats a lot of cameras Large construction companies are moving to having one or two gps units per machine on big jobs Sounds like they make medical stuff too Seems like they might just lose market share in Canada to companies with a direct distributor setup,mq0s4lp,4.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq1sren,Pikeman212a6c,,10,2025-05-01 17:11:25,,,,Shifting to a FTZ isnt nothing But not being willing to do the paperwork to file for drawback is just being too lazy to give a fuck about Canada,mq0s4lp,4.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq2avc8,bamboob,,5,2025-05-01 18:38:41,,,,This is one of the things that I was expecting Once companies realize that they have a greenlight to just start upping prices they will do it and I suspect those prices are never going to come down to the level that they were even if the tariffs completely go away,mq0252h,1.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq08g5p,Edward_TH,,120,2025-05-01 12:15:50,,,,The delusion of all these non US corporations suits that think theyre gonna get the red carpet from now on instead of the projectile diarrhea they got till now and that theyve been warned theyre gonna get again in the future for some reason is really telling how detached they are from the world most people live in Trying to save your largest market by announcing that your strategy is to fuck over all the other costumers or potential ones especially in the light of said market being now openly manipulated by your competitors and getting poorer is really being blindly delusional,,0.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq100kt,IronVader501,,34,2025-05-01 14:50:30,,,,Thats not why they are doing it As Leica explains their entire distribution in North America runs over the US Even if a Product is intended to be sold in Canada or Mexico at the end of the day its still being shipped to their USSubsidiary first and then distributed from there So they have to pay the Tarriffs on them even if it isnt intended to be sold in the US The better solution here would be to set up seperate distributionchannels for Canada but Leica evidently so far doesnt think thats worth it,mq08g5p,1.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq136sd,Edward_TH,,23,2025-05-01 15:06:10,,,,And thats my point Recent events have clearly demonstrated that following this pathway as a foreign company isnt a smart idea at best whatever you save by not investing into a safer distribution chain gets wiped by tariffs and poorer sales at worst political instability and outright rigged rules made by your competitors straight up destroy you because you lose other markets just by having your supply chain crippled Its just delusional of them to think the US is still a fair market for foreign companies It was manipulated before now its straight up openly rigged against fair competition,mq100kt,2.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq0acz3,Helmdacil,,50,2025-05-01 12:28:36,,,,Leica makes the most user friendly lab microscopes Nikon Zeiss Olympus Echo vwr in house brand All are great but Leica is the easiest I can get undergrads to take publication quality images on a Leica with almost no training The Nikon is not like that at all This is a poor move by Leica but they are the best game in town in general Imo For biology scopes,mq06pr1,2.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq0n4qg,S_A_N_D_,,2,2025-05-01 13:44:27,,,,Its funny because I found Nikon to be the most user friendly at least for high end confocal and super resolution systems actually abberior was leagues more user friendly but theyre less versatile unless all you want is peak resolution at which point theyre better The downfall with Nikon IMO is their reliance on ai processing which is a black box and I feel like it just shows you what you want to see The Stellaris systems had much better super res nearly on the level of the abberior and adding FLIM to STED was just black magic With all that said we dont know if the research commercial side uses the same import chain as the consumer camera division They could easily be separate divisions using different supply chains given the lower volume and higher dollar value,mq0acz3,3.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq0x5ie,vaska00762,,1,2025-05-01 14:36:19,,,,If you ever see pictures of operating theatres in hospitals theres a very strong chance youll see loads of Olympus branded equipment The medical imaging industry is big money and the other big player with a photography heritage is Fujifilm who are quite big on making digital XRay devices which are basically just really large XRay image sensors Fujifilm also makes XRay film still which is largely still in use in dental settings as you can usually fit film inside someones mouth but not a digital image sensor Fujifilm is also rapidly expanding into the pharmaceutical market though thats mostly from their background of photochemical industry which has a niche but isnt popular Even Sony is big into the medical field For a long time Sony specifically made monitors which could be sterilised easily for operating rooms as well as also making Blu Ray and Peter Solid State recording drives which could record 1080p and later 4k medical footage taken from a microscope endoscope laparoscope or other such equipment All the medical device stuff makes way way more money than consumer products ever could,mq0to2i,4.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mqq0teh,vaska00762,,1,2025-05-05 15:34:07,,,,Its still regularly in use at my local dental clinic The film isnt very large usually only about a couple of square centimetres wide placed next to a molar that a dentist wants to look into then the Xray emitter is positioned appropriately and the exposure taken The film selfdevelops similar to Instax film and can be placed onto a lightbox to see if theres a cavity Large digital dental xray machines exist but largely only see use in orthodontic settings usually due to concerns around Xray exposure,mqpzaga,6.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq2bbxx,nsomnac,,0,2025-05-01 18:40:56,,,,RTFA Not the reason whatsoever They ship all products intended for Canada via US distribution which makes them subject to tariffs Yes they could recoup the tariff paid however it probably costs more to do that than to just pass on the cost of the tariff Long term solution is to establish or move North American distribution to Canada from US which would just be another slap on the face to US as they not only lose access to international products not available in US but also the US based jobs for people that were responsible for handling distribution Are we winning yet,mq22wcd,1.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq29fbd,nsomnac,,1,2025-05-01 18:31:34,,,,Sure But thats not a zero cost activity Leica has to pay people to file and monitor all that paperwork Its not just one person either Its likely one person doing the main paperwork but then any number of finance and lawyers involved in the process That cost isnt nonzero Its not unreasonable to believe that task alone adds significant cost to recoup those payments and pass through of the tariff may be the cheaper option at this time,mq1m4uv,2.0,1kc6fjo

comment,mq2uzdk,nsomnac,,1,2025-05-01 20:16:18,,,,Thats all fine and dandy for a keyboard warrior who has zero insight into Leicas internal business costs and financial position Im not claiming to know any but using simple critical thinking skills Leica sales into Canada is likely a very small fraction of sales in comparison to other regions globally Moving or establishing a new Canadian port of entry may not just make sense if the historical sales in Canada dont create enough revenue or profit to cover the operational costs for selling into Canada alone I dont claim to know what 7 increase means in total revenue from Canadian sales but given the population I cant imagine its a giant number overall Buildings people insurance etc are expensive unless the tariffs adds many millions of dollars annually that could be circumvented by moving or recouping it likely doesnt make sense But Im only making SWAGs without knowing the real numbers Realistically since we know baseline tariff is 10 using algebra one can probably deduce what that markup on Leica imports actually are since the tariff is applied to the wholesale price not the retail price If you know the old retail price and the current retail price changed by 7 you know that should be equal to some base price 10 some amount of retail markup If theres any published insight into historical sales in Canada one might be able to figure out if this is price gouging or not Until then my assumption is it doesnt make financial sense to move operations to Canada or recoup the tariffs paid or maybe the 7 does factor in the cost to recoup tariffs,mq2kkrz,4.0,1kc6fjo
comment,mq2wb6h,bianary,,2,2025-05-01 20:22:39,,,,So its not fine and dandy to assume they can recover their financial losses through known mechanisms but it is fine and dandy to assume that a business And businesses are just _known_ for their honesty and transparency to customers about their costs is being truthful about how they have to just have to pass the costs on Right Pull the other one,mq2uzdk,5.0,1kc6fjo
