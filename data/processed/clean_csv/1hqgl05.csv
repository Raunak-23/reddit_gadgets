comment,m4ub5up,QuantumQuantonium,,19,2025-01-01 12:47:18,,,,Theres more than just this problem I claim that the strict OS and bootloader controls Meta uses on their headsets is against right to repair I have 2 quest 2 headsets with different bricks not from the recent update and out of warranty one of them I got for cheap in an attempt to repair and replace the other The headset doesnt allow downgrades or complete reinstalls one has a black screen of death and the other remains stuck on boot Both headsets are broken in terms of software or firmware but its not exactly a hardware fix Companies like meta Samsung apple Microsoft should be forced to allow at minimum downgradability and complete reinstalls of device firmware and operating systems under the right to repair Taken a step further I believe when I purchase the hardware I now own that hardware not the software or its design the manufacturer can stop or control me from using their software all they want but if I want to replace their software which is a hardware level function I should have the right to in the name of FOSS and reducing planned obsolescence The reason they dont let you do thst is security sometimes to protect the device owner but often to protect the software from hacks and exploits which can be difficult stop per case but locking bootloaders is a broad fix at the cost of blocking low level device functions,m4qmkgv,1.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4qvocw,AUkion1000,,9,2024-12-31 20:25:22,,,,I wonder if this stuff is intentional At worst oops we bricked headsets we dont make looks like youll need the new 3s I mean phones almost ge that with crap updates and no one does anything enmass about it,m4qmkgv,1.0,1hqgl05

comment,m57vdcs,Aidan_Welch,,1,2025-01-03 18:07:37,,,,I dont think its intentional but to answer your question its so people who already made a purchase would make another one probably,m4sobr3,3.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4t4cj2,OkCalligrapher9,,6,2025-01-01 05:16:27,,,,Considering it impacted Quest 3 and 3S devices including ones that were purchased brand new for Christmas it would be an incredibly poor implementation of that kind of plan I think its far more likely it was a catastrophic accident Especially considering that now theyre going to spend a ton replacing everyones bricked devices,m4qvocw,2.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4rdws4,Vanilla_Vomit,,16,2024-12-31 22:08:57,,,,Mine updated when I turned it on a week ago today but instead of bricking the headset it bricked the controllers They are now sent to their facility for repairexchange The dumb thing was they had to be shipped separately one got lost in transit it thankfully got recovered two days later after the other arrived at their facility,,0.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4rfcq7,Chronotaru,,14,2024-12-31 22:17:30,,,,If its no longer booting I guess any fix would be PC based through USB,,0.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4rj4uc,speculatrix,,5,2024-12-31 22:40:02,,,,If they had a serial port which could be exposed by taking off the internal plastic shield which allowed control of the bootloader when device was turned on you could probably fix it by connecting to a computer,m4rfcq7,1.0,1hqgl05
comment,m4u8hoi,None,,12,2025-01-01 12:21:41,,,,Quest is the worst for software updates and OS problems Once mine said dont turn off updating and it stayed like that overnight and long into the next day before I said fuck it and let the battery run out Turned on fine and updated Some Quest 3s got stuck in the battery saver mode if you made the mistake of turning it on Couldnt be fixed by factory resetting Not even sure if a fix ever rolled out for that one Theres definitely some major incompetence going on over at meta,,0.0,1hqgl05
