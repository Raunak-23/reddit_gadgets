comment,mo9uc2j,J-W-L,,26,2025-04-21 15:51:49,,,,So I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew This is my new hobby Watching depression era cooking on YouTube Anyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew It was called this because Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act I didnt know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here Except in Hoovers case I dont think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros in trumps case he seems to be doing it to show hes protecting American interests but Im reality it was already good and now its garbage Anyway Here is a brief summary of the act The SmootHawley Tariff Act officially the Tariff Act of 1930 was a US law enacted on June 17 1930 that significantly raised import duties on over 20000 foreign goods It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C Hawley with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression Here are the key facts about the SmootHawley Tariff Act Protectionist Measure Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive High Tariff Rates The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in US history averaging around a 20 increase on dutiable imports Some tariffs were raised as high as 50 Wide Scope It applied to a vast range of goods both agricultural and manufactured Triggered Retaliation A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports Contributed to Trade Decline This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade US exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts Global trade decreased by an estimated 65 between 1929 and 1934 Worsened the Great Depression While the Act didnt cause the Great Depression most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the US and globally It reduced demand for goods led to business closures and exacerbated unemployment Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists Over 1000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill warning of its negative economic consequences Political Motivations Despite the economic warnings political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage A Symbol of Protectionism The SmootHawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire Shift Towards Free Trade In the years following the Great Depression the US shifted towards policies of trade liberalization beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 In essence the SmootHawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression,,0.0,1k4f004

comment,mo9ud3r,J-W-L,,-18,2025-04-21 15:52:22,,,,So I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew This is my new hobby Watching depression era cooking on YouTube Anyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew It was called this because Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act I didnt know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here Except in Hoovers case I dont think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros in trumps case he seems to be doing it to show hes protecting American interests but Im reality it was already good and now its garbage Anyway Here is a brief summary of the act The SmootHawley Tariff Act officially the Tariff Act of 1930 was a US law enacted on June 17 1930 that significantly raised import duties on over 20000 foreign goods It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C Hawley with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression Here are the key facts about the SmootHawley Tariff Act Protectionist Measure Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive High Tariff Rates The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in US history averaging around a 20 increase on dutiable imports Some tariffs were raised as high as 50 Wide Scope It applied to a vast range of goods both agricultural and manufactured Triggered Retaliation A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports Contributed to Trade Decline This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade US exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts Global trade decreased by an estimated 65 between 1929 and 1934 Worsened the Great Depression While the Act didnt cause the Great Depression most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the US and globally It reduced demand for goods led to business closures and exacerbated unemployment Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists Over 1000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill warning of its negative economic consequences Political Motivations Despite the economic warnings political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage A Symbol of Protectionism The SmootHawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire Shift Towards Free Trade In the years following the Great Depression the US shifted towards policies of trade liberalization beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934 In essence the SmootHawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression,,0.0,1k4f004
