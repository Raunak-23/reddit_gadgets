comment,mgb4ain,None,,87,2025-03-06 10:40:15,,,,It is accurate I have a brother printer and third party inks will not work in the printer Brother has also now resorted to blocking black and whitegrayscale printing if the color cartridges are empty even if you have a full black ink cartridge Edit here is a reply by Brothers CSR I understand that you are getting a Replace Ink error Thanks for letting me know I apologize for the inconvenience but Ill try my best to further assist you so we can get the machine back up and running and improve your day Sadly since the error message is Replace Ink you should replace the missing color cartridge You cant manually place your machine into BW only mode The machine will use a small amount of ink from each cartridge during regular cleanings to maintain optimal print quality Your printer is designed to stop ALL printing operations when any of the ink cartridges have reached their endoflife This is to ensure the life of the printhead and to maintain premium print quality Some ink from all the ink cartridges is used in periodic cleaning cycles This helps to prevent issues such as printhead clogs and poor print quality There is no way to bypass this feature I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused So theres no solution or bypass In the past I was able to select both in the brother iprint software to print only in black and white or press a button on the printer to bypass the warning that the color ink was out,mg9hv5q,3.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgcl4to,Kiseido,,6,2025-03-06 16:10:22,,,,The blocking when color ink is out might actually have something to do with complying with USA federal law Printers are mandated to apply tiny watermarks usually in yellow all over the paper so that any printed page can be inspected and determined what serial number the printer it came from had That way law enforcement can then track down who sold that printer to whom and find the owner if need be,mgb4ain,4.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgb8oh3,None,,6,2025-03-06 11:21:54,,,,This is what Brothers CSR said Basically your Brother machine is designed to stop ALL printing operations when any of the ink cartridges are empty This is to ensure the life of the print head and maintain premium print quality If the unit were to continue printing print jobs and cleaning cycles would suck air from the empty cartridge and damage the print head,mgb8bb3,5.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgbcfxd,double-you,,14,2025-03-06 11:54:02,,,,If the printer knows it is out of ink why is it sucking air from those cartridges Such a BS answer theyve given,mgb8oh3,6.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgbj9uc,zap_p25,,4,2025-03-06 12:44:52,,,,This is actually something they state with the Ecotank and why you should refill when the low level alerts go off because running too low could result in damage to the print head if air is sucked through,mgbirql,8.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgekj5x,Nexustar,,1,2025-03-06 21:45:19,,,,The priming process that is part of the nozzle cleaning that must occur on a regular basis can suck air into the system if the cartridge becomes fully empty leaving ink remnants to potentially congeal there which threatens the tiny nozzles ultimately damaging the printer Much like oil added to gasoline in a 2stroke engine the ink is the lubricant for the plumbing and mechanics of the nozzles It is also the coolant especially important for thermal inkjet vs piezoelectric heads that helps protect the nozzles from overheating and damaging themselves,mgbr6t5,6.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgemmxx,DonArgueWithMe,,1,2025-03-06 21:55:21,,,,Even if thats all true being short on anyall color shouldnt prevent you from using your black cartridge And if that was the reason they would be upfront when deploying a firmware that prevents it It should call out increased longevity due to x y z not just shadowban it,mgekj5x,7.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgekvoe,Nexustar,,1,2025-03-06 21:47:00,,,,No the ink also a coolant a lubricant and importantly liquid instead of dried up which are necessary to service the tiny nozzles on the printhead Air in the system caused by priming from an empty cartridge promotes ink remnants drying or congealing and can significantly degrade the printhead,mgbivuh,6.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgeso0i,AspGuy25,,1,2025-03-06 22:24:32,,,,I have a buddy who services printers Those issues can mainly be fixed with another servo A normal servo can go years without needing additional lubricant Have you ever lubed up an old toy A blender No need ever They design printers so there is one motor and a series of clutches so they can run into this problem It makes them more money Its a good problem for them to have Guess how much it costs to do it a different way How older printers did it Its a BOM adder of 50 cents Its a great smoke screen for them to hide behind If project managementupper management wanted the problem to go away they could easily make it happen,mgekvoe,7.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgfq9gz,Nexustar,,1,2025-03-07 01:40:08,,,,To my knowledge no modern inkjet uses servos maybe the wiper mechanism but definitely not anywhere where the ink flows They do have stepper motors again nowhere near the ink and vacuum pumps to prime the printer As far as the ink being a lubricantcoolant that relates to the nozzle itself only these are 10 to 50 microns typically smaller than a human hair and block or in thermal inkjets overheat easily,mgeso0i,8.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mg9vboy,wjean,,33,2025-03-06 04:00:51,,,,No problem Only works if you setup the printer to always get the same IP address and go look in the firewall settings for the option to block outgoing traffic from a specific source address Your cheapest potato router might not have these features But most do I literally spent 20min going through all the options to confirm if I can disable fw updates from the printer or from the web interface Neither looked possible old enough firmware so I deleted all the brother SW on all my devices and this was just a final bit of protection for me,mg9uwlx,5.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgb1dxo,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,10,2025-03-06 10:11:15,,,,Use a DHCP reservation for the MAC Address Its a better way to handle static IPs in general anyway since it will survive device resets and operating system installs You can see all the IPs that you have set up in one convenient place,mgaqsqd,5.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgaiimi,TotallyNormalSquid,,5,2025-03-06 07:00:08,,,,Ive never had as much trouble with a printer as with my Brother inkjet Heard I should have gotten a colour laser printer but just figured any Brother printer must be OK based on how much reddit loves them Every print takes an average of 4 attempts with a strong automatic cleaning between each attempt which must waste a lot of ink I dont print that often so I can see a cleaning being needed after a few months but this can happen after a few weeks of no use And the thing wakes up to clean itself randomly every once in a while so youd think you wouldnt have to worry about it being ready to go when needed And then the updates that break the WiFi connection and need a full reinstall of the software to fix Last time I wanted to print a single black and white page it took over 30 minutes,mg9b64f,1.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgdsk9w,orev,,1,2025-03-06 19:34:41,,,,Inkjets are a really bad choice for people who dont print often The ink dries inside the nozzles so if you havent used it they need to be deep cleaned which wastes ink You might be able to get around this by printing something that uses all 4 colors once a week Typically people who dont print often get an inkjet because theyre cheaper but unintuitively thats when buying the more expensive laser printer makes more sense But dont ever print photos at home Its far cheaper to have them printed at a pharmacyphoto shop,mgaiimi,2.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgagh64,cH3x,,7,2025-03-06 06:41:38,,,,When asked where Brother thinks the confusion may be coming from the company said Brother encourages the use of Brother Genuine ink and toner for optimal performance and reliability and it is standard practice that we perform a Brother Genuine check when troubleshooting a Brother printer Compatible supplies may range in quality and in order to verify that a printer is working properly we like to troubleshoot with Brother Genuine supplies We believe this check in the process may have led to a misunderstanding but as we confirmed the firmware update would not be responsible for the degradation of quality or removal of printer features This could be interpreted to mean that after using a genuine toner cartridge to verify the printer is working properly one could use the thirdparty toner to actually print In other words a genuine cartridge is required to be inserted before inserting the thirdparty,mgacvjo,3.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgcdtet,AccomplishedEnergy24,,1,2025-03-06 15:35:37,,,,Why do people keep talking abstractly Apparently because none of them understand how printers work What exactly is the feature you think they disable to make print quality worse Ill offer a view none Laser printers are simple devices There is a beam that electrostatically charges the drum with the right image and causes it to attract toner The toner is then rolled on to the paper and fused with heat Thats it So what is the feature they are disabling exactly All of this is easy to verify too You can easily measure whether the fusing temperature is the same withwithout third party ink You can easily measure whether the image is being painted the same on the drum You can easily measure whether the roller speed is the same Maybe instead of abstractly accusing brother people should just do the fucking measurements and wed know for sure On the software side its trivial to determine if they are doing something in the software While most printers accept various formats of drawing commands from their drivers basically all of them including brother also accept post processed rawimage formats that they dont touch So disconnect your machine from the network so it cant possible communicate with the printer to determine if the ink is genuine generate a raw datastream format that the printer accepts copy it to the printer Reconnect machine to network reprint Try again with a nonraw image format If you see differences maybe the software is doing something Again this is just not that hard to test My guess You will discover brother is doing literally nothing and some slightly different property of the third party ink accounts for all perceived difference,mgb97h5,2.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgdafu5,diverareyouokay,,1,2025-03-06 18:09:46,,,,You know a whole lot more about this than I do I honestly never even thought to wonder how a laser printer works but I assumed when the person you were responding to spoke about degradation that they were referring to software reducing the dots per inch on things like images before it actually hit the printer It seems like that would still be possible but I dont know if that would work on things like printed text or not,mgcdtet,3.0,1j4kb6q
comment,mgezpy0,AccomplishedEnergy24,,2,2025-03-06 23:02:31,,,,This is really only possible in certain modes Its also a lot harder than one would think to implement something like this The reason is that Microsoft has multiple print APIs and most if not all are still in use By print API let me try to give a nottooincorrect version of what happens when you click print 1 You click print button 2 Depending on print API used GDI XPS OpenXPS etc a set of drawing commands is issued to the printer driver or a raw image is handed to the printer driver 3 The driver then translates these into some printer language it sends the printer 4 It gets transported to printer and printer processes the commands A few things 1 As things became more complex printers actually do less and less of the rasterization work on device because its too intensive and too easy to get wrong if for example you want fonts to look the same way on the screen and the device In the case of raw image print modes it basically just splats pixels directly and hence affecting this sort of mode would be really hard 2 Nonraw formats like GDI XPS etc getting sent to the driver are completely different sets of drawing commands and what have you Which one gets used is not just selected by windows but by the app So for example Google Chrome still uses EMFGDI printing While Microsoft word prints in XPS XPS in turn queries the printer driver to understand which sorts of things it understands 3 Degrading image quality while not making it completely unusable is not trivial either if it was we wouldnt have ditheringetc algorithms In the end because of all of this making the software degrade image quality would actually be a lot of work Thats true even if you dont for example try to degrade it consistently the same way in XPS vs GDI vs etc It is very hard to believe anyone would undertake the development effort required to degrade image quality in the driver across all supported modes It would also be very easy to discover through reverse engineering On top of that its one of those things where you actually want the user to know its happening If someone only ever used third party ink how would they ever know it was lower quality printing without someone telling them In the end 1 Its dramatically easier safer and saner to just refuse to work properly when third party ink is detected if that is what someone wants to do It isnt illegal in the vast majority of cases and as we see here users assume all printer companies are both assholes and doing it so 2 Building and maintaining support for consistently degrading image quality inside the software is hard and its hard to imagine anyone would bother over just doing 1 If they did bother i also dont see why theyd try to hide it from the user if you want people to buy your ink at some point you have to tell them they should buy your ink to get better quality prints,mgdafu5,4.0,1j4kb6q

comment,mgcnkvw,Diashocks,,5,2025-03-06 16:22:49,,,,Threw away two Brother printers exactly like the one in the article expansive A3 multifunctional in December One of the most reliable printers I have had for years till some firmware update System prompted me to replace the ink cartridges that had plenty of ink left able to tell by shaking and theres a transparent window It just wont let me print till I replace them with a new cartridge Multiply this by four times CMYK one after the other The system used to just prompt low ink and would still print Final straw was the latest patch of cartridges prompted an error and mentioned cartridges are not detected Now on a Epson EcoTank No chip no cartridges Edit Printer also loves to run its routine print head cleaning that uses up lots of ink after new cartridges are installed,,0.0,1j4kb6q
