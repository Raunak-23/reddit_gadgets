comment,lw384br,Sub_NerdBoy,,43,2024-11-08 15:11:21,,,,They failed to capitalize on the mobile chip boom which cost them billions They failed to capitalize on the crypto boom which cost them billions Theyre failing to capitalize on the AI boom which is going to cost them billions If you cant generate the revenue at key milestones to reinvest for RD your future in this field will suffer and theyve been suffering for a long time now,lw2qko1,1.0,1gmhx3y

comment,lw3fypn,Sub_NerdBoy,,7,2024-11-08 15:50:34,,,,Arguably the cloud boom was on the back of Intel server CPUs so I dont agree with that one GPU boom is what I would call the crypto boom really which they absolutely failed to capitalize on,lw3bnli,3.0,1gmhx3y
comment,lw3j171,bizarro_kvothe,,2,2024-11-08 16:05:34,,,,A good question is how much of cloud revenue actually goes to Intel vs Amazon Im sure Intel could have capitalized a lot more,lw3fypn,4.0,1gmhx3y

comment,lw2z22h,mr_bots,,10,2024-11-08 14:22:39,,,,With Intels failing two generations of failing CPUs and their latest not holding a candle to AMD theyre going to lose most of the gamers but theyll probably still dominate the prebuilt markets especially office settings Well see if MS and Qualcomm can get their act together and keep improving compatibility to make snapdragon succeed in mobile,,0.0,1gmhx3y
comment,lw3lymx,geekstone,,3,2024-11-08 16:19:49,,,,They seem to still dominate the business desktop and laptop market that Intel Inside marketing really worked in those segments It will be interesting to see if AMD makes a bigger push in those segments,lw2z22h,1.0,1gmhx3y
comment,lw3mcyj,mr_bots,,5,2024-11-08 16:21:46,,,,I think its more that Intel basically paid them to use their chips exclusively which is why AMD has struggled to get a foothold and why SIs generally only used bottom tier AMD CPUs,lw3lymx,2.0,1gmhx3y
