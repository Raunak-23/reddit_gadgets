comment,ms2l1xc,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,47,2025-05-13 11:09:28,,,,60 vs 144 is an enormous visual difference 144 vs 240 is unnoticeable for most 240 vs 360 is unnoticeable for most 360 vs 500 is unnoticeable for most But 144 vs 500 is an enormous visual difference The issue isnt that its overkill its that each incremental upgrade isnt earth shattering the way 60 to 144 is Its pretty easy to demonstrate that the human eye can still detect improvements as high as 10000hz in specific scenarios You can do it yourself with an arduino and a LED make the LED blink at a few kHz and shake it about and youll see it flickering Once you see it youll never unsee youll start spotting car headlights flickering at their PWM frequency as they drive past,ms2dvvm,1.0,1klhxwb

comment,ms4ii7n,bonesnaps,,14,2025-05-13 17:26:58,,,,Except its all redundant when the only games you can run past 144hz are ghetto esport games with graphics from 2010 like Counterstrike or League I have a 165 oled 3440x1440 and my 9800X3DRTX 3070 build can only push most modern games to around 80120 fps To push 500hz in actual good looking games youd need triple SLId 5090s basically I am skipping this gen of gpus since the 5000 series was a hardware pricing disaster and AMD is only marginally better Maybe nextgen of AMD with be worth it for me,ms2l1xc,2.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms6ku3d,Cynical_Manatee,,8,2025-05-13 23:43:59,,,,Its a very small market but rhythm games like OSU really benefits from super high refresh rates Or any game where you are looking at fast but simple motion,ms4ii7n,3.0,1klhxwb

comment,ms7x694,Kiseido,,0,2025-05-14 04:49:14,,,,You might want to reduce quality settings below Ultra if you actually want higher frames per second You might find many multiplayer games can be run well over 200fps on low settings with your stated hardware,ms4ii7n,3.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms9t4zb,cbytes1001,,6,2025-05-14 14:05:32,,,,Thats not a trade most people would make Personally Id rather look at beautiful graphics at 120Hz than pixelated edges less defined textures at 200Hz,ms7x694,4.0,1klhxwb
comment,msb8kdl,Kiseido,,1,2025-05-14 18:12:29,,,,If you are attempting to play a competitive game then the trade off is often worth it Additionally you are unlikely to be admiring the details when all your attention is spent on checking doors and corners for enemies or etc For instance I play Halo Infinite on nearly all low settings and with upscaling from 788p up to 4k so I can maintain a constant 240fps and I play much better at that higher frame rate despite my monitor only being a 60hz model The input latency reduction is substantial and can be felt even if I only get to see one of every four frames generated,ms9t4zb,5.0,1klhxwb
comment,msbdshs,cbytes1001,,4,2025-05-14 18:37:49,,,,The person you replied to originally specifically stated To push 500Hz in actual good looking games so I am really only speaking to that In competitive games then sure not only do you want frames but also the fewer shadows the easier it is to see the other player,msb8kdl,6.0,1klhxwb
comment,msbgsbm,Kiseido,,1,2025-05-14 18:52:13,,,,I hadnt noticed it wasnt the original commenter i had replied to thanks for pointing that out Extreme framerates for noncompetitive or otherwise nonfast paced games arent likely to help all that much The slight improvement in input latency wont really be immediately noticable but rather only showing itself in aggregate when comparing how well you did against others with low latencies I would argue shadows tend to help at least where dynamic shadows are a thing seeing a players shadow appear on a wall prior to them coming around the corner can be strongly helpful Many games are only a bit less pretty when at medium or low settings but tend to perform much much better than ultra Ultra is a preset that tends to be made such that halotier or highend next generation cards are required to run the game at 60fps So running a modern game at Ultra or even high and also desiring high framerates would seem to be conflicting objectives And it would seem they are likely to be conflicting objectives for the foreseeable future,msbdshs,7.0,1klhxwb

comment,msljwbo,Otaraka,,1,2025-05-16 09:48:06,,,,That was a a really interesting watch thank you To be picky it wasnt double blinded and it wasnt just the monitor refresh rate being compared In my view it supported the idea that 144 onwards is pretty marginal even when it was the whole fps being limited rather than just the monitor let alone 240 vs 500 which obviously couldnt be tested there,mslf9we,4.0,1klhxwb

comment,msqqgau,Cheap-Plane2796,,1,2025-05-17 04:02:30,,,,Since oled panels are still sample and hold they suffer heavily from sample and hold blue in motion 360 fpshz MASSIVELY reduces sample and hold blur over 120 or 144 hz First time ever for me that a sample and hold panel looks as clear in motion as crt did In games where i can get such good fps,ms2l1xc,2.0,1klhxwb
comment,msqr1uq,StaysAwakeAllWeek,,1,2025-05-17 04:07:14,,,,Even without sample and hold on strobed displays there is still the residual stroboscopic artifacting that is impossible to remove in any way other than increasing framerate It doesnt necessarily look blurred but it still looks imperfect,msqqgau,3.0,1klhxwb

comment,ms43or1,Itwasallyell0w,,1,2025-05-13 16:15:16,,,,yeah you definitely have vision problems then 60144 is actually an extreme difference you cant even come back to 60 fps Now even 144 to 180 is a big difference for me,ms34h8y,3.0,1klhxwb

comment,ms328hs,No-Bother6856,,1,2025-05-13 13:04:11,,,,It gets into diminishing returns but even then a leap this large should make a difference Motion clarity on a CRT is still better than a 120hz OLED because sample and hold displays inherently have this issue The only way to reduce this issue is to run higher and higher refresh rates Until this sample and hold blur is entirely imperceptible there will be benefit from going higher and higher with the refresh rate,ms2dvvm,1.0,1klhxwb

comment,msbqaky,VRGIMP27,,3,2025-05-14 19:38:48,,,,What is 500hz good for Low persistence 500 fps at 500hz means that each frame will be visible to the eye for 2 milliseconds If you have a good BenQ 144 HZ monitor and you use backlight Strobing this monitor at 500 FPS will look as good as a 2 ms strobe OLED pixels also switch on average in 25 milliseconds If you use this monitor with frame generation to lock to the 500 FPS this monitor should look in motion like an analog picture tube Think of A Dell P 1110 CRT monitor in motion,,0.0,1klhxwb

comment,ms3jpdu,Edward_TH,,5,2025-05-13 14:37:52,,,,I get that thats what they do and that advancing tech is always good but Excluding a very minute handful of games run on stupidly expensive and overkill hardware whats the point of chasing this trail How many people would have the exact combination of hardware games will to sacrifice detailfidelity for smoother visuals and money to justify a consumer product launch over a custom made order only product I mean how many games can you actually run at 500 fps 1 low at maxed graphical settings even on literal top of the line hardware Even if you could afford thousands of these monitors how many years do you have to wait for the rest of the hardware to catch up in capability,,0.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms46j01,andynator1000,,1,2025-05-13 16:29:10,,,,If you drop the graphics settings to less than ultra you can play a lot of games at 500fps on highend hardware This is mostly for competitive FPS players though who have a 405090 and play an older title,ms3jpdu,1.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms4a2tl,Edward_TH,,0,2025-05-13 16:46:31,,,,Yeah but 500 average is MUCH different than 500 1 lows Even cs2 lol dota2 and starcraft cant really hit those numbers for 1 lows at 1080p If you look at one of the latest video from LTT where they tune a very high end computer cs2 sits at 300fps 1 lows at 1080p Thats what seems odd to me on a market point of view why pushing for a 500hz monitor that just a handful of people in the world would be willing to compromise with and buy because of external bottlenecks when you could market a only 360hz one but with lower response time better brightness better contrast better color accuracy or other features that can make a difference and people actually care about enough to shell out some extra money,ms46j01,2.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms5h94i,andynator1000,,0,2025-05-13 20:13:52,,,,Because some people own a 5090 and are playing old games 1 lows are much less important when youre in the hundreds of frames per second because even if your 1 lows are 100 fps lower than your average your frame latency is not dramatically different Regardless if you want a 360hz monitor they exist but honestly a 4k 144hz monitor makes more sense for most people who are not interested in competitive shooters and own a high end gpu,ms4a2tl,3.0,1klhxwb
comment,ms5pfwi,Edward_TH,,2,2025-05-13 20:53:04,,,,No I know that they arent useless Im just puzzled by the idea that there could be more demand for this than for a better lower refresh rate display instead The amount of people that have rigs even capable to reach these numbers isnt zero but not that common either how many of those are playing so much older games competively that they value marginally smoother experiences lets be real most of them are probably already rocking 240hz displays anyway over a better image quality better viewing angles or whatever,ms5h94i,4.0,1klhxwb
