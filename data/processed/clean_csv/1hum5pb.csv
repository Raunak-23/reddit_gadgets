comment,m5oiexm,None,,19,2025-01-06 11:06:23,,,,Espresso might be the dumbest name for a display manufacturer you can think of Like an unrelated name like Apple works but they literally sell Espresso machines Like there is no reality where you search espresso on google and your brand can come up even if youre extremely popular,m5mtfk3,1.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5n2jxj,AlexandreFiset,,40,2025-01-06 03:26:32,,,,Last year I shopped for a portable 11 to 13 inches monitor for photovideogame editing and I ended up buying an iPad Air for the purpose as other options were not better nor much cheaper 800 might seem pricy but its not far off the market Id still buy an iPad over it tho,m5mbvpm,1.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5ny291,thefinalcutdown,,13,2025-01-06 07:28:31,,,,Sadly in the world of professional color grading this is chump change A 16 1080p OLED built for film postproduction will set you back about 4500 from the affordable companies Or this 31 Sony 4K OLED thatll set you back a cool 20000 Theyre super niche and typically only bought by larger organizations with money to burn but theyre also extremely well built and calibrated to incredibly precise standards,m5mbvpm,1.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5o29s6,lucellent,,14,2025-01-06 08:12:46,,,,We are talking about a regular LCD display with no dimming zones average looking from the videos on their website and kinda ugly design The only Pro thing it has is the title,m5ny291,2.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5rd0k7,galvanash,,1,2025-01-06 20:59:17,,,,and it runs entirely off of USBC power from the displays data cable no AC power required That is pretty nifty,m5o29s6,3.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5vjd34,fyzbo,,1,2025-01-07 14:29:41,,,,It will be less that is the price of the 17 version It will still be priced higher than other products being niche and premiium just wanted to call out that it wont be 800,m5mbvpm,1.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5mc9by,None,,-32,2025-01-06 00:59:33,,,,The smaller size makes it more expensive This is much higher ppi than a 32 inch 4k monitor,m5mbvpm,1.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5mhfxa,Lurker_81,,34,2025-01-06 01:28:44,,,,15 laptops with colour accurate 4k touchscreens have been available for many years now Its not exactly cutting edge technology This product is almost certainly using an offtheshelf version of one of those laptops You can buy replacement screens for such laptops for 250 or less I know they still need to build a quality chassis and deal with marketing and shipping etc but its pretty clear theres a very generous markup on this product which isnt surprising since theyre clearly targeting the MacBook crowd,m5mc9by,2.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5ne8so,AbhishMuk,,4,2025-01-06 04:38:15,,,,Youre right you didnt say that its just that having a stylus support does not make it significantly rarer or more expensive Espresso displays have overpriced for a while now Ive been vaguely following the portable monitor market,m5mvv7o,6.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5np184,Lurker_81,,3,2025-01-06 06:02:34,,,,I did a quick search for comparable devices and found portable 15 4k touchscreens for as little as 300 USD and higher quality ones for 375 USD One with a stylus shouldnt be any more than an additional 75 USD extra I would suggest that Espresso are using a premium appearance and some expensive native marketing to make a very tidy profit on every unit sold,m5ne8so,7.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5ocuwz,adaminc,,-2,2025-01-06 10:08:18,,,,Well it would make it more expensive because its an extra feature that most other portable displays dont have at least not yet It is also kinda rare in this market as it stands right now Most portable monitors dont have an active digitizer in them You are paying for the premium of a 10bit 4k display that is over 100 aRGB colour accurate with 550nits of brightness There really is no competition for that yet in the portable monitor market Then you add in the active digitizer stylus and now there is even less competition for it yet until you get into actual drawing tablet territory like the Huion Kamvas Pro 16 The price hasnt been listed yet but itll probably be around 650 Id imagine as 799 is the price for the 173 inch version Im not gonna go digging deep on AliExpressAliBaba for some possibly better device but just simple searching on Google shows that of the portable monitors that do exist with similar specs 4k 10bit 100 aRGB active digitizer they are priced similarly or higher There are some lesser options like with only an 8bit panel and youll pay significantly less for such a device but that isnt comparable imo But as I see it like I said earlier the only direct comparisons right now are actual drawing tablets like the aforementioned Huion Kamvas Pro 16 which has a lesser display,m5ne8so,7.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5ndzqb,realusername42,,4,2025-01-06 04:36:30,,,,You already have some on Amazon for 18th of that price Sure they maybe arent as good quality wise but Im not sure why you would need a high quality portable display in the first place those are made for working in a caf√© otherwise you would just buy a tablet,m5n2u4a,2.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5o1tdj,lucellent,,4,2025-01-06 08:07:54,,,,There are little to no Pro things on this monitor compared to every other portable monitor in existence I hate these so obvious paid advertisements They make it seem like having USBC is a groundbreaking Pro feature,,0.0,1hum5pb
comment,m5o871a,Rhywden,,3,2025-01-06 09:17:27,,,,They have advantages over other portable monitors Touch support Windows Pen support ie any pen that works on a Surface will also work on this USBC passthrough and the 4K resolution is not bad either Also strong magnetic attachment so you can easily detach rotate the display That combination is rarely found especially the pen support I myself am using the 15 nonpro version and like it very much,m5o1tdj,1.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5oontj,Mesapholis,,4,2025-01-06 12:04:48,,,,I am still using their 13inch nontouch screen that came out during the pandemic I worked 100 remote at the time and continue to travel with the screen as it was the same size as my macbook air 13inch back then still works great I dont really see a necessity for the touch features but so far the hardware has held up really well plug and play doesnt matter if I plug it into my personal mac at home or at the office now not 100 remote anymore lol into the windows once this thing will give out I will definitely look into their newer models,,0.0,1hum5pb

comment,m5o6pbe,KabarJaw,,-6,2025-01-06 09:01:06,,,,These Espresso monitors are really stepping up their game The color accuracy on their previous models was already solid but this Pro version looks like it could be a gamechanger for digital artists who need something portable,,0.0,1hum5pb
