comment,myato0w,thisischemistry,,42,2025-06-17 17:38:28,,,,No it can be safe Its like most things how much exposure you have Putting your face in it and breathing deep lungfuls wouldnt be a good idea but a bit of skin contact probably isnt bad Id like to see a health and safety study on possible longterm effects for proper use of the device but they probably arent very serious After all people use things like ammonia and chlorine bleach all the time and those are probably much worse for you than this product Even the alcohol that people drink is probably worse depending on how much and how often,myalril,6.0,1ldj2yy

comment,my9idyz,big_troublemaker,,41,2025-06-17 13:55:31,,,,Thats exactly what you use ozone machines for not necessarily killing roaches but killing living organisms Source have one and use it to disinfect all sort of smelly stuff around home helmets boots mattresses cars etc but with appropriate safety precautions basically not inhaling ozone during or after treatment,my97fq2,5.0,1ldj2yy
comment,my9wa2e,thisischemistry,,27,2025-06-17 15:03:28,,,,It will also degrade surfaces such as plastic rubber leather wood metal paper cloth and so on Of course it will kill organisms faster so its a balance of how much you use it,my9idyz,6.0,1ldj2yy
comment,my9z8ik,big_troublemaker,,20,2025-06-17 15:17:23,,,,Of course but its simply nature of things Alcohol and other disinfectants also degrade surfaces Do we also need to emphasise that washing clothes degrades fabrics VERY quickly And using dishwasher deteriorates finishes and surfaces on your kitchenware,my9wa2e,7.0,1ldj2yy
comment,mya2omh,thisischemistry,,6,2025-06-17 15:33:32,,,,Sure its good to know the side effects of the things we use That doesnt mean they are useless just that you need to balance their effectiveness with their detriments,my9z8ik,8.0,1ldj2yy

comment,my95sbx,VagueSomething,,4,2025-06-17 12:44:51,,,,Which should only concern you if it was being implemented at your expense If theyre not taking away your options then another option being added for a tiny market is none of your concern For those with allergies or skin conditions or issues with over production of sweat where normal deodorant doesnt work then having another thing to try or combine is a huge win Plus we have to consider this being a potential stepping stone to something better If this safely works then maybe it inspires another step for tackling bad smells or this can lead to an alternative use,my8uzox,2.0,1ldj2yy

comment,my8wdnd,edvek,,5,2025-06-17 11:43:27,,,,My quick googlefu has a bit of a range depending on what you are looking for but if its the aluminum antiperspirant in some products its probably less than 1 of adults If the fragrance is an issue which you can just buy fragrance free it might be a little higher than that So lets just go real high and say its 5 of the population has a hard time with most deodorant They can just buy aluminum and fragrance free products which is probably not that expensive I dont know about everyone else but I buy regular stick deodorant and it lasts a while and I use it daily Theres no way this machine will be better or cheaper At the end of the article it says it will retail for 250 Even if you buy the fancier stuff and it costs 10 and you go through it like crazy so 1 every 3 months that will take you over 6 YEARS to break even I highly highly doubt this will last 6 years probably wont even last half that Even if you go through 1 a month which is absolutely insane thats still 2 years Maybe this product does work but it sure as hell not cost effective,my8uzox,2.0,1ldj2yy
comment,my9id3z,cmasontaylor,,5,2025-06-17 13:55:23,,,,Yeah I think for me this product would become worth having under these circumstances 1 It lasts for years and years 2 It costs under 40 At that price and in that circumstance it would become a useful option for when I forget to buy more deodorant until it completely runs out,my8wdnd,3.0,1ldj2yy

comment,my91zxv,b1gwheel,,176,2025-06-17 12:21:11,,,,Heres how the technology is claimed to work Twice each day the user starts by holding the PlaDeo gently beneath each clean dry armpit A silicone gasket creates a 1cm 04in gap between the devices main body and the underarm skin Pressing and holding the power button causes the PlaDeo to start producing ionized gas namely cold atmospheric plasma for 15 minutes Should the user be prone to particularly stinky armpits they can boost the time to three minutes per pit by pressing the button twice In either case the plasma in turn produces chemicals known as reactive oxygen species ROS These kill odorcausing bacteria like Staphylococcus hominis and Corynebacterium xerosis mainly by rupturing their outer cell walls The ROS also break down any VOC molecules that those microbes may have already produced But thanks to the 1cm gap between the devices plasma emitter and the skin the ROS are claimed to not harm the skin cells Wow So convenient to have a mid day pit wash and dry followed by a 36 min plasma session,,0.0,1ldj2yy

comment,my8r3wo,Mesapholis,,3,2025-06-17 11:04:19,,,,yes it does to an extent but if your wash cycle is not effective over time sweat will stain the pits if not treated specifically But also the device here states its application interrupts the bacterial cells present so that means you apply it several times throughout the day I want to point out that the research is done at a Korean University Asians are genetically predisposed through a gene variant to sweat less be less sweatystinky so you zap your pits several times throughout the day NonAsians even more often but how often do you have access to a shower to remove the residue And how effective is it on NonAsians,my8pvpi,5.0,1ldj2yy

comment,mybg2ca,AssaultedCracker,,4,2025-06-17 19:22:28,,,,Yeah this isnt solving anything especially since a better alternative to conventional deoderant already exists and it operates using the same mechanism as this thing Crystal rock mineral salt deodorant kills the bacteria too and you use it basically like regular deodorant,my9p4pu,3.0,1ldj2yy
comment,mybeuoz,AssaultedCracker,,2,2025-06-17 19:16:40,,,,Consider this your review even though its for a different product that Im positive is far superior to this I have been itching for an opportunity to rave about crystal rock mineral salt deodorant Just like this device it also kills the bacteria that cause odours but instead of using a device twice a day you put it on like regular deodorant once a day And a stick costs 10 but lasts forever Like over a year The only requirement is to apply it after you shower It has to go on wet clean skin And use a lot of it liberally cover the entire armpit and then some If you do that you can sweat through your clothes and not only will you be stink free your clothes will smell fresh too cause theres nothing around to cause an odour I have confirmed this with my wife after I drenched my shirt it didnt smell at all and neither did I Seriously I have no idea why anybody would use anything else much less a lessconvenient alternative like this device,my8qk5k,2.0,1ldj2yy

comment,mykhsl4,AssaultedCracker,,0,2025-06-19 03:11:22,,,,Wtf Why not The review is that there is a far better alternative readily available that you can buy today for 10 on Amazon While not technically a review of the product it tells you all you need to know about whether or not to buy it,mydfc7o,4.0,1ldj2yy
comment,mykvt5l,VincentNacon,,1,2025-06-19 04:51:32,,,,Your idea of a proper review is literally downright insane You do NOT have the device itself you havent used that device yet you couldnt possibly have the device in the past because its not even out yet Its on Indiegogo and they havent completed the funding window period yet Youre just giving me your experience with others nontech related stuff Thats not a proper review of the said device were talking about here,mykhsl4,5.0,1ldj2yy
comment,myzo3zk,AssaultedCracker,,0,2025-06-21 14:25:03,,,,To spell this out clearly Im reviewing the ADVERTISED features value and convenience of this device as compared to my personal experience with a different product Assuming it works 100 as well as they claim it works I have used a product that works for longer than theirs requires much less time to apply and can be bought for 5 of the cost Its a pretty basic application of logic to realize that even if this device operates perfectly a cheap stick that does the same thing better is going to be preferable in every way Apply logic a little further and youll realize that this review is much more helpful than a review from somebody who has used this device but doesnt know about mineral rock deodorant They might think this device is an amazing breakthrough in technology that totally justifies its exorbitant 250 price tag for people who cant use conventional deodorant In reality a 10 alternative already exists for those people You could find that persons positive review and choose to pay 250 for this device and be very happy with it blissfully unaware that you could have paid 10 for a much more convenient option Honestly I was just trying to be helpful and save you that But it would seem my use of the word review has motivated you the opposite way somehow as you seem very emotionally invested in wasting your money Try this thing out and let me know how well it does at killing those bacteria for half the day with a 15 minute application time for 250 No matter how well it does Ill keep using my stick that works for 48 hours applied in 15 seconds and cost 10,mykvt5l,6.0,1ldj2yy
