comment,ms9d9tv,JoviAMP,,203,2025-05-14 12:35:42,,,,A company decided to put people who say theyd pay more to buy American to the test They ran an AB test where they sold a showerhead that was made in China at 129 and an identical showerhead that was made in the USA at 239 and ended up selling 584 Chinamade showerheads and ZERO USAmade showerheads,ms94z69,2.0,1kmbppf

comment,msau2e5,djk29a_,,15,2025-05-14 17:04:28,,,,While a similar motivation of proof if in good faith its similar to companies putting out job ads and crying that they cant find candidates for their job postings The difference is that job markets goods markets securities markets You have to have evidence to show to the public or administrative bodies that regulations upon your company are working as intended or not Additionally lets recall Apple attempted to manufacture Mac Pros in the US and found that even labor skilling isnt necessarily the biggest issue but that the US is such a huge country with long distances for suppliers that it would be a huge problem while in China with its urban manufacturing model you have lots of options for suppliers for so many parts across different cities This took China decades and decades to reach this state even with its well known underhanded and morally dubious methods while in the US we cant even manufacture most weapons of war costeffectively with our stupidly overfunded DoD read the de facto US federal jobs program So my supposition is that if we instantly disbanded our DoD had zero need for new human labor and shoved ALL that defense money read debt into more consumer goods manufacturing _maybe_ we would have something viable for manufacturing a broader range of goods in like 13 years in the US,ms9zvfk,4.0,1kmbppf

comment,msa1sfb,Ashmizen,,-38,2025-05-14 14:48:55,,,,That doesnt prove anything though They were identicalso 100 of the people were smart enough to pay 129 instead of 239 for the same thing US manufacturing will never succeed because of just goodwill They will exist in cases where due to tariffs and other factors the US version is either higher quality or actually price competitive,ms9d9tv,3.0,1kmbppf

comment,ms9qlr5,HereForTheComments57,,47,2025-05-14 13:52:14,,,,here is the story The showerhead wasnt marked up it was the actual cost with the tariffs Regardless people may pay a tiny percentage more for made in USA but 99 of people will buy cheaper even if its 2 dollars difference,ms9ov1k,4.0,1kmbppf

comment,msbx9ql,edvek,,-11,2025-05-14 20:12:48,,,,You would need to see how much people are willing pay over the other Maybe people are willing to pay 10 more or even 50 more but that price difference is quite the shock so it makes sense people wouldnt buy it Even if the Chinese one lasted 5 years and the US one lasted 10 years so technically a better deal for time and money people will still spend the lower upfront cost Its like looking do American made clothes I looked some time ago and the cost of simple button down shirts and jeans were significantly higher than the stuff made overseas And Im not talking about some fancy 1000 marked up brand either Maybe its a bit better but havent looked in years So ya people do want to buy American but the cost is too high And to expect people to stick to that principle especially now is insane Everything is getting too expensive so you have to cut costs where you can,ms9ps4b,5.0,1kmbppf
comment,msh18p7,NecroCannon,,3,2025-05-15 16:25:30,,,,Maybe your kind of people cares but most people dont care its what ever is cheapest or last the longest And American brands are tanking on the reliability aspect because ours care more about profit than volumes,msbx9ql,6.0,1kmbppf
comment,msahth9,Ja_Rule_Here_,,-23,2025-05-14 16:05:50,,,,Thats the point of tariffs though Just boost the price of the Chinese one to 239 with a tariff and now consumers will either pay the tariff or buy the US made one either way win for the country It does cause higher prices but theoretically should drive up employment too which would drive up wages and ideally the balance at the end is a net positive,ms9d9tv,3.0,1kmbppf
comment,msaj2ay,StillwaterJerry,,12,2025-05-14 16:11:51,,,,Do you think theres a large amount of unemployment in the country currently I worked as a manufacturing engineer for a company that assembled high dollar items in the US And we couldnt keep new employees no matter what we did This company paid pretty well and gave substantial quarterly bonus One year every single employee in the company got 12k bonus for Christmas Despite that we were always struggling having enough people,msahth9,4.0,1kmbppf

comment,msb4xqy,StillwaterJerry,,15,2025-05-14 17:55:12,,,,The same person pushing the Tariffs is deporting everyone and legally immigrating takes forever and is very difficult Yeah lets give all manufacturing workers 30k Christmas bonus and pay them 200k Im sure everything will be very reasonable priced Youre not living in reality with comments like this and its pretty obvious,msavqsv,6.0,1kmbppf
comment,msb8wk0,Ja_Rule_Here_,,-16,2025-05-14 18:14:04,,,,Deporting illegal immigrants there is a difference And we dont have the labor shortage yet but when we do we can easily open the spigot Whats wrong with paying people fairly 200k and a 30k bonus is what I get why does someone working for you deserve less than me My job isnt all that hard,msb4xqy,7.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbb75n,StillwaterJerry,,8,2025-05-14 18:25:12,,,,Theres no difference they are deporting illegal immigrants that will do the jobs very few US citizens will do But they are also denying more H1B visas and revoking student visas Theres already a shortage of high end talent in the US and this regime doesnt care Nobody works for me But if you paid everyone that kind of money shit could cost 5x as much and nothing would change You think someone can go from paying an employee 50k to 200k and not have to jack the price WAY up You live in some fantasy land where all us workers want to work in factories can get paid astronomical wages to do so but thats not real life The cost of good would skyrocket and nobody could afford it The US is a knowledge economy the manufacturing days are gone,msb8wk0,8.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbgaqz,Ja_Rule_Here_,,-1,2025-05-14 18:49:52,,,,Doesnt seem theres a shortage have you heard about all the recent layoffs in tech There is certainly a difference between a legal and illegal immigrant And yeah you can jack wages up quite a bit without affecting price too much Wages are only one component of price ultimately the market works on supply and demand The price will equalize somewhere and corporate profits may have to suffer a bit boo hoo Have you seen the bonuses that business execs get Makes 30k look like peanuts The system can work but not with us selling out our own people in order to make things for pennies by exploiting foreign workers so executives can buy another yacht Thats what has to change corporate profits,msbb75n,9.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbj0y8,StillwaterJerry,,4,2025-05-14 19:03:02,,,,You know that layoffs mean the opposite of a shortage right That means theres a job shortage not a labor shortage Sure sure and as soon as the rich are willing to give up money for the average American we can live in your utopia Until then Not so much,msbgaqz,10.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbpb6h,Ja_Rule_Here_,,1,2025-05-14 19:33:57,,,,Did you forget what point you were arguing Theres already a shortage of high end talent in the US Thats what you said I said theres no shortage Then you say That means theres a job shortage not a labor shortage Which is what I said No current labor shortage,msbj0y8,11.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbx7ao,StillwaterJerry,,3,2025-05-14 20:12:29,,,,Theres a big difference between whos getting laid off and high end talent Tech companies are not laying off elite engineers and idea people,msbpb6h,12.0,1kmbppf
comment,msbqzpk,YnotBbrave,,-19,2025-05-14 19:42:14,,,,People would not pay double But otoh would pay 139 for a US made shower head vs 129 for a Chinese made The taarif will help reduce the price gap maybe enough to make some American made products possible,ms9d9tv,3.0,1kmbppf
comment,msc18er,Bill_buttlicker69,,21,2025-05-14 20:32:58,,,,Lets fix your example The original scenario was Chinese 129 US 239 Youre saying if instead it was China 129 US 139 more people would be willing to buy American But they already have the opportunity to do that American manufacturing is just much more expensive due largely to stricter labor laws If American companies wanted to compete at that price they would Since they cant a tariff jacks up the price of the foreignmade item so that the American price becomes competitive In short you would be looking at China 316 thats the original price plus 145 tariff US 316 because guess what theres no incentive for a US company to offer it for substantially lower than the competition Now the China tariff has just been dropped to 30 for a time which would make the price 168 still 30 more than your pieinthesky estimate But the more broad point to make here is that with this completely unhinged and random assignment of tariffs no company is going to make hard plans to move manufacturing into the US right now even if they pretend theyre thinking about it for PR And even if they do its not going to be a slightly higher price than before It will be a lot more expensive To help illustrate the chaos of all of this a little better consider a Chinese company staring down the barrel of a 145 tariff Thats so unbelievably high that theyre going to start looking into moving operations to another country with lower tariffs such as Vietnam 46 or Thailand 36 And then a month later Trump backs down and changes the China tariff to 30 Well now it doesnt make any sense to move to those two countries after all since it will be more expensive now And when supply chain shifts like this take on the order of several years to complete and Trump is tweeting changes from the toilet at 3am every other day its completely impossible to make plans like that And furthermore to circle back to shower heads again even if a company builds a factory here in the US almost every single good requires parts and resources that arent found in the US And when those parts and resources get imported they get charged the requisite tariff So its not even simply a matter of building a facility here Its straight up not possible to source everything domestically so prices will still rise Hopefully youre starting to get the picture here These tariffs combined with the nature of their implementation is the equivalent of a crazy person on the subway swinging a bag of piss around Totally unpredictable and making a fucking mess of everything And people here are still clapping for him and calling him a genius,msbqzpk,4.0,1kmbppf

comment,mscggzu,HereForTheComments57,,6,2025-05-14 21:50:44,,,,Thats the thing the parts made in USA would be more expensive to manufacture and the tariffs from parts coming from China would increase the cost Either way in the end PlayStations would cost more,msc8swp,3.0,1kmbppf

comment,msaret5,llamapower13,,5,2025-05-14 16:52:00,,,,Yes its possible But even a domestic made PS5 would be assembled here and not made Things like mother boards have very limited manufacturing options and all are over seas My out of my butt guess is we wouldnt see a completely US made PS until PS7 because it would take that long to recreate the total supply chain stateside and thats even if you could,ms9zwne,3.0,1kmbppf
comment,msa0ttl,HereForTheComments57,,14,2025-05-14 14:44:11,,,,So they would manufacture overseas for overseas sales only and then manufacture domestically for domestic sales only Thats 2 manufacturing facilities 2 times the number of employees 2 times the amount of assembly equipment etc The US made one would still have a cost increase because of the cost to manufacture goods in the US Plus if they dont send any overseas then they will be taking a huge profit hit which they will try to recover from another cost increase,ms9zwne,3.0,1kmbppf
comment,msau7yl,woodcookiee,,-4,2025-05-14 17:05:13,,,,The North American markets account for nearly 40 of PS5 sales which seems like enough to justify a dedicated facility To me again not even an armchair expert it makes sense to consolidate as much of the supply chain as close to the consumer as possible,msa0ttl,4.0,1kmbppf
comment,msb8u5b,HereForTheComments57,,5,2025-05-14 18:13:45,,,,Yes but all those parts being produced domestically will cost more to manufacture and raise the price that much more,msau7yl,5.0,1kmbppf
