post,1i7bei0,a_Ninja_b0y,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 3DMark performance leaks out,1230,2025-01-22 13:44:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1i7bei0/nvidia_geforce_rtx_5090_3dmark_performance_leaks/,397.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,m8jqiyc,M4c4br346,,247,2025-01-22 15:18:52,,,,Im more interested in seeing the performance of that cooler on 5090 Its around half the thickness of 4090 and yet the card is 125w TDP higher than 4090,,0.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8k8r8y,tartare4562,,212,2025-01-22 16:43:45,,,,Theres a video from Gamer Nexus with an indepth interview of a thermal engineer at Nvidia about this he even shows prototypes and testbeds they used That card is a marvel of thermal management honestly the most fascinating aspect of that card so far,m8jqiyc,1.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8mqcmo,Ironlion45,,37,2025-01-22 23:35:53,,,,Ill tell you I stopped having to pay the heating bill after I installed a 4090 in my gaming PC p So thermal management is very much nontrivial either But other than that it kind of sounds like an overclocked 4090 with better cooling,m8k8r8y,2.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8nru7n,ClemsonJeeper,,14,2025-01-23 02:56:54,,,,I had to buy a 30 foot HDMI cable to move my rig that has a 4090 outside of my office When gaming it would easily raise the temperature in it uncomfortably during the summer,m8mqcmo,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8or8i6,Sandman1920,,2,2025-01-23 07:08:55,,,,I feel this but with a 3080 3080 was already a heat generator with AAA games I was forced to buy a window AC to level the temperature out at night I cant imagine a 4090 temperatures heating my room,m8nru7n,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8je43m,GrosBof,,246,2025-01-22 14:15:05,,,,no it doesnt looks good its basically only more Watts to get more perf on the exact same tech,m8j9v1b,1.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jrl73,RobinVerhulstZ,,139,2025-01-22 15:23:56,,,,Really feels like every gen after the goated pascal has progressively thrown more and more watts at the silicon and now its just gotten completely ridiculous Its like every new gpu worth a damn is friggin space heater at this point,m8je43m,2.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kf94l,gramathy,,25,2025-01-22 17:13:10,,,,the 3000 series was a solid bump even with the wattage increase the 60ti was REALLY good even if the VRAM was lower than it should have been,m8jrl73,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8knm38,TheConnASSeur,,14,2025-01-22 17:50:36,,,,Traded my gtx 970 for an rtx 3060ti I was hoping for the same longevity It looks like Im going to get it but only because NVidia is out of its mind,m8kf94l,4.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8luoql,gramathy,,6,2025-01-22 21:02:25,,,,Ill give nvidia the smallest amount of credit DLSS upscaling is going to give those a longer lifespan than originally expected but its by accident because you can get away with 1080p levels of VRAM with DLSS to 1440p That doesnt make it perfect but it is going to be tolerable and will give it a year or two extra life,m8knm38,5.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8mjn4r,TheConnASSeur,,1,2025-01-22 23:00:18,,,,I just bought a new 1080p monitor I had that 970 for like 8 years I got really used to gaming at 720p 1080p looks incredible right now,m8luoql,6.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8l9sbn,Spobely,,8,2025-01-22 19:28:59,,,,how the fuck did you trade a GTX970 for a 3060ti Who would even accept that I have a 970,m8knm38,5.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8llx80,LegitosaurusRex,,11,2025-01-22 20:23:26,,,,Traded the 970 and 400 for it probably lol,m8l9sbn,6.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lnrm3,Spobely,,-1,2025-01-22 20:31:45,,,,That makes sense Did you do it through some vendor I wasnt sure what I was going to do with my current setup once I finally build a new one but shaving some money off a GPU interests me for obvious reasons,m8llx80,7.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8m3jtj,isairr,,2,2025-01-22 21:41:40,,,,It probably means he sold 970 and bought 3060ti,m8lnrm3,8.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8lg75m,komvidere,,7,2025-01-22 19:57:25,,,,My 3080 Ti raises the temperature in my office by abt 2 degrees celcius after gaming for a while Its nice in the winter though,m8jtx0p,4.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8m49o1,QuickQuirk,,3,2025-01-22 21:44:53,,,,no surprise Most space heaters are 8001000 watts With the 5090 any machine becomes a serviceable mainstream space heater thats stuck on in the summer,m8lg75m,5.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8k7wm7,GoldenBunip,,15,2025-01-22 16:39:55,,,,Those using the dumbass 110v system are going to need a dedicated cooker lines just to run a PC Those of us in civilisation have a gen or two more before a gaming machine eats our 3Kw limit on standard plugs,m8jtx0p,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8ka7vh,SpeedflyChris,,13,2025-01-22 16:50:23,,,,The US no,m8k9gtp,6.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8ke1l3,TheArmoredKitten,,19,2025-01-22 17:07:41,,,,Its 120110 to the neutral wire but the US is actually a 240v country We just use split leg power for domestic stuff since its technically safer You can get a NEMA 240 outlet run anywhere in your house and have it be up to code but its not something anybody does for a number of convenience reasons,m8ka7vh,7.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kh3sj,gramathy,,11,2025-01-22 17:21:31,,,,Downside would be youd have to run a new wire and thats expensive since youd likely need to pay an electrician to do it Next time I move Im probably going to want to spend some money making an actual server closet and Ill run 240 to that but most of the loads are probably still going to be 120,m8ke1l3,8.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8luzpi,RollSomeCoal,,1,2025-01-22 21:03:48,,,,You dont need new wire can just indicate the white is another black and have no neutral As far as size amps is amps dont exceed in breaker or outlet the amps of original,m8kh3sj,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8m93ad,TheArmoredKitten,,2,2025-01-22 22:06:58,,,,Youll have to swap the outlets over to the ones for 240 styled plugs too or youre gonna have a bad time,m8luzpi,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lxvf3,No-Bother6856,,1,2025-01-22 21:16:34,,,,Before going to 240 there are also 20amp outlets available for 120v in the US Admittedly I dont have one where my PC is but 20A instead of the standard 15A is an option,m8kh3sj,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8mpspt,GoldenBunip,,1,2025-01-22 23:33:01,,,,Thats still less power than a standard uk socket Our cookers are 45amps at 240v,m8lxvf3,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8n7ych,gramathy,,2,2025-01-23 01:08:12,,,,when you say cooker do you mean a stoveoven combo If we dont have gas we have high capacity runs for large appliances like that,m8mpspt,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8mw0xc,No-Bother6856,,1,2025-01-23 00:05:34,,,,Yes but it means there is more room to go before you have to start running 240v circuits to your PC,m8mpspt,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8n7tzr,gramathy,,1,2025-01-23 01:07:33,,,,Those would potentially require higher gauge wire to be up to code though,m8lxvf3,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8n9zpx,No-Bother6856,,1,2025-01-23 01:19:03,,,,They do I have a few 20A outlets in my house already though They have the advantage of working with everything the 15A 120v outlets work with meaning it wouldnt have to be just for a PC They are keyed so 20A devices cant plug into a 15A receptical but any 15A device can be plugged into a 20A receptical,m8n7tzr,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8ogof0,gramathy,,1,2025-01-23 05:39:04,,,,Yeah I think some of my runs are like that all my lighting is on 15A circuits but outlets are 15A outlets on 20A breakers,m8n9zpx,12.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8m9wj0,TheArmoredKitten,,1,2025-01-22 22:10:56,,,,You can run this stuff called armored cable through interior walls pretty quick especially if theres a clear drop to the basement or wherever your panel is Its not the cheapest stuff to buy but its way cheaper than an electrician Read the spec sheet correctly and check your work thoroughly but it might be easier than youd expect if youve got tools,m8kh3sj,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kpvm6,lowcrawler,,-4,2025-01-22 18:00:35,,,,No you dont you just need to connect the neutral to a different legfinger on your panel You can go from 120 to 240 on the physical wires though you likely have a lot of other junctions and receptacles on that circuit that make this impracticaldangerous unless you know exactly the electrical layout of your home To be clear Youd need to change your breaker panel setup ganged together breakers and you absolutely should not do this unless you know what you are doing and can do it according to code This reply was ONLY in response to the idea that youd have to run a new physical wire to go from 120 to 240,m8kh3sj,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lddq9,TheArmoredKitten,,4,2025-01-22 19:44:57,,,,Thats extremely against code and would also probably not work correctly 240 breakers are ganged together so that they still trip on a fault through neutral If you flip the leg on a 120 breaker youd almost certainly blow something up instantly Its also something you just cant do easily The breakers are mounted on bus bar which has alternating fingers Youd have to hack up your distribution panel to even start doing something so phenomenally dumb,m8kpvm6,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8m5283,TooStrangeForWeird,,1,2025-01-22 21:48:26,,,,When I installed a tankless water heater I put in a 240v breaker It has a positive neutral and ground If I swapped a 120v breaker for a 240v it would work fine on the same wiring as long as it was the same amp rating,m8lddq9,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lhskh,lowcrawler,,1,2025-01-22 20:04:34,,,,Oh Im not saying you wouldnt need to change the breakers Im just saying the same physical WIRE is used for 120 and for 240,m8lddq9,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8n8zwr,gramathy,,1,2025-01-23 01:13:45,,,,Most US installs dont have 11 outlet to breaker equivalence You do that and now your entire run of outlets potentially in multiple bedrooms is 240v unless as I said you add a specific run for your computer to plug in to,m8kpvm6,10.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8kfvph,gramathy,,8,2025-01-22 17:15:59,,,,that 120 can vary based on several factors 120 is what you get from the utility but that can change between your feed and the outlet and is really more like 100120 Devices need to be able to take a range of voltages,m8kae5v,8.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kqc6e,Still-Meaning3282,,-1,2025-01-22 18:02:41,,,,Yes It varies Not that much though I usually get 122124 volts in my house,m8kfvph,9.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8kds8p,tastyratz,,2,2025-01-22 17:06:29,,,,WHEW Im glad you were around to set the record straight That 10v might just make it work now Its STILL 110 or 120v depending on where you look Its also incredibly normal to see 125v and dips under 110v in practice on the US grid,m8kcevk,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kebax,Still-Meaning3282,,0,2025-01-22 17:08:55,,,,It is always 120 Volt 5 in the US It has been for a long time At least we are beating Japan that uses 100 volt,m8kds8p,11.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kdhp9,NickCharlesYT,,-3,2025-01-22 17:05:09,,,,Still laughably low My PC can pull a full kw easily between the components monitor and peripherals with just a mild overclock and I have a 4070Ti Super that pulls a maximum of 285w or so 5090 is going to pull 300w more That puts a standard 15A circuit at 13001400w JUST on the computer Never mind anything else plugged in to the same room like lights ceiling fan maybe a laptop charging in the corner etc NEC code states a maximum sustained load on a 15A circuit shouldnt exceed 1440W so were right there already without factoring in literally anything else on the circuit Ive already had to split out my PC to a separate circuit because thanks to modern code its somehow still permitted to allow one circuit to power multiple rooms Found that out the hard way when I tried to use the PS5 in the other room while my PC was rendering out a video and my 3D printer was running coincidentally about a 300w average load for that printer so I could in theory do the same with a 5090 and a PS5 in two different rooms Yep had an electrician out ASAP to quote for dedicated 20A circuits hopefully will be in the budget this year,m8kae5v,8.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kgcmn,gramathy,,14,2025-01-22 17:18:05,,,,1000w 285w 715w for CPU what exactly No consumer computer that i know of will get anywhere near that Even an overlocked intel cpu and a 600w GPU is still going to just barely tip 1000w sustained My 5900x at full chat doing transcoding is only about 300w paired with a 7900xtx and its no slouch theres no fucking way your computer pulls a kilowatt unless its an actual server build that pulls 150w just for fans to keep the other 800w loads cool,m8kdhp9,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kv7vd,hellowiththepudding,,2,2025-01-22 18:24:31,,,,OP well i have a 1000watt power supply,m8kgcmn,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kwai6,NickCharlesYT,,-2,2025-01-22 18:29:14,,,,I can tell you its 1kw because thats the value at which my connected UPS goes into overload and starts beeping at me to reduce the load or it cuts power 850w is when the fan kicks on and it does so often when rendering So yeah 1kw is absolutely possible and has happened I have to turn a monitor or two off when doing a video render just to be safe So lets break it down GPU is rated for 285w that doesnt mean its what it pulls at maximum Mine is overclocked with a factory power limit closer to 300w and I can push it 10 beyond that still with MSI afterburner so lets call it 330w CPU is an overclocked 14900K I believe its a 55GHz all core with 43 on the E cores and 55 on P cores Pulls 310w or so and can saturate my LFII AIO easily if Im not careful to set 100 fans before I start a long encode or render So thats about 640w right there Ive got two additional PCI cards hard to say what they pull but PCI spec allows for up to 75W per slot Id guess 2030w there between my capture card sound card and 10gb network card Lets call it 110w for the motherboard cooler fans and other peripherals because the PC itself idles at around 135w or so at the plug with the PCI cards not in use Monitors Im looking at my energy monitor for them now My ultrawide is currently pulling 58w at 70 brightness with RGB lights on and my 4K secondary OLED monitor pulls anywhere between 40 and 70w depending on whats on the screen at 60 brightness and RGB on but these are without HDR or high color accurate modes I usually use when not gaming so that may be a little higher still especially with peak brightness levels turned up in the OSD for those modes Third monitor is a Cintiq 16 touch display which has a 30w power adapter Audio mixer pulls 15w powered studio speakers pull 20w each KVM pulls 5 or so and I have an external USB hub that can pull up to 100w but I have no idea how much its actually using Still add all those values up and you get 998w before the USB hub and before any other peripherals directly connected to the PC Oh and I have a MBP plugged in as well so there could be up to 100w going to that to charge it as well or 30100w in active use charging Over 1KW yes its happened Happened even easier when I had a 3090 instead of my 4070Ti S I dont know what to tell you Im clearly a power user _ツ_,m8kgcmn,10.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8ltups,gramathy,,2,2025-01-22 20:58:42,,,,Ill definitely believe that power spikes with the 3090 would do it especially with the 450w profile and yeah the whole system including peripherals can get around 1kw depending but thats not just the PC which is what it sounded like you were describing,m8kwai6,11.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jyyr3,elite_haxor1337,,12,2025-01-22 15:58:18,,,,your pc actually works just as efficiently as your spaceheater Its extremely efficient at converting electricity into heat Like greater than 99,m8jy76w,7.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8k0hdp,z3speed4me,,4,2025-01-22 16:05:21,,,,I literally have closed the vent to my office bc when the desktop is on in winter I sure do not need the heat running in that room,m8jyyr3,8.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8kaq0v,SpeedflyChris,,3,2025-01-22 16:52:39,,,,Like greater than 99 Should be 100 regardless of the device all of the other forms of energy it creates will become heat,m8jyyr3,8.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8ladih,smootex,,1,2025-01-22 19:31:35,,,,That would be my understanding as well All the energy eventually gets converted to heat just like an electric space heater Doesnt mean its just as cost efficient to heat with your gaming rig many households have gas furnaces for their central heating and depending on where you live that gas is likely to be cheaper than electric BTU to BTU but efficiency wise its 100,m8kaq0v,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kynwv,OsmeOxys,,3,2025-01-22 18:39:43,,,,Overly long fun nerd fact Not 99 but well and truly 100 Well Depending on how many external factors you account for all of which are perfectly valid to include or exclude depending on the discussion So youre not wrong about being 99whatever either Im guessing you already know the general idea at the very least but Im a big old nerd about anything electrical so here I go You can think of heat is the final form of energy and efficiency as the measurement of desired work done before that energy inevitably becomes heat If your desired work is to create heat xx is always going to equal 1 Friction is heat light and sound being absorbed is heat chemical decomposition is heat even something snapping in half is heat If it consumes energy it is 100 efficient at generating heat 1000w of electricity in exactly 1000w of heat out theres a delay with lightemf and sound being converted to heat but inevitably The complicated part of heating efficiency is the external losses The system as a whole is still turning 100 of energy into heat but not necessarily where we want it As a fitting example the light from your monitor shining through your window is still going to create heat but its warming up the trees instead of you Overall heat lost in generation and transmission can easily drop the usefultous efficiency to below 50 which is why gas furnaces are significantly more efficient which doesnt account for clean and cheap renewable energy sources than electric heaters With the exception of heat pumps but I think Ive rambled enough,m8jyyr3,8.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8l6szb,elite_haxor1337,,2,2025-01-22 19:15:44,,,,great points Thanks for your comment Youre right that I know the basics they covered heat at some point during Thermodynamics hehe But I appreciate the correction because I hadnt considered that while some energy is used to produce light sound bluetoothwifi signals all of that will become heat as those waves attenuate Such a cool topic Now the only thing Im still wondering about is what about the signals your ethernet cable is carrying from your PC Surely that requires some energy and isnt converted to heat,m8kynwv,9.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lm2f0,OsmeOxys,,2,2025-01-22 20:24:04,,,,Still heat Theres still current flowing so resistance does its thing and theres still emf and attenuation just like with wireless signals Thats your loss while the work is switching the transistorsmosfetsoptocouplersetc at the end Signals like Ethernet not being considered as power is a weird thing that gets taught presumably because its so insignificant in most applications that its easier to ignore it and just cover it all with a cable length rating Once you get into the nitty gritty of it however like electrical design it can become a huge deal read pain in the ass,m8l6szb,10.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jgsd4,thedsider,,68,2025-01-22 14:29:31,,,,It made sense Their point is that there is no significant improvement this generation A 30 increase in performance was achieved by increasing the CUDA count by 30 and the power consumption by 30 The technology didnt get any more efficient it just got scaled up Those percentages are indicative I cant remember exactly what they were but it was around 30 from memory,m8jfxin,3.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jnan2,-Dixieflatline,,4,2025-01-22 15:03:00,,,,In pure numbers it isnt all that compelling of a generational change However it is interesting that they got 30 more CUDA cores into a 2 slot card though Kind of makes me wonder if they could get close to 4090 performance in a single slot card with that CUDA density,m8jgsd4,4.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jo0qc,V1pArzZz,,2,2025-01-22 15:06:36,,,,Slot size is just cooler size you can easily make a 1 slot 4090 or 5090 with a watercooler and radiator Air cooler to dissipate 600W 1 slot will be very hard already 2 slot is impressive,m8jnan2,5.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8julib,pederbonde,,-13,2025-01-22 15:38:06,,,,I dont get the frame generation and dlss hate Regular dlss set to quality is youst fps gain without losing anything And frame generation will make a game look smooth but you will have the latency of the real fps But you dont lose anything here either,m8jcvgx,1.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jvisu,OvenCrate,,48,2025-01-22 15:42:23,,,,Youll actually have more latency than the real frame rate because frame gen needs the next real frame to interpolate so your display is always lagging behind by 1 real frame time And DLSS Quality is nice but it isnt the game changer its touted to be If all that AI silicon was just allocated to more raster compute units wed have similar frame rates without upscaling tricks,m8julib,2.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8k6gzb,BassGaming,,12,2025-01-22 16:33:17,,,,Frame generation should only be used if you cant run the games otherwise due to input lag as the person before mentioned Concerning your last point yeah I agree Some games with very slow gameplay and beautiful graphics are good with DLSS If you have fast paced games you get upscaling smudge back though Even on quality you can see some blurryness and ghosting One great example is racing games Yes I do upscale those as well due to having no choice but I wish I didnt have to,m8jwdld,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8o3lb5,RRR3000,,1,2025-01-23 04:06:54,,,,They kinda fix that latency issue with Reflex 2 though at least on paper Will be very interesting to see how well that ends up working in practice when the reviews start to come out I kinda doubt itll matter much to the average person anyways When seriously playing competitive online shooters it may matter but thats only a fraction of games And most who are serious about it tend to play lowest settings for highest fps anyways In the bigger picture though its a difference of mere ms In most singleplayer and a good chunk of multiplayer games not a big deal Just look at how many use wireless input devices nowadays despite relatively more latency than wired All consoles come with wireless controllers and a good chunk of PC mice are too now Yet people are fine with those because a few ms is negligible,m8jvisu,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8p189q,OvenCrate,,1,2025-01-23 08:48:55,,,,Wireless mice that use a proprietary radio protocol so not Bluetooth can have identical latency to wired mice Especially the ones designed for gaming eg Logitechs G series that uses their Lightspeed radio protocol The USB HID polling rate of 1 kHz reads the cursor position every millisecond and the actual read operation completes much faster than that The input lag added by the radio communication between the mouse and the USB dongle is less than 1 ms The frame gen lag is also more than just a few ms in most cases If the rendering runs at 30 fps which the frame gen tech boosts to 60 then each frame takes 33 ms to render So the 60 fps with frame gen has at least 33 ms more input lag than the native 30 fps probably a bit more because the AI calculations themselves also take time Thats comparable to the latency of streaming over the internet with GeForce Now if you live close enough to the data center Realistically if you dont mind that much latency you should just get GeForce Now Ultimate for 10 years for the same amount of money that buying your own RTX 5090 would cost you,m8o3lb5,4.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jxtpm,z3speed4me,,5,2025-01-22 15:53:01,,,,Frame gen is great for high demand visually complex engines 99 if people will never be able to tell the difference visually However some games that frame interpretation and assumption to fill the gaps are not preferred if playing online when other variables are introduced for a network latency perspective I dont want even more things screwing with what Im actually seeing Anyway my point is yes DSSL is cool but the prior gen could probably come super close to where these cards are if they simply were able to enable to same features and tools I simply want to see how much better the actual hardware itself is,m8julib,2.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jykq2,pederbonde,,3,2025-01-22 15:56:30,,,,Yea makes sense and there seems to be the same numbers of cuda cores on 4080 as on 5080 if the rumors is correct so the improvment is probably in ai But 5090 has the dubble amount of cuda cores so it will be interesting to see the reviews on it,m8jxtpm,3.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jwqyy,secretagentstv,,4,2025-01-22 15:48:04,,,,DLSS does not look as good as native rendering Frame generation introduces artifacts and ghosting Frame generation increases latency of the base frame rate So 60 FPS with FG to 120 feels like 30 FPS FG feels laggy at anything under 80 FPS Thats why I only use FG when I am already getting high FPS Adding 3 frames per rendered frame means you are playing less than 13 the latency of the actual frame rate,m8julib,2.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jyvnt,secretagentstv,,4,2025-01-22 15:57:54,,,,You can use FSR frame generation in quite a few games There are some games you can use FSR FG and DLSS upscaling I play cyberpunk with everything on highultra 1440p native with frame gen and get 140180 fps I can turn off the frame gen and turn on FSR upscaling and the higher fps from FSR feels smoother Frame generation makes it look smoother But there are some issues with using either technologies Edit a word,m8jxthv,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8kcige,kevihaa,,4,2025-01-22 17:00:40,,,,Part of this is Nvidias fault 5070 4090 but general perception is also an issue Too many people are looking at DLSS Frame Gen as allornone rather than just another tool to hit a target frame rate Like its fundamentally no different from deciding between LowMediumHigh textures and deciding within the constraints of the hardware you have where you want to be when it comes to visuals vs FPS Its reductive to say DLSS Frame Gen are free frames but to me at least the loss in fidelity from using AI upscaling is way less than the loss from needing to lower texture settings,m8julib,2.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kellu,pederbonde,,0,2025-01-22 17:10:13,,,,Yea agree 5070 4090 was quite stupid Yea i dont see any difference with or without dlss on quality so i consider them free But it could be my cheap screen that already have to of ghosting making it so i dont se any difference Raw performance is of course better But in the past its have been almost the same price between amd and Nvidia And amds ai upscaling have been far behind I would have bought more amd cards if the price where better we have 4 pcs in our family 2 Nvidia 1 amd and 1 Intel,m8kcige,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8kj44x,Dangthing,,0,2025-01-22 17:30:31,,,,I dont think we should talk about DLSS and Frame Gen as if they are remotely similar DLSS degrades image quality for direct FPS gain in a nonlinear fashion Quality vs Performance but Frame Gen degrades performance for FAKE performance While supposedly the new frame gen is better than old ones it has had the latency of the normal frame rate while giving the higher number So essentially if you had 30 FPS and used Frame Gen to get 60 FPS you would still FEEL like you were playing 30 There is also a hit to visuals Your ability to see frame rate is fairly limited and this becomes dramatically more apparent at higher FPS BUT you can feel the differences in response very easily,m8kcige,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jwswm,OramaBuffin,,1,2025-01-22 15:48:19,,,,If you generally play things that arent AAA DLSS is often not an option at all Or if it is you get 20 at best So frame gen literally does not function as a selling point for that kind of gamer,m8julib,2.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8l6j8y,loconessmonster,,5,2025-01-22 19:14:33,,,,To add do your comments running on ultra settings is not a requirement Honestly running on a mix of medium and high settings is what most people should do The consoles dont run games on ultra either If you want to build a budget system you still can with the expectation that youre not maxing out all the settings Id say you can still build a decent comparable console system for around 600700 allin,m8jroqy,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lohd1,Psychast,,3,2025-01-22 20:34:58,,,,Its all relative to where youre at in life as a broke teenearly 20s putting together a 600 rig that ran stuff at 1080p was all I could manage and I was very proud of it hitting anywhere over 60fps was good enough Getting the absolute best value for your money was the aim of the game But you get older get better paying jobs and have the good fortune to afford nice things every few years or so Then it becomes less about value and more about style and power even at a premium cost I built my dream rig a couple years ago huge full tower case 4090 i713700 DDR5 ram NVME SSD man all the works 4k gaming on a big nice 4k screen its really great Im set for years and years Im just as proud of it as I am of my first rig I dont need justify jack shit value is simply not my primary factor anymore Its a luxury item afterall even at 600 it was a luxury item for teen me its a luxury item now at 3k why are we pocket watching,m8jroqy,3.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8lufyt,Gahvynn,,1,2025-01-22 21:01:20,,,,I agree with your assessment completely But I dont think an entire sub transitioned from loving super cheap rigs to being able to afford nicer things I think its just the fact you used to be able to get a 1080P capable card and system for 5600 and now the standard is either 1440P or 4K and a 12k GPU Plus the rest of the system,m8lohd1,4.0,1i7bei0
comment,m8jwy98,OvenCrate,,-1,2025-01-22 15:49:00,,,,PC building was never about price efficiency Prebuilt units are often better deals than getting all the components and DIYing it Consoles will always be more bang for the buck because theyre purposebuilt at scale for just gaming and to top it off manufacturers sell them at a loss that they then recoup in game sale fees later thanks to their lockeddown platforms granting them a monopoly on game distribution Its a hobby and hobbies have costs As a broke college student I had to make do with the LEGO experience of putting everything together and installing Windows Now that I have more disposable income Ill spend the price of a console on just watercooling components not because it makes the games play better but because I love to tinker with my system,m8jroqy,3.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8m5yzo,Sethithy,,1,2025-01-22 21:52:32,,,,That prebuilts are cheaper thing only came about recently with the scarcity of hardware postpandemic Consoles are more bang for your buck if all do is play games If you want to game AND do other work then getting a PC capable of gaming is usually a better bang for your buck as opposed to getting both a pc and a console,m8jwy98,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jv1kf,CoreParad0x,,3,2025-01-22 15:40:09,,,,Yeah as someone who has liked both channels its becoming increasingly harder to side with Steve over this stuff And the sad thing is he could have just left well enough alone His 2 minute comment on LTT in the Honey video literally added nothing to overall content and was frankly even kind of awkward even when I just first watched it without all this extra drama I personally wont unsub to him I still think his hardware benchmarks are worth watching Thats what theyve been great at Unfortunately I dont know how much Ill watch their investigations channel because this really undermines the quality of the rest of that work,m8jsgn3,5.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8k06tw,Dt2_0,,12,2025-01-22 16:03:59,,,,Gamers Nexus fired another attack at Linus Tech Tips over the Honey drama taking Linus completely out of context For reference Linus and other creators likely including Steve knew about Honeys Affiliate scrubbing several years ago Linus chose not to make a video due to other creators having covered that issue and it not affecting consumers at all To him it would have sounded like Stop using Honey it cuts into my pocket book when you do What Linus did not know about at the time was that Honey had specific agreements with websites not to give the best codes to consumers Now that the information is out Gamers Nexus put out a video where they stated they joined a lawsuit against Honey and attacked LTT for not doing the same years ago ignoring the very important context above This along with the attack video in Summer 2023 where much of what Gamers Nexus brought to the table was completely unfounded or missing context has finally had Linus say Ok that is enough On WAN show last week Linus had a scripted statement that very clearly had been reviewed by LTTs legal team saying This unprofessional and unethical behavior stops now Either bring receipts or stop attacking me along with a well worded Or Else This affects Linuss brand and the company that employs well over 100 people and much of what has been thrown by GN is either found not true or misrepresented setting an actually fairly strong case for a Libel suit During that segment of the WAN Linus personally extended an Olive Branch asking for their relationship to go back to how it was a few years ago remember Steve was one of the people invited to the Linus Roast They were at least from LTTs perspective on friendly terms Gamers Nexus responded by posting their receipts much of which either does not or only arguably supports their claims Some of which make Steve seem immature himself It is very important to note that if this continues the ultimate action is probably out of Linus hands He is not the CEO of Linus Tech Tips and ultimately legal decisions like this are the CEOs call Needless to say Gamers Nexus which appeared to be greatly unbiased has in the last week or so dug themselves a hole that has tarnished their reputation as reliable sources of data and industry news and investigations Speculation is that Steve has a personal beef with Linus or he is very concerned by competition from LTT Labs moving LTT into his wheelhouse These are unconfirmed so take them with a grain of salt Sources Gamers Nexus 2023 video on Linus Tech Tips Dr Ian Cutresss break down of the 2023 situation highlighting unethical journalistic practices by Gamers Nexus Gamers Nexus Honey video The Scripted Portion of last weeks WAN Show Gamers Nexus response to the WAN Show,m8jqsog,4.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8jh9pc,kentonj,,4,2025-01-22 14:32:07,,,,No thats what you expect when chip fabrication allows for node sizes to be substantially smaller one generation to the next which happened with the 40 series for the first time since the 10 series Expecting meaningful reductions in the sizes of nodes every generation to accommodate perwat performance gains is wild Especially when were going to have to start measuring by fractions of nanometers soon if the trend of chip size efficiency even continues Its not a generational expectation for example the 20 series and the 30 series,m8jbr6o,3.0,1i7bei0

comment,m8omb37,juleztb,,1,2025-01-23 06:24:57,,,,Thats why I wrote the 1nm process because thats what its called Thats not the real size true The problem doesnt start at 1nm but at the sizes of the 1nm process So no there isnt much room left 3D chips are a possibility yes But this comes with a very big caveat Staying at the same size but going into the 3rd dimension means the same as just making the chip bigger in 2D it will just need more power So a GPU that draws 500W with a 2D chip will draw 1000W if the chip has one additional layer in the 3rd dimension Oversimplified of course That also means that the heat that has to be dissipated increases And with every layer this gets more difficult because the cooling contact isnt directly on the surface anymore but n layers above Not saying 3D isnt a thing It probably will But its not the same as miniaturizing the structures sadly By far,m8nn1j2,8.0,1i7bei0
