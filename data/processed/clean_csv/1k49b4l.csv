comment,mo93cax,suffaluffapussycat,,46,2025-04-21 13:19:14,,,,These are used by people who buy and sell usedvintage vinyl so you can listen before you buy You cant always see if vinyl is damaged sometimes you have to listen Used record stores dont always have turntables and if they do theres usually a wait,mo8clt4,1.0,1k49b4l

comment,moe6k7u,sirentropy42,,4,2025-04-22 07:13:21,,,,I have to disagree Record damage presents in a number of ways but none of them are hampered in any way by having low quality equipment Pops are still pops warps are still warps and even skips rely more on the stylus than the turntable Anything which would be imperceptible on this device but perceptible with higher quality equipment I would 100 attribute to production and pressing which isnt damage,mobtbye,3.0,1k49b4l

comment,mo9eik3,boomerxl,,3,2025-04-21 14:22:28,,,,So the record starts 15 seconds later than normal and any skips that do occur are still recorded into the buffer Vinyl doesnt store audio in repeatable checkable discreet units Theres no read ahead Its a sound wave imprinted on a platter Only the information directly under the needle is being read and the needle is guided by the groove its reading,mo99ohr,2.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo977c1,SkaBonez,,0,2025-04-21 13:42:16,,,,I imagine this is trying to sell to the market of people who own vinyls but dont own a player Something you can break out and put on a table then put away after youre done so you dont have to have a dedicated setup taking up space or to bring to your other friends who also are in the same situation But that also isnt a new concept,mo8chtc,1.0,1k49b4l

comment,mo9gmt0,ChaZcaTriX,,4,2025-04-21 14:33:25,,,,Bottleneck is the bluetooth compression Depending on hardware proximity of other wireless devices and things like weather and clothing it can go down from average modern stream to MP3 quality Its a protocol originally designed for wireless sensors not audio its slowly getting better but its still very severe compression delays and various design crutches,mo8zwcq,2.0,1k49b4l

comment,mo9e735,rudimentary-north,,5,2025-04-21 14:20:51,,,,Digital to Analog Conversion and audio file compression are two very different issues In this case the DAC is receiving an analog signal which is always going to be better fidelity than a compressed digital file and SpotifyYoutube doesnt do lossless streaming Services like Tidal or Apple Music where you can actually stream lossless audio should be virtually identical The real loss of fidelity here is the Bluetooth transmission,mo8zwcq,2.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo9kjf3,nick1812216,,1,2025-04-21 14:53:17,,,,Wow fascinating How Does bluetooth impact the fidelity Wont it just stream whatever raw audio data the DAC tells it to send And what are your views on tube amplifiers btw,mo9e735,3.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo9luv4,rudimentary-north,,3,2025-04-21 14:59:52,,,,Bluetooth encodes to a lossy format before transmission There are a number of different codecs some of which are close to lossless but only supported on a handful of specific hardwares I like tube amps for guitar playing I cant be bothered with them for listening seems weird to me to intentionally color the signal more than my speakers and room already do,mo9kjf3,4.0,1k49b4l

comment,mo8xlll,fullload93,,3,2025-04-21 12:42:57,,,,Just another Sound Burger but I fail to see the point of any of these portable devices The only time I see it useful is if you are going to a record shop and the shop allows you to demo listen to the records before buying it But even then a proper record shop usually is going to have a player set up and ready to go for demo anyways,,0.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo92ctw,n-harmonics,,2,2025-04-21 13:13:15,,,,Can you imagine someone wanting a portable record player to take on a vacation where they might go shopping Or taking it out to the patio for a bbq Or setting it up in another part of the house so you have music while you work Your single use case is short about a dozen use cases,mo8xlll,1.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo95bpb,fullload93,,2,2025-04-21 13:31:09,,,,What you just described is a vinyl snob and it sounds ridiculous If Im having a party or inviting people over for a bbq that last thing on my mind is whipping out my record player Its not 1960 where that was the only option vast majority of people would be perfectly fine with playing music from a Bluetooth speaker and phone,mo92ctw,2.0,1k49b4l
comment,mo9anbt,n-harmonics,,1,2025-04-21 14:01:41,,,,To think that someone wanting records on the patio or vacation is a ridiculous snob is your opinion and you are entitled to be as demeaning as you want to people with interests that differ from yours Im just pointing out that people have found more than just the one use case you claimed even if you have disdain for those people,mo95bpb,3.0,1k49b4l

comment,mo9cokm,n-harmonics,,1,2025-04-21 14:12:49,,,,I can tell you as a sound burger owner my favorite way to use it are to bring it on vacation and set it up in the room so that when I go record shopping we can listen to our new finds back at the hotel Also its nice to be able to quickly and easily set it up in the patio garage or basement or wfh office if you have something on record you want to listen to while you do something else,mo8qfhl,1.0,1k49b4l
