comment,n5zyfep,Then-Simple-9788,,14,2025-07-30 15:54:23,,,,Its just cabling for compute and display Realistically the final product will either be selfcontained with some added bulk on the glasses themselves or tethered via a single cable to a dedicated power source and processor Its a prototype of course it looks rough You shouldve seen the original Oculus prototype before Facebook got involved It was literally ducttaped together Even the early Valve Index units had circuit boards glued to the front That said with the rapid progress in transparent and flexible displays were not far off from truly functional ARVR glasses that dont come with all this bulk,n5zpo1j,1.0,1md8z76

comment,n62k6t6,Then-Simple-9788,,5,2025-07-30 23:24:04,,,,You are comparing apples to oranges with that one The Vision Pro is a completely closed source device At least every other device allows you to hook directly into a PC so that you can use its processing power the Meta quest three included Youll get no argument from me that the Vision Pro is an overhyped overpriced under utilized piece of technology However I wont deny that by Apple introducing themselves into the market it opened up various avenues to parts production as well as quality assurance for a lot of components that are used in the broader market,n628516,3.0,1md8z76

comment,n618no5,Scheeseman99,,2,2025-07-30 19:28:27,,,,I dont particularly want Metas AR glasses but I like the idea of them conceptually heres hoping they dont end up with a total monopoly on key parts of the tech But AR glasses need to hit 90 FOV before theyre useful and these dont even hit half that So thats another swing and a miss,,0.0,1md8z76
comment,n61agjd,DarthBuzzard,,6,2025-07-30 19:37:13,,,,These are a display prototype for VR not AR Although it could be made to do AR too via passthrough cameras,n618no5,1.0,1md8z76

comment,n65gona,TrailsGuy,,1,2025-07-31 12:12:09,,,,I dont want an argument either but your point is mistaken since the BSB is a display only and includes none of the tech or the battery to make an XR device This isnt about proving you wrong and gaining an internet point I just didnt want to encourage readers to consider the BSB to be an allinone XR device,n63pix0,3.0,1md8z76
