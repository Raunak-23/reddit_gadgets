comment,n5ig80z,NotAPreppie,,10,2025-07-27 22:36:28,,,,There was a time you could sort of do that Early memory management schemes in Windows and Mac OS were pretty bad A company called Connectix made a product that replaced the memory management systems that actually increased the amount of usable memory and it really did work Also often made computers a bit faster,n5hqmh8,3.0,1malq7f

comment,n5m7n19,DespairTraveler,,1,2025-07-28 14:44:14,,,,I am really sad how people are shitting on Unreal Engine because of the bad devs nowadays UE is amazing engine capable of great optimization And its also incredibly beginner friendly with tons of stuff out of the box compared to say Unity which is barebones without buying ton of modules from market The only reason Unity games dont stutter because there is nothing there But lazy devs dont optimize their gameswhich is rather easy untill you want to optimize to the limit so your game can run on mobiles and such either because they are bad devs or their managers decide that optimizations is not important better push release faster and grab some money And UE gets a bad rep because of them,n5fwsx0,2.0,1malq7f

comment,n5qdday,Surviving2021,,1,2025-07-29 03:32:41,,,,I watched a thing that talked about how unreal 5 has a ton of features that are defaulted on that tank performance even if you dont use them Devs keep using it so they can get epic money and good support but dont fully understand it because they dont have proper training on what all the features do I wouldnt say most devs want to be lazy or push bad products they likely are over worked underpaid and at the mercy of someone higher up making decisions without knowing how to do the work of people below them One thing they could easily do though is ship games with low res textures so they still work on 8GB graphics cards and offer a high res texture pack for free as DLC But thats just a bandaid to a much bigger problem,n5fkbab,1.0,1malq7f
comment,n5i6oi7,Fredasa,,-6,2025-07-27 21:43:47,,,,Such a weird sentiment I for one am happy to see doors potentially open so that games worth their salt can offer higher texture detail and have it potentially matter to more than a few thousand people A phenomenon that will trickle down to the majority more quickly than if the VRAM ceiling remains stagnant Its bonkers that I even have to elaborate any of this,n5fkbab,1.0,1malq7f

comment,n5gngrk,BassGaming,,6,2025-07-27 17:05:52,,,,Meanwhile other GPUs from AMD and Intel will have more but people wont buy them You say that but the current lineup of AMD cards all have 16gb and that is honestly baffling I just cant understand why theyre not releasing new 24 or even 32gb cards Even when talking about Ai theres now a compatibility layer called zuda IIRC for cuda which allows for cuda applications to run on amd cards I just cant understand why they didnt already release cards with more vram,n5fr728,1.0,1malq7f

comment,n5npst6,theboned1,,1,2025-07-28 18:57:20,,,,Why are those the same bus speeds weve had for 20 years Is it really hard to increase bus speed or is there no benefit certainly seems like faster would be better,,0.0,1malq7f
comment,n5ffx7q,lordraiden007,,2,2025-07-27 13:20:33,,,,Cool Now wheres a lower end card thats not immediately out of date and irrelevant due to low VRAM Surprised NVIDIA hasnt tried to make a 16bit bus on their xx50 series just to see if their bootlicking fans will eat it up,,0.0,1malq7f
comment,n5fkvxw,stellvia2016,,12,2025-07-27 13:49:33,,,,9060XT is around 300usd and performs about like a 3080 and has 16gb,n5ffx7q,1.0,1malq7f
comment,n5fv2se,Agomir,,10,2025-07-27 14:44:43,,,,This is a great suggestion Though thats the price for the 8GB version You can find the 16GB starting at around 370 US and thats 420 in Europe Still considering how much the prices have gone up thats not bad,n5fkvxw,2.0,1malq7f
comment,n5fxp9i,stellvia2016,,1,2025-07-27 14:58:26,,,,Otherwise they could take their chances on a used 3080 Only issue there as well is the higher power reqs so if you dont have at least a 750W psu go with the 9060XT instead,n5fv2se,3.0,1malq7f
comment,n5gh5p6,mywik,,1,2025-07-27 16:35:18,,,,Cheapest 9060xt 16gb in germany is 370 euro right now But jeah definitely not 300,n5fv2se,3.0,1malq7f

comment,n5hi0fu,stellvia2016,,1,2025-07-27 19:36:49,,,,tbf he said lower end not lowend That said youre still not getting even a lowend card for less than 250 new these days Definitely worth looking into some used cards though to get more bang for your buck eg 3080 used are less than a 4060 Or you can pick up Arc B570 for around 280 And Nvidia just launched the 5050 which the lowest end versions are 250,n5gpawd,3.0,1malq7f
comment,n5fxi3r,zarafff69,,1,2025-07-27 14:57:25,,,,It should be a good card but somehow in my country AMD GPUs have been going for much more than MSRP while the 50 series is actually below MSRP right now Aka it depends on the price,n5ffx7q,1.0,1malq7f
