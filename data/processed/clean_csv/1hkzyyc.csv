comment,m3jgsrx,TheRealSectimus,,3,2024-12-24 03:16:59,,,,As usual nobody reads the article It lasts for twoish days on one charge and is supposed to be very quiet 30dB much quieter and much longer lasting than compared to the market average Also fans generate heat and dont actually cool anything down evaporation of sweat is what makes it work I would expect that youd need a custom helmet to do this right perhaps one with some gaps for airflow also Ever used a fully covering bike helmet on a hot day Ever used one of those sporty bike helmets with the gaps in them See my point,,0.0,1hkzyyc
