comment,n37o4wy,speculatrix,,12,2025-07-15 05:36:08,,,,Canon have always segmented their market and deliberately made any non35mmsensor cameras badly inferior to their full sized bodies They didnt seem to realise that theres a lot of people who want compact bodies that are packed with cutting edge features Hence OMD and the OM1 unit with the micro four thirds sensor Or to some extent Sony and the A6700 with APSc sensor,n37c6pz,1.0,1m04rmo
comment,n40mv7i,Griffdude13,,2,2025-07-19 16:18:53,,,,I LOVE my A6700 Overheating issues aside happens far less as long as you fold the screen out from the body it punches way above what its 1400 price tag suggests,n37o4wy,2.0,1m04rmo
comment,n40w1zx,speculatrix,,2,2025-07-19 17:06:49,,,,Ive been very impressed with the technical capabilities of my a6700 Not such a fan of the user interface Edit fixed autocorrect user interface,n40mv7i,3.0,1m04rmo
comment,n40webl,Griffdude13,,1,2025-07-19 17:08:31,,,,I will say that Canon has a much easier menu to navigate on their devices Sonys still leaves a lot to be desired That being said its still better than what it used to be The old menus from previous generations was one of the most infuriating things to navigate,n40w1zx,4.0,1m04rmo
comment,n45cot8,speculatrix,,1,2025-07-20 11:17:24,,,,Really My main camera is a Lumix and I found it quite intuitive I cant believe Sony cameras used to be worse I guess if you only ever used Sony youd become familiar and never think there was anything wrong,n40webl,5.0,1m04rmo
comment,n37rorx,dearpisa,,3,2025-07-15 06:06:40,,,,Theyre only primarily fullframe manufacturers who have a dual card slot APSC body with IBIS Canon R7 Sony and Nikon dont have such a body at all Panasonic has M43 pro bodies and Fujifilm is primary APSC to begin with Or in short they have the best APSC body amongst the fullframe brands,n37o4wy,2.0,1m04rmo
comment,n3abhh4,runandgum,,2,2025-07-15 16:26:06,,,,Sonys FX30 has dual card slots and IBIS Although it lacks a mechanical shutter if some photographers need this,n37rorx,3.0,1m04rmo
comment,n3amg64,dearpisa,,1,2025-07-15 17:15:36,,,,Right I know nothing about the cinema bodies but theyre probably not comparable anyway shutter and much higher price and probably not enough advanced photography features,n3abhh4,4.0,1m04rmo
