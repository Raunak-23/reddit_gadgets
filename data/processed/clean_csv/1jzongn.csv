comment,mna8b74,Ohyo_Ohyo_Ohyo_Ohyo,,1,2025-04-15 19:18:33,,,,Yeah replacing caps lock with escape when tapped and control when held turns it from one of the least used keys to one of the most used modifier keys for me so having no control or escape wouldnt bother me one bit Of course this particular keyboard also doesnt have a commandwindowssuper key optionaltmeta key or a backticktilde key so I would have to get a bit creative if I were to use this as a daily driver Maybe changing space to command when held and pressed with another key and using that square key below enter as option,mn804bb,2.0,1jzongn

comment,mnb2sgq,Kills_Alone,,5,2025-04-15 21:52:33,,,,What a lame article it repeats how the keyboard is missing an escape key over and over and over sevens times its mentioned then at the bottom of the page is a link to an article about a keyboard with nothing but escape buttons The only potential usage scenario I can see is in a public location such as a library where they dont want people being able to circumvent any security,,0.0,1jzongn
