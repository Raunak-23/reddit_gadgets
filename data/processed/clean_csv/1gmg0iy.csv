comment,lw6zjdq,Nothing-Casual,,3,2024-11-09 03:11:33,,,,The answer is possibly yes but the real answer is nobody knows The US is so deeply entrenched in global trade and finance that anything that affects the US affects the world and viceversa of course The US has tons of treaties with tons of different nations and trading blocs and traditional US allies may join the US in tariffing certain industriescountries Countries may join the US purely to show solidarity as allies or because they agree with some reasons for the tariffs see Chinese EVs If your country decides to join in the tariff wars then yes your prices will definitely go up This alone means that the answer is extremely convoluted but its made even more uninterpretable by the fact that Trump 2024 is an unprecedented and historic fuck up by the US and US allies are realizing now more than ever that the US isnt a reliable ally This will force countries to heavily review themselves and will almost certainly force more spending as other nations realize that global peace is much further from guaranteed than they thought If I had to guess Id say that the next 1020 years will be significantly more expensive for everybody to buy almost everything beyond just regular inflation That said I also think that the biggest reason PC parts skyrocketed is because of COVID causing a MASSIVE shortage and because of cryptocurrency going absolutely bananas and everyone buying parts to mine crypto I dont think either of these two things will happen again in the near future so maybe PC parts will remain reasonably priced I guess theres also corporate greed to consider They could just raise prices because theyre assholes There are very few major competitors making PC parts so were also at their whim If the market will bear and still consume elevated prices within the US perhaps the same will be true without the US,lw65eh2,3.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw73ojj,Dramatic_Explosion,,11,2024-11-09 03:39:41,,,,Your crucial gap in understanding that protesting low wages often means making no wages and people out there need wages to pay for housing and food This disproportionately effects people who get out of prison and people who had to drop out of higher education to take care of their kids Its why so many things like insurance are tied to your job if you protest unfair practices like low wages you can lose _everything_ There are few to no social programs to get you out of the poverty cycle once youre in it youre usually stuck I do appreciate your glib uneducated take on a vastly complex problem Thank you for voting,lw6oym3,7.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lwu1rps,PickingPies,,1,2024-11-12 23:55:13,,,,The average US wage is double the average EU wage And if you know maths you know that average is meaningless unless its uniformly distrubuted In US the average household income is 114k while the median is 80k That gargantuan difference showcases how the average is inflated due to rich people and its not representative of the majority of the citizens But also you are comparing currency trades not real purchase power Cost of living in Europe is on average 60 of the cost of living in the US If you earn double but pay double for the same apple you are not richer Currency conversion only affects international trading which of course affects the final price but much less than what you can expect Thats why in the end Europeans can save more and can afford better social benefits despite earning less according to the currency market But believe it or not in europe people pay in euros and purchase in euros theres no trading conversion so theres no loss in money,lw7z7wj,3.0,1gmg0iy
comment,lwvsq3d,Aidan_Welch,,1,2024-11-13 07:07:53,,,,I was talking about median not mean Cost of living in Europe is on average 60 of the cost of living in the US Source Is that including tax burden Thats why in the end Europeans can save more Source Here is PPP adjusted disposable median income and the US is higher than all but the very richest EU country But believe it or not in europe people pay in euros and purchase in euros theres no trading conversion so theres no loss in money I have no clue why youre saying this in a weirdly chastising way nobody said anything about currency conversion and regardless its also wrong A lot maybe even most Europeans arent in the eurozone I live in a European country that doesnt use euros,lwu1rps,4.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw7bfjc,donfuria,,0,2024-11-09 04:36:25,,,,Of course there are things that are cheaper like produce utilities food in general and public transport but others are ironically more expensive Technology and electronics more expensive than in the US Cars too Specialty items tools and whatnot for whatever industry or hobby or business venture much more expensive Ive been dying to find a bank that would approve a mortgage so I can own the roof over my head but for the median property price they all ask about a demonstrable income of around 34K USD per month which isnt happening because that is reserved for the top 4 of earners at a national level Minimum wage doesnt get you shit in mexico Im not kidding its barely a life You spend most of your income in the public transport rides that get you to and back from your job and your daily lunch Most low income workers live 23 hours away from their jobs because they cant afford rent in closer places and the vehicles they use get routinely mugged So you wake up at 4am to leave your house at 5 pray that you dont get robbed on your way to work get to your job by 8 and most companies dont adhere at all to federal labor laws so its common to not get stuff like overtime Lets say it was a good day and you end your shift at 6 and get home a bit after 9 Youve spent 5 of your 1250 daily income and need to wake up 7 hours later if youre lucky to do it all over again Not to mention many many jobs dont even pay minimum wage Our institutions are a joke and its a prevalent practice because they obviously get away with it Theres people working more than 70 hours a week for 30 total Thats 120 a month So yea Im blessed in ways that 90 of the country can only dream of but if I performed the same job in the US Id earn easily 10x as much Regardless of what an avocado costs in the supermarket over there my standard of life would increase exponentially I lived in Vancouver for a while and earned practically the same as a dishwasher a decade ago than nowadays after building a real career in my own country And I could afford so much shit and travel and do so much more Comparing dollars to pesos is completely ignorant Even at 7 an hour US workers have it significantly better,lw77t1z,6.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw5332i,LaunchTransient,,13,2024-11-08 20:41:06,,,,A word of warning this will be a short lecture on oil industry basics if youre not into that stop reading here Crude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons it has shorter chain hydrocarbons stuff like pentane butane and long chain polymers stuff with 3040 carbon atoms in a chain or more as well as tonnes of other more complex molecules The nice thing about this is that the chain length is proportional with boiling points shorter chains boil at lower temperatures This allows for fractional distillation allowing you seperate out fractions which are mixtures with a set range of hydrocarbon chain lengths Now in the crude oil industry there are 4 broad terms which dominate describing the types of oil Theres Heavy and Light heavy means the oil is dominated by long chain polymers light means its a mixture of shorter chain polymers Then you have Sour and Sweet which refers to sulphur content sweet oil is low in sulphur sour is high in sulphur these terms come from when wellborers literally tasted the oil to check quality Light sweet oil is highly desirable because it requires minimal processing to refine it into high quality fractions You get a lot more gasoline out of it straight out of the door so it commands a premium Unfortunately 70 of the worlds crude oil reserves are heavy crude and thats a problem because you cannot just distill that to get gasoline which is roughly in the range around 8 carbon atoms long hence the socalled octane rating Instead they use a process known as cracking where the heavy oil is heated to high temperatures in the presence of a catalyst which then breaks up the longer chain polymers into shorter chains which can then be distilled in kerosene gasoline naptha etc Only problem is much of these heavy crudes are also sour Sulphur fouls up many of the processes can cause crosslinking of hydrocarbons and all kinds of bullshit chemistry that brings down your yield and generally gums up your equipment So you need more advanced systems to scrub the sulphur out of the oil to more acceptable levels because the regulations also limit the sulphur content in your products high sulphur gasoline is both bad for your engine and your lungs So as a result you need highly skilled chemists and engineers lots of capital and billions worth of equipment to clean and process the crude that comes in and you prefer to focus on sour heavy oils because your advanced technologies were expensive to develop and build and you want a return on that investment This means that the refinery capacity in the US is predominantly built to handle heavy sour crude from exporters like Venezeula Mexico Russia and Canada Not nearly as much capacity handles light crude such as West Texas Intermediate As for your question about refinery locations oil is rarely refined onsite Instead refineries tend to be sited near logistics hubs where millions of barrels can easily be shipped in by tanker railway or pipeline Then you refine and ship it back out the way it came If youve read all this well done but this is just a tiny dip into the science and engineering behind the scenes,lw4obpm,8.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw40gsg,LeCrushinator,,0,2024-11-08 17:29:47,,,,Youre both right Youre right China doesnt have to pay anything theyd just receive less when selling something to the US But theyre also right because the result of the tariffs is that Chinese companies would just increase the price of their goods to compensate If a Chinese company is selling you an item for 10 an theres no tariff then they get 10 for it Once theres a 60 tariff on goods from China China now only gets 4 for selling something to the US for 10 China still needs to make its profit though so they raise the price of the item to 25 now they get 10 when selling it The net result is that Americans pay more now for the same items and this is in the hope that some American company would step up and instead make the item and that Americans would buy from them instead The problem with that assumption is that even if an American company would sell you the item theyd likely sell it to you for much more than 10 because labor and materials here will cost more money So that 10 item you were paying for from China is now 25 and the American version is probably at least 25 as well Its a tax on Americans with the hopes that America gets to keep that money but lets be realistic the people getting to keep that money are mostly the rich and the prices will be going up for the poor and middle class to make that happen,lw2sdw8,4.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw2z9p5,HellBlazer_NQ,,1,2024-11-08 14:23:51,,,,Trump will be but not how they think A lot of Trumps supporters think tariffs are paid by the exporting country they are not they are paid by the importing business So as an example lets assume a business in the USA wants a product to resell They can import it for 100 or buy it from a supplier in the USA for 120 Obviously they import it Now along comes Trump as says well lets stick a 30 tariff on that import now it costs 130 to import and 120 to buy from the USA So they switch to the USA supplier At this stage the USA business has had its cost increase 20 will they just take the hit fuck no the price they resell that product for with increase 20 to cover the lost revenue Maybe even more if the business wants to appease the shareholders and keep the same margin of profit Now what will also happen is the USA supplier that was selling the item for 120 will see importing that item costs 130 and will then move there own price to match the importing price because no business is going to leave free money on the table The original business that was paying 100 to import the item will now have to pay 130 meaning the price will always match the over inflated tariff price whether or not it is mane in the USA or not Once again the increased cost will be shifted the consumer This will result in price increases across the board leading to higher inflation,lw2ja0y,2.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw7vvib,Prophage7,,1,2024-11-09 07:44:08,,,,I think youre confusing phone factories that just assemble parts with the fabrication plants that actually make the chips If that was the case then Intel chips would cost a lot more since theyre an American company producing chips in America already but theyre still competitively priced The issue is that TSMC and Samsung are currently the only companies in the world with the knowledge on how to reliably manufacture chips with transistors at the sub10nm scale Intel has been trying for a while to figure it out but havent had much success so much so that even theyre contracting TSMC to produce their newest line of chips so they can at least have a competitive product to AMD It quite literally just comes down to theres only a small number of people in the world that have the knowledge on how to manufacture chips of that calibre and theyre all already working for TSMC and to a lesser extent Samsung who have admitted theyre a couple years behind TSMC,lw7oocb,4.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw9wg98,Prophage7,,2,2024-11-09 17:11:13,,,,Absolutely it would be but America needs to either bribe them or provide a compelling reason for them to spend the money and time to setup plants for these chips in America right Theres a reason why it took billions of dollars in American tax payer money and a heavy tax break to convince TSMC to setup a fabrication plant and even that couldnt work in the whole supply chain considering packaging still needs to be done in Taiwan Consider that where theyre currently located they have access to a market of 8 billion people With how expensive it is to duplicate their fabrication plants it is it might not be profitable to serve a market of only 300m people And if you still need to buy their product because no one else in your country knows how to do it what incentive is there for them to take that loss Theyll happily just keep selling you their chips and letting you suck up having to pay the tariff on it,lw7xtou,6.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw2pw2g,oneeyejedi,,1,2024-11-08 13:29:21,,,,No tariffs are normally used to persuade consumers to buy something produced locally Tariffs do not effect anyone except for those buying the items So if a company needs one hundred thousand motherboards thay pay more to get the item into the country and the corps arent going to eat the cost so they pass it on to you This does nothing to the producer of those motherboards they still got the same parts at the same price and produced the same product Now that same company gets those motherboards in the use then no extra cost no need to raise prices everything goes along smooth For the tech sector specifically though we get a lot if not all microchips from over seas and it is a very important component in any electronic,lw2n88d,1.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw455cr,-Lysergian,,1,2024-11-08 17:52:22,,,,Tariffs imposed by the US government are collected by the customs authority basically as a tax So the importer would pay that cost once it is processed through the port The importer pays that cost once it gets here regardless of if it sells or not but typically id assume they wouldnt import it unless they have retailers contracted to sell it to The importers would most likely pass that price into the retailersdistributors its not likely that many places will take a cut to their profits in the supply chain so its expect that initially high priced items would linger on the shelves and then get discounted once they sit on the shelves too long Eventually id expect the quality of the products on the shelves to get worse as corners are cut to lower the prices or more likely the manufacturers will offshore the factory to another country that doesnt have such strong tariffs like what has already been done with moving a lot of production from China to places like Vietnam and India Unfortunately theres not a lot that can be done to bring standard manufacturing back to the US and keep it price competitive with the cheaper labor abroad You can help by buying American where you can Unfortunately those American made goods may be more expensive and lower quality as oftentimes corners are cut here in the US to help keep prices competitive,lw2zs9i,1.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lyuz8m1,Modley1,,1,2024-11-25 04:49:27,,,,If the products continue to be manufactured in the proposed tariff country like China it will increase the cost however the goal is not to increase the price the goal is to incentivize these countries to move manufacturing of US sold products to the US China also heavily subsidies many of their products If they keep manufacturing there they will have to increase subsidies to compete If it works as promised then we will see prices temporarily higher but then over time as manufacturing returns to the US the prices will lower not all the way to pre tariff rates because we pay better than jobs in China at the same time US wages will increase due to a more robust manufacturing market This in theory should provide more manufacturing jobs that are badly needed in the US Thus giving US workers more pay to afford the products that are now slightly more expensive and are now made in the US It will be interesting to see how it plays out and if it works as intended,,0.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw2dazk,relator_fabula,,7,2024-11-08 12:03:15,,,,Bro Trump drove the economy into the ground with the insane increase in national debt couple with massive tax breaks for the wealthy The debt increased by nearly 8 trillion under Trump accounting for nearly 13rd of our ENTIRE debt at the time 24T Thats the reason for the inflation problems after he left office We spent 8 trillion more than we fucking took in You think thats good for the economy lmfao Gas prices and egg prices and inflation were up globally and in most 1st world countries they were up more than the US over the past 4 years Not to mention that Trump along with the GOP majority in congress let billionaires run absolutely rampant In his final days in office he also erased flags on hundreds of billions of dollars in PPP loans for the biggest borrowers giving them essentially free government grants for misspent funds that instead of going to keep workers employed went into billionaires pockets The fact that Biden has completely turned around the absolute clusterfuck that took place from 20162020 is a minor miracle Millions upon millions of jobs createdrestored wages on the rise etc all despite not having a Democratic majority in congress to get any meaningful legislation passed It takes time for policy changes to make a difference We spent the first few years of Bidens administration just trying to recover from the pandemic and fix Trumps free ride for billionaires Trickle down doesnt fucking trickle down Unbridled capitalism and massive tax breaks for billionaires doesnt help anyone but the billionaires The narcissist that bankrupted six casinos does not give a fuck about economics nor does he know how to run a business He knows how to feed his addiction for attention and nothing more He was completely out of his league running a fucking casino a business that is literally guaranteed money let alone a country,lw2bvu4,1.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw2nq96,Jorycle,,2,2024-11-08 13:16:07,,,,Regardless of the red wave they dont have a 23 majority You only need 60 votes to get around the filibuster But funny enough you only need 51 votes to get rid of the filibuster Republicans are likely to do what Democrats wouldnt especially now that they have a large enough majority that the mindful Republicans like Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski cant stop them and MAGA drove out most of the rest,lw2l6oj,1.0,1gmg0iy

comment,lw2chu9,megahtron77,,9,2024-11-08 11:56:48,,,,Unless you can buy roads or flying carsplanes I dont see how having less than 30 more money in our pockets offsets damaged infrastructure or anything thats potentially up for collapse or make up for the fact that everything costs double because of the new inflation,lw2bt1h,1.0,1gmg0iy
