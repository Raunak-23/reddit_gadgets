comment,mh6460z,itsalongwalkhome,,17,2025-03-11 08:05:23,,,,I literally just ordered a new PC with a PCI 50 SSD It hasnt even arrived and its out of date,,0.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh67pwh,j_schmotzenberg,,18,2025-03-11 08:44:37,,,,If you are a consumer this is completely moot The speeds PCIE drives are capable of really only matter for enterprise use cases Beyond PCIE 40 is just a waste for consumers,mh6460z,1.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh6r885,yepthisismyusername,,-2,2025-03-11 11:46:44,,,,Mostly However if youre having to move large amounts of data VMs large data sets etc the faster PCIE 50 and higher speeds can save you time It will be more expensive so its up to the buyer to determine if the increase in price is worth it,mh67pwh,2.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh8ve71,person1234man,,11,2025-03-11 18:24:34,,,,I hate to break it to you but if you are moving large VMs or large data sets presumably from scientific applications then you are not a standard user,mh6r885,3.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mha97q3,nvec,,7,2025-03-11 22:18:43,,,,Who said they were a standard user I move large VMs and data sets as both a programmer and 3d graphics hobbyist I may not be a standard user but Im doing it on my own personal offtheshelf hardware and not making money from it Im a consumer Im certainly not an enterprise I would see an advantage to this being available on consumer hardware Its the same as highend GPUs A standard user has no need for one but if youre a gamer who wants maximum performance on a highres display then it can be worthwhile and thats certainly a consumer use,mh8ve71,4.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mheqznx,redsoxVT,,2,2025-03-12 16:34:44,,,,Yea hate to break it to that guy Ive been rolling raid0 M2s for 2 gens just to push the throughput further Wish my employers would do that for my work machines lol Current project is using AI to upscale 480p VHS home videos up to 4k These files uncompressed are hitting 350GB During finalization the drives go max for significant time periods,mha97q3,5.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mhpsxb0,Elveno36,,1,2025-03-14 08:38:35,,,,Damn how does one get into AI upscaling I have a lot of compute on standby any models you recommend,mheqznx,6.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mhfkpf2,DonutConfident7733,,1,2025-03-12 18:55:58,,,,The consumer ssds do not sustain the peak speed for too long usually after 100GBs it depends on ssd capacity it slows down a lot so it no longer matters if its PCIe 5 or 4 heck some go lower than SATA speeds whipe cheap ones go even to 30MBsec which is lower than hdd speed USB 20 speed And this is for sequential writes random writes are way lower Most ssds write at max speed for one or two minutes then need quite a while to recover until you can write fast again for two minutes CrystaldiskMark with 1GB test size will not show this behavior you need much larger test size,mh6r885,3.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mhflj3p,yepthisismyusername,,2,2025-03-12 18:59:50,,,,Thanks for that info I didnt realize that Ive been pretty lucky in that I havent had to move more than 100GB at a time so I havent noticed a slowdown,mhfkpf2,4.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh5fxjl,lilblueorbs,,-11,2025-03-11 04:16:51,,,,This doesnt matter if the company cant survive the Trumpcession Itll be interesting to see what companies are still around in 6 months,,0.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh5pcyf,Rollertoaster7,,14,2025-03-11 05:35:03,,,,Micron has been around for nearly half a century I think theyll survive 4 years,mh5fxjl,1.0,1j8dq6z
comment,mh60oha,namisysd,,0,2025-03-11 07:27:45,,,,Astera Labs is pretty new they might not survive a recession,mh5pcyf,2.0,1j8dq6z
