comment,mhjhekm,challengeaccepted9,,3,2025-03-13 10:10:10,,,,Right So you understand that ploughing forms a part of any harvest So your intervention was nothing more than disingenuous tedious internet pedantry Itd be the same as if I was visiting someone in Shinjuku from the UK and I said Im going to have to push the visit back The flight has been delayed so I wont arrive in Shinjuku on time Only for a pedant like you to pipe up with Um actually theres no flights to Shinjuku You have to ride the metro Yeah no shit And how do I get to the metro from the UK By flying to Tokyo first How do you have a crop to harvest By doing the rest of the cultivation of the land Twat,mhjg2fl,10.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhilopr,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-03-13 04:50:36,,,,Your example isnt really good because theres a clear benefit You can harvest more in less time But basically everything Silicon Valley has done in the last 20 years has actually made our lives worse I seriously cant think of anything that has actually improved my life at all I had a dumb phone with no text plan until 2017 and it was way better than a smart phone Ive had to turn off all notifications and only check texts at designated times The alternative would be a flood of banners and no sense of privacy since people would assume youre always available Social media has completely ruined democracy and our ability to assess facts That outweighs any benefits Streaming has destroyed the film industry and dried up tons of money for the people actually making the shows You cant buy software anymore nearly everything is pay month to month and then you lose it when you stop AI is a disaster that has made every product it touches worse and is destroying art itself The internet itself is far worse than it was 20 years ago I cannot point to a single thing Silicon Valley has done that makes my life actually better I can point to a ton of things its done to make businesses more money But all of it is ultimately at my expense,mhgokvk,5.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhiz088,challengeaccepted9,,0,2025-03-13 06:55:50,,,,Your example isnt really good because theres a clear benefit You can harvest more in less time Doesnt matter if it has a benefit You could harvest just fine without it Thats what their metric was and thats why I criticised it But basically everything Silicon Valley has done in the last 20 years has actually made our lives worse I seriously cant think of anything that has actually improved my life at all I had a dumb phone with no text plan until 2017 and it was way better than a smart phone Then you lack imagination With a smartphone I can instantly pull up details of exactly where I am how to get where I need to go which methods I can take to get there and how long each method will take control my finances instantly including checking balances setting up or stopping payments scanning in cheques there and then and freezing my card within seconds of realizing its missing checking literally anything I need to online instantly being able to listen to or watch anything I like within the bounds of legality and courtesy on the move eg during train journeys flights etc play videogames that used to require a box a dozen or more times the size plugged into the wall and a TV instantly translate anything I find in real time just by pointing the phone at it using eSIMs to use my phone in countries at the other end of the world for practically pennies and have it arranged ahead of time so all I need to do is toggle a setting when I land have cheap and reliable sat nav in my car thats far better than purposebuilt sat nav units cars used to have I paid an extra 300 for an Android Auto that looks absolutely seamless with the surrounding dash and swapped my radio out for it Worth every penny Those are all just examples Ive personally used within the past year Under the other persons message theyre irrelevant I was living just fine without them just like the farmer was ploughing just fine with a horse But per your second message those are all obvious improvements Im not denying the downsides of things like the growth of social media Im just saying its either lazy or disingenuous to suggest theres been literally no benefit to smartphones As for people who assume youre always available I have friends who wont reply to messages for days sometimes Sometimes I dont None of us care Likewise my employer has not once messaged me on the assumption Im available to work outside the hours Im contracted to work The fact that youre nearly always contactable is not a problem of the tech People assuming youre always available is a problem with people I dont care about having the shiniest trendiest new toy If there was literally no benefit to smartphones I would happily buy a brick every few years rather than spending two or three hundred on a smartphone But Id also be completely lost in new cities have to have a list of directions pinned to the windshield for longer journeys and hope I never make a wrong turn have a much more limited range of options available to me when I visit places like Japan I have repeatedly used translation services on Japanese only menus or shop products to check what I am about to orderbuy be MUCH more bored on train journeys and out of the loop about breaking news relevant to my job until I could get to a computer Oh no social media is terrible I agree Thats why I deleted my X account Id take the evils of social media and the ability for me to walk away from it if the alternative was no social media and no smartphone technology,mhilopr,6.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhkf464,pinkynarftroz,,1,2025-03-13 14:03:15,,,,Im just saying its either lazy or disingenuous to suggest theres been literally no benefit to smartphones Not my argument The argument is that any small benefits are massively outweighed by the negatives of which there are many and they are very significant The amount of damage smartphones have done to culture the internet and even the brains of young people is almost incalculably bad,mhiz088,7.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhkigk6,challengeaccepted9,,1,2025-03-13 14:20:38,,,,And Im saying the risks are outweighed by the benefits and are often ones we can control Im not downplaying the impact of smartphones on young people Which is why in the UK for example we have started banning them from schools We want to have more considered controls on what children are exposed to No one remotely sane suggests itd be a net benefit if we didnt have smartphones because if that was the consensus view wed have support for a complete ban of the technology I dont want children accessing porn which has next to no practical benefit for adults let alone how it affects kids But we dont look at that and say well we should just ban all online porn then and have a world without it We accept that its more nuanced than that We accept that parental responsibility comes into it that pastoral responsibility comes into it that maybe some of the more extreme content should be reviewed in terms of accessibility and legislation,mhkf464,8.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhflc7l,TheDoktorIsIn,,40,2025-03-12 18:58:56,,,,Literally the only use Ive found for AI is easy photo search I know you could do it before but its cool to say hm what is this thing And snap a photo then find it 30 seconds later I tried making a meal plan with ChatGPT awhile ago gave it very loose reins with the exception of no seafood Gave me salmon I said no seafood so it replaced the salmon with chicken and then gave me 2 breakfasts of shrimp Repeat 5x until I get something reasonably resembling a good plan which just took longer than if I did it by hand,mhekg7b,2.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhg3xir,NickCharlesYT,,38,2025-03-12 20:26:47,,,,Thats kind of the whole thing isnt it AI tools like chat gpt are just prediction engines You ask it for recipes for a meal plan and it spits out the words that are most likely to go with your prompt It doesnt really have the capacity to think about what its writing unless it passes its own response to another AI to validate and that AI will likely have the same problem There is no actual intelligence to speak of In general Ive only really found gpt useful for drafting skeleton code that I can then customize to my needs or ask it to make VERY specific modifications to piece by piece Its almost as slow as just doing the coding yourself and you still have to know what youre looking at or youll get burned trying to blindly run the code,mhflc7l,3.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhgj9sf,Eurynom0s,,15,2025-03-12 21:42:50,,,,ChatGPT is pretty good for programming if youre looking for something that gets discussed on Stack Overflow a lot It skips the part of the Stack Overflow Googling where you have to sift through the bad answers and people being dicks about this is a duplicate question and just surfaces the most useful answer But this of course only works for as long as people keep putting new questions and answers into Stack Overflow and I know traffic is already starting to go down there For boilerplate its still useful to me because I often wind up having to look up pieces of the boilerplate anyhow And its very handy at stuff like regex which Im just not very handy with myself,mhg3xir,4.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhhsbqd,los_thunder_lizards,,10,2025-03-13 01:40:49,,,,I havent thought about even asking ChatGPT about LaTeX programming but I on occasion have to try and figure out a thing that isnt particularly easy to do in LaTex and this is compounded by the humorous situation that there seems to be a single German guy who is the biggest curmudgeon in the entire world who just tells you that you should attempt to solve the problem yourself first which is like okay guy I wonder how good ChatGPT is at LaTex,mhgj9sf,5.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhk99s4,HilariousSpill,,1,2025-03-13 13:31:46,,,,Ive found ChatGPT to be great at getting me started with Regex Then I have to fix whatever problems there are with what they gave me using my old RegEx book The part I appreciate most is that it gives an explanation of what different aspects of the code should be doing That way even if GPT gets it wrong I know how to look up the correct syntax,mhgj9sf,5.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhh9qwi,SirJefferE,,8,2025-03-12 23:58:56,,,,In general Ive only really found gpt useful for drafting skeleton code that I can then customize to my needs or ask it to make VERY specific modifications to piece by piece Its almost as slow as just doing the coding yourself and you still have to know what youre looking at or youll get burned trying to blindly run the code I use it pretty extensively for coding but in almost every case Im asking it to write things I know how to do I can spend 10 minutes writing a Python function or I can spend 30 seconds telling the AI to write it for me and then 2 more minutes reviewing it and tweaking it to make it do what I want it to do Ive used it for Python SQL queries fetch XML queries Javascript C Excel functions and more Its saved me literally hundreds of hours over the last year or so Large language models as you can probably guess from the name are great at modelling language The fact that they can be pretty good at providing information as well is a strange emergent side effect of their language modelling abilities Its a fascinating side effect and I love to play with it But Id absolutely never use it for research or work because thats not at all what its good at and it doesnt know the difference between a correct answer and a correct looking answer,mhg3xir,4.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhhaw06,NickCharlesYT,,5,2025-03-13 00:05:01,,,,Sure its done that for me as well but you and I spend the time reviewing the code and we have a basic understanding of the structure But the more complex the code gets the harder it is to have it keep everything straight as it starts dropping context and losing the overall vision It also seems to absolutely love making up functions to do specific things that dont actually exist in scope And if the language or software youre working on ever had a major overhaul it starts blending the two versions together This is stuff that can often take more time to fix than it does to build the function from scratch in the first place Ive found its only really useful until you need to start iterating on the code and adding fixes and enhancements once you get there I have to start fighting the models instead of benefiting from them and they start to drop context and miss blocks of code as a result,mhh9qwi,5.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhhf03m,SirJefferE,,4,2025-03-13 00:27:07,,,,Yeah I think that probably goes back to the whole understanding thing Its memory sucks and it cant understand your project Its great at helping me write a single function that takes an input and provides an output Its terrible at helping me write a function that calls another function that calls an API and returns the results to another function and so on It will absolutely fuck it up and troubleshooting it will take longer than just writing it yourself But for simple stuff Its great Like the other day I had a few dozen CSV files I wanted to load them up into a dataframe add a few columns drop a few columns then export the results to a single CSV I know exactly how Id do it if I were typing it myself I know what modules Id use I know how to loop through CSVs I could do it on my own in a few minutes But why bother I can just go to ChatGPT and be like Yo write me a function that accepts an input filepath loops through every CSV in that folder and return a pandas dataframe and I get an immediate result that almost always works perfectly The fact that I know exactly how Id write it means I can just glance over it and go Yup thats what I would have done Im not a developer I maintain a few small function apps that ChatGPT isnt great at helping me with because of the context problems but most of the coding I do is small repeatable shit that Ive done a thousand times before which is pretty much the perfect use case for ChatGPT,mhhaw06,6.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhh8k09,NickCharlesYT,,6,2025-03-12 23:52:35,,,,If our brains only predicted text and didnt have a few trillion other parameters and several other senses sure A typical llm is several orders of magnitude less complex than a human brain and simply cannot manage the same level of context meaning it is very limited in how it can apply concepts to its responses in the same way humans can If you ask an llm if shrimp is a seafood it will usually answer yes If you ask it to make recipes for a healthy diet and oh by the way no seafood it has trouble applying the concept of what seafood is to the recipes its making Some of the newer llms with reasoning try to help with that by essentially iterating on itself to come up with a more accurate answer but it still isnt great at understanding these concepts and applying them consistently,mhh64n3,5.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhix3xp,therve,,0,2025-03-13 06:36:13,,,,Overall I agree with you but your example made me laugh because Ive had several interactions with restaurant staff for whom the concept of seafood or dairy or gluten was pretty difficult to grasp So yeah LLMs are very flawed but so is the human brain,mhh8k09,6.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhjwc3y,NickCharlesYT,,2,2025-03-13 12:11:55,,,,Thats a different issue in humans to be fair Frankly speaking you are often dealing with people that simply dont care enough to put the effort into knowing the concept or the differences in the first place A restaurant staff worker often works simply to make money not because culinary arts are their passion or customer service is their lifes goal Its just a job like any other and theyll do the minimum required to keep said job and make a certain amount in tips because their aspirations lie elsewhere in life I dont think thats inherently bad either for what its worth but the motivations of a human and the purpose of an LLM are two very different things leading to two very different utilizations of the same inputs and outputs Its the same reason we have different models and flavors of models to process the data differently everybody is looking to get something different out of them and theyre is no one size fits all solution,mhix3xp,7.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhiy4n9,Mollan8686,,-2,2025-03-13 06:46:48,,,,It al depends on the number of parameters and algorithm underlying the LLM Current LLM have issues but theyre getting better Reasoning and deep search have vastly improved in just 2 years consider the billion years of evolution required to the get to the human brain Your example is very good but try for example to explain those concept to a 5yo kid and ask the same things Will you receive a correct recipe,mhh8k09,6.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhhjv2w,probablywhiskeytown,,12,2025-03-13 00:53:27,,,,I dont mean this in a glib way at all rather with more of a grim tone about how formidable the challenge is given how badly the core education of most people under 35 or so was eroded compared to what older public school students received We cant teach internet literacy anymore We need to teach cultivate or maintain everything literacy like most literate people did preinternet and most effectively in the 60s90s amidst access to libraries primary research Humans need to know enough about any given thing to usually smell bullshit and then be able to look into primary sources to sort out any claim which seems iffy There are some major challenges involved in going back to living this way Survival even via manual labor didnt leave as many people as tapped out as it does now It also relies upon curiousity optimistic interest to feel worthwhile which is diametrically opposed to the wholly understandable prevailing doomerism of the moment One example of why this is so difficult Antivaccine beliefs are antiscience antisurvivalbut people in those circles sometimes mention the endocrine effects of plastics The culprit is usually more from the plasticizer chemical components which determine mechanical properties of the plastic but yeah endocrine disruption from those is something research has been showing for decades Antivaxers then attribute complex identity formation behaviors to these chemicals which isnt wellfounded in science But the weird thing weve seen in all mammals in recent decades where the EXACT same amount of food from the same crop types made the same way results in more weight gainthat might be environmental endocrine disruption How in the hell would we ever expect someone to sort that out at a glance without a TON of nonvocational education simply intended to produce an educated person,mhfmjvi,3.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhgirsj,djshadesuk,,7,2025-03-12 21:40:25,,,,fun to mess around with but fucking useless Thats not quite true Ive found AI one in particular but Im not going to directly mention it because its currently free to be very useful when used as a coding assistant And by assistant I mean literally that an assistant not a do everything for me coding machine The ability to iterate through different ideas much faster than a human would be able to is awesome But you have to have a fundamental understanding of the language you want to program with because it doesnt get everything right first time but in many ways thats no different than a human anyway Used in a collaborative process youre able to explore different ideas fix and optimise code AI picking up on your mistakes and you picking up on AIs mistakes and best off all it does it with zero ego that a human would have Ive been able to knock stuff out 95 of how I would have coded it myself but in a fraction of the time Still I recognise this is a super niche use case and is not going to be the killer app that AI needs,mhfpdpt,3.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhgx7ho,ArchitectofExperienc,,6,2025-03-12 22:53:05,,,,The situation that youve described is in my opinion the correct way to actually implement LLMs On their own LLMs are a bit useless and I dont think theyre going to replace any job the way the Venture crowd wants us to think But you make a really good point The term Ive heard for A Person and a Machine Learning Algorithm working together is Centaur but I get the feeling it never really caught on for obvious reasons Realistically though its the only solution that allows approaches to be checked refined and innovated to the rate of failure that clients expect Its also an approach that benefits a lot from specialized modelsshellsmodesmoduleswrappers did I miss one I think it may be a niche use case now but there are areas where it might do a lot of work and a lot of good Coding included especially netsec but manufacturing and medicine also have strong usecases It seems like you have a solid workflow out of curiosity have you tried training your own,mhgirsj,4.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhhdw89,dxrey65,,5,2025-03-13 00:21:10,,,,A Person and a Machine Learning Algorithm working together I had a writing job for awhile working up technical content for a website It was just me for a year paid per word then they decided it would be cheaper to have an AI produce the basic content which Id edit and factcheck That was so much harder and more timeconsuming and aggravating it wasnt even worth it I asked for a raise and got told there was no money so that was the end of that Id have minded more but it was only marginally worth it in the first place I think I can still consistently recognize AIgenerated content btw The typical tell is that they present information in a way that makes no sense A human has a typical way of organizing content sort of like verbally painting a picture in a way that another person would build a picture in their head there is a logical order to things following the way we think and visualize and categorize things AIs might get all the grammar right but the order of things is all messed up typically and if you look at the underlying concepts they just dont organize them sensibly at all,mhgx7ho,5.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhewgmn,wilbo-waggins,,39,2025-03-12 17:00:30,,,,I think the search engine results started going down the drain when people realised there were ways to game the algorithm search engine optimisation techniques As soon as people started making progress with SEO techniques it went from giving an advantage to being required to being an arms race of who can game the system more than the rest And without the search algorithm improving to _actually give a better search result to the user_ the search quality plummets Theres also little incentive to produce a better search engine algorithm given how complex and possibly impossible it would be to achieve and how well the current systems serve the algorithm owners,mhe82lh,3.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mheyq91,whatadumbperson,,23,2025-03-12 17:11:30,,,,I think thats one part of it They also changed how the algorithm serves you information and thats the significantly bigger problem They took away your ability to exclude certain search results and they decided they wanted to serve users more ads disguised as content so they fundamentally changed how results are displayed to encourage visiting certain websites over others,mhewgmn,4.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhf081d,wilbo-waggins,,8,2025-03-12 17:18:36,,,,Absolutely the incentive to guide users toward whoever was part of the Google ads scheme always struck me of the taxi driver in a foreign country who has a deal with some particular businesses You dont know the area so you ask for a good place to eat hoping to get genuine impartial advice from a local who has a wealth of knowledge If the driver has a deal with a particular restaurant then they are more likely to reccomend that restaurant over alternatives that are actually better So the restaurant owner gets more tourists visiting them which gives them an advantage over the lesser known competition So the other restaurants also make deals with the taxi driver etc etc,mheyq91,5.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhg0ie3,zmobie_slayre,,6,2025-03-12 20:10:48,,,,I think the search engine results started going down the drain when people realised there were ways to game the algorithm search engine optimisation techniques So like pretty much as soon as Google started to dominate the search engine space Optimising your pagerank was a big thing in the 2000s internet,mhewgmn,4.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhffg3z,suicidaleggroll,,0,2025-03-12 18:30:49,,,,You had me until the last sentence You wont see a better algorithm from Google or Bing since pushing ads on you is their business model not just the obvious ads on the search result page itself but also artificially promoting search results for pages that have more Google ads on them but they arent the only search engine options Paid search engines like Kagi are really starting to gain traction as Google alienates their own users more and more with these practices,mhewgmn,4.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhg77iu,EchoAtlas91,,3,2025-03-12 20:42:00,,,,Its frustrating because I see the potential but these companies are dropping the ball hard when it comes to AI assistants I recently started this audiobook for a book club Ive started going to and I was completely lost 2 chapters into a book called Ancillary Justice So this morning in the car on the way to work I turned on voice mode on ChatGPT and had a full on casual back and forth conversation about the various aspects of the book I was confused on terminology and like the basic premise that I was having a hard time understanding It knew exactly what I was asking and explained perfectly the things I was having a hard time understanding Its as if I was asking the author themselves or someone whos obsessed with the book and lore It even warned me when my questions were getting into spoiler territory with a quip like Well youll have to read on and find out And I also use ChatGPT a lot to help manage my ADHD so Ill put in all the chores and errands I have to do during the weekend and it will give me an hour by hour schedule of all my tasks broken down and then if things change or I go over the time limit I can tell it and it will reorganize the schedule to adapt And it does this intelligently so if I say I need to do laundry it will schedule my day so that I load up the laundry then I can be doing something else while my laundry is washing If Alexa or Google Gemini could do that and make appointments lists reminders and be able to turn onoff all my smart devices and adapt to my preferences all in a conversational way Thats where I thought AI would go and for some reason I have no idea why it seems so difficult for these companies to get that right Like shit imagine an AI at home where I can tell it to listen for the sound of a cat puking then when I walk in the door it greets me and lets me know it thinks it heard the cat puke,mhe5njx,2.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhjdicd,ju5tr3dd1t,,2,2025-03-13 09:31:03,,,,this is getting into a larger conversation about what is affordable but I feel like its downplaying it to call it a little debt 41000 and 26000 is not a small amount of money I honestly think weve normalized debt as a vehicle of access so much weve stretched the definition of afford to hide that thats not affordability I think its fair to say most people cannot outright pay for college The student loan debt is 18 trillion And people have been beating the drum that theres a higher education affordability issue and student loan crisis Auto debt is shockingly close at 16 trillion Folks are struggling to afford things in 2025 it does not look promising that the future were heading towards will be making personal robots affordable even if they are visually prevalent,mhjavsn,6.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhfhjie,PmMeUrNihilism,,6,2025-03-12 18:40:53,,,,The problem with sites like Perplexity is that you have to actively confirm the sources to determine how reliable the summaries are because you cant immediately see them in context with the info thats being given This inevitably leads to people to think that its always right then that leads to an overreliance on something that is routinely wrong Whats worse is that if things keep going the way they are itll create a loop where sites that usually feature human authorship will just post whatever info they can grab off of AI search engines regardless of accuracy What you see as useful and convenient is actually eroding basic skills while contributing to misinformation While old school search isnt perfect its still a lot more reliable,mhf03yy,2.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhe0mbg,chrisdh79,,78,2025-03-12 14:22:23,,,,From the article The onrushing AI era was supposed to create boom times for great gadgets Not long ago analysts were predicting that Apple Intelligence would start a supercycle of smartphone upgrades with tons of new AI features compelling people to buy them Amazon and Google and others were explaining how their ecosystems of devices would make computing seamless natural and personal Startups were flooding the market with ChatGPTpowered gadgets so youd never be out of touch AI was going to make every gadget great and every gadget was going to change to embrace the AI world This whole promise hinged on the idea that Siri Alexa Gemini ChatGPT and other chatbots had gotten so good theyd change how we do everything Typing and tapping would soon be passé all replaced by multimodal omnipresent AI helpers You wouldnt need to do things yourself youd just tell your assistant what you need and it would tap into the whole world of apps and information to do it for you Tech companies large and small have been betting on virtual assistants for more than a decade to little avail But this new generation of AI was going to change things There was just one problem with the whole theory the tech still doesnt work Chatbots may be fun to talk to and an occasionally useful replacement for Google but truly gamechanging virtual assistants are nowhere close to ready And without them the gadget revolution we were promised has utterly failed to materialize,,0.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mheyna8,_RADIANTSUN_,,8,2025-03-12 17:11:05,,,,Nobody said peak app but you can accomplish detailed tasks with much less effort than it takes to detail them to an assistant digital or physical Eg if I want to book a trip and have a travel booker app installed with my info saved it legit takes me 30 seconds to book a flight hotel rental car etc and then Im sure cuz I did it myself vs some janky ass AI doing it then me having for review it anyway to make sure it didnt fuck up The utility would be at the ill defined margins in making judgments on fuzzy things Eg I may want my hotel to meet X Y Z requirements in terms of the rooms and services themselves as well as location like distance to airport etc Normally it would be easier if lots of people gave feedback to a normal developer and they added lots of useful filters to help you meet the need That would also probably be more reliable once implemented But lets say that hasnt happened yet or maybe no hotels meet all your criteria but you want to find whatever next best things fit as much as possible Then instead of the dev having to implement all sorts of filters eg your AIssistant could just access a database and craft the necessary function to your requirements itself Or if none actually fit like if the filters would show 0 options with all your criteria set it could figure out the best approximate fit Most things its better to just have a good software to do the task,mhe980j,3.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhk4zde,mvonballmo,,1,2025-03-13 13:07:07,,,,I think this is an important point that is borne out by a lot of anecdotal evidence that coding AIs are good for prototypes What youre describing is a sortof prototyping of additional functionality for existing UIs Once the value of the additional functionality has been determined it can be converted to actual UI which is more efficient to build maintain and use rather than adhoc reinventing it with each query as you do with LLMs This is a common pattern some tech starts off as software and once a pattern has been established migrates down to either FPGAbased solutions or even then hardwarebased solutions Sometimes those hardware solutions are for slightly lessgeneralized hardware like graphics cards Almost nothing starts out as a hardwarebased solution This notion of virtualization during development is already prevalent in industrial development in which its becoming ever more realistic to delay hardware development Its acknowledged though that the ultimate goal is still to develop the hardware Thats kind of the difference versus the AI hype virtualization in industrial development is considered a tool that makes development of the endproduct more efficient its not ever considered as the endresult itself Many AI vendors make a different argument selling their products as creating the endproduct directly rather than a tool to help you build the endproduct Im not saying that everyone is making that argument and that noone is making the AI as tool argument but that the loudest hype especially from the more uninformed sources make the nonsensical argument which unfortunately has a negative sideeffect on the whole area,mheyna8,4.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhfdx1t,LordCreamer69,,11,2025-03-12 18:23:32,,,,AI is currently best at the most fun things to actively do Take 3D modeling for example AI generated 3D models have been getting better recently however they have one massive problem the topology is horrible The AI does the fun part of sculpting and then leaves the worst part to the real people that being Retopology It should be the other way around The artists should do the actual artistic creation while the computer handles the boring and annoying retopolgy This is true with basically all elements of AI Creating backstory for characters is fun AI does it faster Concept art is fundamental to designing any artistic project It lets the artist explore in a million different ways AI can do it faster and cheaper AI animating tweens is bad because AI cant add style and substance Its like the AI upscaled 60fps clip compilations on youtube They look smudged and the sense of movement and pacing is destroyed Dragging and dropping pictures into a box just to have an AI do all the fun parts of creating art while I get stuck with the worst part of creating 3d assets sounds fucking horrible As an artist who has worked in the video game industry AI isnt the future of games Paying devs well and not abusing them is the way to get better games,mhf5dg7,3.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhf7hfm,101m4n,,5,2025-03-12 17:52:52,,,,Transformers are the language models like chatGPT etc DLSS isnt a transformer I dont think correct me if Im wrong Its definitely going to be a big deal but mostly I think its going to show up as better versions of things we already have Better voice recognition better computer voices tools for various workflows etc natural language interfaces for things that previously were manual etc,mhf5dg7,3.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhf97d2,Cyniikal,,3,2025-03-12 18:00:56,,,,Theyre widely used in vision as well DLSS is driven by a transformerbased model something NVIDIA is actively bragging about with this generation Massively oversimplifying small groups of pixels are treated like tokens and processed in a similar way to language Has some pros and cons vs traditional CNNs which Im sure they still use at some stage in the pipeline I cant imagine a fully transformerbased model being fast enough for frame gen but thats what theyre moving to,mhf7hfm,4.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhfxcru,Cyniikal,,1,2025-03-12 19:56:00,,,,I can get way too into the weeds here since this is what I do for work but basically you take some pixels say a 16x16 patch flatten them into a single vector with 256 values then project them into some tokenembedding space usually with a learnable mapping just like words embeddings then give it a positional encoding so the model knows where that token was in the image That 16x16 patch is then literally a token that you can compare just like language tokens That embedding space is usually learned as the model trains instead of using a pretrained tokenizerword embeddings but you can do that too Different architectures do different things but that was the foundational idea from the 2020 paper An Image is Worth 16x16 Words Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale Sometimes instead of doing this 16x16 256 embed youll use convolutions to do the projection to the embedding space directly which is what we see nowadays with a lot of transformercnn hybrid models There are lots of ways to do it but the concept of having a common embeddingtoken space still exists with ViTs vision transformers,mhfpsqu,6.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhjjlur,101m4n,,1,2025-03-13 10:30:40,,,,I can get way too into the weeds here since this is what I do for work No worries I like the weeds Always good to get opinions from people who are actually involved I dont do ML for a living but I have been tinkering for a while and have even invested in some hardware Language transformers operate along one dimension I guess vision models operate in two Or do they just line up all the 16x16 tokens in a line Also theres typically some masking in language models to avoid attending to tokens in the future I guess with vision you dont need this,mhfxcru,7.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhkynt9,Cyniikal,,1,2025-03-13 15:40:38,,,,I guess that sort of depends on how you think of 1D vs 2D After tokenization and embedding each 16x16 token which after embedding could be whatever lengthsize you want gets some kind of extra numbers added to it representing its position in the image This is so the model can weight how it interacts with other tokens while keeping in mind where theyre all spatially located this is called a positional embedding Sometimes this is an absolute number specifying exactly where in the sequence image this token was sometimes its a learnable parameter After that in a classical ViT that just uses transformer blocks everything is done via attention with no special care paid to the original 2D shape of the image other than that positional embedding we add Its up to the model to learn during training whether or not the exact spatial ordering of the 16x16 tokens matters or not Maybe you dont even need to care about how the pixels are arranged or care very little in order to classify a bird the model just figures that out during training CNNs on the other hand _definitely_ care about the spatial ordering of pixels its baked into how they work There are a lot of hybrid ViTs that use a CNN backbone to extract image features then these features are the things that are actually broken up into blocks and turned into tokens instead of raw pixels These are inherently 2D up to a point but then usually theyre flattened and the standard transformer stuff happens Also theres typically some masking in language models to avoid attending to tokens in the future I guess with vision you dont need this The masking in language models happens because usually youre training it for an autoregressive task predict the next token If you were simply training a transformer for something like sentiment analysis or spam detection there would be no need to mask out future tokens You _can_ mask out image tokens but thats usually for stuff like selfsupervised learning where instead of having labels for the data you want to pretrain a model on a massive amount of unlabeled data In this case you might train the model to predict whats in those masked tokens with the assumption that whatever features its learning to extract from the image in order to accomplish this task will transfer nicely to a new task later on when you train with labeled data for classificationdetectionsegmentationwhatever Funnily enough this is pretty much exactly how LLMs are pretrained before theyre finetuned for conversation Continue the next token on an enormous amount of data then finetuned on significantly less data with wellcurated labels,mhjjlur,8.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mheahp4,NecroCannon,,-1,2025-03-12 15:14:25,,,,But AI bros told me to just wait and AI will be this massively useful thing tailored to everyones uses Oh it was a pump and dump scheme of something that could be useful but greed took over Just like crypto Just like NFTs Huh its almost like we shouldnt listen to corporations promises and wait until they have a complete product available for everyone to get invested in it Gamers learned this lesson a while ago now its tech bros Non of these companies care about the future beyond the next few quarters Its about money always have been since the 2010s The main push for AI isnt for us its for them to make more money not needing more people,,0.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhef8rk,Sevinki,,3,2025-03-12 15:37:59,,,,I think its certain that AI will have a massive influence on most parts of our lives its just not there yet You need to remember that this is the worst it will ever be the models will only keep getting smarter AImachine leaning neural networks are already solving problems that were impossible a few years ago AlphaFold has revolutionized protein research NVIDIA developed a weather prediction neural network that is much more accurate than models we use today the most recent LLMs are orders of magnitude better at logic questions und overall understanding of context than ones just 12 years ago etc The tech isnt ready for all of the things apple google and so on promised but it is advancing rapidly in many areas Give it 5 years and i doubt people will want their old shitty virtual assistants back,mheahp4,1.0,1j9l7ii
comment,mhg9gfg,gay_manta_ray,,2,2025-03-12 20:52:31,,,,Just like crypto Just like NFTs yes this tool i use every day for work is just like NFTs and crypto gpt1 is only six years old gpt4 was released two years ago and about six months later a lot more people started hear and think about AI only a spoiled child would expect motherfucking AGI 18 months after they devote their first abstract thought to the concept of AI but i dont think youve even gotten to that point yet,mheahp4,1.0,1j9l7ii

comment,mhgbcre,gay_manta_ray,,3,2025-03-12 21:01:59,,,,its not a good comparison the amount of money being invested in something has nothing to do with whether its useful or not nfts are truly useless and crypto is only marginally useful in the sense that it provides a way to circumvent the banking system for transactions ai is infinitely more useful than both every single person i know uses it for intellectual work,mhgb0nv,5.0,1j9l7ii
