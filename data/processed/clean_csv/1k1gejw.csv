comment,mnlz6ve,BAG1,,22,2025-04-17 16:32:35,,,,Right Or was this device hiding until it decided to break cover Still too close to a broken cover headline which I assume will not appear until a week or so after the release date because why are people still trying to make folding glass Were not there yet cough samsung were still working out how to make a nintendo joystick that doesnt drift and trying to affix panels to teslas that wont fly off when the truck moves,mnlvbqz,1.0,1k1gejw

comment,mno4zhi,chigoku,,28,2025-04-17 23:04:58,,,,I get that some might want more screen real estate without a larger footprint but I dont understand why it needs to be a foldable screen Its an ereader a line in the middle isnt an issue so just make it 2 screens that are extremely close together and no bezel between them I dont think people mind the line in the middle of their physical books,,0.0,1k1gejw
comment,mnpjqzu,Chaski1212,,13,2025-04-18 04:37:33,,,,Yup a folding screen makes no sense here Its not like its for watching media Microsoft Duo had the perfect form factor for this Just two screens with a hinge in the center Copy that and make it an ereader,mno4zhi,1.0,1k1gejw
comment,mnq08ck,NecroCannon,,6,2025-04-18 07:14:51,,,,Im so tired of products nowadays just hopping on a trend without any meaningful use case Like as someone that reads manga I can see the appeal of being able to experience it close to how they do art for volumes but why is this shown as a hamburger style than hotdog,mno4zhi,1.0,1k1gejw

comment,mnm5guh,airckarc,,8,2025-04-17 17:02:48,,,,I appreciate companies working on new products but they seem to always work themselves into a tiny niche that will force them to sell the business maybe their goal or go out of business due to low sales This reader looks pointless Its small and a tablet is going to have a much better screen A Kindle or other ereader is lighter and less prone to damage And easy to hold in one hand,,0.0,1k1gejw
comment,mnpajs5,TorpeAlex,,6,2025-04-18 03:25:42,,,,Contrary to your point but an ereader that folds in the middle like a book would be much easier to hold than the current ones I find it awkward to hang the entire ereader off of one side or hold the entire thing from the bottom and have to do the stupid shelf pinky thing Having the crease in the middle to allow holding like a normal book would be excellent ergonomically,mnm5guh,1.0,1k1gejw
comment,mnuiope,enewwave,,2,2025-04-18 23:59:35,,,,I use a kindle case with a cover for the screen for that reason It allows me to hold the damn thing like a normal book,mnpajs5,2.0,1k1gejw
