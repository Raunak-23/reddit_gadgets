comment,m1oinli,SpareFullback,,974,2024-12-12 12:09:09,,,,Too bad With the way streaming has been going the last few years Ive started buying physical discs again,,0.0,1hchewf
comment,m1ovi0q,ButtFullOfSemen,,340,2024-12-12 13:44:55,,,,Their players were not well regarded There have been plenty of signs that the 4k format may be the last physical film format like Best Buy no longer carrying discs and Target massively downsizing but LG has essentially been out of the player game for 5 years If Panasonic or Sony stopped that would be very troubling,m1oinli,1.0,1hchewf
comment,m1p6mdx,DreamHiker,,68,2024-12-12 14:54:08,,,,I thought Sony only sells business to business now I would be glad to be wrong though,m1ovi0q,2.0,1hchewf
comment,m1paos5,ButtFullOfSemen,,90,2024-12-12 15:17:32,,,,That news story was about Sony stopping sale of blank writeable BluRay discs They still sell players and their studio is still putting their movies on 4k and rereleasing restored old films in their collection,m1p6mdx,3.0,1hchewf
comment,m1pi2hy,drfsupercenter,,41,2024-12-12 15:57:39,,,,Yeah I was going to say you can definitely still buy Sony Bluray players even at Walmart they sell them What baffles me though is that Sony makes these DVD players with HDMI outputupscaling that are like 20 less than the same exact unit that can play Blurays Why They own the patent so theyre not paying royalties to themselves and the laser cant be that expensive Its basically just making an inferior product for the sake of making it,m1paos5,4.0,1hchewf
comment,m1pvri3,TURBOWANDS,,44,2024-12-12 17:09:08,,,,It has to do with how stupid the average consumer is I need a DVD player to watch my dvds Try explaining to grandma how a Bluray player can do both,m1pi2hy,5.0,1hchewf
comment,m1py0cv,drfsupercenter,,29,2024-12-12 17:20:48,,,,Yeah this is one reason I wanted HDDVD to win the format war because the name is more logical and people know what it is lol Just yesterday I had a friend ask if Bluray was a type of DVD and he was like well its a digital video disc right,m1pvri3,6.0,1hchewf

comment,m1s1fxw,drfsupercenter,,2,2024-12-13 00:03:29,,,,They had such high hopes for the format with photo discs and stuff supported too but none of them really took off besides the video format Theres a DVD Video logo much like Compact Disc Digital Audio is different from CDROM so I guess DVD Video is the video one I am thinking of Regardless if you want to be pedantic Blurays are a DVD but theyre also not,m1rtkqh,10.0,1hchewf
comment,m1tmkao,siobhanellis,,2,2024-12-13 06:29:02,,,,Sorry if I came across as pedantic Wasnt my intention I used to think the V stood for Video until I learnt otherwise I meant to pass on my learning,m1s1fxw,11.0,1hchewf

comment,m1t7ys7,drfsupercenter,,6,2024-12-13 04:28:33,,,,No I said its one reason The main reason is that I had a grudge against Sony after the rootkit scandal and HDDVD was backed by more companies Microsoft and Toshiba among others rather than JUST Sony I wouldnt call it vastly inferior its the same exact tech with the blue laser the only difference was capacity Bluray held more But who knows maybe they would have made triplelayer HDDVDs if that won,m1t6vpe,8.0,1hchewf

comment,m1qk6le,MachinaThatGoesBing,,7,2024-12-12 19:14:23,,,,And honestly the writable Bluray situation isnt exactly a surprise I own a ton of physical media including a significant amount of obsolete media Blurays in 2k and 4k CDs DVDs vintage and new vinyl even some tapes and a nice Panasonic tape deck from the 70s not to mention quite a few CDROM games and altogether too many 5¼ and 3½ incy floppy disks and the equipment and software to read them over to modern systems and even I dont own a Bluray burner I dont think Ive ever even seen a burned Bluray At this point if most people want to transfer like 100GB of information in a compact package theyll get a 20 microSD card Even if youre just using it once its probably more economical and greener honestly than buying the burner and a stack of discs The only way the Bluray writer makes sense is if you this a ton and dont want to ferry media back and forth or if you have a client who you need to transfer big data sets to who also demands deliveries on writeonce then readonly media Though I can think of one pretty big customer who does demand the latter in specific situations,m1paos5,4.0,1hchewf

comment,m1q0ukm,theangryintern,,1,2024-12-12 17:35:33,,,,I have an Asustor NAS that probably should be OK at transcoding but I dont really have to do that much since 99 of my Plex viewing is Direct Play at home I typically dont watch anything outside my house,m1pyz9n,4.0,1hchewf
comment,m1qp29w,MachinaThatGoesBing,,1,2024-12-12 19:39:26,,,,Any drive that functions and doesnt have a reputation for breaking down is going to be fine for that I really cannot imagine that a drive from LG has any significant durability bonus over one from say Sony or another large name with a decent reputation Its not like a cassette deck or turntable where its analog information and little details like wow and flutter and noise pickup matter This is all digital information and any decentlymade drive is going to work basically the same The digital data is fixed there is error correction built into the standard and the quality of the reader isnt going to affect it I have a now over a decade old Bluray drive from Asus that still works It moved into an external 5¼ USB3 drive bay and has since outlasted the computer I bought it for Still rips disks to MKV for backup just fine,m1pn70o,3.0,1hchewf

comment,m1qm16c,Patman128,,4,2024-12-12 19:23:50,,,,Nitpicking your nitpick theyre not a film as in celluloid strip format but they are a film as in motion picture format so they are still correct in the more obvious sense of film,m1pnxfu,3.0,1hchewf
comment,m1qnwip,HEX_BootyBootyBooty,,-2,2024-12-12 19:33:30,,,,Nah its a film on a BluRay that doesnt make BluRay a film format Film format is a technical term and BluRay doesnt store a film in such a fashion it stores formatted data,m1qm16c,4.0,1hchewf
comment,m1pwb7x,ButtFullOfSemen,,1,2024-12-12 17:11:59,,,,Nitpick received As far as UHD being the last physically released resolution I was only speaking about there not being enough of a market to support 8k discs not a lack of information in a 35mm frame of film I hope there is a vinyl like resurgence but I think we are in for a drought of popular new movies released on disc and will only get boutique releases at some point in the near future I hope Im wrong,m1pnxfu,3.0,1hchewf

comment,m1p5bvr,mcortez16,,30,2024-12-12 14:46:32,,,,While Xbox Series X does support Dolby Vision for games it does not support Dolby Vision for UHD discs The Xbox will default to HDR10 for playback Its a hardware issue thing related to playerled vs tvled Dolby Vision Its honestly quite baffling,m1p1zpq,4.0,1hchewf
comment,m1pqset,onestarv2,,2,2024-12-12 16:43:23,,,,Dolby Vision is also supported on streaming as well to make things even more confusing Theres the small part of me that wants to get a standalone player instead of using my series X but I feel I also should get a proper OLED if Im gonna do that,m1p5bvr,5.0,1hchewf
comment,m1qckab,mcortez16,,1,2024-12-12 18:35:20,,,,Right which is the whole playerled vs tvled Dolby Vison implementation Just dont get a Samsung OLED if you want DV because Samsung doesnt support it They support HDR10 which is an open standard and comparable to DV but not sure how similar it exactly is I may finally buy a player as they might start to go away soon LG just announced theyve stopped manufacturing all UHD players,m1pqset,6.0,1hchewf
comment,m1u10qc,FartyPants69,,1,2024-12-13 09:02:14,,,,There are also nonOLED technologies that get pretty close and are way cheaper I have a HiSense ULED that looks amazing and was only 350 for a 55 about 2 years ago Surely even cheaper now,m1pqset,6.0,1hchewf

comment,m1pcosz,Old-Rhubarb-97,,3,2024-12-12 15:28:37,,,,People have been saying that since the PS4 launch rumours I think next gen is still too early we will probably get an optional add on disc drive,m1p9jb2,3.0,1hchewf
comment,m1peiw1,AnOddSprout,,2,2024-12-12 15:38:39,,,,I mean look at the data Majority of game sales are on digital Xbox aint even a competition since theyre going focusing on games as a service So Sony dont have to worry about looking bad or losing customers to Xbox They could essentially do what iPhone did with the headphones jack remove it And Sony could quite possibly get away with it coz who else are console players going to turn to It always fella to early till the jump is made I genuinely believe next could literally be it And if video game companies also just stop with the physicals what are the customers actually going to do Not play them That might work on some but on the big sellers like final fantasy and Sony first person it aint going to Just my take anyway,m1pcosz,4.0,1hchewf
comment,m1piucb,Old-Rhubarb-97,,1,2024-12-12 16:01:45,,,,There will be a breaking point for sure where companies decide the lost sales from those who cant or wont go digital are not enough to justify a disc drive I just think its still too early with game sizes always increasing and many people still having slow internet They could change pretty quickly though The pro has an add on disc drive and companies love an add on I think thats the move at least for next gen,m1peiw1,5.0,1hchewf
comment,m1r8ux5,No-Bother6856,,1,2024-12-12 21:21:54,,,,Not that it necessarily means anything but Sony is actually one of the only companies who still hasnt removed the headphone jack from their latest smartphones Perhaps that may indicate a company that cares about not running off purists,m1peiw1,5.0,1hchewf
comment,m1rlg16,AnOddSprout,,1,2024-12-12 22:29:16,,,,keeping the headphone jack is keeping a feature which other phones do not have And for music enthusiasts its great too coz you can get a line connection So from a business standpoint it makes sense Sony offers customers something which other top brands do not So lets also apply the business standpoint for the disc drive Every game that is sold sony gets a cut of it If we have disc drive they sell it to a customer once and they get the profit of that one sale But they can lose out on profit from game sales if people go second hand which is a key selling point of physical games If i was sony and game devs id try and go fully digital as it means no second hand sales so every person that plays it would have to buy their own individual copy They can also just pass it off as this is the way that technology is going and leave it at that And at the end of the day Sony is a business They are not your friend Everything which they do is for the sake of profit,m1r8ux5,6.0,1hchewf
comment,m1rnutm,No-Bother6856,,1,2024-12-12 22:42:47,,,,I get that but if either microsoft or sony pulls the disk drive first the disc drive becomes that feature they have but the other one doesnt It would absolutely benefit them to dump the disc drive but neither side is likely to do so while they think it would lose them customers to the competition,m1rlg16,7.0,1hchewf
comment,m1s0fhr,AnOddSprout,,1,2024-12-12 23:57:23,,,,No I mean you could argue that but Xbox aint even completion anymore Its focus is games as a service Heck their next Xbox might just be a streaming stick and a controller And even if Xbox did push out an actual console And kept the disc drive Means nothing coz they literally have no games thats an actual Xbox exclusive If Sony keeps pushing out their console sellers it aint gonna mean much Especially since the majority of video game sales are digital now and thats just gonna increase My argument is that Xbox aint even worth looking at as completion anymore Not only coz they aint focusing on the same thing but also coz well they just really aint The only reason to pick up the series x is so I could play games from the 360ps3 era on a modern console,m1rnutm,8.0,1hchewf
comment,m1r8d4q,No-Bother6856,,1,2024-12-12 21:19:20,,,,In a vacuum I would think this extremely likely download only has been proven viable and it lets the hardware become cheaper while cutting out the retailers for game distribution however they arent in a vacuum so what we have is a bit of a game of chicken Whoever stops offering physical first risks losing customers to the other platform that still offers it I suspect it will take more time for them to normalize digital purchases before they feel comfortable risking losing the folks who demand physical to their competitor Not that it applies to a discussion about bluray but for what its worth nintendo has already confirmed backwards compatibility for switch games on their next console which means there will be a cartridge slot which probably means their next system will also distribute games that way,m1p9jb2,3.0,1hchewf

comment,m1pe8tg,Newtons2ndLaw,,1,2024-12-12 15:37:07,,,,Its been the biggest weird circle in my life with media In the early aughts I embraced digital music converted my several hundred CDs and only purchased digital Seeing the writing on the wall by the end of that decade instead of trying to upgrade my massive DVD collection to BR I thought everything will just be on demand in the future So I sold off my really great film collection for an average of 1 per disk those criterion special editions really hurt And now I cant even find something as mundane as Perfect Stangers to watch online without paying absurd feesprices In a world where corporations dont want you to own anything I feel I no longer belong 100 years from now they wont believe that people used to own copies of things like movies or albums,m1oinli,1.0,1hchewf
comment,m1puy1b,RDOCallToArms,,3,2024-12-12 17:04:51,,,,Theres a few shows I like to rewatch once a year or specific movies I want to watch for the holidays etc Physical media is so much easier and cheaper than having to find whatever streaming service has what I want to watch subscribing canceling and repeating the process next year You can get an entire box set of a long running TV show for under 50 Thats like a couple months of Netflix Like if I want to watch ER or some long running show with 200 episodes its cheaper to buy the discs than pay for many months of streaming service Plus streamers are constantly dumping stuff out of their library There will come a day sometime soon when shows like the original Quantum Leap Macgvyer or niche shows like Tales from the Crypt Black Mirror or Orhpan Black will basically be impossible to find streaming maybe not those shows specifically but those types of shows,m1pe8tg,2.0,1hchewf

comment,m1qd7hj,Roseking,,3,2024-12-12 18:38:39,,,,The main difference is the 820 has Dolby Vision Does your TV have Dolby Vision and do you care enough about it If yes get the 820 Samsung TVs are notable for not having Dolby Vision It also has 71 RCA connections but that likely isnt going to be a factor Most people would likely have an AVR for a speaker setup The processing is the same however So if you dont have Dolby Vision and dont plan on getting it during the period you have the player the picture will be the same,m1q1h5z,2.0,1hchewf

comment,m1rrx1u,bluesmudge,,3,2024-12-12 23:06:08,,,,The dialogue in TV shows and movies is so hard to hear now Person listening through the sound coming out the back of a 12 thick screen and mentally comparing it to the sound they remember from the CRT TV that had massive front firing speakers and lots of depth to work with but who thinks the problem is the content not their speakers,m1p4zes,3.0,1hchewf
comment,m1rbjzp,No-Bother6856,,1,2024-12-12 21:35:54,,,,Thats part of it but also it sounds like what you are describing is the audio being mixed for higher hynamic range than folks are used to For the loud parts of the movie to be actually loud they have to be substantially louder than the dialog which means anyone adjusting the volume for the loud parts to be comfortable will think the quiet parts are too quiet The intent is generally to set the volume so the dialog sounds natural and the loud parts blow you away but the loud parts being that loud is uncomfortable for a lot of folks Its sort of like how a lot of classical music requires really turning up the volume because most of the recording will be too quiet otherwise and the high volume is reserved for a few notable highs while most modern popular music is basically loud the whole time,m1p4zes,3.0,1hchewf

comment,m1pjw6t,stupid_horse,,1,2024-12-12 16:07:23,,,,Streaming looks good enough except for in dark scenes thats where the compression blows chunks It also has a lot more color banding At full price UHD is too expensive for me but I look out for sales and can regularly find them for 1012 Theres also regular bluray which is cheaper and still looks great I pick up used blurays from thrift stores and second hand shops for 23 all the time I understand why most people dont want to bother with looking for a deal and would just scoff at like 30 for a movie and at the same time dont want a bunch of plastic clutter in their house For me I hate subscription models and not owning anything and I enjoy the hunt for a good deal so collecting movies is a fun hobby for me,m1o7ypj,1.0,1hchewf

comment,m1pyfhh,MasterInterface,,3,2024-12-12 17:23:01,,,,I dont think UB820 is popular because its so much better than other player when it comes to quality but more that its consistent and reliable It also does a good job with dynamic tone mapping on movies without DVHDR10 but often hear this is feature is very valuable to those using it on a projector A lot of the UHD players also have freezing issues especially with triple layer disc which is not the case with Panasonic players The Sony UHD players are plagued with freezing issues When it works its great but when it doesnt then its a headache and will be a persistent issue,m1pnlr8,1.0,1hchewf

comment,m1vf983,Zod5000,,1,2024-12-13 15:42:13,,,,oh they were testing DV on a test release then opted not to release it that sucks I would of rather bought a game console as a Bluray player due to the extra functionality which I suppose is now moot as I bought the Panasonic a few years back,m1twd6i,7.0,1hchewf
comment,m1vfzsm,firedrakes,,1,2024-12-13 15:46:14,,,,it related to something with drm and handshakes seeing ms could afford the fee sony cheap out thru for the console fee for it and also for until the ps5 pro not used a full spec hdmi port on their ps5 aka they where using spares from ps4 pro models for the ps5 this gen console manf did odd stuff and cheap out as much as possible,m1vf983,8.0,1hchewf
comment,m1vh1t5,Zod5000,,2,2024-12-13 15:51:54,,,,Wouldnt the HDMI still support it though I do think what MS does is clever which is you have to download the bluray player app to play blurays I think that most likely means they dont pay the license unless someones actually using it Even if Sony charged 5 or 10 for an app in their online store to cover the cost of a Dolby Vision license Id pay it Seems like a small price to pay to turn the console into a solid bluray player,m1vfzsm,9.0,1hchewf
