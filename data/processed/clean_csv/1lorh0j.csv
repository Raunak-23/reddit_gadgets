comment,n0rojzb,Abigail716,,1,2025-07-01 14:57:07,,,,Pretty much Having money sets you up for future success if you take advantage of it For example my parents used their wealth to allow me to do things like travel the world and apprentice under top chefs in different countries Instead of sitting at home doing nothing I was able to continuously refine my education because I had the money for it and didnt need to work just to cover bills My husbands job is more about innate talent Hedge funds are one of the few jobs that are pretty much meritocracies You might be able to get an interview with the top fund because of connections but thats about all it can get you Maybe some fun would hire you just for the connection but youll never climb above a low level position Interestingly enough my husbands specific job being wealthy actually made it more difficult to get hired As a rule of thumb his boss typically does not hire people who come from money Says it makes them lazy unless motivated because they have a backup,n0rnp0r,7.0,1lorh0j
comment,n0sgexr,PurchaseStreet9991,,2,2025-07-01 17:06:18,,,,Pretty much Having money sets you up for future success if you take advantage of it Tbf taking advantage of it is basically as simple as being able to sign a check As a rule of thumb his boss typically does not hire people who come from money Says it makes them lazy unless motivated because they have a backup Basically for the same reason Someone who doesnt have to work is never going to be as good as someone who inherently has to value that work,n0rojzb,8.0,1lorh0j
comment,n0tcth9,Abigail716,,0,2025-07-01 19:36:42,,,,Hardly Signing a check doesnt get you the experience only the opportunity Signing a check got me there but its not like signing a check is going to wake me up at 500 am to work 12 hour days under some random chef for a month for moving to another part of the country to repeat the process to learn a different technique or culinary skill For example its because of my familys wealth I was able to aggressively pursue my education I have two bachelors degrees I have an MBA and I have a PhD No matter how big of a check you write you cant just magically implant that knowledge into someone and hand them the degrees I always find it interesting when people do believe that such as yourself because if that was the case you would see a lot more successful people that come from money It would be basically unheard of for some wealthy child to be a failure if all you need to do is sign a check to be successful Someone who doesnt have to work isnt necessarily going to be any worse But it does provide unique motivation knowing that if you fail if you decide to take a weekend off if you slack off and get fired its the end of your livelihood When your boss knows you have no plan B it provides them with a unique opportunity to exploit you They know youre not willing to go back to poverty,n0sgexr,9.0,1lorh0j

comment,n0pvr9h,techieman33,,135,2025-07-01 07:00:49,,,,It probably doesnt matter anyway since most manufacturers seem to be opposed to even normal CarPlay They want us off of it and on to their own software Then they can get back to charging us for data subscriptions map subscriptions and every other subscription they can think up,,0.0,1lorh0j

comment,n0qh6av,OperationMobocracy,,33,2025-07-01 10:31:37,,,,That may be their dream but AFAICT they have thrown millions at the problem internally and with OEM headunit makers and their software is garbage The only ones with a chance of getting away with it are expensive status cars where the car itself is a significant part of the buying motivation even then these people are affluent enough that they give them CarPlay anyway because they overwhelmingly use iPhones too IMHO the vast majority of people find most cars within a segment interchangeable and at this point not having CarPlay or Android Auto is a dealbreaker,n0pvr9h,1.0,1lorh0j

comment,n0qeefr,SmooK_LV,,2,2025-07-01 10:06:30,,,,There are cars with good software Tesla Xiaomi Rivian NIO and some other chinese brands Then there are cars with decent enough software Renault Volvo ie Android Automotive Then next best thing is either Android Auto or Apple CarPlay and this version still keeps it in same tier Then we have Hyundai Kia and Volkswagen software And at bottom of barrel BMWs Audis Porsche Suzuki Toyota Legacy automakers either need to go Android Automotive or support both wired wireless Android Auto CarPlay If they cant make a decent software for more than 15 years already then partner with someone who can And no I am not paying big bucks for a car just to have a cheap shitty software on it,,0.0,1lorh0j
comment,n0qi9el,OperationMobocracy,,4,2025-07-01 10:41:03,,,,A big help for the shitty software would be using SoCs and displays that werent overstock parts from 2018s most popular discount tablet I was kind of shocked in 2019 when I found out my 2019 Subarus chipset didnt even have 5 Ghz wifi support of any kind considering that the Snapdragon S4 released in 2012 had it Higher resolution displays coupled with speedier CPUs would paper over some of the bad design,n0qeefr,1.0,1lorh0j

comment,n0rhf7y,hmr0987,,1,2025-07-01 14:22:05,,,,I personally dont really understand all the hate for CarPlay Its one less system to configure and for the vast majority of OEM infotainment systems Apple does a much better job with the interface It certainly has come a long way and can still improve but I thoroughly much prefer CarPlay over my cars system Subaru Same is true for basically any rental in fact if you rent cars often CarPlay is a dream come true Just hop in and go no configuration needed and all your stuff is right on screen how you want it unless you want it to work wirelessly then you have to figure out how to connect it up The only argument I could get behind for CarPlay being bad is how its consolidates the whole market into one system No originality and no competition,,0.0,1lorh0j
