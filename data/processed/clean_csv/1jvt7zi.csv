comment,mme1ns3,Abigail716,,11,2025-04-10 14:03:39,,,,It can be a lot of fun My grandmother and I still exchange letters as our primary form of communication Its rarely anything time sensitive and it feels so much more special getting a handwritten letter Both of us always use calligraphy pens and wax seals to add to the fun Sometimes intentionally writing the letter to be overly dramatic to describe mundane events,mmd5vke,1.0,1jvt7zi

comment,mmd8h7h,JBWalker1,,14,2025-04-10 10:54:55,,,,I know theyre not as compact but a Royal Mail version of parcel lockers would be good They all seem to be Amazon and Evri but a Royal Mail one would have an edge by also having a post box in the middle of it too A post box for parcels will never be as good since they can accept larger parcels and you dont even need to add a post label or anything to the parcel youre dropping off so you therefore dont even need a printer at home which more and more people dnot these days They can also have security and reliability features like cameras and scales Obviously they can have fancy post boxes too but fancy royal mail lockers would be handy I think parcel lockers should be everywhere including at every train and tube station,,0.0,1jvt7zi

comment,mmerlna,JBWalker1,,3,2025-04-10 16:12:42,,,,Oh yeah looks like they do have some of their own They dont have post boxes integrated with them though which is an odd choice If a royal mail person is stopping there daily anyway they could collect a sack of mail too with just 1 minute longer But eh anyway its a private forgein company now sadly so I shouldnt care,mmdoaol,2.0,1jvt7zi
comment,mmdpndt,GrynaiTaip,,7,2025-04-10 12:55:33,,,,We got the first parcel lockers called postomats in Lithuania just a few years ago before covid and theyve been hugely successful Now there are multiple next to every grocery store Its super convenient you dont have to go to the post office to pick up your parcels these ones operate 247 Theres even a few refrigerated ones for food stuffs,mmd8h7h,1.0,1jvt7zi
comment,mn1y3we,KFR42,,1,2025-04-14 12:53:31,,,,Theres a royal mail locker at my local petrol station They already exist I suppose this is more aimed at areas without that kind of thing available,mmd8h7h,1.0,1jvt7zi
comment,mmf6p5d,Mattwildman5,,12,2025-04-10 17:26:17,,,,Used one of the Royal Mail lockers the other day Just walk up scan the QR it prints a label and you chuck it in a hatch 1000x better than the post office dance One of the rare occasions Im fully advocating for machines to replace people,,0.0,1jvt7zi
comment,mmf7q1o,Class08,,5,2025-04-10 17:31:11,,,,Id also be happy with the reverse of this like the Amazon lockers but Royal Mail I keep missing parcels because Im at work during the day but all my reasonable sized Amazon stuff just goes to the Amazon locker in my local supermarket,mmf6p5d,1.0,1jvt7zi
comment,mmfa14r,Mattwildman5,,-1,2025-04-10 17:42:11,,,,Pretty sure Royal Mail does this when using the locker it asked if I wanted to collect or send Unless Im thinking of inpost,mmf7q1o,2.0,1jvt7zi

comment,mn4vqjy,ledow,,1,2025-04-14 21:59:03,,,,They sold off the Royal Mail to a Czech billionaire only the other day They have no intention to improve postal services Theyve basically just privatised the last one and this is one of the attempts to make it look like things are better when actually the price has risen immensely were almost certainly losing weekend collections and deliveries and the 2nd class service to reduce costs even though those were listed as one of their universal service obligations Its a gimmick A bit like the recent stories about BT repurposing their cabinets to be electric car chargers They planned pitched for investment for 60000 such locations They converted one made a big fuss about it on the news and then immediately ditched the entire scheme,mmfgpf5,1.0,1jvt7zi

comment,mme348n,yarash,,3,2025-04-10 14:11:14,,,,US Post offices in general are only open during business hours It is impossible to drop off a package if you have a traditional 8595 job during the week The self drop off machines have been locked away in my area since covid I can make a call for a pickup but that means leaving a package out all day and risking it getting stolen Standard mail boxes are only equipped to pick up flat items,,0.0,1jvt7zi

comment,mmf8lxg,michaelkah,,0,2025-04-10 17:35:25,,,,We are here today to witness the opening of a new box to replace the box which used to stand at the corner of Ulverston Road and Sandwood Crescent Owing to the roadwidening programme carried out by the Borough Council the Ulverston Road box was removed leaving the wall box in Esher Road as the only box for the Ulverston Road area This new box will enable the people of the Ulverston Road area to post letters postcards and small packages without recourse to the Esher Road box or to the box outside the post office at Turners Parade which many people used to use but which has now been discontinued owing to the opening of this box and also the reorganization of box distribution throughout the whole area which comes into force with the opening of new boxes at the Wyatt Road Post Office in July,,0.0,1jvt7zi
