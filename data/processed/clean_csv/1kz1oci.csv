comment,mv44fhc,nimbusnacho,,13,2025-05-30 18:33:52,,,,Man its crazy tho to think about how different the world was when the Wii came out Not every device had Netflix pre installed Its very unlikely that you own a new TV now that doesnt just have a straight up Netflix button on the remote It seems unlikely that many people would use a switch app over any of the other better viewing options Maybe kids but I guess that isnt enough of a draw for Netflix,mv2cwmx,3.0,1kz1oci
comment,mv6zxqm,306bobby,,4,2025-05-31 04:31:10,,,,Tbf a switch is portable and a Wii isnt Having Netflix on a switch in my opinion is like having it on a phone or tablet,mv44fhc,4.0,1kz1oci
comment,mvehf8q,thegreatpotatogod,,1,2025-06-01 12:08:07,,,,Id argue its more valuable that way especially since the switch is designed to be docked to a TV Watch shows at home or on the go whereas a stationary device like the wii could always be supplemented with a roku or Apple TV or something similar these days,mv6zxqm,5.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv3fu1j,hornylittlegrandpa,,9,2025-05-30 16:39:11,,,,Yep Granted at the time getting streaming on your TV wasnt as simple as today Smart TVs werent really a thing yet so you needed an extra device like a Roku if you wanted to watch streaming Thus the Wii had the same value proposition as the PS2 its an affordable media device that can also play games,mv3cw7m,5.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv5z92u,whiskeyjack1053,,5,2025-05-31 00:26:18,,,,I just straight up dont understand it It would be entirely optional and not affect those who dont want it AT ALL The damn thing already has YouTube on it I often bring my chromecast when travelling because I would rather just connect that to my phone hotspot and have everything signed in on whatever tv is available rather than signing my services in on a device or network I dont trust I also bring my switch If the switch had all the streaming services I could leave my chromecast at home,mv2bjru,2.0,1kz1oci
comment,mv6hikr,131sean131,,2,2025-05-31 02:21:01,,,,The Switch sub HATES the idea of these things being added and its the stupidest shit Ive ever heard They have lost the plot and are convinced that they are the target audience for Nintendo The thing is Nintendo already has them buying there stuff so they DO NOT GIVE A FUCK about anyone outside of there core audience which are kids young teens etc and all of them normal people Reddit the echo chamber has convinced them they still matter and are being catered to and when something goes against that they lose there mind about it So they talk themselves into mental gymnastics to make everything Nintendo dose as part of there internal frame of reference Look at Nintendos marketing its kids and families and people who are at parties having fun together not dudes on reddit trying to recapture there childhood lol I think back to the moment in the car with a flashlight and the gameboy where Nintendo got me and they are trying to do that all the time All of this is not to say they wont take these people money bc Nintendo 100 will but they will change there core principles to capture every kid who is in the back of a caron a planetrain etc Once they have them they have them for life,mv2bjru,2.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv5b0ek,CamBeast15366,,1,2025-05-30 22:07:36,,,,Which is so weird because theres plenty of people like me who has their console hooked up to their main TV not everyone has a smart tv or a roku or firestick or Apple TV etc If my console that Im already going to have hooked up has the same streaming apps as anything else I will just use that instead of buying another device My switch account has maxxed out the hours on YouTube and Hulu at 9999,mv2bjru,2.0,1kz1oci

comment,mvaz86p,pixel_of_moral_decay,,1,2025-05-31 20:39:24,,,,Eh Netflix typically pays big money for placement If Netflix did strike a deal with Nintendo theyd for sure insist on a dedicated button and in a pretty good location Those Netflix button on tv remotes arent just because its popular and their position so you accidentally press it arent an accident Netflix pays good money for that because they know youll occasionally do that and see what theyre showing before you exit and a chance youll reengage Im sure theyd insist on it from Nintendo and Im sure Nintendo and its users wouldnt enjoy an easy to press prominent button that exits the game to open Netflix,mv2bjru,2.0,1kz1oci
comment,mvcti9q,Recon_Figure,,1,2025-06-01 03:16:35,,,,Why does everything have to stream video though As long as all those apps work well on it and it doesnt add to the cost its fine But I feel like everything else already can do that now And if they cant make it work well they shouldnt worry about it too much imo,mv2bjru,2.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv31vkp,BuffDrBoom,,38,2025-05-30 15:33:31,,,,The Wii U had a great browser and all the important streaming apps The online was free back then too Sadly something about the consoles failure broke nintendo after that and theyve been less consumer friendly ever since,mv29yic,2.0,1kz1oci
comment,mv4o4xj,Haltopen,,9,2025-05-30 20:11:21,,,,Having a web browser made piracy on Nintendo consoles much much easier thats why they dont have one anymore As for the streaming services I assume its just because Nintendo doesnt want to negotiate with companies about putting their streaming apps on Nintendo hardware Nintendo gets a cut of the money from every game sold on the device store but streaming apps are free and apps like Netflix and Disney arent going to give Nintendo a cut of every subscriber fee they get from their viewers so Nintendo has financial incentive to exclude them from their ecosystem so people on the switch are spending more time and money on things Nintendo gets a cut of,mv31vkp,3.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv5a73n,BuffDrBoom,,-1,2025-05-30 22:03:08,,,,Yes in general if Nintendos only goal was to make as much money as possible it would probably make more sense to nickle and dime their customers while providing as few features as they can get away with However that would be anti consumer hence my original post,mv58hud,6.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv5ve5d,Manticore416,,-1,2025-05-31 00:03:02,,,,Well they did but not directly All those apps were super easy to develop applets that utilized the internet browser already on the device Nintendo didnt include a browser on Switch because it made consoles too easy to hack and mod And apparently the only services willing to dedicate resources to developing a native app were Hulu and Crunchyroll And since Switch 2 doesnt natively run OG Switch software it seems they may need to either develop a translation layer or a new app if they want them on the new systems So yes Nintendo is the cause of the lack of streaming services but not for any conspiratorial reasons just conservative business practicing reasons,mv5u9vn,11.0,1kz1oci

comment,mv686jk,PikachuIsReallyCute,,1,2025-05-31 01:21:51,,,,I believe Hulu and Crunchyroll arent compatible and YouTube is still under testing and will likely need an update to work My best bet is theyre most likely planning on releasing a separate version of the apps due to the way the Switch 2 runs Switch 1 games In simple terms from my very limited understanding the games dont run natively but instead run through a translation layer This is actually a really good thing because from what Ive heard older games will run better just due to the nature of how theyll run Framerates and resolution are more likely to hit their capslikely docked caps in handheld mode docked mode on Switch 2 with no updates to games required If games are updated and tweaked mainly to raise frame caps or adjust resolution things again not the most tech savvy just going off of what Ive heard from those that are they could run at better resolutions and FPS But just due to this translation layer I could imagine itd maybe cause a couple of issues for these apps In particular Crunchyroll which was a bit buggy on Switch 1 but had the beautiful godlike addition of being able to download episodes to the console for offline viewing in handheld and docked Worked amazing as it essentially made it a streaming tablet on that app specifically without any load times resolution drops or buffering that comes with video streaming There wasnt really a cap on it which was a slight bit of an oversight considering the original Switchs total space it was easy to fill up all your native storage really fast lol But I recall there being a fair decent bit of bugginess that had me like deleting the app and redownloading it just from how it was poorly optimized concerning the downloads and how it all worked I could see that definitely leading to a very veeerrryyy buggy performance on Switch 2 Considering the popularity of the console theyve likely just gone back to repackage and put out a better optimized version of the app That being said Im still shocked Netflix HBO Max etc never came to the console Its kind of a really good fit considering it can either just be watched right from the TV or function as a tablet with a really really high quality screen with the OLED specifically HDR display in the Switch 2s case Not sure ifwhen Hulu would come but Im definitely curious as they are aware yknow Just a bit interesting to me,,0.0,1kz1oci
