comment,mclk0n8,Wakkit1988,,47,2025-02-13 19:08:16,,,,Trying to spread 50 amps evenly across 8 wires is a bigger nightmare The reason they melt is because the power isnt transferred cleanly across all of them and single wires will peak at over 20 amps of draw when only rated for 10 A standalone power supply would be no worse than the current situation but stands to be an improvement In any case one of the proposed solutions was to increase the output voltage on the GPU power output from the power supply to 36v or 48v completely eliminating the problem The excessive amperage draw would be completely eliminated since the peak individual draw across a wire would then be no more than 57 amps This is a problem that shouldve been solved a decade ago but theyve tried nothing and are all out of ideas,mckvgck,3.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcmor42,17Beta18Carbons,,46,2025-02-13 22:18:31,,,,Trying to spread 50 amps evenly across 8 wires is a bigger nightmare The reason they melt is because the power isnt transferred cleanly across all of them and single wires will peak at over 20 amps of draw when only rated for 10 Transferring 50 amps is not hard this has been a solved problem in electrical engineering for over a century You dont use more cables you use thicker cables which gives you a dramatically larger crosssection and avoids all the worries with load balancing Tech companies are just trying to reinvent the wheel because apparently wed rather risk electrical fires than build in an extra halfinch of clearance XT60 connectors have been the gold standard in RC and more recently ebikes for 30 years at this point Theyre rated for 60 amps continuous are significantly smaller than a 12VHPWR connector and can handle thousands of connection and disconnection cycles just fine The downside is that they use 2 relatively thick wires and therefore need a bit more room to have a 90degree bend in the cable Maybe instead of trying to fight physics we should just accept that cases need to get a halfinch wider or that you need some clearance below the GPU so the cable connects in a different direction edit some folks are talking about higher voltage as an alternative solution thats just not the limitation here There are ebikes with these XT60 connectors pulling over 3000 watts at 72v out of their battery with barely any measurable heat generation in the connector Thats double the wattage and triple the amperage youre even allowed to pull from a wall outlet with standard US wiring The issue isnt the connector its the obsession with using tiny wires so theyre easy to bend,mclk0n8,4.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcopm1n,17Beta18Carbons,,3,2025-02-14 05:28:22,,,,Ive no doubt the engineers at Nvidia are perfectly aware of this and tearing their hair out saying we told you so in all of the emergency meetings that are undoubtedly going on there Someone at Nvidia has made an executive decision to do a worse thing because it seems modern and cool Also you wouldnt actually want to use an XT60 connector inside a computer because theres no clip and you can just pull them apart it was just an easy example because theyre so ubiquitous There are other similar offtheshelf connector designs that would work just fine though,mcodg3p,6.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcww852,innociv,,1,2025-02-15 15:31:08,,,,Maybe instead of trying to fight physics we should just accept that cases need to get a halfinch wider or that you need some clearance below the GPU so the cable connects in a different direction They could also just have the connector facing 90 degrees outward from the front of the card or out the backplate Some cards do do this,mcmor42,5.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcplma0,silon,,1,2025-02-14 10:38:36,,,,20 amps of draw when only rated for 10 That seems like a huge difference unless the cableconnector is really bad or maybe somewould be using a dual rail PSU but Im not sure that is still a common thing,mclk0n8,4.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcmvzw0,Jusanden,,8,2025-02-13 22:54:59,,,,PCIE is differential its not ground referenced Your actual potential issues are congrats now the tdp of your card went up another 10 your size just ballooned by 34 of a PSU and congrats now you have a giant EMI emitting magnetics right next to your highly sensitive lines Fun,mckvgck,3.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcka15a,zz9plural,,7,2025-02-13 15:30:57,,,,Why 24V The only advantage would be less copper needed for the wires that transport the power to the card but those could already be much shorter with this solution,mck7r3a,2.0,1iojtt6
comment,mckdp2j,sarhoshamiral,,13,2025-02-13 15:48:45,,,,Less amps but your question is fair I didnt really think much about the voltage part I really like the idea of an external power supply though just for the GPU,mcka15a,3.0,1iojtt6

comment,mck5krj,Samwellikki,,253,2025-02-13 15:08:28,,,,Think the bigger issue is we are still using basic cables to connect and manage 600w on multiple wires without intelligent load management being built in somewhere This isnt a 1500w microwave with one fat cord and 3 wires or a washerdryer hookup on a beefy cable This is 600w going across spaghetti with I sincerely hope each wire shares evenly gifgiphyl0NwNrl4BtDD7JCx2,mcjyr9r,1.0,1iojtt6
comment,mck6enm,manofth3match,,148,2025-02-13 15:12:45,,,,I think the biggest issue is that this is simply an unsustainable power requirement for a component in a PC They are doing their base level architecture engineering with a focus on data center requirements and power requirements for graphics cards have become wholly unacceptable,mck5krj,2.0,1iojtt6

comment,mclzl0u,Protean_Protein,,17,2025-02-13 20:19:44,,,,Kind of I buy AMD personally But its just a fact that theyre not putting out cards that are competitive with Nvidia and arent even trying to do that But given what Nvidia are doing AMD doesnt even have to price their cards all that competitively Theres effectively a duopoly ignoring Intel that functions as a tiered monopoly Its bad,mclydwp,7.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckd6up,Samwellikki,,-13,2025-02-13 15:46:17,,,,Some of us need a new card its been a decade Will roll the dice and do what we can to mitigate but in the end this is a warranty issue that theyll have to solve if truly widespread and not attributed to anything else There should be a PSUlevel solution as I dont think any sort of smart load balancing chip on the GPU side would fix it Its more than just monitoring and maintaining power level like a conditioner within a UPS I think Not 100 sure though Maybe an addon between PSU and GPU could fix it if installed at the PSU connector side Problem is would have to be first party After cable mod debacle I doubt any third party is going to provide a solution that makes them responsible,mckbgns,5.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckr7gs,suddenlyreddit,,8,2025-02-13 16:52:33,,,,Weve reached the end of the line Not really This is an engineerable fix But thats part of the issue as well What if the solution requires a different connector type and engineering for future PC PSUs Thats a whole lot of followon changes for other manufacturers etc What if the solution is an additional power lead from PSUs Again that affects more parts within the PC system currently since there will be many left with not enough power outputs from currently deployed systems etc Overall its fixable but will very likely require more than just effort from NVIDIA on a fix But in the short term this is very bad for them with the current manufacturing going on for the cards and sales thereof This is also a great time for a competitor to seize some market share if they can push additional GPU power and features and maintain better stability I dont think were at the end of the line yet Certainly I remember very low wattage early PCs and lack of dedicated GPUs even Weve come a long way Power requirements have grown but we arent outside of being able to make it work Not yet I guess well see what happens here and how they handle things,mckicb2,4.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcl7xlu,CamGoldenGun,,3,2025-02-13 18:10:57,,,,exactly They just need to make a new standard of cable that can handle the load 4 Gauge cable would handle it but thered need to be new connectors unless you want to screw it in like a cars audio system,mckr7gs,5.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcpp6el,shazarakk,,0,2025-02-14 11:13:45,,,,They could also just make the power delivery on the GPU side competently instead For a single 50 amp wire youd need a total cross section of about 133mm² or 6 gauge lets go with 4 gauge21mm² assuming the next card has an 800w limit Contra 6 cables with 16 gauge 13mm² cross section what Cablemod uses which should in theory take 90 total amps They did that with the 3090 and 3090TI which didnt exactly melt all that much What happens is when your load is balanced and youre only pulling 85A per wire no problems occur excepting user error or manufacturing mistake But because of the power delivery system the load ends up imbalanced and one wire ends up delivering more current than the others Note that its usually one or two wires that have melted not the entire connector at first,mcl7xlu,6.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcklcxb,Agouti,,30,2025-02-13 16:25:29,,,,100 correct I worked on some pretty high powered projects in my career and one of the big golden rules was never run cables in parallel to meet current handling requirements You just cannot guarantee that you wont have a minor ohm mismatch in the connections or cables that would cause one to exceed its capacity There were so many ways to fix this The absolute easiest would have been simply to go back to independent 12v rails on the PSU as a requirement for 12vHPWR Or go higher voltage up to 48V like power tools and USBC did,mck5krj,2.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcq1y0h,doctorcapslock,,1,2025-02-14 12:57:44,,,,without intelligent load management being built in somewhere im not sure load balancing would help in this case say the load measures a higher contact resistance on one of the wires but the power requested is still 600 W if another wire is to pick up the slack when its already at the limit it will result in overheating in a different wirepin or a reduction in performance the only solution that both maintains performance and increases thermal overhead is a reduction the total contact resistance ie the connector must be bigger andor more must be connections must be made,mck5krj,2.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckoohf,drmirage809,,25,2025-02-13 16:40:44,,,,Nvidia had the brilliant idea because their top end cards eat an absolutely staggering amount of power The 5090 is almost 600 watts And thats stock No boosts no overclock nothing So instead of sticking a bunch of the old 8 pin on there they instead came up with this small thing It supposedly is good for 600 watts but the cables have been melting since the 4090 AMD just said fuck it and stuck more old school 8 pins on their cards,mckgly4,2.0,1iojtt6
comment,mclmoly,Wakkit1988,,11,2025-02-13 19:20:33,,,,So instead of sticking a bunch of the old 8 pin on there they instead came up with this small thing It supposedly is good for 600 watts but the cables have been melting since the 4090 Fun fact The images of the prototype 50XX cards all have four 8pin connectors on the card They were literally engineered utilizing them They cut back to the single connector for production They absolutely know this is a problem but are passing the buck to consumers to save pennies on cards selling for thousands,mckoohf,3.0,1iojtt6
comment,mctiwkr,dugg117,,2,2025-02-14 23:48:43,,,,kinda nuts that the 3090 solved this problem by treating the single connector like 3 and balancing the load And that would likely have solved the issue for the 4090 and 50905080,mckoohf,3.0,1iojtt6

comment,mck4yox,aposi,,61,2025-02-13 15:05:17,,,,Theres two problems here the safe limits of the cable and the uneven current distribution The 5080 is within the safe limits of the cable while the 5090 has next to no safety margin The uneven current distribution is a problem that can affect both because theres no load balancing on the GPU side of the connector It could affect most 5000 series cards the specific cause of the uneven load isnt clear yet but theres nothing in place to stop it,mcjvlvh,1.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcms1by,soulsoda,,19,2025-02-13 22:34:54,,,,It could affect most 5000 series cards the specific cause of the uneven load isnt clear yet but theres nothing in place to stop it It will affect all 50 series cards that use 12Vhpwr or 12V2x6 and use anything close to 400watts because thats simply how electricity works Electricity follows the path of least resistance Nvidia did load balancing on the card for the 3090 and we didnt hear anything about cables melting despite being 12vhpwr because the worst case scenario is that any single wire of 6 had to deal with 200 watts The worst case scenario for the 4050 series is that a single wire could have to deal with 600 watts This made improper contact a huge issue Each improper contact means another wire not properly sharing the load and thats a death sentence because the safety factor on the cable is only 11 you cant afford a single dud on the cable when your using over 500w Improper contact aside its still an issue just running the card Even if material and coating was identical theres still going to be minute differences thats unnoticeable by any reasonable human measurement in the resistance that the majority of current will flow through a couple wires out of the available 6 Causing wires to have to deal with 2030 amps instead of 910 all because Nvidia cant be arsed to balance their God damn load,mck4yox,2.0,1iojtt6

comment,mctx4tw,soulsoda,,2,2025-02-15 01:13:54,,,,It should be A 5080 TDP is only 360 watts Youd have to overclock it to get up to 450 watts Theres also might be cases where power draw might peak instantaneously above 400450watts even if not OCd but youd have to OC to have any sustained load The wire is supposed to deliver a max of 95A x 12v x 6 pins 684 watts Specified for 600 watts and a safety factor of 11 Every bad connection removes 114 watts from the safe power cap If you had badfaulty connection on say 2 of the 6 pins youre already down to 457 watts of safe delivery and thats not accounting for the fact the load isnt balanced so theres no telling if youve got wires running way above spec unless you measure them The cable will survive 2030A for a few mins on an individual wire but eventually the connectors are gonna melt and itll be too late to save your card once you smell burning plastic my advice is to not OC this generation and rather set target power to 7080 Itll take some tweaking on clock speeds but youll probably lose 5 performance but the card efficiency will sky rocket and save you some on energy bills I know like half of enthusiasts hate that type of advice i paid for X i want it to do what its made for but thats my personal opinion my other advice is to inspect the wire gently like barely any force at all tug on each wire on your 12vHPWR12v 2x6 cable and see if the pins move If theres a loose pin you probably wont get good contact on it as its lose and will get pushed out or even slip out a bit if you ever finagle with your pc despite the connector being fully seated Also visually inspect the wire to ensure the pins are at the same level in the connector stupid we have to do this but thats where we are Edittypos grammar,mctsl3d,4.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckz73t,jonboy999,,13,2025-02-13 17:29:50,,,,Not really since current is what dictates the cross sectional area of wire required and power is not dissipated by the wire but by the device itself Increasing the voltage of a device and therefore reducing the current needed is one way to reduce the size of wire required while keeping the same power output,mckyq3k,5.0,1iojtt6
comment,mcl79ie,mortaneous,,6,2025-02-13 18:07:45,,,,To be pedantic the wire does dissipate some power which is why a lot of industrial wiring ratings will specify the rated current with an acceptable temperature rise or temperature limit eg 14 copper with THHN insulation is rated for 25A at 90C With PC power supplies using aluminum wire and finer gauge the ampacity is even lower and they probably also use lower temperature rated TW or UF or worse,mckz73t,6.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcpon72,jonboy999,,1,2025-02-14 11:08:34,,,,I am in no way an expert but the higher the voltage the more risk to life High voltage can drive current through high resistance objects like people Also at very high voltage arcing is more likely so a higher fire risk Very high voltage is used to save money for long distance transmission across country but the wires are much more difficult to access so its less of a safety risk,mcooi6q,7.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcliiij,ScourJFul,,3,2025-02-13 19:01:17,,,,A 3070 is fine for modern gaming Now you are obviously running into modern games that are definitely pushing the 3070 to its limit but if you can concede some of that stuff it wont matter If you really needed to upgrade I wouldnt go the 5000 series due to their extremely high cost and extremely low availability Especially considering how disappointing they are when they are basically only a 30 increase in power than their 4000s equivalents but at a ridiculous price point The best thing to do IMO is wait or find a 4000 series card on sale or for cheap Or alternatively go to AMD which always will have better bang for you buck if you needed to upgrade from the 3000 series For comparison an NVIDIA card typically costs about 100 to even 300 more than an AMD card that performs similarly Granted if you care for the Ray Tracing then NVIDIA is the better option NVIDIA is rapidly becoming more of a luxury item due to their really fucked price to performance value on their cards I will say for a 3070 upgrade if you wanted to have more VRAM and better bang for your buck look into AMDs 7800XT to 7900 XTX Or the 9070XT which apparently will be priced aggressively which doesnt mean fuck all atm until we actually know the price and specs But most importantly if you wanted to upgrade your 3070 you need to get something for cheap IMO Paying full price or even higher than that for a card is not worth it cause your upgrade options arent that much better to justify paying for it You can likely find some deals right now on some 4000 cards dont get a 4060 since people are selling their used cards for a 5000s card,mckc8is,6.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckr2sf,Levester,,14,2025-02-13 16:51:56,,,,I built a new PC for a 4090 less than a year ago I use it for work related stuff gaming the fact that theyre advertising 50 series around 4090 equivalence is so ridiculous to me laughable nonsense imo I could offer tips for parts but honestly the main thing you need to know is that no game actually requires a 4090 or anything close to it For purely gaming purposes you dont need to even get close to the top of the line You just need to spend 1015 minutes playing with settings Its the unfortunate truth about todays PC games I can run games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 maxed out and get 170180 fps at 1440p beautiful game lots of fun highly recommend it turning down just a couple settings shoots my fps up to a very very steady 240 which is my monitor limit and no matter how hard I look for it I honestly cannot spot the difference at all Keep in mind that KCD2 is decently well optimized but like 99 of games today therere tiny graphical settings that will make near zero difference in fidelity and yet will cost you disproportionately in performance,mck7pg9,1.0,1iojtt6

comment,mckcyab,stellvia2016,,3,2025-02-13 15:45:07,,,,The problem is they keep trying to produce the least expensive connector that wont fail and keep missing the mark Theyre putting 5056A across 8 pins with no load balancing which is 10 or less headroom and just assuming it will spread out evenly Thats not nearly enough tolerance for something like this The usual rule of thumb for critical things is at least 23x their rated load This is absolutely on Nvidia for cheaping out on cards they already charge an obscene amount of money for,mck90wg,4.0,1iojtt6

comment,mcl0v44,random_reddit_user31,,4,2025-02-13 17:37:45,,,,People have done this for years with 86 pin PCIE connectors and havent melted their PC Most people arent aware that mixing cables is a risk and they shouldnt need an electrical degree on how to plug a GPU power connector in While some of these cases are user error the cable should be robust enough to factor in the user error like the prior connections did Also its been looked at by electrical engineers and they are saying its flawed People need to stop blaming ourselves and blame the company thats charging high prices and who put more RD in their coolers than the basics of safety first Im checking my 4090 daily because Im paranoid even when using the PSUs 12VHPWR cable We shouldnt be in this position at all let alone when these GPUs cost over a grand Its unacceptable,mckajlo,1.0,1iojtt6
