comment,lvi5di6,diacewrb,,0,2024-11-05 11:03:08,,,,PS2 also had a Linux kit The PS3 was used in supercomputer clusters Sony lost money on each PS3 sold but made up the difference on games and accessories then these clusters were costing them money The US Air Force was legendary for buying 1760 consoles and building one of the worlds most powerful supercomputers at a fraction of the normal price If they had used a regular supercomputer then the cost would have been 10 times as much,lvhrxbo,3.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvdm23f,Tandoori7,,21,2024-11-04 17:23:52,,,,Am talking about LDAC a popular encoder for Bluetooth that has way better quality than aac Apple uses a modified aac in their headphones but if you connect SonyBoseanything else the quality will be way worst in iphonesipads than in iMacsandroid windows and even Linux I learned this the hard way when I bought my sister some xm4s and they sounded way worst in her iphone than my android,lvdl8c8,3.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvec45q,ThinkExtension2328,,7,2024-11-04 19:30:44,,,,To be fair all Bluetooth standards sound like shit even LDAC is terrible shit Headphone jacks have existed for so long for a reason But nowadays the mix and master of music is kinda shit too soo thats fun If you think Im being old man yells at clouds I challenge you to listen to Michael Jacksons thriller on a good pair of wired headphones and then listen to any modern song Modern stuff is just loud and distorted and lacks the dynamic range and soundstage the old stuff had,lvdm23f,4.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvdxpaz,abrahamisaninja,,-4,2024-11-04 18:20:17,,,,Make sure you install the Sony Connect app if you havent already XM4 sounds great on iPhone but if you dont use the app the EQ tends to sound really flat,lvdm23f,4.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvevplm,Tandoori7,,2,2024-11-04 21:07:01,,,,Its not about EQ its about sound being all compressed due to a shitty codec,lvdxpaz,5.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvhn181,abrahamisaninja,,1,2024-11-05 07:40:16,,,,Well for 999999 of people who use headphones I think its safe to say most of us arent using them primarily to mix or master music most of the time So if the headphones trend more street as you say I think thats perfectly fine and hell even preferred,lvf8dvc,8.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvdlvo4,DreVahn,,16,2024-11-04 17:23:02,,,,My company orders 30 Airs with pens Vendor ships new Airs with M4 and older model Apple pens They dont sync Have to return the 30 pens for newer model Yes thats on the vendor but that says its not so easy,lvd5ohl,1.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvda8g0,tfrw,,4,2024-11-04 16:25:36,,,,I mean apple headphones do have advantages We also dont know if apple is making headphone makers pay apple for validating headphones,lvd5ohl,1.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdgesb,Dependent-Zebra-4357,,8,2024-11-04 16:56:27,,,,Where is Apple validating headphones Surely if they were there would be a prominently displayed list on their website And I think its pretty dangerous to go after a product because it has advantages over competing products Thats the path to everything just being the lowest common denominator What is the motivation to improve your products when the government is going to block you from shipping that improvement or force you to give that improvement to your competition,lvda8g0,2.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdpisl,Got2Bfree,,3,2024-11-04 17:40:39,,,,Try to pair air pods and any other Bluetooth headphones The airpods connect immediately when you open the case Apple could open up an API so every pair of headphones could behave this seamlessly This has nothing to do with the lowest common denominator This is just apple artificially locking their system,lvdgesb,3.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lve59qw,Dependent-Zebra-4357,,8,2024-11-04 18:57:00,,,,Its not just a software difference that can be provided via an API call though The reason AirPods work so well with Apple products is because of the custom W1 and more recently H1H2 chips Apple designed for the AirPods Do you think Apple should be forced to sell that chip to their competitors If so where does that line of thinking end Should they be required to sell M series chips also,lvdpisl,4.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvedd4q,Got2Bfree,,-5,2024-11-04 19:36:56,,,,A Auto connect feature similar to air pods is available in Android so this is 100 doable with just Bluetooth A chip is of course IP I draw the line at artificial locking of systems Third party manufactures should have the possibility to interact with system components to full extent Locking face ID and true tone is another perfect example Im pro right to repair,lve59qw,5.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lveqrd7,INACCURATE_RESPONSE,,4,2024-11-04 20:42:49,,,,Bluetooth auto connect works on iPhone It just sucks because it gets stolen by any other device that has it turned on,lvedd4q,6.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvf593h,Got2Bfree,,-1,2024-11-04 21:55:05,,,,No I mean the one with a popup where you dont have to click on the device you want to connect Theres something similar in Android which only Bluetooth devices support,lveqrd7,7.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvitsah,benanderson89,,1,2024-11-05 14:01:10,,,,Can connect both via Bluetooth Surely a non issue Absolute nonissue Ive used my AirPods Max with my Xiaomi Phone and my Heavys H1H with my iPad Likewise you can already buy a third party pen for the iPad and it works absolutely fine,lvd5ohl,1.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdczf5,Hobbit1996,,-10,2024-11-04 16:39:34,,,,apple literally makes other devices perform worse just an example Was in a 2012 fiat forgot the model im not a car person 2 android devices play music just fine apple connects and the bitrate of what we are listening to is clearly lower nearly unusable Why idk ask apple ig we shouldve had a newer car with carplay or something,lvd5ohl,1.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvdpcvz,Miguelboii,,2,2024-11-04 17:39:50,,,,It probably went in some sort of old headset mode With older headsets I think it depends on the bluetooth version it lowers the audio quality presumably to be able to get enough data from the microphone This is something that is like that on iOS and Android I experienced this myself once when I wanted to use an early 2010 single inear headset as wireless headphones,lvdczf5,2.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdqssd,Hobbit1996,,4,2024-11-04 17:46:49,,,,im getting downvoted but why does it work with android and not ios,lvdpcvz,3.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdrrqw,Miguelboii,,1,2024-11-04 17:51:31,,,,The way the devices handle it is just different Quite possibly as soon as you do anything with your microphone on the android phone it also switches to this low quality audio mode,lvdqssd,4.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lve0hmk,Hobbit1996,,-1,2024-11-04 18:33:48,,,,but im talking about music nothing to do with mic or calls,lvdrrqw,5.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvdn2bz,AsshollishAsshole,,26,2024-11-04 17:28:39,,,,LOL How about smartwatches I cant use the latest samsung gear with an iphone I believe it is the same with apple watch and samsung phone Same for basically any manufacturer,,0.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lvdgxtk,kawag,,28,2024-11-04 16:59:01,,,,I think this is a bit excessive Smart pens do not seem like such a significant market that there would be antitrust concerns I dont think its fundamentally anticompetitive to sell accessories without establishing a full thirdparty ecosystem A PlayStation does not work with Xbox controllers all thirdparty controller support is extremely limited and while I think thats a bit consumerunfriendly I dont think its an antitrust matter,,0.0,1gjhbm5
comment,lviiccs,NuttFellas,,3,2024-11-05 12:49:42,,,,Every other tablet vendor offers it Youre asking why but we should really be asking why not It may not be much but it has been a problem for a while as other users have mentioned with smartwatch compatibility etc,lvdgxtk,1.0,1gjhbm5

comment,lvhw71z,AbyssalRedemption,,0,2024-11-05 09:23:22,,,,Tbh it seems an odd choice to say the least that the EU keeps going after Apple for this type of stuff Nitpicking even Theres much bigger fish to fry and Apple is hardly the worst offender out there their most egregious offense in the industry is their walled garden ecosystem or at least that seems to be what the EU believes Keep going after Google and Amazon and Facebook instead,,0.0,1gjhbm5
