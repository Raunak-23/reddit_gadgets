comment,mhdgyqt,CandyCrisis,,42,2025-03-12 12:28:53,,,,Its so hard to pick a good vacuum robot All the reviews cover is MAXIMUM POWER and I could care less I want it to be quiet and to never get stuck My ideal is a robot that runs every evening at 2AM but doesnt wake anyone up avoids junk that got left on the floor and doesnt get stuck on rugs or inside chair legs,mhd57z9,2.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhdnarr,tony__pizza,,89,2025-03-12 13:09:08,,,,Vacuum Wars on YouTube He has hundreds of selfpurchased Robot and traditional vacuums that he independently reviews against standardized tests Hes constantly improving his methodologies too One of his recent videos goes into how hes updating his robot vacuum mopping tests because he doesnt feel they were fair so hes systematically going back through every robot mop and retesting them He also maintains a website where he ranks all robot vacuums and has various categories for budget and criteria like homes with lots of dogs or all tile or all hardwood or whatever Incredible dude that is totally committed to a super confusing niche of gadgets His websites list presumably contains Amazon affiliate links tldr Roborock tends to be the best brand overall and their budget options usually beat out other brands high end models However other brands may have specific patents for featurestech that specifically benefit your use case,mhdgyqt,3.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhjpgpe,Peter_Nincompoop,,0,2025-03-13 11:20:43,,,,So you want a vacuum which traditionally is a very loud device because it needs to move large mounts of air in order to be effective to have the power to clean well and do it all by itself without getting stuck on anything despite your inaction to pickup after yourself in the middle of the night without waking you Good luck with that,mhdgyqt,3.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhk0iw0,CandyCrisis,,4,2025-03-13 12:39:29,,,,Yeah thats what Im looking for Ive seen lowend vacuum robots that are quiet actually They do an okay enough job for me cleaningwise They just have the other lowendrobot issues navigation sucks not enough battery to do a house they get lost etc,mhjpgpe,4.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhnwg5z,None,,1,2025-03-14 00:12:02,,,,Ive only ever owned a Roborock and a Deebotabsolute POS do not recommend but the Roborock is absolutely indestructible It maps perfectly in my house cleans great has only gotten stuck twice in the year that Ive had it and empties perfectly every time I would love to try some other brands if they werent so expensive but I cant imagine any of them working better than my Roborock Q5,mhdkxfk,3.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhdraog,Reniconix,,-4,2025-03-12 13:32:17,,,,My wife has a roborock she named Dwayne Unfortunately kids thought Dwayne was thirsty and killed him We recently got a new Roomba named by the kids Broomba because theyre so creative She was upset I didnt buy another Roborock But anyway the only reason I bought the Roomba instead was because it had a massive black Friday sale like 60 on it and it made the thing cost less than a Roborock with less features Based on just MSRP an identical Roborock would have been 150 or 200 cheaper,mhdkxfk,3.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhgs39t,NotAHost,,3,2025-03-12 22:27:06,,,,Computer vision lidar Lidar isnt the cheapest but its damn good Roomba was doing the Tesla thing which is thinking because cameras are cheap and provide more info object recognition we gotta make them work for mapping However its a lot harder and relatively computationally expensive for a cheap device LiDAR is simple in comparison Once you have solid mapping and with how cheap compute power is getting you bring in computer vision again and start doing things like cable and poop recognition But good mapping has to be a foundation,mhfbkuc,3.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhiy0fl,calcium,,3,2025-03-13 06:45:35,,,,Musk has tried this with Tesla and I think their safety record reflects this Its probably fine for something like a robot vacuum where the worst issue is that it bumps into something or falls down the stairs but its a lot cheaper than lidar,mhgs39t,4.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhcmar9,Kikkia,,16,2025-03-12 07:46:09,,,,I robot went all in on a camera system that looked at the ceiling of the room Not exactly sure why they did not if they thought maybe you could add any more functionality down the line or was cheaper But it had a bunch of drawbacks including but not limited to working under furniture and in low light condition,mhbgbo0,1.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhgscmo,NotAHost,,1,2025-03-12 22:28:26,,,,Itll happen The crash rate will just be 10100x higher than a fsd car with lidar If people are scared of planes even if they are statistically safer I think theyll be even more scared of fsd cars that are known to be more likely to kill you,mhe41zz,2.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhdijwy,allogator,,5,2025-03-12 12:39:17,,,,Jeebus I had never heard of Roborock and that website is atrocious My Neato BotVac has been going strong for 8 years but with them going out of business Ive been looking around sporadically whenever a sale goes up The other companies have limited models and its generally pretty easy to compare features This Roborock site is like Heres 500 different models that all have one thing differenthave fun figuring it out Dont get me wrong Ive seen enough people in this post say that Roborock is amazing and Ill go dig around some more and research but I cant picture anyone with limited tech knowledge looking at this site and not backing away slowly EDIT not really since I went back just to glance over the site to double check my hyperbole wasnt too insane before submitting I did finally find a See all Models and Help me Choose button It was like halfway down the page and hidden in between some other blocky pictures See all Models is still a little too janky but yeeshthey definitely need better site design,mhd630e,1.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhc5z91,None,,11,2025-03-12 05:04:22,,,,thats the false middle option tactic that makes you evaluate the mid option as not a good enough deal so its go big or go home then spend more money Apple does this with the base model and upgrade pricing,mhc3y0s,3.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhdodv6,andynator1000,,-1,2025-03-12 13:15:33,,,,Engineers in my experience tend to be unable to understand the concept of simplifying a product lines Its why Apple historically has reduced the number of product lines to reflect different budgets rather than features An engineer with the choice of two different screens and three different processors would build six phones while a product team would prefer to make three with the cheaper screen going to the base model This explains why Intel driven mostly by engineers makes dozens of CPU SKUs and Nvidia driven by product people makes only a few SKUs,mhbu98z,2.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhji6e3,ThePretzul,,1,2025-03-13 10:17:30,,,,Nah man speaking as an engineer myself most engineers hate the stupidly large product lineups because it means vastly more documentation and development required for a product family launch Plus if youre not working on the cool one then you just get to watch while other engineers make the fancy model with all the bells and whistles while youre stuck in meetings with bean counters All of whom are telling you that the parts you specced for the budget models are 002unit too expensive so you need to go through an exhaustive supplier search process all over again Most engineers would be happy to work on a single overcomplicated and overfeatured model because then they get to do more interesting things andor a single simple model because theres beauty in simplicity too,mhdodv6,3.0,1j97rv0

comment,mhdj7ho,enki941,,1,2025-03-12 12:43:31,,,,I remember when Roomba first came out and it had zero builtin intelligence when it came to mapping It would just bounce around randomly often overlapping and frequently getting itself stuck in weird places for long periods of time When people asked why it didnt map the room or something similar the iRobot people said they did tests studies etc and randomly bouncing around aimlessly was the best method for cleaning a room Of course that sounded like horsecrap back then and since then they added some mapping logic and now this new lidar system So I think the real answer is and always has been they either were incapable of doing it correctly or wanted to do it as cheaply as possible and sell us an inferior and pretty expensive product with some marketing snake oil to spin the flaws as pros TLDR They lied to us,,0.0,1j97rv0
comment,mhdygcr,buildallthethings,,1,2025-03-12 14:11:06,,,,I still like the bouncing method I just wish it could incorporate mapping to not get stuck The new ones follow the same exact path every time and press ruts into carpet pile,mhdj7ho,1.0,1j97rv0
