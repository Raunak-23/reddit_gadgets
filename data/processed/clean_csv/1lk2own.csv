comment,mzrbg99,PocketNicks,,2,2025-06-25 20:04:22,,,,Yeah I think the max an appliance can pull on a North American outlet is around 1800w before tripping the breaker Even on a 20amp circuit,mzonj7o,2.0,1lk2own
comment,n05j9ct,DragonSlayerC,,2,2025-06-27 23:22:16,,,,No a 20 Amp breaker will trip at 2400W Ive pulled a little over 2300W from the wall before for only a couple of minutes Maybe youre thinking of the 80 rule which states that any device that continuously draws energy shouldnt pull more than 80 of the rated amperage limit That puts a 15A breaker at 1500W hence all the 1500W space heaters or 1920W for a 20A breaker That being said a device that draws over 1800W needs the right plug If youve ever wondered why many outlets have an extra horizontal cut on the left prong that for devices that can pull over 15A Devices that do that however are quite rare I dont think Ive ever actually seen one,mzrbg99,3.0,1lk2own
comment,n05kzul,PocketNicks,,1,2025-06-27 23:32:12,,,,Yup thats what I said A single device can only pull around 1800w Your explanation was more thorough for sure,n05j9ct,4.0,1lk2own

comment,mzosb58,Small_Editor_3693,,23,2025-06-25 12:46:12,,,,Think you are mixing up units here Watts vs Watt hours The average household in the United States consumes approximately 893 kWh per month or about 30 kWh per day,mzomy99,1.0,1lk2own

comment,mzywmnt,Small_Editor_3693,,3,2025-06-26 22:57:15,,,,Watts is equivalent to speed watt hours is equivalent to distance travelled if that makes sense So a watt is actually joules per second So it is the speed of energy You multiply it by time and you get the total energy used or work Electricians and physicists just put watt hours cause we have to make everything more complicated,mzytf65,3.0,1lk2own
comment,mzv818a,TOBIjampar,,1,2025-06-26 11:49:53,,,,900 kWh per month I guess it is that high because of heating right We used 1400 kWh over the last year approx 4 kWh per day in our two person household with fulltime working from home,mzosb58,2.0,1lk2own
comment,mzp7iqx,Impossible-Hyena-722,,-14,2025-06-25 14:09:06,,,,20 of 30kwh is 6kwh At 2600 watts that card could burn through 6kwh in just over 2 hours of intense gaming Thats easy to do for the average PC gamer,mzosb58,2.0,1lk2own
comment,mzp8uaf,Small_Editor_3693,,18,2025-06-25 14:15:29,,,,Ok But 2600 watts is not in any way able to be compared to a watt hour without running it for some time If you ran it for 24 hours thats double power consumption of your house by itself 20 is a vast under estimate cause they mis understood the units,mzp7iqx,3.0,1lk2own
comment,mzpcfxg,Impossible-Hyena-722,,5,2025-06-25 14:32:56,,,,Maybe Maybe not Maybe he assumed his average game time and came up with 20 off the cuff Maybe he has no idea what a watt hours is But his statement is technically correct and plausible And as we all know being technically correct is the best kind of correct,mzp8uaf,4.0,1lk2own
comment,mzpebkq,Small_Editor_3693,,0,2025-06-25 14:41:55,,,,It is not technically correct to say 2600 watts is 20 of any KWH,mzpcfxg,5.0,1lk2own

comment,mztzhfx,8day,,-2,2025-06-26 05:14:49,,,,Thats not the issue there are multiple wires and one of them can draw much more than it can handle If that is true and depending on how much excess power goes through it it doesnt matter what type of existing connector they will use Basically it just needs thicker connector wires and probably wider electrical lines on the board,mzr7wgk,2.0,1lk2own
comment,mzu6ukf,chaotic_goody,,3,2025-06-26 06:17:10,,,,Hey Im trying to learn so could you elaborate on this My understanding was that the 12VHPWR is finicky and potentially powering through a GCHPWR avoids this issue are you saying that the issue is internal to the nvidia video cards so the external power connector doesnt matter,mztzhfx,3.0,1lk2own

comment,mzu7xma,8day,,0,2025-06-26 06:26:57,,,,Maybe older connectors are better and are less susceptible to the issue but if what everyone says about unbalanced power consumption is true then the issue is with the cards themselves Its like when shoes wear out faster on one leg you can get sturdier soles but it wont fix the root of the issue unbalanced load,mzu6ukf,4.0,1lk2own
comment,mzupjo6,unematti,,5,2025-06-26 09:17:34,,,,The only reason theyre unsafe is because they left out the monitoring from a 2000 dollareuro card Lets not forget the amateurish engineering on those cards,,0.0,1lk2own

comment,n0d77a6,Gogo202,,1,2025-06-29 06:08:05,,,,This solves the problem of GPU connectors If a new connector is introduced to he motherboard then thats also an opportunity to use the correct connector there Also seems easier for users to me Basically shifts responsibility to motherboard manufacturers which I prefer because there is more competition,mzp6gv5,1.0,1lk2own
comment,n0gg1es,danlorlg,,1,2025-06-29 19:28:54,,,,You will continue to have the exact same issues as before The ATX cables and connectors are not designed to carry hundreds of amps of power MB vs card power routing is irrelevant We need proper connectors This should have also been addressed in the new ATX 12v standard but it wasnt,n0d77a6,2.0,1lk2own
comment,mzpyhh4,TheOtherBelushi,,0,2025-06-25 16:16:10,,,,Thats 216 amps at 120 volts Most home wiring is 14 AWG set on a breaker that trips above 15 amps To ensure you dont burn your house down you would have to run a new 10 AWG wire to a 30 amp breaker just to operate your PC with this card in it running at the full 2600 watts,,0.0,1lk2own
