comment,mjp9n6g,ronnie1014,,2,2025-03-25 18:44:54,,,,It was very good coming from someone who played the games Nailed the cartoonish feel they have at times with such sinister and depressing undertones I need to rewatch it because they were laying some serious groundwork right out the gate that I completely missed Highly recommend it,mjjrkt0,8.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjtkjgl,spdorsey,,1,2025-03-26 12:18:28,,,,I really dont think Apple would allow any tech on their watch that would degrade the battery life to the point where it would not go an entire day without a charge I have been unimpressed with Apples AI but that doesnt mean it cant be used in some sort of productive way That I may not have thought of As long as I can deactivate it I really dont care,mjgd9zr,2.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjhgxu9,kris206,,2,2025-03-24 14:41:50,,,,Siri is a bit dated these days but definitely not the worst thing Apple created I get youre speaking hyperbole but Siri was probably the first wide scale voice assistant and other than scifi inspiration Siri pretty much set the standard for the world Siri allowed people with impaired hand motor skills to functionally use an iPhone Siri was a friend for people with social skill deficits and Siri helped the blind navigate their phones,mjgvw6d,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhjai9,leavezukoalone,,6,2025-03-24 14:54:08,,,,Those are all great things but dont change the fact that Siri is a hot pile of garbage Being first to market with Siri Apple had a head start Instead of maximizing that they got lazy and now we are stuck with an insanely underwhelming feature,mjhgxu9,3.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhk0pg,kris206,,3,2025-03-24 14:57:53,,,,After I posted my reply I thought I misunderstood your comment and that you meant the combination of Apple Intelligence AND Siri was trash Siri definitely doesnt live up to the hype they were selling us but realistically there isnt any voice assistant that is great even in the Google subs everyone complains about it Bixby Cortana,mjhjai9,4.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjgxj2f,rustyrazorblade,,2,2025-03-24 12:51:27,,,,Not really no These things would be built by different teams with completely different goals The folks building gear with sensors dont really need to know how AI will process the data they just need to provide it If you do it sequentially then you have to wait for the AI to be good then you develop the gear and depending on the lead time they would have lost years to competitors,mjgcgdp,1.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhxz1o,madmofo145,,2,2025-03-24 16:07:28,,,,Yeah while the whole thing seems silly if thats the goal youd start prepping the hardware years in advance It could take many prototype iterations to get the product correct and you certainly dont want that to be the bottle neck if youve finally got youre working AI waiting in the wings,mjgxj2f,2.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjlldi6,Pundamonium97,,1,2025-03-25 03:36:05,,,,Github copilot and cursor are the applications of AI that i think are the most impressive right now like coding assistance is an absolutely masterful use of the product There are a few image generators that are quite good esp for like anime fanart or getting restyled selfies of yourself Apples image generator sucks so much its not funny locked to the most awful style I do think if apple is using ai for picture editing and touching up etc and like extracting text from or pieces from an image thats brilliant Tho i dont think thats part of the apple intelligence package per se and idk if thats ai or just a good set algorithm When it comes to notification summaries i turned apple intelligence off bc it was the most garbage tool If i got a message saying theres a fire sale at home depot lamps are half off it would probably summarize it as home on fire caused by lamp I would have preferred apple move slow and not release this than release it and have it be so bad,mjlf8qw,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjm1dgz,SafeModeOff,,1,2025-03-25 05:51:19,,,,shouldnt they actually make it work well before embarking on this goal of putting it in everything I have asked myself this about every single AIified product and have yet to find a company thats behaving rationally,mjgcgdp,1.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjx6o3s,Pundamonium97,,1,2025-03-26 23:14:32,,,,That hasnt really been apples approach typically they often prefer to wait for a technology to mature a bit before they implement it It seems like they got caught up in the hype of AI and rushed ahead They literally launched it without it having all of its features lol,mjx6exs,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjx7jlv,alidan,,1,2025-03-26 23:19:10,,,,no apple does this with damn never every product line they put the first one out get enough of an understanding about whats bad and put the second version out as fast as possible and never acknowledge the first one again,mjx6o3s,3.0,1jimzi5
comment,mk1lxxs,Leftieswillrule,,1,2025-03-27 17:21:09,,,,The only thing Apples AI is good for is the kind of stuff a watch does Telling it to set a timer or tell you the weather is the extent of what it can do,mjgcgdp,1.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjh8u9s,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,13,2025-03-24 13:59:09,,,,The weirdest thing is that the problem I actually have which is keeping good meeting notes track of the things Id say Id do track of things I saidwrote to keep in mind when Im working on X isnt something that AI is being pivoted towards No I dont want AI to generate my proposal that requires actual thought and understanding of our system and policies and whatnot to actually make sense and be successful AI can generate something that appears plausible and will get approval from managers skimming it sure but thats not the goal I just need it to keep track of all my little notes and shit that are in different places in 7 different platforms,mjgg11i,1.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjiq5gj,PublicWest,,7,2025-03-24 18:22:28,,,,Be very careful about using them at work though Theyre obviously a privacy nightmare and your company would rightly be pissed if they found out you were sending all the meeting minutes to a 3rd party,mjiair4,3.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjixpcn,lifeishardthenyoudie,,2,2025-03-24 18:58:52,,,,Yeah that goes without saying You either need to make sure that nothing confidential is being discussed and that everyone is okay with being recorded or your company needs to pay for the service and have an agreement in place with them just like they do for any other service that handles your data,mjiq5gj,4.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjiqu3c,LookOverThere305,,1,2025-03-24 18:25:48,,,,There is literally a Gemini integration with google meets that does exactly this Its one of the first things ai was pitched as Check out readai,mjh8u9s,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjjgtnd,IIlIIlIIlIlIIlIIlIIl,,1,2025-03-24 20:30:11,,,,Thats still a pipe dream Most workplaces even those that already use the underlying services Google Workspace MS Office etc dont have the AI features enabled let alone third party AI that integrates data other services such as Slack Jira etc So if youre lucky you get meeting notes but thats about it Were still a long way away from everyone essentially having an omnipresent AI PA even within FAANG,mjiqu3c,3.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjpsx8e,BeneCow,,1,2025-03-25 20:18:37,,,,I work in a call centre that uses AI to make notes of the conversation It makes our stats amazing because you dont need to waste 5 minutes making notes but the notes are so useless and wrong they may as well not be there The stats are good though so,mjh8u9s,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhfhn7,NecroCannon,,11,2025-03-24 14:34:10,,,,Every time I try to have this discussion so many AI bros come from no where to tell me how wrong I am and that theyre a programmer or some similar field and its incredibly useful and all of us are just the problem But its like when it comes to the general population who is this for Who is asking for a middle man between themselves and their loved ones Whos asking to constantly have their data analyzed and used to tell you directly what you should buy Whos wanting to generate images outside of people wanting quick images without paying an artist Instead of trying to listen to what people are looking for they instead just ignore the complaints and take it as being antiai so instead of improvements were just seeing tech bros force their idea of a solution for all of our problems onto us But if an everything app isnt working well for Twitter why the hell would it work for any of this The future of machine learning isnt chatbots or virtual assistants not until they can ACTUALLY physically do stuff for us,mjgg11i,1.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjihncy,lifeishardthenyoudie,,4,2025-03-24 17:42:02,,,,I agree that the usefulness depends on your job is but that doesnt mean its useless I work as a teaching assistantafterschool teacher not an Englishspeaking country but those are the closest terms and I use it quite a lot both at work and outside of it At work use it to plan lessons or activities come up with a game that teaches the kids x for input on important emails does this sound good or does it come off as too critical for help with explanations come up with a good analogy for explaining x to young kids etc Outside of work its mostly helping me with planning my Dungeons and Dragons adventures Its a great help when you can give it hundreds of pages of sourcebooks and ask it to come up with a monster that fits your campaign or an idea for a good puzzle or riddle Other than that its mostly random questions that I wouldve googled like explaining the German political landscape or substituting an ingredient in a recipe What really makes it excel is that the answers are personalized I can tell it the age or the number of kids that will be participating in an activity what my Dungeons and Dragons group is like or what I ingredients I have at hand and it will tailor the answers instead of the much more general advice that googling would give me,mjhfhn7,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mk6w397,cordcutternc,,1,2025-03-28 14:38:24,,,,Whenever I see use cases for AI on consumer devices I feel like Im getting gaslit Why would I need intrusive batterysucking AI middleware to add something to my calendar ormake a restaurant reservation I can already do that in a few seconds on the phone itself,mjhfhn7,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mk6ytf9,NecroCannon,,2,2025-03-28 14:52:04,,,,As someone thats autistic but learned to function well in society I just genuinely feel like a lot of AI bros are neurodivergent and while it feels like a genie in a box for them for the rest of us we just dont need it to live Like it feels like theyre gaslighting because it honestly almost is you have a ton of people that cant function well and want a middleman to make life easier forcing everyone else to also need to use one They point to the large amount of users but one its solving a problem created artificially by making searches easier and two theres a ton of people that use it to cheat Its why outside of those two cases you only mainly really see AI bros talking about how useful it is,mk6w397,3.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhdprn,tnnrk,,4,2025-03-24 14:24:43,,,,The AI bubble is gonna burst soon I think The fact its being thrown around and in everything recently all while consumer sentiment is that they dont care about it as much anymore is my hunch I think everyone has realized what LLMs do and their limitations they just guess what the next most likely sentence to say is I dont see how you utilize that for anything beyond some writingcoding tools and call it a day Unless the corpos have a different version the can actually think or something this shit is over blown Every time I use it for coding I cant get it to disagree with me and it takes every suggestion I give as fact and hallucinates even more its wild It really pulls back the curtain and shows you what limited stuff it can do,mjgg11i,1.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjha6f0,koenigsaurus,,14,2025-03-24 14:05:39,,,,I mean it is for now until they decide its mandatory for the watch to function The only way to guarantee they cant turn it on by force is to use a device that doesnt have AI capability at all,mjh4nno,2.0,1jimzi5
comment,mjhibri,Sylvurphlame,,-10,2025-03-24 14:49:08,,,,Its a bridge that will have to be crossed when it comes to it And for now its optional Its also fine in response to someone saying theyd stop upgrading They can keep their current device and simply disable the feature on the last generation where it was optional If it becomes nonoptional they werent getting a new device anyway by their own statement So pointing out that they might decide to make it mandatory is largely pointless It isnt mandatory now on current devices you might own I fully understand that some people are vehemently anti Apple Intelligence and antiAI on any device Thats fine Doesnt change that it is currently an optin feature and if they decide to make it optout or nonoptional some future point then you already werent getting the device anyway with your current stance So what are people thinking they actually communicate with these fastest way to make me stop upgrading statements Strikes me as no different than loudly proclaiming Im leaving Reddit if,mjha6f0,3.0,1jimzi5

comment,mjild6r,Sylvurphlame,,0,2025-03-24 17:59:29,,,,Hahaha They were always going to charge the price they were going to charge If it becomes nonoptional dont buy if you dont want it But posting about how thatll be the fastest way to get me to stop upgrading Thats like loudly complaining that Ill leave Reddit if Its not going to move the needle AI will either reach a point of usefulness or otherwise run its course Its already here in whatever form it exists and not likely going away,mjil1y5,3.0,1jimzi5
