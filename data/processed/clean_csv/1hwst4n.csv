comment,m648gal,Kyvalmaezar,,11,2025-01-08 21:24:17,,,,Theres nothing actually AI about it Thats just a buzzword Its all predetermined algorithms Iirc it adds some water to the machine then times how long it takes to reach the bottom to determine the fabirc type It determines load size based on a weight sensor and soil level via a turbidity meter After it has that info it can set correct amount of detergent water wash cycle time Its not the worst idea for a feature but nothing a chart and measurment lines couldnt solve like how its been done for decades All this could be easily baked into the machine itself but they likely offload it to their servers so they can use cheaper processors in the machines themselves and harvest data,m63vgth,1.0,1hwst4n
comment,m655uor,CucumberError,,2,2025-01-09 00:19:09,,,,My current non smart washing machine does all this stuff without AI or an internet connection I plugged it into a smart plug When the power usage drops below 5watts its finished washing and Alexa tells me to hang out the washing Cant really work out why youd need it more smart than that,m648gal,2.0,1hwst4n

comment,m63zgx7,sweeney669,,2,2025-01-08 20:41:03,,,,I mean this probably isnt it at all but I could make an argument for artificial intelligence in a washing machine Being able to dump all your laundry in it and it can identify fabrics colors quantity etc to determine the best washing and drying settings so you dont damageshrinkbleed colors in your clothing,m63vgth,1.0,1hwst4n

comment,m6490nq,GapingFartLocker,,7,2025-01-08 21:26:59,,,,I shove all my clothes in the washer and they come out clean I dont need AI to do anything for that I dont even need regular intelligence to do that Theres nothing a washer can do to prevent colors from running and clothes shrink in the dryer not in the washer again not something AI could determine Think of the sensors it would need to determine material color etc and if you have a bunch of different materials in there how does it prioritize which ones get optimal settings Just one more thing to break and need fixing My brand new washer has AI wash Ive never used it,m63zgx7,2.0,1hwst4n
comment,m64e00r,Cynical_Manatee,,1,2025-01-08 21:50:59,,,,You are not wrong about washing machines but your answer is very reminiscent of people who said I just need my phone to be a phone why does it have to be a computer Look where we are at now for better or for worse,m6490nq,3.0,1hwst4n

comment,m640isc,dieselmiata,,-1,2025-01-08 20:46:08,,,,Ya know thats actually not a bad idea at all and would be pretty handy Ive just become so jaded and cynical that I actually have trouble fathoming a company using new tech to actually improve their product rather than just use it to harvest data and enshittify the world,m63zgx7,2.0,1hwst4n
comment,m641ftr,sweeney669,,-1,2025-01-08 20:50:29,,,,Oh listen Im fully with you and totally see it and 99999 of ai being used to enshittify the world Thats just the only logical use of ai in appliances like that imo,m640isc,3.0,1hwst4n

comment,m68dvro,Jesus_Is_My_Gardener,,1,2025-01-09 14:58:07,,,,Im so glad the hype over 3D TVs and monitors has died down Dont get me wrong for those who have and want to use 3D media its nice to have options but I dont want to have the extra expense of a niche feature I will never use priced into my electronics especially something that was obviously not going to become anything more than a novelty,m6852bo,3.0,1hwst4n

comment,m64dhjf,TheMacMan,,1,2025-01-08 21:48:29,,,,Understand where items are placed in the dishwasher to adjust the cycle to make sure all items become clean Spray more in one area than another or run an extra cycle if they find the dishes havent come clean on the first cycle Normal dishwashers run the heat drying for a set amount of time which is likely longer than needed AI could sense when theyre actually dry and cut it short saving electricity Not sure if it does any of that but those are just a couple things they could address with it,m63vgth,1.0,1hwst4n

comment,m640s44,CrewMemberNumber6,,0,2025-01-08 20:47:21,,,,I wonder if Apple was just messing with Samsung when they announced they were working on a subscription model for iPhones years ago I think it was only last month Apple announced they were discontinuing the plan Did Apple bait Samsung,,0.0,1hwst4n
comment,m64ccqo,TheMacMan,,2,2025-01-08 21:43:09,,,,Apples subscription was going to be similar to what service providers already have TMobile ATT and Verizon already offer the ability to upgrade whenever a new phone comes out and have accident coverage Thats what Apple was going to do too And similar to what it sounds like Samsung wants to do The article says itll include repair coverage Likely covers yearly upgrades too,m640s44,1.0,1hwst4n

comment,m64mcxb,fire2day,,1,2025-01-08 22:32:21,,,,The articles author should have titled it better Samsung is rolling out a smartphone AI subscription next month would have fixed it with two letters But I also understand that they word these headlines exactly how they mean to I guess I should read the articles as well but that sounds like a lot of work,m64lbj4,4.0,1hwst4n
