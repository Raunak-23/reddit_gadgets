comment,mrppw80,pcdarling,,21,2025-05-11 07:14:05,,,,Acetaminophen or paracetamol is used a lot in both mothers and babies and has been found to be safe in both breastfeeding and pregnancy In fact we advise use of paracetamol after vaccination of Meningitis B in babies which currently occurs at 8 and 12 weeks in the UK This is advised for multiple doses to avoid post vaccine fever Even both mum and baby using paracetamol both individually is recognised as safe The Breast Feeding Network states If your baby needs to take paracetamol suspension eg Calpol whilst you are taking paracetamol they can do so at their own full and normal dose The amount that they would get through your breastmilk is too small to be harmful in addition The article states overuse of acetaminophen as the issue for liver problems in children This isnt something I can see measuring levels in breast milk will help as if you care enough to measure paracetamol levels in your breast milk then Im sure you care enough to stay within the safe dosages noted on the packaging This whole product concerns me coming across as a money maker for the company and an anxiety inducer for the mother It seems the whole reason for the creation of this product hangs on one line in the paper some users may not follow the dosage instructions properly They write a lot about liver damage children needing liver transplants and other scary things but this is what it boils down to People overdosing due to not following dosage instructions properly Pushing this towards anxious mothers being given paracetamol in hospital post csection doesnt feel right to me Again I really dont see this product being useful for the people who buy it as it solves a problem that doesnt exist in the group of people who are conscientious with their medication,,0.0,1kj82bc

comment,mrnk0nx,pnutbutterfuck,,8,2025-05-10 21:47:34,,,,Yeah as a fellow breastfeeding mother I feel very conflicted about this Of course I would want to know whats being passed through to my breastmilk but also I feel like this just gives mothers another burden surrounding breastfeeding that may cause them to stop altogether The potential long term health effects of residual Tylenol in breastmilk vs the benefits of breastmilk and breastfeeding itself cant be fairly weighed Ive personally noticed that every single formula fed child I know has a massive amount of health issues food allergies digestion issues skin infections ear infections sinus infections constantly sick etc Meanwhile the breastfed kids I know hardly have those issues to the same level of severity And its not just my own observation this is something that has been studied and proven to be generally true breastfed children are healthier So if I break my leg and need to take a bunch of Tylenol to cope with the pain do I stop breastfeeding to avoid possible health issues related to acetaminophen and risk my child getting a slew of other issues In the time it would take for the bone to heal my supply would absolutely dry up that would be the end of the breastfeeding journey,mrn1obv,1.0,1kj82bc
