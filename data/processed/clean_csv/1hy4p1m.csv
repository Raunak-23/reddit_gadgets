comment,m6epwyd,internetlad,,10,2025-01-10 14:44:35,,,,Too bad Ive blackballed OnePlus for their exploitative tradein practices charged me extra saying my phone did not work when I traded it in I suspect the battery was dead and then refused to test it putting the onus on me did you take a picture of it working as you boxed it up to send it in They ask Then I got ahold of them to register a complaint and they clearly dont give a shit The open is a good phone for the money but fuck that company,,0.0,1hy4p1m

comment,m6l9spd,internetlad,,2,2025-01-11 15:53:56,,,,So funny story I tried that I was not impressed with the nothing 1 There was no one thing wrong with it but like It just felt not quite done yet The build quality was okay but there was a lot of plastic including the whole back The glyphs were a neat concept but ultimately useless Had a lot of weird issues that while I cant be sure Id attributed to their OS and software package I havent seen on phones before or since The specs were verrry mehhhh Ultimately it was just enough of a let down to switch back to the Open which is when I had the huge negative customer service experience Im hoping that it was just early installment weirdness it WAS the North American beta so maybe that explains the cell service and coverage issues Im absolutely going to be keeping an eye on Nothing going forward and hopefully the 2 or 3 are better phones because the first one wasnt it chief,m6knvz1,2.0,1hy4p1m

comment,m6hpkin,hwmchwdwdawdchkchk,,2,2025-01-10 23:43:50,,,,I agree except foldables are fairly chonky I guess mainly to avoid issues with the fold etc I dont mind personally but the difference is large,m6g0xcp,1.0,1hy4p1m
