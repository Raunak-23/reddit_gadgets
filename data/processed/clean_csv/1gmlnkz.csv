comment,lw8bv39,xondex,,11,2024-11-09 10:41:38,,,,This is intended for security After a reboot Android phones will only show you notifications after you unlock it Alarms are not notifications they are classified as systemlevel events and will work after a reboot regardless if you unlock it You think they would make the autoreboot feature available if alarms stopped working Literally all people need to wake up and go to work lol This thread is full of fucking boomers lmao,lw7jisa,6.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw8qcpx,danielv123,,1,2024-11-09 12:57:46,,,,A while ago mine prevented connecting to wifi4g after rebooting Had lost my pin You can reset the pin from Google find my device but that requires it to be connected to the internet So that was fun Luckily my device doesnt have the firmware locks so I could go into recovery mode and do a full reset,lw8bv39,7.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lwabc9g,SimplifyAndAddCoffee,,2,2024-11-09 18:30:23,,,,Pins and passwords never change themselves However Ive seen on at least a dozen occasions a device reject a correct pinpassword for invalid password Usually its some kind of caching or connectivity error or the authentication service is broken or credentials are expired or something like that Sometimes its even a hardware fault with a security module On websites its often that undisclosed password restrictions invalidate the valid password or cause it to not input correctly the same between where you set the password and where you enter it for validation In other words tech is stupid and fails in spectacularly stupid ways,lw98xl2,11.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw9ljgo,dark_gear,,3,2024-11-09 16:12:35,,,,This is just a reboot of the phone not a reset or remote wipe Alarms work fine after a reboot External devices trying to penetrate your phones security likely wont enjoy the process,lw6yqf9,4.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw4chfi,None,,-9,2024-11-08 18:28:10,,,,Wouldnt they be able to just use it once the restart is over And out it away at the scheduled restart time If anything this sounds like a minor inconvenience if any Its not like they need the device to be on 247 to access the data in it,lw3vutk,4.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4lryl,Akrevics,,9,2024-11-08 19:13:42,,,,Unless they have the code a restart will wipe any previous faceidfingerprint access and I think will return it to a state that makes it much more difficult to break into than if it was signed into before,lw4chfi,5.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4qvba,thejesterofdarkness,,7,2024-11-08 19:39:10,,,,No a restart forces the device to use pinpassword to initially unlock then it will resume biometric unlocking Fun fact you can also force this condition by triggering Siri and saying whose phone is this,lw4lryl,6.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw4pfjf,one_is_enough,,7,2024-11-08 19:31:56,,,,It doesnt But a restart requires the pin before it will start doing biometrics again,lw4nxvg,9.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4q3zw,thejesterofdarkness,,3,2024-11-08 19:35:21,,,,No restarting the device forces it to use pinpassword instead of biometrics Forcing a suspect to divulge a pinpassword is protected by the 5th Amendment whereas biometrics are not So law enforcement can legally shove your phone up to your face to unlock it but they cannot force you to give up your pinpassword as it is considered a form of selfincrimination,lw4nxvg,9.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4td5i,CheeseGraterFace,,1,2024-11-08 19:51:35,,,,On my iPhone at least if you just scrunch your face up or close your eyes it will not unlock your phone I just tested it,lw4q3zw,10.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4u05p,thejesterofdarkness,,2,2024-11-08 19:54:46,,,,My point is legally biometrics arent protected against self incrimination A judge could find you in contempt for not unlocking your device with biometrics and toss you in jail indefinitely until you cooperate A pinpassword is compelled speech which is prohibited under the 5th amendment,lw4td5i,11.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw57los,None,,1,2024-11-08 21:03:46,,,,Ok that makes sense I was thinking more once they do have the pin then auto restarting the phone doesnt do anything,lw4q3zw,10.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4lobv,nobd22,,6,2024-11-08 19:13:12,,,,Usually they cant make you give them your PIN So assuming it asks for a pin instead of biometrics after restart then it makes it that much harder for them,lw4chfi,5.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4n5hx,None,,-8,2024-11-08 19:20:33,,,,But once they have the pin whats the point,lw4lobv,6.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4p60t,one_is_enough,,13,2024-11-08 19:30:37,,,,That is the point They wont have the pin unless you give it to them and you are not legally obligated to The fingerprint or faceid loophole allows them to use those to unlock your phone without your permission but not the pin And iphones require the pin after restart even if you have touchfaceid enabled,lw4n5hx,7.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw4w1d9,OptimalMain,,1,2024-11-08 20:05:05,,,,Yep You can also just hold the power button until the slide to power off is visible Or hold power vol up or down I believe emergency mode reacts faster After using any of those you will have to input pin to unlock,lw4p60t,8.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwyvdpo,PackOfWildCorndogs,,2,2024-11-13 19:47:22,,,,Just tested this Even though I select run immediately when the automaton ran it still had a pop up that asked if I was sure I wanted to shut down The whole point of run immediately is to not need any other confirmation or interaction on my part to fully execute the automation Do you know of a workaround,lw3qw6z,3.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwyyo2q,Khayman11,,1,2024-11-13 20:04:03,,,,Not sure that prompt no The run immediately setting only removes to prompt from shortcuts to run the shortcut itself otherwise it prompts the user whether the automation should be run at all As far as I know Apple doesnt allow for a shutdown or restart without that confirmation,lwyvdpo,4.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw9dpqw,problemlow,,2,2024-11-09 15:29:09,,,,It is an option see other comment below your one Alternatively almost every single electronic device there is will hard shutdown if you hold the power button in for 5 seconds If about to be taken into police custody and they cant see youbecause if they do and you put your hand into a pocket Theyll probably assume youre going for a weapon and shoot you on the spot Just slide your hand into your pocket and hold down the power key for as long as youre able wont need to be more than a minute Youd want to do this because while the phone is active it has A decryption key in memory RAM but the moment it loses power thats gone until you provide the unlock code or pattern again A regular shutdown also dumps it as the moment the RAM loses power the data in it is also lost,lw3jw5o,2.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw47xw3,Smachymo,,34,2024-11-08 18:05:52,,,,The problem with the greatest locks in the world are that they dont work if people dont use them Designing security practices to be more convenient to the end user ultimately makes the systems more secure even if the more convenient option is less secure Its all apart of the CIA triad Data does no good if its secured so well it cant be accessed These types of things are also why NIST no longer suggests passwords automatically expire,lw46ooj,3.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw47u1b,TheRealPitabred,,13,2024-11-08 18:05:20,,,,Biometrics are in an interesting place of a compromise between security and ease of use It is a lot easier to use your constantly needed device if it unlocks from your face or a fingerprint even if that authentication isnt exceptionally secure Which is why Apples shortcut makes sense because you can disable the ease of use quickly and leave it much more secure at a moments notice,lw46ooj,3.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw78dws,Programmdude,,6,2024-11-09 04:13:34,,,,Thats because biometrics arent a password they never have been Security has 3 types What you are What you know and What you have Passwords are squarely in the What you know camp and biometrics in the What you are camp Its not a password replacement its an decent alternative to having no password on your device at all Plus why would you need to revoke it If youre in a situation where someone else has the ability to break a What you are type of security you have bigger problems,lw5bkum,4.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw3ygh7,ThePretzul,,19,2024-11-08 17:20:04,,,,More important is the fact that the device storage is encrypted and portions of that storage related to anything other than what is needed for the operating system itself are only decrypted and loaded into memory AFTER the first time a phone is unlocked following a restart Thats why the first unlock after a restart takes a little extra time usually with a mostly blank screen that doesnt even display your Home Screen apps Your phone is busy decrypting the data required to display your Home Screen When everything is still encrypted in memory and storage it makes it easier to bypass the Lock Screen protections entirely Both in terms of unlocking the phone and in terms of accessing data without unlocking it first Anything decrypted and loaded into shortterm memory can be accessed by forensic investigators and exploits can be utilized to attempt to make the phone load specific desirable information into memory Even with the phone locked it still loads and displays information related to incoming notifications for example,lw3waqc,3.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw4nmcb,ThePretzul,,4,2024-11-08 19:22:54,,,,Its not decrypting everything before it displays anything Full data for each application and all the photosmusic in your storage isnt decrypted during this momentary pause The momentary pause is the phone decrypting enough critical information about home screen configuration and installed apps to display the home screen and begin starting various services that normally operate in the background The remaining necessary decryption operations happen in the first 1030 seconds of time spent unlocked when you may notice the phone being slightly slower to respond when opening an app for example or it is left untouched until being decrypted ondemand as needed The exact details of when and how the encryption and decryption process happens is a closely guarded secret in an attempt to help prevent exploits,lw4itmn,5.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw60y2i,FateOfNations,,4,2024-11-08 23:42:25,,,,No The underlying authority relates to searching physical items being brought in to the country The consequences for a US citizen refusing to unlock their phone for customs could include having the phone seized for an indefinite period of time in theory its supposed to only be 30 days andor a more through search of your belongings which can take hours if they want it to In theory its your stuff thats detains not your person but in practice people wont abandon their stuff TLDR they can seize your phone and make you miss your connecting flight In theory this also applies to noncitizens as well but they very likely would be refused entry if they did,lw4nrzj,6.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw5140v,Puffen0,,46,2024-11-08 20:31:03,,,,Did you know that if your phone is unlocked by your fingerprint the cops do not need a warrant or really anything to give them access Theyre allowed to just grab your hand and force you to touch the phone to unlock it The logic behind this is that its no different than if you had a work badge on when arrested that lets them know where you work Isnt that fucked up,lw3ngp4,2.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw6bh54,edgecr09,,5,2024-11-09 00:44:06,,,,Yea most guys above dont really understand what that law is getting at Its not saying they can just search the phone The important part of the law is that if it was say a passcode they cant compel you to speak your passcode to them as that would violate the right to remain silent Whereas biometrics dont require speaking or language The law isnt so much about searching the phone as it is dealing with Miranda v Arizona,lw5yjp8,4.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw3wypo,shifty_coder,,47,2024-11-08 17:12:50,,,,Illegal search and seizure If you dont consent they cant look at the contents of your phone without a warrant Its 5th amendment violation to force you to unlock it with your passcode although theres currently a loophole that allows them to use biometric data to unlock your device by force In other words if you ever get detained and arrested turn off your phone so that it requires your passcode to unlock,lw3vz38,3.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw4agpo,Mr_Engineering,,47,2024-11-08 18:18:18,,,,They have always had to get a warrant This isnt about warrants its about gathering evidence All modern mobile devices all Apple iPhones and most name brand Android devices have security coprocessors with their own operating system and encrypted memory The security coprocessor secures the symmetric encryption key needed to decrypt user storage The security coprocessor is secured by a passcode and wont release the encryption key for user storage until the passcode is provided Enter the wrong passcode enough times and the coprocessor will erase the user storage encryption key User storage is where all the interesting evidence is stored such as text messages videos pictures navigation data etc If they can keep the phone in a state where its been unlocked at least once then the encryption key is in memory and the only hindrance is the pesky lock screen There are methods of defeating a lock screen due to the massive attack surface of the iOS and Android operating systems There are no methods of forcing the security coprocessor to give up the encryption key because the operating system that runs on it is incredibly small and designed to be impenetrable,lw3ol2r,1.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw3j7pd,darmanfi8015,,56,2024-11-08 16:06:28,,,,Neither one of yall read the article apparently lmao The purpose of this notice is to spread awareness of a situation involving iPhones which is causing iPhone devices to reboot in a short amount of time observations are possibly within 24 hours when removed from a cellular network Stranger still the reboot occurred in phones that were in airplane mode and one that was inside a Faraday box which typically blocks outside signals,lw3imny,2.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lw3lf59,DauntingPrawn,,48,2024-11-08 16:17:12,,,,Yes its a safety setting on Android so I assume its on iPhone as well You can set it to reboot into lockdown if it loses network connection Its an antitheft feature in case thieves turn off network so you cant find my phone on it Its kind of hilarious that it has this side effect,lw3j7pd,3.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw3tjsi,DaoFerret,,1,2024-11-08 16:56:16,,,,Not sure if Ive ever seen that as an iPhone setting not doubting it could exist though You can also very easily set an iPhone to automatically restart on time of day so I wouldnt be surprised if people who need it set that up,lw3lf59,4.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lw65c1n,randomaccount178,,2,2024-11-09 00:08:09,,,,It also is consciousness of guilt evidence Bricking your phone is a very fast way to create evidence against you that is probably as strong or stronger then whatever might be on your phone,lw49lmw,2.0,1gmlnkz

comment,lwrm6op,I-lack-braincells,,1,2024-11-12 16:12:46,,,,No one is against them searching phones They just assume because it is a pretty safe assumption they are searching those phones without a warrant You want to search through my phone Get a fucking warrant If you have evidence I did something wrong it wouldnt be that hard anything less is a violation of my rights,lw7hnp2,1.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwt6t21,sotzo3,,1,2024-11-12 21:03:15,,,,Obviously But encryption doesnt care about a warrant Either cops can get into a device without the password or they cant The legality of the search isnt going to change that But it still puts society in a hard spot Sometimes the government is corrupt but does that mean when they have the legal and moral obligation should they be able to search,lwrm6op,2.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwul8tu,I-lack-braincells,,1,2024-11-13 01:49:32,,,,If they have a warrant they can legally obligate you to give them the password If you refuse they can hold you in contempt Sure in some cases when a person still refuses to provide the password even after being held in contempt it can be troublesome for some cases where the polices entire case relies solely on the phone itself However I would rather have that issue than the issue of the police abusing their power by breaking the encryption,lwt6t21,3.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwv6r8m,sotzo3,,1,2024-11-13 04:02:49,,,,Thats simply untrue You have the right to remain silent A judge cannot verbally compel them to reveal a password even under penalty of contempt There are rulings that you can physically force biometrics like fingerprints or Face ID but both those things get disabled automatically after a while on many smartphones,lwul8tu,4.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lwzr72o,I-lack-braincells,,1,2024-11-13 22:30:11,,,,Not true just the same as if they have a warrant you are compelled to let them into your house if they have a warrant you are compelled to let them into your phone The right to remain silent is meant to prevent the police from forcing you to incriminate yourself so you dont have to answer any of their questions You arent required to speak to provide access to your phone If you do not provide access to your phone you will be put in prison potentially for months held in contempt A warrant is a reasonable ask for access to a phone Otherwise your privacy should be respected,lwv6r8m,5.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lx09j9e,sotzo3,,1,2024-11-14 00:14:58,,,,Thats again simply untrue A judge can independently order you in court to comply to his orders but a search warrant does not require the suspect to verbally provide a password There isnt a single case in America that Im aware where a judge ordered on a search warrant to compel the verbal password under penalty of contempt of court,lwzr72o,6.0,1gmlnkz
comment,lx12d09,I-lack-braincells,,1,2024-11-14 03:07:09,,,,No they can compel you to unlock the phone They hand you the phone and you unlock it If your house had a deadbolt that is opened with a 4 number pin you have to put in the pin and unlock the door to conduct the search warrant the same rules apply In both Commonwealth v Gelfgatt and State v Stahl a judge forced the owner of a phone to unlock it with a pin and fingerprint respectively It has happened it will happen and it is a fact You can deny facts all you want or you can accept your mistaken ASSUMPTION,lx09j9e,7.0,1gmlnkz
