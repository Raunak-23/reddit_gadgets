comment,m5vm1ik,Chronotaru,,417,2025-01-07 14:45:17,,,,The problem always was that the Quest 3 had several things that were better than the Pro if the Pro was revised at the same time to be unambiguously better then it would still have a market position If they want another Pro headset they should release it at the same time as the Quest 4,,0.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5vqtgm,Sykes83,,184,2025-01-07 15:11:41,,,,Its not just several things that were betterthe Quest 3 is better than the Quest Pro in almost every way It has a higher resolution better cameras a faster CPU and more And it was half the price Compared to the Pro the Quest 3 is missing the face and eye tracking mini LED backlight selftracking on controllers and a few other things but theyre mostly minor things The positioning of the Pro vs the Quest 3 never really made much sense to me Even when it first launched before the Quest 3 was available the Pro was a bit weirdthey positioned it as an AR powerhouse and then equipped it with the worlds worst cameras,m5vm1ik,1.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5w3078,Agrippanux,,103,2025-01-07 16:14:10,,,,The Pro was launched early because Meta feared a holiday release of the AVP and wanted to get ahead of it The Pro wasnt ready and when the AVP was pushed back Meta deprioritized it quickly The Pro has been an afterthought 3 months after it launched they quickly pivoted to the Quest 3 Source I run a VR game company,m5vqtgm,2.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m60rcvq,Portlander_in_Texas,,6,2025-01-08 08:36:34,,,,Intergalactic conflict makes it sound bigger than it actually is Its more like asshole hunters import a dangerous invasive species to a planet to hunt And with no natural predators the species propagates eventually overwhelming local fauna The Yaujta are just obnoxious trophy hunters,m5wuskn,4.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5vsfgy,Chronotaru,,20,2025-01-07 15:20:15,,,,In general yes Quest 3 is better in the things that matter but that doesnt negate those things that are better on pro Eye tracking wouldnt be a minor thing if it actually was implemented on PC in most titles the way it is with PS5 and until its actually on their biggest selling headsets that wont change The controllers are a significant upgrade but if you want them they can be purchased separately so why get a Pro for them,m5vqtgm,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m631wcg,BaconAlmighty,,1,2025-01-08 17:58:59,,,,and Quest Pro uses miniLED display tech which provides greater contrast and richer color than is seen in the Quest 3,m5vsfgy,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5xqb1a,nope_nic_tesla,,4,2025-01-07 21:00:47,,,,Im betting they manufactured too many Pros before the release of the Quest 3 so they just kept selling their inventory backlog until they ran out and now its discontinued,m5vqtgm,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m64di4y,alidan,,1,2025-01-08 21:48:34,,,,quest pro controllers are self tracking and dont require to be seen by the headset to track how much this matters is debatable but it was a clear win I believe it also had eye tracking for foveated rendering rather than relying on your eyes only being dead center but thats kind how halo products function they come out are the be all end all and then you take what you can from them and put them in the lower end skus quest 4 will likely have holocake lenses amd fingers crossed on oled display,m5vqtgm,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5y1jrs,joomla00,,-5,2025-01-07 21:54:41,,,,The quest pro has next gen features that werent that important to the average user Quest 3 really hit it out of the park with its overall package But personally Ive given up on it at the moment 500 is about the right price pancake lenses were a big improvement but the screen and visual quality kicks me out of immersion Its a continuous reminder that this is an early gen product Im strapping to my face It really needs quality miniledOLED and eye trackers to get us to that next level of immersion,m5vqtgm,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5zb8g5,Braidaney,,2,2025-01-08 02:00:35,,,,I think this is a problem with consoles and products of this type in general selling different versions of a product that vary slightly in price and slightly in quality confuses consumers and hurts the brand If people buy the lower end product theyll feel buyers remorse when they realize if they had just spent a bit more they could have had a better product however that doesnt mean theyre going to be willing to buy a whole new system more than likely they just get frustrated and lose all enthusiasm for trying out a newer product like vr,m5vm1ik,1.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m606p42,Rollertoaster7,,3,2025-01-08 05:22:41,,,,As budget headsets keeping costs down is paramount and the average meta user likely would prefer advances to be made to the weight comfort and battery life before they added several new cameras inside the headset increasing cost power consumption etc,m5z65r8,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m60s2m0,TheNorthComesWithMe,,4,2025-01-08 08:44:14,,,,Even if the hardware was decades better than the current state of the art VR needs software Unique input features locked behind the less popular model makes it less likely to be implemented in third party software,m606p42,4.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m610ts1,Chronotaru,,2,2025-01-08 10:18:24,,,,And at the same time its on PSVR2 Without it being on the most popular headset then developers wont implement foveated rendering in their games which means theres no point it being on the premium headset either,m606p42,4.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5wrw95,TheRogueMoose,,4,2025-01-07 18:15:31,,,,I got an aftermarket head strap for them both So its hard to say comfort wise as it was the first thing i did with them both lol I hated the stock head strap I have the Bobovr M3 Pro for my Quest 3 and love it I also have the Kiwi design Upgraded Elite strap for the Quest 2 and loved it Tho 3 years later its starting to wear down I found without the straps it would just hang down and dig into my cheeks and just really hurt With the Bobovr strap on the 3 it doesnt even touch my face Quality wise much better in my opinion I wasnt a huge fan of the fresnel lens in the older headsets So much clearercleaner with pancake lenses,m5woeqf,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5xuwca,Fugueknight,,1,2025-01-07 21:22:41,,,,Never used a 2 but one limitation of the 3 for sim racing in particular is that the video encoding can cause a lower quality video signal than your system is capable of rendering or the headset is capable of displaying Im happy with my 3 for something like dirt rally but it is a bit of a downgrade from my old reverb G2,m5woeqf,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5wlrc5,PenislavVaginavich,,11,2025-01-07 17:45:58,,,,The Quest 3 is a major improvement its far better in almost every way to any other mixed reality or VR headset Ive used and I dont really get headaches with a good strapBut its still just not a super practical tool for most people as cool as it is Its not immersive enough for things like movies and YouTube 360 is mostly kind of a gimmick Theres just not enough good content out there to make it worthwhile for most people Mine mostly sits charging in the corner and I occasionally throw it on to play golf or table tennis or to use as PCVR for Alyx Thats about it,m5vlyb8,1.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5x6ck9,Alchia79,,4,2025-01-07 19:24:59,,,,I have the quest 2 as well from Christmas 2020 We all used it a lot the first year I loved Supernatural Beat Saber The kids loved the games Now only my youngest uses it The novelty wears off It feels so heavy and uncomfortable after a bit,m5vlyb8,1.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5vyerb,Abigail716,,7,2025-01-07 15:51:07,,,,I would try out the Quest 3 I know quite a few people including myself that could not use the Q2 for very long without getting a terrible headache But the three is way better Im now able to play it for hours without a problem at all IMO the Q3 is the first VR headset worth buying that isnt just a novelty,m5vlyb8,1.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5w1dzc,MukdenMan,,15,2025-01-07 16:06:04,,,,Yeah I remember playing one I think at Navy Pier in Chicago and it blew my mind It was a tank battle game and the headset tracked where my head was looking which was completely new to me at the time I thought a lot of games would be like that soon but didnt happen,m5vrksa,1.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m6775df,bremidon,,1,2025-01-09 09:23:00,,,,Back in the mid90s I lived in Chicago They had one at North Pier as well as a MechWarrior thing The game I played was some sort of onrails shooter with a wild end boss I seem to remember that a full game to the end took about 15 minutes I was one of only a few people who could beat it so that was always cool,m5w1dzc,2.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5x2673,Enderkr,,8,2025-01-07 19:04:39,,,,I can think of a half dozen amazing uses for ARVR off the top of my head but it sure seems like companies dont give a fuck about actual real world usage and instead keep pushing AR movies and bad video games To say nothing of the hyperlimiting form factor of a massive pair of goggles on your face,m5vrksa,1.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5whq0d,TheBroWhoLifts,,15,2025-01-07 17:26:22,,,,Half Life Alyx was one of the most engaging and thrilling gaming experiences Ive ever had If there was more content on oar with that it might attract a wider audience but the high price barrier to entry is going to be a problem A decent PC is required to run titles like that,m5vz1iu,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5wxjyn,wingspantt,,9,2025-01-07 18:42:41,,,,Alyx unfortunately isnt mass market enough Its borderline horror it is the third or fourth entry in a series of games from 20 years ago meaning newyoung gamers dont have any connection to the story So the game is really good but it is also very alienating,m5whq0d,3.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5wnhud,ajemik,,1,2025-01-07 17:54:15,,,,I might check that out then But the point is other games feel gimmicky compared to Alyx you know Like you try to find an excuse to put the headset on rather than not being able to wait to play it No idea if Im expressing it well enough but I hope I do haha,m5wn4rk,5.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5won43,TheBroWhoLifts,,1,2025-01-07 17:59:42,,,,Absolutely Cartoonish unpolished Agreed I even found Bone works to be really lacking and clunky and I just didnt get it The sandbox got old after a while and even though Im pretty fit the parkour shit was exhausting and frustrating Maybe I didnt get far enough but I really didnt get into it Vail has some promise as a competitive first person shooter but by far the greatest VR coop experience was Firewall Zero Hour on the original PSVR Wow what a game And Moss Super Hot Astro Bot and Statik Institute of Retention fucking brilliant deserve honorable mentions as well Those are old games and not much on the PC really comes close Its depressing Oh I just remembered Resident Evil 4 is another one worth playing especially if youre nostalgic for the original which is 100 but in pretty thrilling VR Oh and definitely check out Compound Man that game is fun as hell Stylized 8bitish 90s vibe first person roguelite shooter I still play it when Im feeling the itch,m5wnhud,6.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5xg4ic,gwinerreniwg,,1,2025-01-07 20:12:13,,,,While I dont disagree this is a good app is it really any different than any 3D shooter weve seen for the last 30y some of which were available on early VR systems and several of which were on Quest before Alyx too Its clear FPS are not the killer app and in fact are pretty boring and cliche at this point despite the intuitive leap that such games should be better in VR While not wrong its not what a new pardigm needs to drive a new market in my opinion of course,m5whq0d,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5xiicp,TheBroWhoLifts,,1,2025-01-07 20:23:50,,,,Have you actually played Alyx It was made from the ground up to be only VR and you can tell Ive played a ton of VR and no other titles have come close not only in technicalgraphical terms but also interactivity story and environment Its a masterpiece And the community of creators makes it so that there is a ton of extra playability Story graphics and interaction matter and that game sets the gold standard,m5xg4ic,4.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5xzkk0,gwinerreniwg,,-1,2025-01-07 21:45:10,,,,I do own Alyx Im not saying its not a good game I enjoyed it but theyre not breaking any new ground with the format with what is basically VR halflife how many decades old now Its original like the new Star Wars series are,m5xiicp,5.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5ygx0u,None,,2,2025-01-07 23:13:19,,,,This The only thing I was interested in playing is Minecraft Too bad Mojang deleted this feature so now the only way to play Minecraft in VR is on PC using Java edition mods which is fine for many but it sucks for me because I play on bedrock only since I am a console gamer Like I have no other interesting things to do with a vr helmet,m5vz1iu,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5wnuf2,kb_hors,,0,2025-01-07 17:55:54,,,,VR has no killer app is a strange thing for me to hear when Ive owned a VR Headset since 2022 exclusively to run VRChat which has a userbase big enough to pull 20k people to a weeklong online event and has an entire industry grown around it It absolutely has a killer app Is it one most people want or need No But for those who do Indispensable,m5vz1iu,2.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5wzgkt,SimiKusoni,,12,2025-01-07 18:51:44,,,,Is it one most people want or need No A killer app is an application that drives hardware sales to the point where it is the primary or even sole driver of a platforms success There are certainly popular applications for VR but there is nothing that has captured the market to that degree and I think youd be hard pressed to make the argument that VRChat is significantly driving unit sales for VR headsets,m5wnuf2,3.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5zjg8o,kb_hors,,2,2025-01-08 02:48:22,,,,I can make that argument incredibly easily because its true Ive met hundreds of VR users none of which did anything other than VRChat and a couple of other social VR experiences like that minigolf game whatever its called Thats the only reason to buy a VR Headset at all it has no other practical use You can see this in the entire market around VR Accessories Full body trackers are not for whatever Mark Facebook is advertising theyre for doing queer shit with furries,m5wzgkt,4.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5wlof1,whewtang,,1,2025-01-07 17:45:35,,,,This just comes across like you havent tried anything since the 90s Got psvr2 on sale over the holidays Have been playing Gran Turismo 7 and its excellent Being able to see the cars as if youre sitting in them walking around them Actually being able to distinguish the elevation changes of real race tracks This isnt like a virtual boy or whatever,m5vrksa,1.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5ww0mj,MajorFuckingDick,,1,2025-01-07 18:35:19,,,,VR still isnt there for the average joe The standalone games are awesome but most people dont want that level of activity for a game Bringing back 3D gaming with a controller would be huge but thats another can of worms Setting it up for PCVR has an entire box of issues on its own that someone who just wants to play games will be annoyed with The amount of tinkering needed to access a lot of the things that enthusiast rave about is too much for most A console headset that lets you play normal games in 3D rather than just Theater Mode is a huge potential market that I foresee being the boom Personally watching my first 3D movie at home that rivaled or surpassed theater experience and racing with the direct feedback of my wheel sold me on VR forever A lot of big players see the writing on the wall but still cant crack the code I want to say that the next console generation will have the stuff needed to bring it into every home but that feels naive,m5vrksa,1.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5vpx21,Mastoraz,,21,2025-01-07 15:06:47,,,,They shot themselves in the foot releasing it so weakened just before the Quest 3 If it had the same SOC and same passthrough as Quest 3 the Quest Pro would be doing a lot better And at 999 launch price instead of 1499,,0.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5ymaob,FlyingBishop,,2,2025-01-07 23:42:42,,,,Any realistic business use cases actually have higher requirements than gaming Even just virtual desktop you need 10x the specs to get an actually on par experience with conventional monitors And of course the monitors cost 110th the price,m5vwdq5,2.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m60i0qy,UgarMalwa,,4,2025-01-08 07:01:21,,,,I used Meta Quest 3 honestly I found it impressive on what it could do and had fun playing it Especially if youre using apps like Youtube which lets you view the screen like a cinema and stuff The 360 videos are also fire Motion trackingcontrols are fine a bit like the Wii but actually more functional There are some negatives however Battery life sucks this isnt the fault of the system though because of how it works But you will notice that it will eat away after 30mins to an hour MetaHorizon can be a cesspool of shitty worlds full of screaming children and trolls Motion sickness happens especially when youre standing The app store feels somewhat empty with A lot of garbage shovelware youd expect from your IOS app Oh and obviously you cant use it outside not only is it dangerous since apps will obscure your vision but the sun can also cause screen damage There are work arounds but there is not real reason to in the first place I do have to give Meta credit however for the innovation of actually making something functional regardless of their questionable reputation,,0.0,1hvsp4l

comment,m5ycgas,blackburnduck,,2,2025-01-07 22:49:39,,,,Biggest problem with quest is meta itself After spending hours diagnosing 40 quest 2 headsets and having to deal with the forced and terrible facebook integration I simply refuse to purchase the product The simple act of pairing remotes is a pain in the ass and feels like im back to the 80s Switch syncs with a click BT sincs with a press Quest Takes a whole process and serial codes for every remore They may be the best overall headset nowadays but Im never getting a quest because of this shoddy forced social integration,,0.0,1hvsp4l
comment,m5yfxst,SuicidalChair,,0,2025-01-07 23:08:04,,,,Well which is it the shoddy social integration or the bad controller pairing you do once or twice while owning it And you used switch as an example when every time a Nintendo switch opens a new screen or menu it disconnects all the controllers and asks you to resync them for player number lol,m5ycgas,1.0,1hvsp4l
