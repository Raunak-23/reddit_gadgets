comment,m3qxsw6,Corgi_Koala,,131,2024-12-25 16:06:56,,,,I feel like its kind of a catch22 though Developers dont have a lot of incentive to design games that work well or are intended to work with controllers because the vast majority of users dont have controller attachments like this But most people probably dont feel an incentive get a controller attachment because most games that they do play dont require it,m3qji7i,1.0,1hm17td
comment,m3r5ezu,sumsimpleracer,,56,2024-12-25 16:56:23,,,,Which sucks because the iPhone and iPad have so much power in them theyd be such a great gaming platform It would be great for some old classics to be rereleased on the platform with the intention of having some sort of controller peripheral Many people have access to a PlayStation or Switch Bluetooth controller that its not entirely inaccessible,m3qxsw6,2.0,1hm17td
comment,m3rpsex,Timelordwhotardis,,30,2024-12-25 19:04:02,,,,A couple years ago I bought a switch to play Minecraft on the go Turn out my phone could run it better and the phone holder for my Xbox controller worked amazing Ended up returning it,m3r5ezu,3.0,1hm17td

comment,m3sgyho,VapeThisBro,,4,2024-12-25 21:56:41,,,,Last years flagship phones from pretty much every company could emulate Switch games and do it almost as well as a switch I would actually be surprised if next years iphones and androids could emulate switch at 60fps consistently,m3s078z,5.0,1hm17td

comment,m3rwskz,Corgi_Koala,,10,2024-12-25 19:47:30,,,,I just dont think that theres a solution that consumers would accept Like I think it would be awesome if Sony or Nintendo released a huge back catalog of games for use on mobile devices even if they did like a subscription model or charged per game But the second that mandate controllers consumers would riot And if they release the games with passable touch screen controls then were right back to square one where nobody is buying controllers because they dont need to,m3r5ezu,3.0,1hm17td
comment,m3s5dbj,Inprobamur,,5,2024-12-25 20:41:27,,,,I mean emulators already solved this There is a standard way the controls are set up so you can craft a very good touch screen experience Having a controller just elevates it even further,m3rwskz,4.0,1hm17td

comment,m3r9m3i,Masiyo,,6,2024-12-25 17:23:31,,,,Its a similar situation with the PS5 DualSense controller It has all these amazing capabilities but so few games actually utilize them because developers are incentivized to design their game for crossplatform the biggest demographic which means designing for a controller with generic features by modern standards,m3qxsw6,2.0,1hm17td

comment,m3rp0pa,ItsAMeUsernamio,,11,2024-12-25 18:59:12,,,,Xbox is completely missing the trackpad motion controls microphone and speaker and the haptic feedback and haptic triggers are just standard vibration motors,m3rmfqr,4.0,1hm17td
comment,m3ropdh,DolphinFlavorDorito,,9,2024-12-25 18:57:16,,,,Nothing like the haptics in the Playstation controller no What they can do with trigger resistance is really cool Different weapons with different trigger weights a stop halfway down you can feel for uses where half and full presses are different etc,m3rmfqr,4.0,1hm17td
comment,m3ryqna,minkdraggingonfloor,,6,2024-12-25 19:59:47,,,,The haptic triggers are great in Horizon where you can feel the weight of the bow string going back on Spider Man the press really helps you gauge how much web to use per swing if you turn off swing assist and on GoW Ragnarok I try not to use anything other than the axe because its so satisfying with the triggers There really isnt anything like it,m3ropdh,5.0,1hm17td

comment,m3z4yay,kn728570,,1,2024-12-27 02:57:37,,,,Gonna have to disagree I may not bring it on the bus but I certainly brought it on an overnight trip to play Alien Isolation in the hotel developers have plenty of incentive to make controllers playable with their mobile ports It wouldve been amazing to have the aforementioned setup during my first year of university when I lived in student housing no money to buy a setup and no room to put it anyway But the iPhone 5s couldnt do any of that back then,m3z2l7t,4.0,1hm17td
comment,m3sfnc5,c010rb1indusa,,3,2024-12-25 21:48:12,,,,Still waiting for someone to realize they can carve out a market for traditional gaming by ripping off the Sony Xperia Play ie the PSP phone It was an early Android phone that was never supported by Sony and was more of a proof of concept so at the time nobody cared But throw some 3ds like circle pads on there with a modern form factor and you have a winner,m3qxsw6,2.0,1hm17td

comment,m3spl1l,RenegadeAccolade,,8,2024-12-25 22:54:23,,,,while im right there with you in wanting more infinity blade its a bit of an irrelevant comment because the post is about controllers for phones and infinity blade fundamentally cannot work as a controller game since the essence of it is swiping and tapping the screen itself,m3que8g,1.0,1hm17td

comment,m3quw3c,I_Am_A_Real_Horse,,21,2024-12-25 15:47:15,,,,The main downside Ive found is that for shootersaiming the small joysticks arent the best You can certainly still play it just takes time to adjust Ive found Other than that Ive no complaints its great to have on hand when the wife wants to watch her shows on TV and I can still play and watch next to her or if you want a quick few minutes in bed,m3qolug,2.0,1hm17td
comment,m3qvchh,Sylvurphlame,,5,2024-12-25 15:50:19,,,,Those are my exact two use cases My wife God bless her actually doesnt mind if I head downstairs to play the Xbox But I feel like Im abandoning her and yet our TV tastes dont often align outside of Disney putting out another Marvel miniseries,m3quw3c,3.0,1hm17td

comment,m3unggt,ufailowell,,1,2024-12-26 08:40:43,,,,It collapses but not all the way together It does hurt its portability or how easy it is to bag If youre planning on sitting somewhere I prefer a small standalone controller like the 8bitdo lite series or the micro Zero is probably too small for any real use cases,m3rz2ya,4.0,1hm17td
comment,m3sdwxu,Lexxxapr00,,2,2024-12-25 21:36:49,,,,I used it to remote play with my PS5 and it actually works surprisingly super well I have input lag but I think thats due to router placement and will be moving soon and upgrading the router at the new place which should fix my only problem,m3qolug,2.0,1hm17td

comment,m3sv7x8,Elyseux,,1,2024-12-25 23:33:14,,,,Technically supports controller on desktop as well so Ive gotten around the issue on my Android by streaming my PC running Genshin to it Works surprisingly well and with a few steps it looks fairly native doesnt have black bars on tall phones I admit though its far from ideal,m3qyrfj,2.0,1hm17td
comment,m3sy6pa,Lkes5,,1,2024-12-25 23:53:27,,,,True and you can do the same with ps remote play and I guess now gamepass as well But the extra lag from streaming to streaming just sucks,m3sv7x8,3.0,1hm17td

comment,m4hy98e,imPansy,,1,2024-12-30 09:05:39,,,,I play on my iPhone and definitely on wifi It burns through data quick Even with unlimited cellular data you need a strong and fast connection or itll look pixelated When playing on a good network its great I get really good fps as if Im on my gaming pc but on phone The backbone itself works well I prefer Xbox controllers but Ive had a PlayStation in the past and got used it it easily,m4hqigp,2.0,1hm17td

comment,m4tkz04,throwthegarbageaway,,3,2025-01-01 08:03:23,,,,Second this Its been over a year now that my PC has become just a central hub for all my other devices I can log into it from a phone a shitty old laptop a tablet a TV anywhere and anytime and everything is wireless Latency of under 16ms overall thats less than one frame in 60hz,m3qq872,1.0,1hm17td
comment,m3qpry7,Sylvurphlame,,55,2024-12-25 15:11:27,,,,Right in the third paragraph Some of those games need a traditional dualstick game controller to work well though and Apple bafflingly offers no firstparty solution for this Bafflingly You can literally use the controllers from the PlayStation Xbox and the Switch They didnt need to make a controller just take your pick,,0.0,1hm17td
comment,m3s4h9e,high_everyone,,28,2024-12-25 20:35:56,,,,Why would I want an Apple controller Theyll put the charger port inside a thumbstick or some shit Or disable inverted controls by default for everything and call it natural gaming Apple is simultaneously the best and worst at making accessories so I dont trust them with a controller TBH,m3qpry7,1.0,1hm17td
comment,m3swb8z,natek11,,2,2024-12-25 23:40:37,,,,Right in the fourth paragraph Yes you can sync popular Bluetooth controllers from Sony Microsoft Nintendo and 8bitdo with your iPhone but thats not really the ideal answeryour iPhone isnt a big TV sitting across the room or a computer monitor propped up on your desk,m3qpry7,1.0,1hm17td
comment,m3ux05v,Sylvurphlame,,2,2024-12-26 10:35:17,,,,Which has nothing to do with Apple not offering a firstparty controller All I get from this is that the author is and possibly you are somehow upset the iPhone isnt a Switch or Steam Deck The author finally gets to the point of saying Apple needs to do some work if they want to be competitive with Sony and Microsoft but its a weird rambling path Apple not having more console style games is a separate thing from not making a first party controller The first is something they would have to make more deals with developers and publishers for the second is literally a piece of hardware they dont necessarily have to come up with in the first place edit misunderstood unatek11s reply,m3swb8z,2.0,1hm17td

comment,m3vrboi,Sylvurphlame,,2,2024-12-26 15:02:54,,,,Yeah I can see that I think the author is just kinda verbally flailing with the fourth just being a moving goalpost No first party controller which is baffling but you can connect a bazillion third party controllers but thats not big screen gaming so I come round to yeah the iPhone is not the Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck but I thought that was obvious The article just irritates me I guess And apologies for misunderstanding exactly what you were replying earlier,m3vmefn,4.0,1hm17td
comment,m3qvanu,Oddjob64,,15,2024-12-25 15:49:58,,,,I used it for gamepass streaming and PS remote play before I got a portal Its a fine controller I just prefer my phone to be a phone and not worry about draining battery while gaming I have plenty of dedicated portable gaming options,,0.0,1hm17td

comment,m3rhdfp,PM_LEMURS_OR_NUDES,,1,2024-12-25 18:12:28,,,,Idk I think iOS has a surprising amount of really solid real games already and when you add everything you can emulate with Delta which includes a lot of older AAA games I think theres plenty to play if youre not picky about wanting to play super new games You can play Fortnite Minecraft Warzone not to mention a ton of great indies like Inscryption Slay the Spire Balatro theres even an iOS soulslike now and a ton more which are free with a Netflix subscription The real question is actually do I really want to play any of these on my phone because most people arent gonna play a noncasual game or game they arent already familiar with that they can pick up and drop unless they have a long public transport commute or some other regular idle time And as the article points out do I wanna drop the 100 or whatever for a pretty niche upgrade being that a lot of these games have passable touch schemes,,0.0,1hm17td
