comment,lvwvh6u,Korrugate,,30,2024-11-07 15:47:01,,,,This is a strange trend Fujifilm has several camera with a dedicated dial for film simulations I own two Fujifilm cameras and the film sims are great but I definitely dont change them often enough to have a physical control,,0.0,1glst16
comment,lvww57l,Legitimate-Wall3059,,8,2024-11-07 15:50:17,,,,Also Lightroom DXO presets do the exact same thing,lvwvh6u,1.0,1glst16
comment,lvwy6rq,dabocx,,19,2024-11-07 16:00:52,,,,I think the idea that Fuji has pushed is that you dont do any heavy editing with a computer You setup your film simulation you take your photo and youre done Fuji isnt aiming for people who want to spend hours staring at light room And as someone who got burnt out doing professional photography and editing I am pretty happy with just my Fuji film now Its so much less work,lvww57l,2.0,1glst16
comment,lvwyjup,Legitimate-Wall3059,,-5,2024-11-07 16:02:44,,,,I get it but they could also have just bundled a small piece of software to batch process their raws into one of the presets The buttonwheel being there doesnt hurt me but I would much prefer a generic tactile wheel that I can use as a customizable function,lvwy6rq,3.0,1glst16
comment,lw09pzs,QuickQuirk,,4,2024-11-08 01:54:23,,,,youve given the reason in your own text They already have that software Only a few owners of the camera actually use it Theyre targeting the end user who wants a nice camera but doesnt want todoesnt know how to edit on the computer Apply the simulation on the camera when taking the photo and seamlessly upload it to your phone and preferred social in one go,lvwyjup,4.0,1glst16
comment,lvwz4e2,dabocx,,1,2024-11-07 16:05:33,,,,They do have that software actually Only problem is you have to have the camera plugged in as its actually still processing on the camera Its a little slow but its nice if you want to mess with a bunch of film simulations and apply them in batches,lvwyjup,4.0,1glst16
comment,lvyoi7j,engineeringstoned,,-2,2024-11-07 20:54:08,,,,Which is the worst idea in forever and a half Why not provide a small piece of desktop software making it blazing fast,lvwz4e2,5.0,1glst16
comment,lvysukb,imakesawdust,,2,2024-11-07 21:14:40,,,,Because then you wouldnt have to buy a Fuji camera,lvyoi7j,6.0,1glst16
comment,lw0h89c,DiscountLlama,,1,2024-11-08 02:36:53,,,,Besides the other options people have mentioned Lightroom has Fuji presets in it so if you upload your RAWs you can apply whatever they were shot with automatically or just leave them alone to edit however The processing is for JPGs out of the camera,lvwyjup,4.0,1glst16
comment,lw204us,Less_Party,,2,2024-11-08 10:00:57,,,,To be fair Fuji also has cameras with a dedicated shutter speed dial and then 2 assignable clickwheels where by default it makes one toggle between ISO and aperture control and then makes the other a redundant shutter speed dial for some reason Sensible controls arent really their strong suit,lvwvh6u,1.0,1glst16
