comment,n6jui3y,DustyMoo,,26,2025-08-02 16:40:57,,,,This is super super niche I travel a lot and I just use phone tethering for connectivity in public places Im already paying for mobile service why pay more for another service on my laptop that I know that I wont utilise much There hasnt been a time where I had gone out of my way to buy a second physical SIM card for a 4g 5g enabled tablet either,,0.0,1mfuxdg

comment,n6jv8an,JoseMinges,,21,2025-08-02 16:44:51,,,,The answer is tether to your phone Youre going to the park with your laptop but you somehow decided to leave your phone at home Ok Someone desperately needed to write an article,,0.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6jy227,dandylover1,,-15,2025-08-02 17:00:17,,,,Not everyone is addicted to his phone Half the time I forget I even have one But I am always on my computer Granted its a Toughpad FZM1 MK3 which is a seveninch tablet and even with my keyboard it still fits comfortably into a small bag It also has a slot for a sim card Its a bit different from a large laptop but this could work with a proper umpc,n6jv8an,1.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6jymgj,neil470,,12,2025-08-02 17:03:24,,,,Theres a difference between being addicted to your phone and using common sense to take advantage of cellular service you already pay for,n6jy227,2.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6jz3mu,dandylover1,,-9,2025-08-02 17:06:02,,,,Fair enough but its one extra thing to carry In my case I also use an external keyboard with it so that makes two But it can certainly be done Technically though you could also just use data on a sim card and get one of those services that allow you to make and receive calls on your computer so thats another option,n6jymgj,3.0,1mfuxdg

comment,n6m7m3j,dandylover1,,-1,2025-08-03 00:40:04,,,,No But if I did that would be two extra things And someone above my comment mentioned battery life of the phone which makes complete sense But one could also use a hotspot which are very small,n6k3sca,5.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6mema1,drae-,,2,2025-08-03 01:24:05,,,,Youre trying to say you dont take your phone with you when you go places And you wonder why were expressing doubt,n6m7m3j,6.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6miqxp,dandylover1,,0,2025-08-03 01:50:45,,,,Humans can go places without their phones Isnt that amazing The only things I really use my phone for are to calltext my mother and one or two friends to check the weather and to read printed things via ocr If I absolutely dont have a computer nearby I might use it to research something on the Internet or to record a simple mp3 but thats extremely rare If I had to choose something technological to take with me it would be my Toughpad and keyboard The only reason I would bring a phone is for emergency purposes since I cant use other peoples phones without Talkback or Voiceover turned on And even if they were I dont use a touchscreen to type or dial numbers,n6mema1,7.0,1mfuxdg

comment,n6jtxan,drae-,,19,2025-08-02 16:37:53,,,,Microsoft doesnt need to do anything And I highly doubt some Gizmodo blogger has greater insight to market trends then Microsoft who spends tens of millions on market research and feasibility studies Nor do they know about the costs to implement or the logistics necessary to integrate such into their supply chain Stuff like It shows that if users want a laptop that can connect to the internet without relying on spotty public or Starbucks WiFi they need to pay through the nose Just pisses me off tethering your fucking phone is absolutely an option Ignoring the obvious solution just to create a greed narrative is fucking dumb So tired of this tone So arrogant,,0.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6jwjm3,CamiloArturo,,2,2025-08-02 16:51:57,,,,Cant think of anything I need less in my laptop than this Its right next to the app which monitors how many times I wear pants by putting my right leg vs left leg first,,0.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6k2i8q,shifty_coder,,2,2025-08-02 17:23:26,,,,Why Every major carrier has unlimited data with mobile hotspot If you need a laptop to work while you travel chances are you already have a smartphone with a major carrier The need for a cellular antenna in a tablet or laptop had long since passed,,0.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6k6snt,IronFrogger,,1,2025-08-02 17:45:27,,,,very recently I had bought a laptop to replace the COOs old laptop and they told me I cant use this unless it has a cellular modem I asked about tethering and they said they didnt want to go through the effort of that Anyway so that laptop went to someone else,n6k2i8q,1.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6kapki,Dan-in-Va,,1,2025-08-02 18:05:58,,,,I use a cellular enabled Dell laptop daily It works using the antenna in the laptop screen and doesnt burn down my phones battery The speed of battery burn while tethering is the biggest reason I seek this integration Microsoft Surface Pros and Dell notebooks both business Intel cellular versions have been my goto for this capability for the past 10 years Im waiting for a 5G version,n6k2i8q,1.0,1mfuxdg
comment,n6krg91,nuttierthanafruitcak,,2,2025-08-02 19:38:55,,,,so spend lots extra on a 5G laptop instead of a few dollars for a powerbank,n6kapki,2.0,1mfuxdg

comment,n6msyl1,Darthalicious,,1,2025-08-03 02:57:18,,,,Okay but real talk what is so great or even good about Surface laptops Ive dealt with a few for clients over the years and I have been sorely unimpressed They just feel like the geeky kid who imitates the popular kid MacBook but just doesnt have the right stuff to be cool Its been a couple years since I handled one they actually any better now,,0.0,1mfuxdg
