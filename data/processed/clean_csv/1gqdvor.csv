comment,lx0doi0,Flipdip3,,-5,2024-11-14 00:39:13,,,,That SIM tray that is going away in favor of eSIM All so I can put potentially important data on the SD card only to have it crap out randomly and lose that data SD cards are not a great storage medium They get borked all the time Apple has a specific way they want customers to experience their devices That may or may not line up with how you personally want to use your device In this case I can see Apple not wanting to explain to grandma that even though little Timmy set up her phone to use the SD card all her photos of her grandchildren are now lost because the SD card gave out It is just gravy that this also makes it easier for them to upsell the upgrade,lwyteyk,8.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx1cx57,CubicEarth,,1,2024-11-14 04:17:11,,,,Its always been that way It was shocking when computers first got rid of floppy drives Then they got rid of CDROM drives But somehow they get more and more capable as they go The rumors are that Apple will ditch the LightingUSBC port Personally I just dont like to be at the bleeding edge of the changes so I try to get the last model that does have say a CD drive and Ill have it for three or four years into the era when most new computers dont have one before finally buying a new computer that also doesnt have one Because by then it is normal to not have one and I wont be missing out Still Ill keep the old computer in a drawer so that at some point in the future I can still access my pile of old CDs also in drawers and probably riddled with bit rot,lx1306n,12.0,1gqdvor
comment,lx1f77b,Throwaway74829947,,4,2024-11-14 04:33:58,,,,Taking away functionality is completely different Computers stopped having floppy readers but because they were replaced with CD drives which fill the same niche Computers stopped widely having CD drives but only because they now have more USB ports which now fill the same niche My graphics card doesnt have DVI but it has DisplayPort and HDMI My computer which I built just a few years ago still has a CDROM drive well a Bluray burner but I do read and burn CDs with it semiregularly and will continue to have one for the foreseeable future The handy thing about PCs is that they are actually modular and you can add pretty much whatever functionality you want I could install a floppy reader right now and it would work fine and I kept a floppy reader in my computer until around 2011 I will also say I will never buy a phone without a USB port I almost exclusively use wired headphones and at least even without a headphone jack I can still use a dongle What would the replacement even be Wireless charging only and file transfer or system debugging via bluetooth or worse yet the Internet only A company making their products worse in the name of progress deserves no defense,lx1cx57,13.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx0fklc,Znuffie,,0,2024-11-14 00:50:16,,,,Very few mobile phones sacrifice a significant amount of space for a microSD card slot The biggest issues with microSD cards is that A LOT of them are VERY POOR quality Theyre way slower than internal storage and usually much more prone to failure I honestly prefer the trend of big storage space on the device itself when it comes to mobile phones,lwy4ekk,7.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx1yn6m,Znuffie,,1,2024-11-14 07:26:59,,,,Youre generalizing There are SD cards that can do 4K video speeds but not all SD cards support that They are labeled on the speeds and standard and they support But the SD speeds classifications are a mess and most people cant navigate trough then properly Theres a high chance that people will just buy random SD cards and then complain their phone is too slow Theres many potential issues,lx1vw8h,11.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx13qnk,CubicEarth,,0,2024-11-14 03:15:45,,,,Indeed but if you can eliminate the removal trays altogether you can reduce the mechanical complexity of the device make internal space available for other uses and increase the water tightness of the device So it is understandable why manufacturers are heading in that direction That being said I waited for the iPhone 14 Pro to be released to upgrade my 8 and then proceeded to buy the 13 Pro because it had a sim tray But other than one occasion when I first got it I have successfully managed to get by with just esims and I buy many when traveling,lx1110n,11.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx2aqx3,Pepparkakan,,3,2024-11-14 09:42:14,,,,Probably because the controller is relatively expensive in comparison to just dumb NAND modules doing it this way they get to make sure the computer has a really good storage controller while being able to replace dead modules easily Honestly this is better but it requires controllers be designed with the ability to talk to many different modules which is true of Apples controllers but not to the extent that we hobbyists think of it when we compare it to replaceable NVMe,lx1v5d6,4.0,1gqdvor
comment,lx34jua,riazzzz,,3,2024-11-14 13:55:19,,,,Its better than soldered on sure but way worse for the consumer than using standard nvme which also would have been the easiest to design solution this design choice 100 is in Apples benefit only and against the consumers right to repair If a design choice adds no benefit to the consumer and seems to only exist to deliberately restrict the consumers rights then that just immediately puts me off the productmanufacturer,lx2aqx3,5.0,1gqdvor
comment,lx3cj8a,Pepparkakan,,0,2024-11-14 14:43:28,,,,Id argue there is a consumer benefit it is possible to replace the NANDs and recalibrate the controller to use the new ones it just requires a little more competence than cavemanlevel Grug replace NVMe Grug computer better now which I agree is a step in the wrong direction What Im trying to say is that conceptually this is probably better than replacing an entire NVMe because the controller is expensive and now we dont have to replace the expensive part anymore Yes for now you can only get replacements from Apple thats bad but the idea is reasonable,lx34jua,6.0,1gqdvor

comment,lwyz89y,swolfington,,4,2024-11-13 20:06:56,,,,apple moving away from soldered on storage is good no matter how you slice it but whats particularly egregious here is while apple has done the exact same thing with the Mac Studios the NAND drives are physically different than the new Mac Minis like youd think it would have been easier on the inventory side of things alone to keep the parts the same but i guess not The only upside is the Studio NAND drives have been reverse engineered tried to link to the project doing it but the automod removed my comment for linking to kickstarter so its probably pretty likely that the Mini will too by their custom nature even without the controller logic they will probably always be more expensive than standard NVME drives but at least the potential is there,lwydhq6,3.0,1gqdvor

comment,lx1ixak,nullstring,,5,2024-11-14 05:02:39,,,,I mean this is all out of my ass but here goes SSDs often throttle under thermal stress This is due to to the controller heating up not the actual NAND Putting the controller into the SoC mitigates this issue as the SoC already has high cooling focus There are crap tons of NAND structures and controllers All with their own separate problems and issues The benefit of this is that manufacturers can innovate without having to worry about the controller on the mainboard or SoC But the downside of this is now you have all these controllers that each of unique operating characteristics caveats defects You can upgrade the NAND Controller without having to upgrade your whole SSD Of course upgrading your CPU so you can get a new NAND Controller might sounds weird but what I mean is that the different iterations of Apple silicon can use the same SSD card things with new iterations of the controller So it solves a potential supply chain issue Maybe there is benefits to having the controller closer to the CPU Its now way closer I doubt its even on a PCIe bus at all Just like we used to have memory controllers on the motherboard there can be benefits to having controllers closer to home What if your NAND controller can put things directly into memory or even directly into cache Even if they arent doing this now having the controller on the SoC means that a new iteration of Apple SoC could do this and use the already existing NAND Im not sure which of these are actual true benefits but I could see them being the case Of course I could come up with a list of downsides just as easy Im not saying this is the right choice but its not black and white,lx1htjf,5.0,1gqdvor

comment,lwxvoot,ItIsShrek,,39,2024-11-13 16:47:38,,,,There are no software locks The reason you cant just buy an adapter and slap in a normal M2 short enough to fit is that while normal SSDs have the controller DRAM and NAND all on one card Apple has the controller on the SoC and uses the system RAM on the SoC as well so these modules are not proper SSDs theyre mostly just NAND memory chips on a small module But there are no software locks on it and if you take a compatible module from another Mac you flash the machine with Apple configurator and it will accept the new module as its new internal drive,lwx5uys,2.0,1gqdvor

comment,lwxx7zu,Noteagro,,-1,2024-11-13 16:55:23,,,,2012 downgraded CPUs from the 2011 ones but they were also like 100200 cheaper due to this The reasoning was Apple didnt see people getting the faster chips and decided to go a cheaper route since those were the models selling However if we had to say they were the last of the good ones I would kind of agreed 2012 models iirc also did not allow for expanding storage like the 2011 models did 2014 might have had the soldered RAM but the 2011 to 2012 swap most definitely was the start of the downfall However do note that I was busy with college so the model years may be a ahead of the year I am saying BUT I know for a fact it was 20112012 I was looking at these computers We could possibly getting a disconnect if Apple uses model years like car manufacturers do Tbh I havent followed Apple products well since they gutted the Mini back then due to the disappointment in how bad they killed those machines,lwxw09v,3.0,1gqdvor
comment,lwxyptv,ItIsShrek,,2,2024-11-13 17:02:58,,,,Looks like the only downgrade was in the integrated graphics the newer generation CPUs were faster and the 2012s also came with USB 3 more RAM 4GB instead of 2GB and faster RAM They all had HDD connections but the 2012 had the option for a Fusion Drive so that would imply they also added their proprietary PCIe connector for the 2012 Additionally the base model 2012 was the exact same 599 as the base model 2011 Again it was the 2014 model that had a weaker base CPU for a cheaper price soldered RAM etc The 2012s were better in every way except base model GPU,lwxx7zu,4.0,1gqdvor
