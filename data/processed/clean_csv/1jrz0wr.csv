comment,mlijg95,stahpstaring,,87,2025-04-05 09:07:16,,,,I see this being a thing in poorer Asian countries regions like we see people there now on rundown motorcycles I dont see it happening in the west though Everyone is too self conscious,,0.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlkp9vt,Sharticus123,,32,2025-04-05 18:04:53,,,,I was just down near the South American equator and I saw a significant number of people on electric motorcycles and scooters This kind of stuff is perfect for developing countries Compared to internal combustion engines the daily cost of an EV bike is considerably less expensive and the maintenance is almost nonexistent,mlijg95,1.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mln8iuh,SimmentalTheCow,,11,2025-04-06 03:27:46,,,,Theft is a big problem though The batteries are relatively easy to steal and are expensive I cant imagine how many of those solar panels are going to vanish,mlkp9vt,2.0,1jrz0wr

comment,mlk601a,Danne660,,1,2025-04-05 16:19:15,,,,The extra air resistance dont matter if it is not moving but i dont think it is designed to be removed for when you are driving and put back on for when you are not,mlk431b,2.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlk9jzs,Dogzirra,,1,2025-04-05 16:39:12,,,,If the blades can be folded it would cut air resistance considerably while moving but still augment the charge if unfolded while parked This makes more sense in energy conservation io If it spends more time charging vs traveling it makes sense too,mlk601a,3.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlir6oi,PussyStapler,,22,2025-04-05 10:33:07,,,,Not necessarily There are examples of wind turbine powered cars that can travel upwind and can go downwind faster than the wind,mlinfnv,1.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlm7933,gerwen,,11,2025-04-05 23:18:49,,,,While that wind powered vehicle is really cool and a bit counterintuitive This silly bike isnt wind powered Its battery powered If the charging system and turbine was 100 efficient it would exactly balance the drag on the system No net benefit But since its not 100 efficient it is a drag on the system and you will absolutely get less range than if it didnt exist Solar power could possibly help but Ive no idea if its powerful enough to offset the aerodynamic drag,mlir6oi,2.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mln70r8,cutelyaware,,4,2025-04-06 03:16:37,,,,Pretty sure the turbine is just another way to charge the batteries while parked During operation I expect it just disengages and spins free Or I suppose it could be used to help propel you,mlm7933,3.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mln8jwu,gerwen,,2,2025-04-06 03:27:59,,,,No if it was to charge batteries while parked itd be on a swivel so it could follow the wind Propel the bike Doubtful it clearly says theyre wind turbines,mln70r8,4.0,1jrz0wr

comment,mliswle,Danne660,,19,2025-04-05 10:50:52,,,,if you use the bike to drive faster then the wind which will be almost all the time if used as a motorcycle then im pretty much 100 sure that it will perform better with the wind part removed Also while the car in the article you posted is really impressive im pretty sure it relies on sailing techniques and would not be able to achieve that if it was constrained to roads,mlir6oi,2.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlitm8f,PussyStapler,,7,2025-04-05 10:57:58,,,,You should read the link or watch a video on it rather than just insisting it cant be done It is really unintuitive but its correct,mliswle,3.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mliu08b,Danne660,,10,2025-04-05 11:01:45,,,,Oh i belive you i think i did not explain myself properly what im saying is that while it is possible to reach higher speeds then the wind using only wind i will check the video later to see how much of that is reliant on sailing using extra power on top of that wind like you would want to do with a powered bike would lead to extreme diminishing returns on the wind part To the point of the wind part becoming negative with just a fairly minor increase in speed I did read the link and it described it as sailing but did not go into details,mlitm8f,4.0,1jrz0wr

comment,mlo4y29,hamlet9000,,2,2025-04-06 08:16:44,,,,But those videos have nothing to do with using a wind turbine to generate electricity that charges a battery to move the wheels,mlitm8f,4.0,1jrz0wr

comment,mlnispp,brickmaster32000,,1,2025-04-06 04:46:46,,,,That is using wind that already exists Of course you can use wind to push yourself potentially to any speed but that isnt what this bike is doing This bike is attempting to generate its own wind and then use that wind to run the generator that is providing the power to create said wind That will never work It is not the same as the Veratasium video you linked In that case you are using existing wind not the wind you are generating by moving,mlir6oi,2.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mljx0nb,airckarc,,10,2025-04-05 15:28:54,,,,It a stupid concept Adding weight and air resistance to a city bike that has no need for the increased range A strong wind could easily knock over the rider I dont see how the solar energy gained would offset the weight and drag On the TukTuk that already has a fixed roof and may spend time just waiting for a fare I imagine solar might add a small bit of extra range,,0.0,1jrz0wr

comment,mlog3d7,qdtk,,2,2025-04-06 10:17:47,,,,I enjoyed the part where the author of the article has no clue what hes talking about Does he think the turbine is moving this thing like an airboat Now I dont know how the turbine attached to the front is cleared for road use considering its clearly a health hazard Sure it might make for a nice breezy ride on a hot day but you dont want to run into pedestrians with that thing rotating,,0.0,1jrz0wr
comment,mlpjyct,RealisticEntity,,2,2025-04-06 15:09:02,,,,I dont think this solarwind electric bike is practical The roof would make it too heavy and prone to falling over and at speed may cause the bike to lift off the ground or get buffeted around and fall over Not too mention the fan on the front will cause significant drag Both these things should be packed away before riding if possible but otherwise make some kind of sense if they can be used to recharge the battery when the bike is parked,,0.0,1jrz0wr
