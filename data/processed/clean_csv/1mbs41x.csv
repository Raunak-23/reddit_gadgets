comment,n5ogec8,dropthemagic,,133,2025-07-28 21:03:57,,,,They should just do a recall at this point Eventually one of these is going to catch on fire on a plane Its not worth the lawsuits Just recall the damn phones,,0.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5okk7s,xGuru37,,69,2025-07-28 21:24:29,,,,Agreed I remember airlines actually banning Note7 phones for the same reason,n5ogec8,1.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5qrczq,Emerald_Flame,,12,2025-07-29 05:17:10,,,,Samsung eventually pushed a firmware for them that literally stops them from charging So for the people who didnt turn them in ifwhen they got the firmware update once the battery died and the phone turned off that was it,n5ppx6p,3.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5qdw5k,xGuru37,,4,2025-07-29 03:36:17,,,,I bet It was hard to convince my cell provider at the time to let me swap to a completely different phone once the news first broke I wasnt going to take chances,n5q8xve,3.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5wpu0v,gilligvroom,,2,2025-07-30 02:15:49,,,,I worked at Best Buy during that fiasco and our Samsung reps all looked like they were ready to take a flying leap off the building I was merrily avoiding all of that BS because Id just moved out of Mobile to Digital Cameras and Geek Squad,n5okk7s,2.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5pg3gs,ResponsibleQuiet6611,,12,2025-07-29 00:13:49,,,,That would set a precedence and they would have to recall every a phone from 4a onward and maybe their nona phones too So not happening Their plan is to render the affected phones useless via software updates in hopes that we all upgrade to other phones until they can sweep this all under the rug,n5ogec8,1.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5piscz,BlueProcess,,3,2025-07-29 00:29:14,,,,No one should have to give up their phone which is almost impossible to scrub of their data Either ship replacements or do the obvious thing and roll back the update,n5ogec8,1.0,1mbs41x
comment,n637wha,brrbles,,-1,2025-07-31 01:41:07,,,,There are plenty of reasons to be mad at Google but this is an incoherent criticism If the phone is at risk of starting on fire due to the battery a free battery replacement or a generous counter offer to get you to replace your battery or phone are reasonable responses and it would be arguably worse for them to give you the YOLO button Theres no reason for them to give you a completely new phone to replace a 4 or in the case of the 4a 6 year old device Im not sure why in this scenario youre worried about your phone getting spied on you actually can factory reset the thing and it will be effectively scrubbed In fact for the most part simply powering it off completely will be just as effective if you have a decent passcode In fact you even have another option that lets you keep the phone restores functionality and lets you maintain custody take the cash option buy a replacement battery and replace it yourself,n5piscz,2.0,1mbs41x
comment,n6390d5,BlueProcess,,-1,2025-07-31 01:47:50,,,,It is not incoherent criticism If a software rollout broke it a software rollback would fix it Plain and simple I think you are well aware of how easy it is to recover deleted data Its not a risk one should be forced to take Not even for the lure of free stuff,n637wha,3.0,1mbs41x
comment,n65t41c,brrbles,,4,2025-07-31 13:23:14,,,,The software update is not what is causing the risk of battery fires its the fucking batteries Take or leave the software update the battery is still at risk And you are 100 wrong about data recovery on your phone User data is stored encrypted and the only way to get it unencrypted is to use the security chip on the phone and feed it your unlock code The unlock code then decrypts the decryption key for data on your phone When you factory reset your phone it deletes that decryption key entirely and the memory chips store data that is indistinguishable from random bits,n6390d5,4.0,1mbs41x
comment,n662htg,BlueProcess,,-2,2025-07-31 14:10:50,,,,Weird how the batteries were fine until the software update,n65t41c,5.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5qblpz,ludocode,,15,2025-07-29 03:20:50,,,,Read this It says only some devices are impacted Click the button that says Check Pixel 6a eligibility and paste in your IMEI I put in mine and it said my phone is not eligible for the free replacement Im hoping that means I dont have one of the defective batteries If it says your device is impacted they will supposedly let you take it to a repair shop to swap the battery for free,n5oxf6w,1.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5pcinu,ElvisArcher,,19,2025-07-28 23:53:34,,,,Someone at Google did the math and realized all those phones were going to suffer catastrophic battery failure rates soon And that by reducing the overall charge capacity that failure rate could be significantly lowered But nothing will prevent it its just delaying the inevitable,,0.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5pguor,ResponsibleQuiet6611,,6,2025-07-29 00:18:11,,,,I doubt in practice it affects the failure rate at all They can just publish some bullshit lies engineering reports indicating it will and never be held accountable The real goal of the batterygimping patches is to mitigate liability by pushing consumers with affected devices to upgrade by rendering their purchased good useless This is the beginning of hardware as a service,n5pcinu,1.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5q0tjw,ElvisArcher,,2,2025-07-29 02:13:25,,,,Yep For me it was an easy decision Moved cell phone carriers and picked up a pixel 9 for free Google Fi cut my cell bill in half,n5pguor,2.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5r5nql,ElvisArcher,,2,2025-07-29 07:26:02,,,,Fi was running a deal where you buy the Pixel 9 on credit then get a monthly rebate that 100 covers the cost over a 2 year period This was about a year ago so their offerings may have changed,n5qi0kq,4.0,1mbs41x

comment,n688pdf,ElvisArcher,,2,2025-07-31 20:18:07,,,,The sad reality is that every device is designed to fail in an absurdly short period of time 4 years isnt bad in todays ecosystem but as long as we are toting devices with LiIon batteries there is no escape,n67q35y,6.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5t0afq,IlTossico,,1,2025-07-29 15:09:39,,,,WHAT thats why my phone just lost a ton of durability on the battery in the last few weeks I was doing 2 days and half just fine with my 6A and now it is a miracle if I finish the second day,,0.0,1mbs41x

comment,n5oy3ds,nipsen,,-27,2025-07-28 22:35:03,,,,Ars is doing a propagandabit for another manufacturer who sees google as a competitor read Apple and theyre succeeding as well The pixel6a like literally all phones on the market at this point uses a lithium polymer battery They will not catch on fire and burn your house down the organic lithium ion batteries also do not do that any more and havent for a decade unless you actually light them on fire and damage the cells Theres basically no way to bypass the regulator for the battery discharge effect without shorting it out But Ars seem incabable of actually mentioning this in any of their several articles about this Im sure it is possible to make most phones including the pixel way too hot by charging it full effect as you discharge the battery by accident through inadvertently running some app forever or an update hanging itself or something like that Where the combined effect from the charging and the processor burn will end up torching something which then in turn flashes and causes damage But the battery itself is not the problem With this phone or with any other phone on the market But Ars just doesnt know I guess like a good mercenary,,0.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5p1rsy,Dan1elSan,,17,2025-07-28 22:55:05,,,,This just isnt correct lithium batteries can and do catch fire Theres plenty of evidence of the Pixel 6a doing just that and thats why Google is replacing the batteries presently for free,n5oy3ds,1.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5p5vkj,nipsen,,-12,2025-07-28 23:17:25,,,,Lithium polymer batteries do not have a combustible electrolyte To get these to catch fire requires a power source that would be bigger than the potential energy release They do not simply catch on fire period And like I said with a regulator the organic batteries also do not catch on fire any more unless they are physically damaged This entire ars series is complete bullshit,n5p1rsy,2.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5p8udf,Dan1elSan,,15,2025-07-28 23:33:29,,,,Defective lithium batteries can overheat and catch fire one specific battery manufacturer installed within the pixel 6a is targeted in the battery swap scheme It can overheat and cause a fire its not really up for debate Theyre not doing a battery swap out of the goodness of their hearts its a safety risk due to possibility of overheating and causing a fire Nobody is saying the phone is going to burst into flames but people charge their phones in all sorts of places and if your defective battery overheats it has the possibility of igniting its surroundings,n5p5vkj,3.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5qj4av,krigr,,3,2025-07-29 04:13:10,,,,Lithium batteries work by moving lithium atoms from one electrode through a membrane to another electrode Depending on the chemistry and manufacturing process the lithium can deposit into spike shapes over time and if the spikes grow through the membrane and make contact from both sides theyll act as a tiny short It might only be a very small short at first with a tiny amount of current but it reduces their effective capacity and causes the battery to drain over time on its own This means the battery gets discharged and recharged faster causing a feedback loop that grows a tiny wire to a more significant internal short thats fully capable of igniting the battery Due to the microscopic engineering and precision metallurgy required its impossible to prevent this from happening 100 of the time Its entirely possible that the Pixel 6as battery happened to use a bad batch of electrodesmembraneswhatever It would take inspecting every crevice of every battery with an atomic microscope to prevent it and that simply cant happen at scale so well have to settle for 999 Mind you my Pixel 6a has been running just fine Fingers crossed it stays that way,n5oy3ds,1.0,1mbs41x
comment,n5qjjmb,nipsen,,-4,2025-07-29 04:16:17,,,,sigh no lithium salts in the electrolyte What year is this again 1974,n5qj4av,2.0,1mbs41x
