comment,mz163ld,elheber,,37,2025-06-21 19:11:30,,,,The standard Q3 has pancake lenses as opposed to older Fresnel lenses The visual quality is so much better that once youve tasted pancake you cant go back to Fresnel I bought the Quest Pro on launch back when it cost 1500 I can safely say it was not worth the 1500 and I immediately regretted the purchase HOWEVER I could not convince myself return it because of the pancake lenses,mz0ju7z,2.0,1lgyr2k
comment,mz24r32,LkMMoDC,,13,2025-06-21 22:26:34,,,,The lenses are also significantly better for anyone who wears glasses I purchased lens inserts for my quest 3 but I can comfortably wear it for long sessions with my contacts or my glasses for shorter sessions Couldnt say the same for the quest 2 which was fresnel and had a narrower IPD You need lens inserts for it,mz163ld,3.0,1lgyr2k

comment,mz2h8j3,phillz91,,2,2025-06-21 23:42:02,,,,Depending on what style of strap you prefer I have found the BOBOVR options I have S3 for the Quest 3 to be very good It is a halo style so distributes the weight well and has hot swappable batteries though I find just the one is enough for how much I play,mz0dqtx,5.0,1lgyr2k
comment,mz6qnzy,CheeseDonutCat,,1,2025-06-22 17:40:04,,,,I bought a cheap extra battery pack that is part of the head strap I paid 22 euro or so on temu and it gives me 34 extra hours It does make the headset a bit heavier though,mz0dqtx,5.0,1lgyr2k
