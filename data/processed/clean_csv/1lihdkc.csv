comment,mzfa4po,moreghoststhanpeople,,7,2025-06-23 23:56:32,,,,Very true But I feel like they maybe picked zurg for color diversity They already had little green man and buzz with green and white palettes They could have maybe done Bo peep or hamm for a pink but maybe that was too gendered Who knows lol,mzf9083,2.0,1lihdkc

comment,n63orvb,Kichigai,,1,2025-07-31 03:24:01,,,,In Toy Story 4 Woody finds himself not Bonnies favorite toy but still dedicated to her happiness as he struggles to acclimate himself to his new role While on a road trip he runs into Bo Peep who is now a lost toy hanging out in the RV parks playground with other lost toys By the end of the movie he realizes hes not needed for Bonnies happiness that he can hand that job off to Buzz who Bonnie still loves and he can basically retire to be a lost toy with Bo who he missed more than he realized So yeah Hanks is out,n63h0dw,5.0,1lihdkc

comment,mzbwnig,chrisdh79,,64,2025-06-23 14:02:31,,,,From the article Sadly the PC is only available in Taiwan with no overseas shipping service available Each of the 500 units is priced at NT 79900 2700 with the first 50 buyers receiving 2000 free LINE Pay points The company does say that the individual components are currently only available in Taiwan so they could make their way to other markets in time allowing you to put together your own Toy Story PC if youre into that sort of thing No word yet on their prices,,0.0,1lihdkc
