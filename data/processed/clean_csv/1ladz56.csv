comment,mxl3kin,quajeraz-got-banned,,81,2025-06-13 16:12:51,,,,An FPGA is a chip that can change its logical makeup Basically it can emulate other systems on a hardware level instead of software Instead of interpreting the program instructions and changing them to work on other hardware the processor and other chips change how they function to be a copy of the original,mxkpoiq,2.0,1ladz56
comment,mxldeuv,diabloman8890,,6,2025-06-13 16:59:35,,,,Whats the implications of that for console emulation,mxl3kin,3.0,1ladz56
comment,mxldx11,CandyCrisis,,37,2025-06-13 17:01:54,,,,FPGA based emulators exist today The implication is better quality emulation if youre willing to buy a custom machine and at that point why not buy a real PS1 or NES or whatever,mxldeuv,4.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmpva4,RealModeX86,,20,2025-06-13 20:54:06,,,,and at that point why not buy a real PS1 or NES or whatever For me its the perfect blend of accuracy and convenience as cool as real hardware is For now its still relatively easy to choose either way based on your preferences For the long term its good to have the FPGA stuff figured out for preservation since those implementations can be saved as data long after the hardware is gone or impractical to buy due to rarity It also opens up the possibility of creating dropin replacement parts for the various custom chips on original hardware such as with the FPGASID project for the C64 sound chip Of course that FPGA preservation needs to happen while we can still do both,mxldx11,5.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmr8ap,Tithis,,5,2025-06-13 21:00:51,,,,And often those old systems are going to need work to connect to a modern TV At minimum youll be looking at some kind of line doubler Then if you want higher video quality on some systems youll need to do hardware mods because they dont support RGB or component natively Then factor in the games themselves Physical copies cost more than ever and flash carts or mods for optical media systems aint cheap either Once you start looking to do this with more than one system the Mister feels like the better solution to me,mxmpva4,6.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmwolq,RealModeX86,,2,2025-06-13 21:28:50,,,,Yeah the display options are one of the big factors of the flexibility for me I can do lowlatency HDMI VGA or component from mine and with the right cabling RGBSCART svideo or composite with most cores being cycleaccurate down to the scanline for the analog formats,mxmr8ap,7.0,1ladz56
comment,mxngu80,Inetro,,3,2025-06-13 23:21:17,,,,Thats possible now but year after year buying original hardware will get harder and harder Technology is not timeless and repair parts will dry up eventually A modern solution can add decades to the lifespan of the original games,mxldx11,5.0,1ladz56
comment,mxohbop,miguel-styx,,2,2025-06-14 03:01:04,,,,Because unlike the real machine you can scale up many aspects emulation In simplest terms its like overclocking I really meant the ones like the Analogue Pocket some people want to play like the real machine but in HD or something smh,mxldx11,5.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmst35,cpt-derp,,5,2025-06-13 21:08:46,,,,Literally perfect accuracy down to the frame if programmed correctly FPGAs are a breadboard for digital circuits on crack instead of manually wiring things and slotting in transistors or gates you program the logic and it shapeshifts its gates to be the exact CPU you want it to be Limits depend on how many logic gates and the clock speed Current high end FPGAs can emulate a Pentium 3 I think,mxldeuv,4.0,1ladz56
comment,mxn8ue3,OnboardG1,,5,2025-06-13 22:35:35,,,,High end FPGAs can soft implement pretty comply ARM cores The way they work is even cooler than physical gates for people not aware of it You take the truth table for a logic gate by writing the outputs compared to inputs So an AND gate is 00 0 01 0 10 0 and 11 1 A gate array works out the truth table for every component in the system and encodes it in memory It has a massively powerful synthesis and simplification engine in the IDE to do that I do miss FPGA engineering Id love to get back into it,mxmst35,5.0,1ladz56
comment,mxpqgfx,mark-haus,,1,2025-06-14 09:29:44,,,,That you can copy the function of the original hardware potentially In some cases its actually harder to copy in hardware than software Then theres Nintendo 64 which is just hard no matter what method is used Decompiling n64 games seems most successful Also FPGA can give you the hardware copy which when done right is more accurate while you can have modern nice to haves like hdmi output,mxldeuv,4.0,1ladz56
comment,mxnuwj0,qda,,2,2025-06-14 00:45:35,,,,No I meant about the 1300 There are already sub200 FPGA units available that emulate PS1 nearperfectly so I dont understand what they meant about 1300 in the next 3 years,mxl3kin,3.0,1ladz56
comment,mxnxz20,quajeraz-got-banned,,1,2025-06-14 01:03:52,,,,I imagine they meant an FPGA that could emulate modern devices like ps5XSX instead of only old hardware,mxnuwj0,4.0,1ladz56

comment,mxsp06j,swaggythrowaway69,,1,2025-06-14 20:16:37,,,,I mean funny playing FPGBC is literally a GBC with an FPGA instead of the original processor Look up the tad boy color and frog boy color by froggo customs Literally GBC in different form factors with components migrated from the a GBC Theres also the gameboy pocket color which is a GBC migrated to a pocket size motherboard Pretty sure there are after market boards for the DMG001,mxr2hb7,3.0,1ladz56
comment,mxtmbyw,KyleKun,,1,2025-06-14 23:24:55,,,,Ok a point about the FPGA its a SOC which thinks its a Gameboy on a very deep and troubling level but hardware wise its completely different You wouldnt be able to use GB original hardware in place of the FPGA anymore than you would with the Analog Pocket Although fair point about Froggo I just looked and it seems like it uses original components but the problem is that its not like you would be able to make a new GBC the projects are scaled to fit in froggo cases But I concede that at least the GBC board layout has been replicated,mxsp06j,4.0,1ladz56

comment,mxrdygx,EvenSpoonier,,3,2025-06-14 16:08:04,,,,The main idea behind this is that even if the motherboard is damaged as long as the core chips are still intact you can replace everything else It allows you to salvage a working system in many cases that would otherwise have been considered beyond repair There is a secondary use for psOne users who want a parallel port I guess but I dont think well see people using it very much for that,mxo38pk,1.0,1ladz56

comment,mxknwio,NickCharlesYT,,19,2025-06-13 14:59:03,,,,Macbooks especially anything post2013 or so are genuinely terrible to work with Go check out what guys like Louis Rossmann have to do to fix those stupid laptopsits not worth it and thats why theyre so cheap when theyre broken This video is from 9 years ago but its just as bad today if not worse Note Rossmann has some colorful language fair warning His own website shows his shop doesnt work on anything newer than a 2020 model either Edit Heres a few more recent videos explaining why more modern macbooks are often unrepairable at all,mxklkq9,4.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmg50d,Neo_Techni,,1,2025-06-13 20:06:01,,,,I bought an XBOXone Kinect and had to get it replaced twice cause it has a dead fuse and I have to ask why the hell do these companies even use fuses whose whole point is to fail and be easy to replace so that it saves the rest of the board from an overcharge if theyre not going to make them easy to replace,mxk7cbn,3.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmgm88,LorentioB,,8,2025-06-13 20:08:24,,,,Becouse they dont give a fuck about you consumer and they make it simple for them to replace it,mxmg50d,4.0,1ladz56

comment,mxk9ao9,sorrylilsis,,5,2025-06-13 13:46:45,,,,For chips that old I would not say that its easy but its still something that someone could do at home without specialized equipment The chips themselves are usualy the more reliables parts its the motherboards that die And the supply of working original consoles is only going to get down Makes sense to have options like that,mxjxe5j,1.0,1ladz56
comment,mxk23b7,fairportmtg1,,-16,2025-06-13 13:06:43,,,,Not to mention the PS2 one do the best selling consoles of all time plays PS1 games perfectly fine This seems like a nest thing to exist but not sure who this is for,mxjxe5j,1.0,1ladz56

comment,mxki5rz,fairportmtg1,,-5,2025-06-13 14:31:39,,,,If you are using actual disc it does play PS1 games natively Im not saying zero people are going to buy this Im saying this is a super super niche item that I dont see even the majority of retro game enthusiast caring about Disc based consoles generally the laser will die before you need to worry about a motherboard going The skills needed to desolder and resolder a full motherboard of chips is a lot If the majority of even retro gamers that care about a specific system would do this type of thing then explain why is analog so successful with FPGA systems They arent original hardware but offer many convinces that could already be added to original consoles with mods that are also not easy to install like this Its cool but this is a niche product is a niche hobby,mxk63wd,3.0,1ladz56
comment,mxkipfi,TediousSign,,4,2025-06-13 14:34:19,,,,If youre not sure who its for why are you browsing rgadgets Much less commenting on the gadgets you arent interested in,mxk23b7,2.0,1ladz56
comment,mxkk0k4,fairportmtg1,,-7,2025-06-13 14:40:40,,,,Lol explain the market for this item then Its at best a small niche product that appeals to a few thousand at most world wide I said its cool but seems like something that doesnt really need to exist as there are plenty of physical PlayStations left I dont even need to make the argument that PlayStation is able to be played on multiple other sont consoles and the emulation for it is fake as well Id make the same comment about pretty much any retro console equivalent of this Making a new motherboard that you need to salvage chips from an existing console seems like more effort than its worth and doesnt make practical or financial sense,mxkipfi,3.0,1ladz56

comment,mxklvji,fairportmtg1,,-5,2025-06-13 14:49:31,,,,The dude is the one who is doing this project setting it up to make it able to be produced Hes obviously trying to get attention to get people to buy them As a hobby project its cool but the plan as it seems to make it so one could manufacter them is stupid Its anti capitalism to say this expensive version of something that already exists is stupid If you try to tell me with a stright face that some number of people wouldnt buy this and tear apart a fully working PS1 just cause you are lying Capitalismconsumer culture is everywhere in video games,mxkkiai,5.0,1ladz56
comment,mxmw506,rasz_pl,,-10,2025-06-13 21:25:57,,,,Except no one needs to save a dying 1990s PlayStation 1 because there were 100million units sold worldwide people insisting on playing using real hardware will _never_ run out,,0.0,1ladz56
