comment,n6bs7ae,CalRipkenForCommish,,35,2025-08-01 10:43:09,,,,Thats a good read I am interested in how theyll address the increased power consumption I didnt see it referenced in the article,,0.0,1mestcq
comment,n6c86hr,letsnottry,,11,2025-08-01 12:33:08,,,,I dont think power is too much of an issue with most chips most Sony chips pull around 7watts the power draw issues come from accessories The movie cameras ARRI Alexasrun on 12v batteries where the chips pull around 10 watts but when you start rolling and with a viewfinder on and are outputting video you start to touch around 80watts So they become pretty power hungry The Sony movie cameras the Venice is considered efficient at around 60watts with a much larger sensor,n6bs7ae,1.0,1mestcq
comment,n6cuvbm,guzhogi,,7,2025-08-01 14:33:02,,,,There were a few DSLRs or similar type cameras that used to have built in GPS to geotag the photos taken but I hear that many companies dropped GPS due to the power drain Ive also seen cameras now that tether to your phone to do the same thing Not sure how the quality compares though,n6c86hr,2.0,1mestcq
comment,n6cfm9r,CalRipkenForCommish,,1,2025-08-01 13:15:38,,,,Good points and thanks for the feedback Whats your take on battery life It would seem therell be significant power draw even though the batteries are becoming more efficient,n6c86hr,2.0,1mestcq

comment,n6ci08j,letsnottry,,3,2025-08-01 13:28:18,,,,There are a bunch of other factors like gain ect ect we have the back lit sensors the dual gain sensors ect working today this seems more like more processing power on the chip its self and not a big advancement in terms of the photodionics but an extra layer of the logic substratefar more efficient than a logic board separate of the sensor its self I think if this tech ends up in say a consumer camera they will neuter it to keep the power in check for the application and the power draw will increase for professional applications,,0.0,1mestcq
comment,n6fgv07,Thanges88,,2,2025-08-01 22:14:19,,,,Rather than just additional logic the article mentions they could also move the pixel transistor to the second layer leaving the logic in the third layer enabling larger photodiodes on the first layer It will be interesting to see what Sony value more additional logic very handy for video or more sensitive pixels,n6ci08j,1.0,1mestcq
comment,n6d6m3x,Sweet_Ad_153,,2,2025-08-01 15:29:07,,,,Does anyone smarter than I know if this is similar to what Blackmagic Design did initially with their 12K sensor,,0.0,1mestcq

comment,n6okl2p,ValgrimTheWizb,,2,2025-08-03 12:10:40,,,,No Foveons X3 used stacked photodiodes instead of a Bayer pattern with an antialiasing filter to avoid color artifacts this caused the image to be really sharp compared to a Bayer sensor of equal resolution but they suffered from low light sensitivity and bad color accuracy This is just an extra electronic layer stacked beneath the sensor Its unclear how this improves the image quality but my guess is some sort of extra signal processing before analogtodigital conversion,n6e9isa,1.0,1mestcq
comment,n6cwx6f,nanapancakethusiast,,-24,2025-08-01 14:42:56,,,,And it will still be absolutely obliterated in terms of image quality by a 40 year old point and shoot camera loaded with 35mm film,,0.0,1mestcq

comment,n6cyccp,letsnottry,,0,2025-08-01 14:49:47,,,,Yup expect Kodak to start releasing new stocks in the near future They are releasing a new motion picture stock soon and I suspect a more nuteral photo stock to be scanned and manipulated like digital photos The human eye loves those chemical photo sites Long live film Its funny to try and talk my clients into shooting film they are so worried something might go wrong but forget that this has been the workflow for 100 years,n6cwx6f,1.0,1mestcq
