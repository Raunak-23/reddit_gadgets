comment,mzp37tg,internetlad,,149,2025-06-25 13:47:15,,,,Every time a fair phone comes out I go okay this is the time I get one because I love the idea then finding out that its got specs that are half that or worse of phones at a competing price point and I go ehhhh maybe theyll figure it out on the next go round,,0.0,1lk2uys

comment,n0mdltx,zzazzzz,,1,2025-06-30 18:26:05,,,,doesnt mean they have to use severely outdated SoCs at least offer an option with a current SoC many ppl wouldnt mind the upcharge but as it stands you buy a phone with such an outdated cpu that it will be a sluggish laggy mess way before it breaks completely contradicting the mission of a repairable phone,mzppazb,2.0,1lk2uys
comment,n0n40p7,terrytw,,1,2025-06-30 20:34:52,,,,I myself wont buy it But SD 7 gen3s is from late 2024 so I dont know what you mean by outdated soc Also the current mobile phone soc is redundantly overpowered given that you dont game on it The first problem with longevity comes with battery and storage degradation I think you dont really understand a lot of the technical details,n0mdltx,3.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzq8nvx,atascon,,39,2025-06-25 17:03:07,,,,No such thing as a free lunch Also as a significantly smaller company with little to no buying power the price point is honestly pretty impressive for what they are offering Their target audience is more than happy to sacrifice performance for repairability and sustainability There are also people that just want a phone that can run a few apps reliably I am typing this on an iPhone 8 that still does everything I need it to If it wasnt for the fact that there are basically no iOS updates anymore and app updates might stop at some point I would just keep it and keep replacing the battery,mzp37tg,1.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzqsdhu,internetlad,,9,2025-06-25 18:33:08,,,,Its just a real bummer they dont have a true flagship offering Im not saying Id pay 1600 for a phone with great specs without thinking twice Im just saying Im looking for one and the closest I can find is rooting a pixel 9 pro and installing 3rd party OS,mzq8nvx,2.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzqzogf,iampuh,,-9,2025-06-25 19:07:53,,,,So people really do care if they have 8 or 12gb of ram on a phone huh Not a si for person will notice the difference What are people doing on their phones which demands the power of the fastest Snapdragon The answer is gaming and nothing else,mzq8nvx,2.0,1lk2uys

comment,mzwzq61,jcw99,,4,2025-06-26 17:15:49,,,,Got a Fairphone 5 at the end of last year Yes the specs are worse than a comparable pixel my partner has but honestly Specs are so good as a baseline at this point I dont really see a way in which my specs are holding me back Maybe I could use slightly more battery life but turns out a bunch of pixels had some flaws in their batteries anyway and after waiting ages for their warranty battery replacement my partners phone with the fixed battery lasts about as long as mine anyway,mzp37tg,1.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzqbquq,billybobjoesee,,4,2025-06-25 17:17:03,,,,Eh outside of a large battery and decent camera I dont care about phone specs Never felt my Iphone 10 nor the s7 edge it replaced were lacking power for what I do on a phone Granted it seems like the camera is a step down than most phones its price which is a tough pill to swallow The bigger issue is carriers dont take it and I have great deal with a nonTMobile carrier that saves me enough money to stop me from swapping even for a phone I think is really cool like this one,mzp37tg,1.0,1lk2uys

comment,mzpmgou,SouthernTeuchter,,18,2025-06-25 15:20:13,,,,Back in the day when I worked for BlackBerry the battery compartment was deliberately designed so that when the phone was dropped the battery panel would fly off and battery would eject This helped reduce potential damage to the phone,mzokom8,2.0,1lk2uys

comment,mzy9ll4,Kingstad,,7,2025-06-26 20:55:42,,,,It looks like a lot of people arent aware that a good chunk of the point of fairphone is that the manufacturing of it is ethical It will never be able to compete in price with competitors using slave labour and the like,,0.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzr6l0u,MarinatedPickachu,,2,2025-06-25 19:41:06,,,,Isnt it the whole point of the fairphone to not have new versions and instead just replace components Aside of the concept just not being well suited for mobile phones why is there even a fairphone 6,,0.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzx8i1e,jcw99,,4,2025-06-26 17:55:31,,,,I think you have misunderstood them they encourage you to not upgrade to the latest generation and repair your phone for as long as practicable but they do not say that that will be forever They do this by keeping several generations of spare parts available and giving 7 years of guaranteed software support most companies other than Google and apple give 2 However even if you wanted to keep making the same thing forever the manufacturers of the basic passive components and ICs that go into a phone will also discontinue their production runs meaning that you have to make changes in turn Additionally very few people would a phone that has the specs from 12 years ago The age of a Fairphone 1 at this point So they make a new version every 2 years with some fixes and improvements while still supporting the previous generations for as long as they have spare parts they still have parts for the V2 on offer,mzr6l0u,1.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzroqmb,atascon,,1,2025-06-25 21:06:53,,,,Ive thought about this as well but ultimately if they want to compete at all and use Android they have to participate in the arms race with other phones I would agree it is a bit of a contradiction philosophically though There are other dumb phones out there that do this a bit less but they tend to be a bit more limited,mzr6l0u,1.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzt43hg,MetriccStarDestroyer,,0,2025-06-26 01:46:13,,,,Ya that was my understanding as well I was expecting a frame with upgradeable components But na its just for parts replacement Bruh I pay technicians either way Im not sacrificing performance for some repairability when other brands are accepting damaged unit trade ins,mzr6l0u,1.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzugh71,your_evil_ex,,1,2025-06-26 07:47:40,,,,Seems like a similar situation with framework laptops and fairphone a device that has repairable parts so that you can use it for decadesexcept the specs are already underpowered on day one so by the time you actually need to repair a part the device will be obsolete and youll need a new one anywyay,mzt43hg,2.0,1lk2uys
comment,mzv9jgo,Nacho_Dan677,,3,2025-06-26 12:00:05,,,,Expect the difference is that framework standardized the chassis on their laptops Allowing a user to replace a main card with an upgrade easily And also even create a mini PC out of the old main board I thought faiphone was doing something similar or maybe they are still trying to find a chassis design to settle with,mzugh71,3.0,1lk2uys
