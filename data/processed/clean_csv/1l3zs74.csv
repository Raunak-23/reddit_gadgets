comment,mw51atf,cjinl,,127,2025-06-05 14:22:24,,,,This is really cool but its unfortunate that they only include Time Crisis when the 2nd and 3rd games are so much better,,0.0,1l3zs74

comment,mw68yx0,narwhal_breeder,,20,2025-06-05 17:48:51,,,,This is just a rebranded Ultimarc AimTrak which works with MAME on modern screens,mw5dhxy,2.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw6dnkt,NuPNua,,3,2025-06-05 18:10:55,,,,Cheers Ill have a butchers,mw68yx0,3.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfkeqf,smitty1ky,,1,2025-06-07 03:17:20,,,,I dont see any evidence to believe that is true Besides this is actually cheaper as a kit than the Aimtrak is on its own,mw68yx0,3.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfswtv,narwhal_breeder,,1,2025-06-07 04:20:04,,,,Please just compare the injection molds of the AimTrak,mwfkeqf,4.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfszra,smitty1ky,,1,2025-06-07 04:20:42,,,,Theyre very obviously different,mwfswtv,5.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfu5gk,narwhal_breeder,,0,2025-06-07 04:29:42,,,,Are you blind Look at the cut above the trigger The only thing that has changed is the cutout above the WMl button but thats present on older molds It wouldnt surprise me if this is a oneoff mould but this was 100 based on the uktimarc and mfgd by them,mwfszra,6.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfuwin,smitty1ky,,1,2025-06-07 04:35:36,,,,I see similarities but they use completely different tracking methods and all the screw holes are in different places as well as the Gaime controller having more buttons AND being cheaper It does not check out in any way that this is a simple rebadge job,mwfu5gk,7.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwfwbw2,narwhal_breeder,,0,2025-06-07 04:47:04,,,,Obviously not just a rebadge job because the gun doesnt terminate with USB AI use is comical though if big buck and ultimarc have had accurate tracking on LCDOLED for literally 20 years without a NN why would you need AI to do it Youre right not a simple rebadge but this was definitely designed by the same company that made the aimtrak,mwfuwin,8.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw5gfv4,Middcore,,2,2025-06-05 15:35:02,,,,I kind of doubt that MAME would be compatible with whatever black magic theyre using to tell the game where the gun is pointing,mw5dhxy,2.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw5osyu,NuPNua,,10,2025-06-05 16:14:50,,,,Presumably youd reverse engineer and write a translation layer,mw5gfv4,3.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw66h2b,Middcore,,2,2025-06-05 17:37:29,,,,Yeah but that seems like it would be a nontrivial amount of work Granted I know nothing about coding but I always try to err on the side of assuming something is more difficult because I dont want to be one of those people who are like Just do massive programming thing how hard can it be lol,mw5osyu,4.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw68ogf,NuPNua,,2,2025-06-05 17:47:32,,,,Im sure its not simple but Ive also seen how dedicated game and system modders can be at getting stuff done lol,mw66h2b,5.0,1l3zs74
comment,mw6975v,narwhal_breeder,,1,2025-06-05 17:49:54,,,,They are likely using MAME to emulate Time Crysis This gun is just a rebranded Ultimarc AimTrak gun which is compatible with MAME,mw5gfv4,3.0,1l3zs74

comment,mwak6c7,blueB0wser,,1,2025-06-06 10:33:19,,,,115 for the base model 170 for the one with recoil Which is fair but very expensive for a niche controller,mw78buz,2.0,1l3zs74

comment,mw78y06,DJKGinHD,,8,2025-06-05 20:38:38,,,,I love Time Crisis the most as a great mix of actionmechanicsgameplaystory but I think the Area 51 game was the most fun overall It was pure action and gameplay with neon alien blood,mw6o8g6,2.0,1l3zs74

comment,mwao67x,BrewKazma,,1,2025-06-06 11:05:27,,,,Yeah I worked at an arcade when this game was out This and house of the dead seemed to have moments where you would take guaranteed hits to make you have to pay more to beat it,mw9vzcf,2.0,1l3zs74

comment,mwa5mmm,TylerBourbon,,2,2025-06-06 08:10:50,,,,Lethal Enforces was fantastic I jumped back and forth between it and Terminator 2 Ghost Squad ends up being my favorite since the arcade machines control was a massive machine gun you held Thankfully there was port released on the Wii,mw9pztk,1.0,1l3zs74
comment,mwbyrs8,qa3rfqwef,,4,2025-06-06 15:30:24,,,,One thing Im wondering is what the feedback while shooting will be In the arcades I recall them having a satisfying mechanical recoil that made it feel a lot more impactful It will come with a foot button for cover So that makes me optimistic about them being faithful to the arcade experience,,0.0,1l3zs74

comment,mwa7dv6,Lettuphant,,1,2025-06-06 08:28:53,,,,VR is great for this There are apps that simulate an entire 90s bedroom and will emulate any console you connect to any virtual TV including gun support The only downside is it doesnt support arcade versions so youre stuck with the PS1 TC1 for example,,0.0,1l3zs74

comment,mwpdxd9,fullload93,,1,2025-06-08 19:14:27,,,,Amazing and so stupid at the same time 90 for only Time Crisis or 120 for all 3 games and thats it Its a standalone device and cant be used for anything else Even if they wanted to make it a standalone device at least offer an option where it can be updated via a PC for additional software downloads or something like that Hard pass on that fact that it will only have those 3 games and nothing else What a major fail,,0.0,1l3zs74
