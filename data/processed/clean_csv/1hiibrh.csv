comment,m2zjcmf,lawndartdesign,,25,2024-12-20 14:38:04,,,,Its probably hard to justify one over a new m4 Mac mini these days Back in 2014 they were absolutely great and as a freelancer it was my FIRST big purchase as far as tools go,m2zh6uv,2.0,1hiibrh

comment,m33gvj4,x925,,5,2024-12-21 05:22:35,,,,A new mac m4 mini isnt outrageously more expensive for the base model compared to a used 2013 mac pro it is over twice the price but a 600 new pc that is much faster than a 250 used desktop isnt terrible A 2018 mac mini for 300 with an i7 and thunderbolt might be a better option for some,m3216vh,4.0,1hiibrh

comment,m39n3dl,Hoserposerbro,,4,2024-12-22 10:44:12,,,,Not condescending M4 Mac mini is the first time Ive considered upgrading only because premiere no longer supports my system and theyre not that big of an investment since the lower tier can work for what I do But Im an avid editor and never had a slow down or a problem since I work low rez Even gfx work is still okay THE MAIN REASON that an upgrade is unnecessary at moment is that since Covid everything is remote and Im simply logging into a system miles away thats actually doing all the labor Im basically just streaming video,m384xwd,3.0,1hiibrh

comment,m34quk3,Savings_Opening_8581,,11,2024-12-21 13:12:40,,,,I would argue they arent difficult to repairreplace if you know how to handle delicate computer parts properly and understand the build process A lot of the time its like just putting an expensive puzzle together in a specific order everything has its place I could strip a MacBook Pro down to just parts and back together again in less than a half an hour after some practice The replacement parts are the difficult part to acquire if youre not Apple themselves or an authorized repair dealer The rest youre bang on On your functionally mid point actually I would like to add that I somewhat disagree Hardware wise yes they could be leaps and bounds better but the software and the accessibility features alone that allow nearly any human on the planet to use their computers regardless of physical or mental disabilities is quite astounding and its surprising they dont charge more for the software alone,m33mkaf,4.0,1hiibrh
comment,m3a65xu,rathlord,,3,2024-12-22 13:54:15,,,,Functionally mid Ah yes the batlecry of the Redditor riding the peak of the dunning Kruger wave These like most Mac products were excellent for the people they were meant for Peoples opinions about Apple probably chart almost 11 along the Dunning Kruger chart You learn a bit about computers and think youre an expert you hate Apple for a bunch of really shallow reasons that sound good to average people And then the more expertise or actual professional experience you have the more likely you understand the point and that they do have their place,m33mkaf,4.0,1hiibrh
comment,m37mqxv,bigsquirrel,,3,2024-12-21 23:54:29,,,,In a thread full of professionals talking about how essential this computer was you make a comment like that Functionally mid Sure These computers arent made for you You dont get them that doesnt make millions of people and thousands of companies idiots If you play video games on your computer these are not for you Believe it or not most of the world uses their computers for work the things you care about mean very little to them,m33mkaf,4.0,1hiibrh
comment,m382tsv,Shadowhawk109,,-2,2024-12-22 01:44:32,,,,Youre right most of the world uses their computers for work Which is why most of the world uses Windows Especially programmers and developers who gasp make programs for the rest of the world And I say that as a professional programmer who has tried using XCode of that era Visual studio spanks that ass I didnt start the being a dick contest with the whole believe it or not thing but BELIEVE IT OR NOT the world aint just about video games and your trashcan is proof Apple wasnt the beallendall the cult thought it was then,m37mqxv,5.0,1hiibrh

comment,m3bpfkn,bigsquirrel,,0,2024-12-22 19:22:39,,,,Macs are extremely common Aside from being Unix even if youre not doing server side stuff if youre developing for anything iOS you practically need one It starts as maybe an extra computer you only use for development then slowly turns into your main machine Not to make to many assumptions but are you basically developing for windows machines,m3az97y,8.0,1hiibrh
comment,m3bcpme,positronik,,2,2024-12-22 18:14:36,,,,Bro programmers use macs too In fact everywhere Ive worked the other devs have been jealous of the devs who have a macbook instead of a Dell VS Code works on macbook too I do think Apple is overpriced but their products work well The majority of programmers dont use them but artists content creators and music producerscomposers prefer mac because of the software Your vitriol is wild especially with how ass Windows 11 is,m382tsv,6.0,1hiibrh
comment,m39a064,Mayor__Defacto,,3,2024-12-22 08:04:50,,,,Most people that use Windows for work do so because thats what their company has issued to them When given a choice most people pick a Macbook,m382tsv,6.0,1hiibrh

comment,m2z2lge,Economy-Bid8729,,18,2024-12-20 12:40:21,,,,They still make the Mac Pro The last GOOD workstation they had was the old tower that migrated from the IBM POWER to Intel chips in the Lian Li rip off style case with solid upgradability Workstations should be big a chonky with plenty of external facing slots of lots of IO and lots of internal slots for lots of juicy expansion cards massive core count CPUs and GOBSSSS of memory and you should be able to swap out and upgrade all of this Dual sockets are nice as well,m2yzig0,2.0,1hiibrh

comment,m2zcseu,Eruannster,,3,2024-12-20 13:54:48,,,,I think it could have worked as an optional Mac Mini Pro or something much like what the Mac Studio is now for certain workflows and that had they retained the big chonker Pro as well They should also have supplied it with parts for longer than five minutes If it was actually upgradeable admittedly with Applespecific parts I think it would have done a lot better,m2yzig0,2.0,1hiibrh

comment,m2zdr0s,-Dixieflatline,,7,2024-12-20 14:01:18,,,,I think this thing rubbed people the wrong way initially because workstation class PCs and MACs before this were all about onboard expansion and ease of part replacement over form factor That resulted in cavernous cases with tons of internal slots for RAM PCIExpress cards and SATA connectorsbays But things changed between the G5 and this MAC Pro Efficiency started to outweigh old school brute force No more dual CPUs You no longer needed a spindle drive RAID array and RAM density improved to a point you didnt require 8 ram slots to hit 1632gigs Also portconnector bandwidth had reached a point where workflow bottleneck was hardly an issue for many people not all but many So having the older full size case might not have been as important moving forward Really depended on the useindustry but many working professionals were fine with this asis I think it was a mistake for Apple to pull back from dictating hardware relevance here and going back to a conventional PC case well as conventional as Apple does one They have a history of telling consumers the correct path and are mostly right about it Ditching floppy discs Flash CDDVDs as a few examples of when they made the right calls even if the general public didnt initially like it Here they developed an innovative quiet cooling solution with the main downside being lack of internal modularity but that might not have even mattered to a lot of working professionals as the machine could have been configured quite powerful out of the box The path ahead might make more sense to just replace the entire PC a few years down the line if it ends up being a company expense anyway instead of just upgrading things piecemeal,,0.0,1hiibrh

comment,m33fwov,None,,2,2024-12-21 05:14:00,,,,What I would recommend is get yourself some good quality thermal paste like artic mx6 and replace all the thermal paste on the cpu and the GPUs also take your time There are loads of videos on YouTube showing how to update the cpu and thermal paste have a watch to see if you feel like you can do it Also list of tools can be seen on the ifixit website for taking the Mac to bits Its a big job and few little connectors etc the macOS and the device saw the new chip right away as it part of the list of ones it can take So I upgraded the cpu cleaned off all the old thermal paste of the GPUs and replaced it with good quality paste The reason being the old paste would have been on from beginning so things move on and better paste comes out I also replaced the battery for vrambios br2032 you can get a cr2032 same size but they dont last as long as the BR2032 which is in the device I also gave it a good clean Its now running cooler Things to watch out for are thermal pads coming off or sticking to heatsink you can put them back on not a problem the bolts that hold the cpu can take the fixing with them not a problem they can go back in see videos on YouTube As for the ssd I used an original ssd 1tb from an MacBook Pro its gives me about 12587mbps write and 13765mbps read the model MZKPV1T000A4 1TB SSUBX I used an original because some people found you couldnt use recover disk etc if you used a none apple one something like that plus the machine see it If you go for a nonapple you need an adapter and maybe a heatsink with the ssd the apple one comes with heatsink on You can up the ram above the apple specs of 64GB to 128GB but that seems to slow the machine ram from 1866 to 1066 some people have notice that difference Also see links below These should help you,m337mbv,2.0,1hiibrh

comment,m7m4h39,None,,1,2025-01-17 11:54:08,,,,The Trashcan is Apples epitome of their obsession of appearance over functionality Its curved design overcomplicated the component placement the motherboard had to be divided in several parts and probably made it more expensive hotter and harder to repairupgrade It worsened every aspect of a computer key areas for professionals in exchange for looking arguably prettier Phil Schiller bragged about how innovative it was but he was wrong Things like Apple ARM CPUs are true innovations whereas the trashcan was just an expensive meme,,0.0,1hiibrh
