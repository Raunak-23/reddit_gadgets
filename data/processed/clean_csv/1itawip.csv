comment,mdqttzp,AnsibleAnswers,,3,2025-02-20 03:51:23,,,,It kind of makes sense to do so The SE 3 is only 3 years old and is basically indestructible under normal conditions with a good case People who choose it are interested in going the distance Im ready to change my battery as expected but Im trying to max my SEs lifespan Thats kind of the phones draw Im not upgrading this generation unless my phone breaks I imagine most SE owners are trying to sit this one out Theyll piss off less people if their modem sucks,mdo3n2t,2.0,1itawip

comment,mdoyhpm,Sock-Enough,,54,2025-02-19 21:50:07,,,,No not at all Qualcomm right now is unmatched for 5G modem quality Intel tried to make their own but failed and Apple bought them out Im not sure where the Exynos modems are but other companies like Mediatek go for the lower end of the market They dont try to compete with Qualcomm,mdoy79q,2.0,1itawip

comment,mdp3rhk,speculatrix,,20,2025-02-19 22:14:15,,,,Theres potential for a large variation in radio performance and power efficiency And theres patents that Qualcomm have that mean if you dont buy their chips or pay their licensing means youll not be able to benefit from their optimisations Apple hate paying licensing fees,mdp073g,4.0,1itawip
comment,mdpbb12,macbrett,,8,2025-02-19 22:50:18,,,,Apple hate paying licensing fees Especially when their licensing fees are based on the entire cost of the phone so that when Apple spends money on adding and improving features that have nothing to do with communication like adding RAM faster processors expensive cameras and screens etc Qualcomm feels entitled to a cut of the profit,mdp3rhk,5.0,1itawip
comment,mdpfdxy,speculatrix,,3,2025-02-19 23:10:43,,,,I was also thinking of the watch patent issue,mdpbb12,6.0,1itawip
comment,mdpzek7,balrob,,1,2025-02-20 00:56:17,,,,Come on name a company or person that likes to pay licensing fees What a silly thing to say The modems in question are covered by patents for sure but since the tech implements a standard the patents are supposed to be licensed under fair and nondiscriminatory terms However if theres no other supplier what constitutes fair terms Monopolies can charge what the market will bear Apple creating their own modems reduces the perdevice cost down to the cost of the silicon,mdp3rhk,5.0,1itawip
comment,mdsv9oq,speculatrix,,1,2025-02-20 13:54:44,,,,For example Apple crippled some of their smart watches to remove health monitoring features rather than pay the licensing costs of the tech whose patents they infringed Caused a bit of a ruckus I agree that RAND licences should be fair but patent holders may try hard not to be reasonable And they may use secret unrevealed tech embedded in their chip sets which are not going to block third parties from following the standard but place them at a disadvantage,mdpzek7,6.0,1itawip
comment,mdp1j3c,QuaternionsRoll,,11,2025-02-19 22:03:57,,,,Yes and no Theyre strictly standardized so there isnt much room to separate yourself from the competition On the other hand 5G modems are wildly complex pieces of hardware even behemoths like Apple would need some serious motivation and money to build their own Thats the interesting part Now obviously profit margin is going to be the biggest motivator when operating at iPhone scale but if I had to guess the security implications of building their own modem also factored into their decision Malicious or compromised modems can both snoop on your traffic and transmit their own with virtually no opportunities for detection Its no secret that Apple doesnt like to rely on third parties to uphold their devices security,mdoy79q,2.0,1itawip
comment,mdr39jy,Esc777,,1,2025-02-20 04:54:15,,,,Yeah Its either let Qualcomm reign or roll their own to compete Frankly Im glad Qualcomm may have the best in the industry but they can throw their weight around easily and thats not a situation anyone wants to be in Competition is good,mdp1j3c,3.0,1itawip

comment,mdqufap,Sylvurphlame,,1,2025-02-20 03:55:07,,,,I was wondering about that myself Its roughly 1 mm shorter and only 01 mm more narrow so the charging coils are probably the same size and location as the other 61 models So if you had MagSafe case from a third party as Apple wouldnt make one for the 16E then you would have MagSafe alignment for chargers but maybe not strong enough for stands or accessories depending on the case itself,mdq3wtu,4.0,1itawip

comment,mdoaqzj,KS_YeoNg,,1,2025-02-19 20:04:44,,,,I put it in quotes because youre rage baiting with unrealistic expectations Its obvious the 16E was never going have anything besides 60hz when the same year base model thats more expensive doesnt have a higher refresh rate Your disappointment is irrelevant to the capabilities of this phone,mdo90kp,5.0,1itawip
comment,mdoecop,cuberhino,,-3,2025-02-19 20:20:47,,,,Maybe you have it in your mind that Im rage baiting Im literally just expressing disappointment They could have made this 120hz Stop defending megacorps,mdoaqzj,6.0,1itawip
comment,mdogiwk,KS_YeoNg,,-1,2025-02-19 20:30:23,,,,Thanks for making it clear that youre a troll Keep pretending that there was any chance this phone could have been 120hz Youre somehow too obtuse to understand what a mid year budget phone release is Go spout your refresh rate complaints in a few months at the iPhone 17 thread instead At least thatll be relevant criticism despite being boring and overstated,mdoecop,7.0,1itawip

comment,mduevf3,snwns26,,1,2025-02-20 18:22:18,,,,Really It seems like a straight up upgrade from the 11 I have Ive been waiting for something cheaper than near 1k for an upgrade and this finally looks solid Trading my 11 would make it 480 with the 120 Apple is giving not counting getting more from outright selling it unlocked Doesnt seem worth it to pay 100 more for a 15 with for 6 hours less battery life and a slower chip unless Im missing something obvious I dont care about camera and audio bells and whistles,mdnim94,2.0,1itawip

comment,mdo7cey,Sylvurphlame,,1,2025-02-19 19:49:36,,,,Youll lose MagSafe and the Ultrawide camera if you were using them but gain a bigger screen assuming youd like one And then of course its newer so a its going to necessarily be more future proof in general Sidegrade Its not terrible on its face and I recommended it to my parents But they were already happy with the XRs theyve been rocking since launch so its basically a refresh for them But for anybody else I dunno No MagSafe so its not full ecosystem and 600 of the 500 Id expected Its also not 58 for the smaller phone folks which I might have given a 1 chance had they done this concept as a 14E instead So unfortunately it just doesnt quite tick all the would recommend boxes for me If you have access to 0 installments through Apple or your carrier and absolute price isnt your primary decision maker Id say nah go for the full 16 The 16E is niche to sidegrade territory,mdncr3d,1.0,1itawip

comment,mdnquu4,saposapot,,6,2025-02-19 18:35:56,,,,Interesting to only include one camera its a major differentiator for sure and its better to cut there than in other parts A major selling point for iPhones is that you are guaranteed to have good photos so it makes it easy for people to understand that better cameras are on more expensive iPhones The bad part is the big price increase Now they dont have a cheap iPhone just a cheaper one I think this price will hurt Apple as more used iPhones will be sold to fill that old price point and used iPhones dont give any profit to Apple,,0.0,1itawip
