comment,mscp5az,WelpSigh,,281,2025-05-14 22:38:39,,,,It would be trivial to bypass this Idiotic,,0.0,1km9jun
comment,mscxgr7,redclawx,,118,2025-05-14 23:25:48,,,,Firewall if on Ethernet Metal roof faraday cage if the card has a cellular chip Wallet to not pay for card from OEM that puts this shit into their cards Edit And if this is something that is embedded in the cards then wouldnt anybody other governments hackers terrorist also be able to track these cards On government owned computers And target them,mscp5az,1.0,1km9jun
comment,msetfj0,zekromNLR,,24,2025-05-15 07:20:56,,,,Presumably theyd try to require manufacturers to brick the card if the tracking chip cant phone home,mscxgr7,2.0,1km9jun
comment,mshu132,veerKg_CSS_Geologist,,12,2025-05-15 18:44:53,,,,How do they brick the card if it cant phone home,msetfj0,3.0,1km9jun
comment,msi9mht,zekromNLR,,12,2025-05-15 20:02:02,,,,Simplest way I could think of doing it is try to phone home when the card is powered on if that attempt fails the card doesnt turn on Assuming the tracking module is a fully selfcontained unit that only relies on the computer the card is installed in for power A somewhat more sophisticated way would store some vital firmware components for the card in the tracking chip so you cannot just remove or bypass the tracking chip it has to be functioning for the card to work,mshu132,4.0,1km9jun

comment,msko6kh,CosmicCreeperz,,3,2025-05-16 04:38:28,,,,Yeah thats likely how it would work which is horrible as you literally couldnt use it without an internet connection Its like fucking Divx all over again It would just be the usual war of VPN workarounds etc just like with geo filtered streaming services,msi9mht,5.0,1km9jun
comment,mseyzpa,ChaZcaTriX,,31,2025-05-15 08:19:28,,,,When USA banned the export of cards performing similarly to Nvidia A100 to China Nvidia made a special version with 1 slower performance,mscxgr7,2.0,1km9jun
comment,msfrqxn,101_210,,15,2025-05-15 12:26:59,,,,and it costed them a lot to develop then the government ALSO banned the new card Nvidia were pissed about that,mseyzpa,3.0,1km9jun
comment,msh2u4l,pinktieoptional,,9,2025-05-15 16:33:30,,,,Coming from the semiconductors industry its actually pretty trivial to factory downclock a card You just create a new product code and force units that would have met the higher product code into the lower product code Then they get their fuse values updated and wham bam you have a slightly worse card Granted I couldnt tell you how much bureaucratic red tape the C suite had to go through to think this was a remotely good idea but the actual technical implementation would have easily been one twoweek sprint With due diligence of rolling out the change maybe a couple of months but again thats mainly just kind of watching the change propagate to make sure your companys engineers arent dumb when they tweak one parameter At least not any dumber than leadership,msfrqxn,4.0,1km9jun
comment,msjpwdt,CoughRock,,1,2025-05-16 00:50:06,,,,so its just a software downgrade,msh2u4l,5.0,1km9jun
comment,mslak88,pinktieoptional,,3,2025-05-16 08:10:50,,,,What the other commenter said but in a more granular way we can also update the fuses that tell the part at a particular frequency what voltage to require If we wanted to run slower all we do is fool the part into thinking it would need a higher voltage to run then it actually would and you will end up with a new performance ceiling set by your power and temperature limit Thats how one red company does it Unrelated that strategy actually comes with the fun implication that if you can cool that part enough itll just keep climbing up that frequency curve which is why it is so easy and so much fun to do crazy stuff like liquid nitrogen cool parts made by that red company You can have the fuses do anything you want though You could literally tell it that no matter how good the cooling and power delivery is Thou Shalt Not run faster than X gigahertz,msjpwdt,6.0,1km9jun
comment,mskochm,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-05-16 04:39:47,,,,No they can literally burn one time programmable fuses to disable parts of the GPU chip,msjpwdt,6.0,1km9jun

comment,msjg3oh,dark_sylinc,,1,2025-05-15 23:48:59,,,,What baffles me is that many components are done in China some in neighbouring countries They know a lot more than most about how these cards work making it easy to bypass Its like asking a thief to install my high security door I may design the locks the hinges everything I may use encryption and tell him to just blindly build what I tell him But in the end the thief knows more about my door and the rest of my house because hes the one who built and installed it,,0.0,1km9jun

comment,mseqmql,im_thatoneguy,,-1,2025-05-15 06:52:57,,,,This wouldnt be simple but it also wouldnt be impossible You would have to have something like an NTP server on site with a gps antenna These are already sold to data centers to use gnss for time keepingNTP You run an antenna to the roof You would also need a Secure Enclave on the GPU Again difficult but not impossible Apple does it all the time Then you would need an NTP server with encryption of some kind to confirm its a legitimate Nvidia positioning server and all of the GPUs would sync up like once a week Relaying would be impossible based on speed of light and encryption It would inevitably be cracked but by then the chips would be obsolete Is it a good idea But it is technically possible,,0.0,1km9jun
