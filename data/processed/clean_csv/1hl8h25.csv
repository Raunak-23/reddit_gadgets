comment,m3m6f7u,donrb,,2,2024-12-24 16:54:24,,,,Yea there are definitely 150lb flats out there but youre looking at the largest screens around I think even 85 TVs are still manageable with two folks at around 75 lbs Nothing you want to drop or try to hang solo but easy peasy compared to the tube monsters of yesteryear,m3m3pub,2.0,1hl8h25
