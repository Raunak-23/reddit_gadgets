comment,n4zdmdn,FattyWantCake,,1,2025-07-24 22:11:08,,,,The actual point is displaying content on the main screen at a more optimal aspect ratio in case anyone was curious and not just hating Try watching a video on a 2panel foldable then compare it to a regular phone the letter boxing is like 40 of the screen which defeats the point of a foldable for that type of content Your options are more panels unweildly tall or wide panels that would make it unusable 1 handed or dont make a foldable since the current ones really arent quite allpurpose due to the aspect ratio,n46s5gh,2.0,1m4hmez
comment,n4zvqlj,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-07-24 23:50:25,,,,The number of folds and AR are pretty orthogonal The square unfolds AR is only because someone decided that the folded phone needed to be a certain aspect ratio Fold wars dictate that all phones will be postage stamps that unfold into road maps eventually,n4zdmdn,3.0,1m4hmez
comment,n525rhh,FattyWantCake,,1,2025-07-25 10:03:17,,,,Yeah thats what Im referring to the need to balance open and closed aspect ratios and the best way to make both ARs as ideal as possible is to add another panel so the ratio is similar when closed but now wider when open assuming you can make panels thin enough to make a trifold useable when closed at all,n4zvqlj,4.0,1m4hmez

comment,n49t4bu,beefjerky9,,3,2025-07-21 02:20:31,,,,True however Huaweis version really does have a fatal flaw They use part of the soft plastic foldable screen as the outside screen when folded This makes it far too delicate for realworld use Apparently the Samsung will be using a G fold design so the whole of the foldable screen is safely inside when folded Then they have a separate glass protected screen for the outer screen when folded,n48fcz0,2.0,1m4hmez

comment,n44k06j,internetlad,,16,2025-07-20 06:44:52,,,,Firstly implying the Huawei Mate XT doesnt exist Secondly single fold screens are already niche so this is an iteration of an already niche gimmick Finally I have a folding phone Theyre not all theyre cracked up to be because most apps dont know what the fuck to do with it so unless youre really interested in seeing a YouTube video on a slightly larger screen theyre not good for much,n44jo2a,2.0,1m4hmez
comment,n44ms5z,WhiteF1re,,17,2025-07-20 07:10:07,,,,Honestly a trifold bifold really but that ship has sailed would solve your last point since it would open into a traditional 169 aspect ratio or something close,n44k06j,3.0,1m4hmez

comment,n477bjb,alc4pwned,,4,2025-07-20 17:39:04,,,,Stuff like Wake on motion is less reliable on the Samsung making lock screen shortcuts take longer to access Face unlock is much worse Android Auto is worse than CarPlay in a variety of ways IMO The Folds multitasking bar will randomly disappear Until recently there was no way to adjust volume without the physical volume buttons but luckily that came in a recent update A bunch of smaller ui decisions I find annoying like toggling bluetooth on always pulls up another menu which prompts you to connect to a bluetooth device,n47130n,3.0,1m4hmez

comment,n4673a3,DaoFerret,,10,2025-07-20 14:35:43,,,,You get downvoted but in 15 years weve gone from the smartphone needing to be upgraded every year or two because of huge improvements to the point where most people are happy with 46 year old phones or more because the tech has matured This is exactly the same maturation curve that all tech goes through until there is another disruptive force that bumps things into development again for a little while It happened to desktops in the 1990s laptops in the 2000s and phonestablets in the 2010s It also went back to the microcomputers and mainframes This doesnt mean that the tech doesnt continue to evolve and improve or that something disruptive wont emerge in the future it just means that for now the level of improvement and what people will gain by upgrading has plateaued This is part of why tech companies are looking at different things Samsung is looking at folding tech because a phonetablet may be that disruptive bit Apple are looking at VR tech because they think THAT will be the disruptive tech EVERYONE is looking at AI because a lot of people think THAT will be the disruptive bit Who knows but for now phones are definitely a mostly mature tech,n45qr8v,3.0,1m4hmez
comment,n48sgxi,Goodly,,1,2025-07-20 22:38:33,,,,The next big one will probably be integrated AI that can interact with apps So you can have a conversation with your phone and have it plan your day write texts based on simple prompts lookup places of interest and suggest stuff based on your location mood and interests Im sure Apple is working hard on having Siri truly fill that role and they seem the most likely to achieve that properly,n4673a3,4.0,1m4hmez
comment,n4b7aw2,_nocebo_,,2,2025-07-21 09:13:18,,,,We are in a thread talking about big fold and tripod phone that Samsung is releasing They also have a clamshell design One of the reasons I like folding phones is it is finally a return to innovation instead of the same rectangle slab of glass,n45qr8v,3.0,1m4hmez

comment,n47c7ct,thatguuuy,,7,2025-07-20 18:02:47,,,,The downvotes are coming from those who havent owned a folding phone My Z Fold 3 had the internal screen protector crack and come off within a year and the hinge brushes get jammed in the hinge within 2 I traded it in for a Fold 5 My Z Fold 5 screen protector came off after 1 year and had some debris get in the hinge and worked its way under the internal screen somehow Im counting the days until it goes out Theyre amazing phones but I agree there are things that need to be worked out That saidI might get the trifold anyways Insurance plans take away a lot of the fear,n46fmfk,2.0,1m4hmez
