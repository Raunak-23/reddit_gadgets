comment,myfh0wo,mBertin,,1,2025-06-18 11:20:37,,,,I just wish theyd make a 5900x3d or a 5950x3d Would be great for both gaming and productivity,myavybs,1.0,1ldtksc
comment,myla13s,Bagafeet,,2,2025-06-19 06:52:27,,,,If you make money off productivity and the 5800X3D isnt enough for your needs you should be making enough money to afford an AM5,myfh0wo,2.0,1ldtksc
comment,mybk14w,SpartanLeonidus,,47,2025-06-17 19:41:38,,,,My AM4 build wasis amazing still going strong I built a new Ryzen 9800x3d 4070 12GB PC recently Then I rebuilt Windows on my old AM4 Ryzen 7 1800X 1080 8GB system it still runs great for 1080P gaming Now my buddies have a PC to game with me when they come over,,0.0,1ldtksc
comment,myjzxos,Xijit,,9,2025-06-19 01:21:59,,,,I did similar but I kept my AM4 board and upgraded from a R7 2700 to a R7 5700X3D and swapped out my GTX 1080GT for a RTX 4070 Super But then I was left with a perfectly good CPU and a GPU that can still do 60FPS 1440p in most games So I bought another AM4 board and made a gaming PC for my TV,mybk14w,1.0,1ldtksc
comment,myk28wm,ninjewz,,3,2025-06-19 01:35:59,,,,Ive been tempted to do this as well Have a 3600 and a Vega 56 64 BIOS leftover from an upgrade They dont sell for much so my desire to build a second PC is high while I can still get AM4 boards and DDR4 memory easily,myjzxos,2.0,1ldtksc
comment,myk3a4l,Xijit,,2,2025-06-19 01:42:09,,,,That sounds like it would be a great Linux system,myk28wm,3.0,1ldtksc
comment,mykwvhz,Captainpatch,,4,2025-06-19 04:59:43,,,,I had a friend who was still running my handmedown i74790k from 2014 when it finally decided to go to gamer Valhalla after more than a decade of service and he couldnt afford a system replacement A long time ago when I was dirt poor a friend of mine sold me his previous rig for 50 so that I could keep playing WoW with him Ive been sorta paying that forward every time I get an upgrade since I had a b350 AM4 proxmox node cobbled together from eBay parts that was ready to decommission from my homelab rack I updated the bios and gave it to him with a temporary R7 2700 and I told him that if he got a cheap 5700x3d it would last him for years to come He was able to get it out of his next paycheck and it was basically like its a brand new platform especially when he was eventually able to get a new GPU to balance it out Being a tech packrat is really satisfying when companies make a long lived platform like AM4 Of course you cant trust them to do that every time they only made it to 2 years with the TR4 socket for the first threadripper Long live AM4,mybk14w,1.0,1ldtksc

comment,myk2vu9,MyIncogName,,2,2025-06-19 01:39:48,,,,I feel like they will Theres enough hype around it It would make a great Christmas release The final upgrade to AM4,myeh0qq,2.0,1ldtksc
comment,myla8cc,Bagafeet,,1,2025-06-19 06:54:14,,,,They wont because I think they had technical difficulties getting it to work with anything more than the 5800X3D on the AM4 architecture,myk2vu9,3.0,1ldtksc
comment,mymjh4l,MyIncogName,,2,2025-06-19 13:08:33,,,,I thought the issue was with the 12 core chip 5900x Pretty sure they had a working prototype of the 5950x 3D Its pretty much 5800x 3D gaming performance with slightly worse multithread performance from the standard 5950x,myla8cc,4.0,1ldtksc
comment,mymnfo8,Bagafeet,,1,2025-06-19 13:30:49,,,,Youre probably right I dont remember the specifics but the issue was solved for AM5 CPUs,mymjh4l,5.0,1ldtksc

comment,myc10xg,CryptikTwo,,25,2025-06-17 21:01:33,,,,I would imagine they dont have that volume or they would be doing it its like the 5600X3D that was limited to microcenterthe states,mybl5y9,1.0,1ldtksc

comment,myctqxq,sourceholder,,23,2025-06-17 23:32:02,,,,They dont want to cannibalize more profitable newergen CPUs Latin America is also a pricesensitive region AMD offering an upgrade path without replacing expensive mobo and RAM brings a good market fit,mybl5y9,1.0,1ldtksc

comment,myefv7k,CrunchingTackle3000,,2,2025-06-18 05:39:43,,,,This chip would be fantastic for a second cheap gaming PC if paired with an AliExpress Am4 plus rx 580 or 5700xt on the cheap Do it AMD,,0.0,1ldtksc

comment,myimwxk,Homewra,,7,2025-06-18 20:53:29,,,,AM6 isnt expected to release before late 2027 hell it could get delayed even Giving a cheap x3d cpu for am4 systems that already are on 2600 3600 systems is a good thing,myhxmem,1.0,1ldtksc
comment,myiouz9,samtherat6,,3,2025-06-18 21:02:51,,,,So a couple more CPUs and AMD can have new CPUs for 3 generations of chipsets at once thats wild,myimwxk,2.0,1ldtksc
