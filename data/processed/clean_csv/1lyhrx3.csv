comment,n2xf0gl,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-07-13 17:11:23,,,,I had a Commodore 128 with the builtin disk drive back in the day though because it was so expensive my folks only sprung for the greenscreen monitor P Also given that I had to type a command every time it booted up just to revert it to C64 mode it was actually less convenient yet more expensive Im not sure if the 128 provided me with any benefit over the C64 whatsoever but I truly loved gaming on it back in the day even if I would often die to something I couldnt discern cos of the greenscreen,n2u1d98,1.0,1lyhrx3
comment,n2xwa4l,critical2210,,3,2025-07-13 18:35:24,,,,128 never had any benefit compared to the 64 if you ran any original 64 applications I will say the keyboard feels moderately less shitty though I doubt anyone knew any better back then If you had business applications that genuinely used the 128 which were few and far between it was a worthy successor,n2xf0gl,2.0,1lyhrx3
comment,n2y03z8,NoFeetSmell,,1,2025-07-13 18:54:29,,,,Yeah it was very much my first lesson that upgrades arent actually upgrades if the added functions are of no benefit for your particular usecase Id have definitely been better off with a C64 and a colour monitor but iirc they were sold out of the C64s and only had the 128 in stock though that could have been a wily salesmans trick I suppose The greenscreen monitor was definitely a letdown and I was waaaay too young to even be aware of useful business applications let alone be enthused about the extra power I could leverage for them I exclusively used it for the C64 games my older cousins had copied to disk for me,n2xwa4l,3.0,1lyhrx3

comment,n2w9lzd,Dampmaskin,,8,2025-07-13 13:37:52,,,,Dominating the emerging quantum computing market or whatever wouldnt be a realistic goal anyway I guess they could aim at becoming just another PC peripherals manufacturer among thousands of others But I think theyre right in being careful with introducing new tech because that can easily disrupt any nostalgic vibes And its hard to get away from the fact that nostalgia is the brands biggest strength at this point in time The cost savings versions have already been done eg the C64 Mini plus you can build your own custom one with a Raspberry Pi The market for that is probably saturated as it is Most of the potential customers have more money than ever before anyway In my opinion it makes sense to focus on style quality of life and tickling that nostalgia neuron as best as they can Anything else others can do better and I think theyll be wise to recognize that,n2vp085,2.0,1lyhrx3

comment,n42v2l1,Adventurous_Meal1979,,2,2025-07-19 23:34:21,,,,Ive been enjoying following the retro computing scene over the last 10 years or so I remember those days when people couldnt give old computers away and you could pick up an Amiga and tons of gear for like 30 But I kind of get the feeling that this current retro wave is on the wane and wonder whether this machine is a bit too late to the party The youngest youd have to be to have used a C64 in its heyday is about 45 and while Im sure there are younger fans my nephew is 19 and loves old computers its going to be a vanishingly small percentage of the potential market Also its joining a crowded market with the mini emulation devices at the bottom end to the FPGA at the top I have a Spectrum Next great machine but I hardly use it my MiSTer does it all Good luck to the backers of this project but I think it missed the retro boat,,0.0,1lyhrx3

comment,n2xboxn,MrFartyBottom,,2,2025-07-13 16:55:09,,,,Just get a MiSTer FPGA Not only do you get a very accurate C64 core that is close to 100 compatible you also get an accelerated Amiga that supports RTG graphics nearly every computer and console from the beginning of computing history upto the mid 90s and a ton of arcade cores Put it inside a modern C64 or Amiga replacement case and you can relive every nostalgic stage of your computing journey from a Tandy TRS80 up to a 486 PC,,0.0,1lyhrx3

comment,n2y03i5,omega884,,5,2025-07-13 18:54:24,,,,According to the listing it ships with 50 full games including licensed classics But beyond that is it really all that expensive relative to what it is Lets say you were going to put this together yourself A new C64 bread bin style case will set you back 150 US Assume youre up for using software emulation instead of an FPGA so you pick up a raspberry pi a 64GB sd card and the power adapter and cables Based on Cana Kits pricing lets call it 100 Now you also need a 75 mechanical keyboard from somewhere Lets assume youre going to hack it up and so dont care much for build quality and call it 50 Just in that youre at the 300 price point but rather than a complete system you have a collection of parts that you still need to hack apart and reassemble into a completed product and said completed product still wouldnt be compatible with original cartridges disk drives or joysticks if you had any you wanted to use So lets say you instead just want to go the buy an original route A tested C64 with disk drive on ebay can be had for about 175 and another 10 for the composite to HDMI adapter from Amazon The C64 power supplies are notorious for going bad and theres a thriving industry of after market ones so 50 if you floppy drive has an internal supply and doesnt need one or 100 if you need one for that too So 235 285 for the OG experience Of course now you have the opposite problem of the emulated one you have compatibility with all the old hardware but no ability to use modern creature comforts like USB SD cards or modern networking Hardware is expensive it always has been 300 isnt impulse purchase money but its also hardly a crazy amount of money to spend on even low end computer hardware these days,n2uwrb0,1.0,1lyhrx3
