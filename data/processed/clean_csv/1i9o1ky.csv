comment,m93n7ef,Suedie,,69,2025-01-25 15:20:05,,,,Its funny Fittingly Xbox is in some ways based of the Sega consoles Microsoft collaborated with Sega on the Dreamcast notice it has a compatible with windows CE thing on the front You can see the original Xbox controller looking very similar to the Dreamcast controller too Sega would develop arcade machines and turn those arcades into home consoles For example the Sega Naomi arcade is very similar to the Dreamcast One of the followups to the Naomi was the Sega chihiro which is based off the Xbox they also had another one the Sega triforce which is based in gamecube So yeah Microsoft and Sega had a connection and the xbox is basically the spiritual successor to the Sega consoles Took over their businesses and ended up going down the same route lol,m93fekn,2.0,1i9o1ky
comment,m941cfa,1980-whore,,31,2025-01-25 16:30:17,,,,Honestly sega was one of those companies that put out amazing products so far ahead of time they just werent trusted I mean the sega saturn using discs in the early 90s was wild then playsation came along and everyone flocked to it So then sega dropped the dream cast with just stupid graphics for the time and features we still havent seen again since like save cards that were mini hand held consoles you could play the level you saved on The thing was wild and i drooled over every inch of the display model I actually think thats why i quit playing video games is because i was never fortunate enough to get one and then sega went to the background for a long while Edit man please guys i had no idea of all the online stuff or extras i never had one and now im stupid jealous of all you luck sob punks lol One day i will not be poor and i will live out the dreams of 10 yo me,m93n7ef,3.0,1i9o1ky
comment,m948y71,Suedie,,17,2025-01-25 17:06:17,,,,Sega consoles are definitely really cool Even before the Saturn Sega had the Sega CD already back in 1991 And the gamegear in 1991 could play a bunch of master system games through ports and from what I can read with an adapter it could run master system cartridges directly They basically had home console games on the go already back then The save card thing is a really cool idea Nintendo did something similar with Pokemon HGSS on the DS you had a little step counter with a screen that you could transfer your pokemon too and walk around with it irl Worked a bit like a tamagotchi from what Ive seen But thats like 10 years after the dreamcast did it Dreamcast is still a pretty cool system today because it doesnt have much copy protection which means you can make your own games and run it on the Dreamcast directly Some people still develop small indie games for it Ive been wanting one for a while theyre not unaffordable but still a bit too expensive imo for a retro console,m941cfa,4.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m9bd8d9,Dick_Lazer,,1,2025-01-26 19:20:07,,,,Yeah but I seem to recall the little mini game you could play on the save card was really lame It was basically just enough that they could advertise the feature but something youd probably try once never again The better feature was actually that the save card slid into your controller could display some graphics so you could use it to choose plays in football games without your opponent seeing etc,m970by2,5.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m98sxah,DangerousCyclone,,-1,2025-01-26 10:02:20,,,,If Microsoft is porting Xbox games to the Switch that can only really mean that the Xbox family of consoles is in its death throes Same exact thing happened with Sega they stopped making consoles then ported games to their former competitors Not entirely surprising as its not as though its been a golden age for Xbox lately theyve fumbled their core franchises,m947fr0,4.0,1i9o1ky
comment,m9i5tc1,CurrentOfficial,,2,2025-01-27 19:25:59,,,,Sega stopped making consoles and left to only make games Xbox has one more console coming where they are integrating pc handheld sub service cloud Xbox OS to third party manufacturers and PC almost the biggest game publisher and they surpassed the Windows division in Microsoft and making money hand over fist They obviously didnt sell well in the traditional way but they will stick around in other ways and arent leaving like Sega,m98sxah,5.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m98cdyz,TheTjalian,,2,2025-01-26 07:15:56,,,,Ultimately it does concern me that if Microsoft drop out of the console race where does that leave the state of the console business long term Think about it this entire time weve had no more than 3 main competitors in the console space and eventually one of them drops out We had Nintendo vs Sega vs Atari Atari eventually drops out Then we had Nintendo vs Sony vs Sega Sega eventually drops out Then we had Nintendo vs Sony vs Microsoft now it looks like Microsoft is dropping out The only reason why Nintendo didnt drop out completely is because of their legendary IPs and their ability to pivot to the Wii and then the Switch The difference now is that it is significantly more expensive to enter the console business meaning it would be highly unlikely we see a third competitor in the console space ever again,m93n7ef,3.0,1i9o1ky
comment,maj97we,Suedie,,1,2025-02-02 10:39:16,,,,Im late to reply but I guess a possibility is that Microsoft would sell of the Xbox hardware division but I dont know who would be willing to buy it especially for the cost and considering how hard it is to compete Just speculating but maybe Nvidia since they have been dipping their toes in the market with the shield geforce now and the chips for the Switch Another one might be Valve as a complement to their current hardware projects but Valve seems more focused on creating an open platform with steam OS Asus maybe since they have been focusing on gaming devices with their ROG phone and handheld The issue is that none of these companies really make their own games so its kinda weird to enter the console business if you cant make any unique games to go along with it Valve kinda could but its not really their style Something really interesting would be if a Chinese company bought it up like Tencent but I dont think the US would allow it,m98cdyz,4.0,1i9o1ky
comment,mb6gel8,fleemfleemfleemfleem,,1,2025-02-05 21:28:29,,,,Nvidia and valve come to mind However in the past console hardware has basically be the loss leader for the sale of proprietary games With stuff like the steamdeck making PC games more consolelike it is hard for me to imagine buying another console and library of games that I get locked out of when I upgrade in a few years,m98cdyz,4.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m96l2bi,pingpong_playa,,5,2025-01-26 00:14:21,,,,Performance for one We dont know the specs of the Switch 2 but we should not expect it to run modern games anywhere near as well as a Steam Deck or whatever MS offers if they enter the portable market Also Game Pass on a handheld would be the other differentiator from the Switch 2 I dont have an opinion on whether they should make a portable but i dont see the Switch 2 as a reason not to,m95fmnl,6.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m99q7s4,idioxical,,1,2025-01-26 14:32:14,,,,The way that PlayStation locked down Madden with EA for many years or the way that GTA and red dead were exclusively on PlayStation to begin with if Microsoft made a deal with EA to have exclusive rights to FIFA That would sell a Microsoft made handheld And while everyones talking about what the Dreamcast brought to the table and what it did to change consoles as a whole in more ways than have been discussed so far and also just so many ways that PlayStation and Microsoft should both be eternally thankful for the trail that Sega Blazed The online store Not just being able to play online but actually having a store online that you could buy items for in game play One of the biggest titles on Dreamcast and one of the most forgotten games that probably Rockstar took a lot of notes from was Shenmue That was an amazing game if you look back at it That game took place in real time If I remember correctly time truly went by the same as it does in reality Its been a hell of a long time since Ive played that game but that was game changer for sure No pun intended at all That was the first game I ever played that had Free World range away from the main story along with having mini games in side of the game You probably wouldnt be able to play pool or poker or pin the tail on the fucking donkey in GTARDR or similar games if it werent for this game I think it was four discs Im not sure In that era of my life was kind of a blur and I had a Dreamcast and a 64 and Ill let a friend that his 5yearold play it so we can get all go outside and get drunk and whatnot and big surprise all of my Dreamcast games were scratched up and my Nintendo 64 was not even capable of playing games anymore somehow And yeah I felt some type of way about it But I couldnt be mad because what did I expect from a 5 year old I was too busy getting drunk with his dad and the rest of our friends But losing Shenmue and losing my Dreamcast is up there with lightning striking the antenna of my housewhile playing ChronoTrigger on SNES It fried the game and the system I was on my third time playing through the game to see what ending I could come up with I know they came out with Chrono cross on Playstation but it didnt compare Ultimately I think final fantasy is pretty much what came of Chrono trigger And I wish that I had gone out and bought another copy immediately Over the years I would go into GameStop and ask if they had a copy and most of them just looked at me like I was crazy for asking for this fabled game I actually saw one on eBay still in the hard plastic box at Walmart keeps them in unopened and I think someone was wanting 10000 for it For that price it better have had the walkthrough guide as well Haha,m969gwu,8.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m94kzet,Mama_Skip,,7,2025-01-25 18:04:06,,,,No whats really smart is that by doing this theyre undermining Steam Microsoft knows it lost the console wars but it also knows the future of gaming is in portable consoles and PCs and that traditional consoles are trending down by rate of new purchasers Younger gens just go PC Because MS owns the OS that PC gaming platforms run on theyre entrenched in the future of the gaming field regardless as VR will need bulkier machines to run In a way they won the console wars by being the ultimate console But they want to own the PC gaming marketplace where the moneys really at which Steam has cornered Steam has also cornered the serious gaming portable console with the Steam deck So support the competition they undermine the Steam Deck undermining Steam from the future of Consoles while they work together with Activision and friends to undermine Steams impact on the marketplace platform,m93e4ww,1.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m958u3i,Firebug160,,1,2025-01-25 19:59:04,,,,I could hit my switch with a hammer and send in a service request And for the record I did send in a joycon and instead of fixing the stick they just sent me a new one instead You can make whatever assumption and guess you want but calling me a liar is ridiculous when Im telling you exactly what Nintendo told me lmao Again Im not going to read a wiki as proof of anything Every console has dumb faults especially release versions The PS5s big fan gets clogged and overheats the PS4 is loud as hell when it does anything more than sit on the main menu the ps3 was a nightmare for devs to make games for and with little to no documentation None of these are just oops theyre notable technical flaws You can say whatever you want MS is still higher on the Fortune 500 than Sony they didnt fall off by any metric Youre objectively wrong about never being a top hardware seller ignoring that its a game industry not a hardware industry and hardware is sold at a loss anyway You cant use game sales to indicate anything here lmao Theres no correlation here theyre not substitute goods You cant use the console sales wiki page to directly compare numbers either The ps2 tracked sales from 2000 to 2024 the Xbox 360 is 2005 to 2013 when the xb1 launched Just because they didnt tell us the 2015 sales doesnt mean there are 0 sales Im not a fanboy just bc you dont have basic data analysis skills Youre acting like that test they do for kids with the fat cup vs the tall cup and the kid says the tall cup holds more this is 4th grade stuff,m955o8b,8.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m95tsi1,bisforbenis,,1,2025-01-25 21:45:29,,,,Microsoft has already given players a way to play their games without an Xbox by making them playable on PC so using exclusives to sell systems doesnt make sense at this point I think realistically theyve been attempting to deliver a very similar product to Sony for a while and didnt go hard enough at exclusives to make a compelling reason why people should choose them so this sort of route makes sense as a fallback,m93e4ww,1.0,1i9o1ky

comment,m98cv4i,TheTjalian,,1,2025-01-26 07:20:33,,,,Ironically also Minecraft Its also not available on Gamepass either Your worlds are firmly locked to your platform of choice and even if youre playing on Realms and signed into the same Xbox account if you hop on to your own realm on a different platform youre treated as a different player It makes for a rather frustrating experience as Id love to play Minecraft on my handheld but the thought of starting over puts me right off,m96dff1,3.0,1i9o1ky
comment,m95f7ki,aphilipnamedfry,,1,2025-01-25 20:31:34,,,,I think the issue lies with Nintendo not the third party publishers Not just with lacking solid network infrastructure for online gameplay but also because Sony and Nintendo both want to keep gaming to their respective consolessilos I remember Sony saying as much as well as a few publishers saying all they needed was a yes to flip a switch for crossplatform but not sure if that stance has changed in the last few years,m93glcr,1.0,1i9o1ky
