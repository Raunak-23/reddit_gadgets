comment,mj3q8t2,potworzak21,,10,2025-03-22 05:27:13,,,,To be honest 1600 price tag kills whole idea Steam deck is way cheaper only advantage of x1 is egpu support,,0.0,1jgynbf
comment,mj5f7gi,Oops_I_Cracked,,6,2025-03-22 14:31:47,,,,It feels like its trying to be too many things so it wont be 1600 worth of good at any of them No one but Apple has truly cracked the tablet nut and I say that as someone who regularly uses a Surface a Galaxy Tab and an iPad A 25 lbs device with a 10 screen is a failure has a handheld And eGPU support is going to make this thing so expensive that you may as well just build a desktop and buy a steam deck instead Youll end up with better portable and desktop experiences Edit also under 11 is small for a laptop especially a gaming laptop Companies tried 11 ultrabooks and chromebooks for a while There is a reason 13ish inches has become the default small laptop size,mj3q8t2,1.0,1jgynbf
comment,mjhx29z,GrayDaysGoAway,,5,2025-03-24 16:02:52,,,,While I agree that the pricing here is not good at all that is definitely not the only advantage of the X1 Its also far more powerful than the deck even without an egpu it has a much larger screen with an actually decent resolution fuck steam decks 1280x800 bullshit and has a detachable controller with better ergonomics than the deck,mj3q8t2,1.0,1jgynbf
comment,mj42mik,moeka_8962,,-3,2025-03-22 07:36:00,,,,price wise it is expensive But you got keyboardtrackpad higher RAM better CPU and GPU and bigger SSD than steam deck So you got all of those in one package and versatility is a key for this thing,mj3q8t2,1.0,1jgynbf
comment,mj5ohos,potworzak21,,2,2025-03-22 15:22:35,,,,Rog ally also had better gpu cpu etc but the price was not worth small improvement in performance for that cash,mj42mik,2.0,1jgynbf
comment,mjia4un,GrayDaysGoAway,,3,2025-03-24 17:06:59,,,,Youre moving the goal lines You said egpu is the only advantage of the X1 That is completely and utterly false And the Rog Ally X is widely considered the best handheld out there today so a lot of people disagree with you on the value proposition too,mj5ohos,3.0,1jgynbf
comment,mjrgr8i,competition-inspecti,,1,2025-03-26 01:33:56,,,,Mate its still 1600 Rog Ally X is still 1000 Compared to Steam Deck 1TB OLED is 600 its still too expensive to be worth it,mjia4un,4.0,1jgynbf
comment,mjtmsha,GrayDaysGoAway,,2,2025-03-26 12:33:27,,,,Price was not part of this discussion that is moving the goalposts OP said the onexplayer has no advantages over the deck That is completely false,mjrgr8i,5.0,1jgynbf

comment,mm4re6i,StanRex,,1,2025-04-09 00:36:22,,,,First time I read that ROG AllyX was considered the best handheld out there From an overall usability point of view Steam Deck is king,mjia4un,4.0,1jgynbf
comment,mm87m7a,GrayDaysGoAway,,1,2025-04-09 15:36:43,,,,The Steam Decks hardware is really showing its age at this point Its CPUGPU are far weaker than any of its competitors and that 1280 x 800 90hz screen is downright pathetic compared to the others who are all running at least 1080p 120hz Plus it still cant do basic things like run gamepass Even SteamOS isnt the selling point it once was since most of the other handhelds can now run it too And the others can dual boot to give you the choice of either that or Windows depending on what youre trying to do at that moment The Deck was a great starting point for this category of gadget but really the only advantage it has at this point is the track pads Which others like the Zotac Zone have now adopted as well so even thats no longer a big deal at all,mm4re6i,5.0,1jgynbf
