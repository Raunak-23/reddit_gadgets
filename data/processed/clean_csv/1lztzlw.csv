comment,n34i33j,natiahs,,229,2025-07-14 18:50:11,,,,The prices that leaked were in euro Those do not necessarily translate to US prices For example PS5 Pro is 799 euro which is 935 US But PS5 Pro is not 935 in the US it is 700 So the leaked prices could be less in USD the same or more We dont know,,0.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3526ub,Rusher_vii,,84,2025-07-14 20:26:14,,,,And to add european prices generally are inclusive of VATaka sales tax and at a rate of around 20 However even with that a lot of products still tend to have number value parity and my guess is that US pricing will be in the realm of 650 and 850 respectively,n34i33j,1.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3ej8gm,GetFvckedHaha,,7,2025-07-16 06:38:45,,,,OLED steam deck is 54999 in the US There is no way the ROG Ally X will be 85000 the product would be DOA,n3526ub,2.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3eme36,Rusher_vii,,3,2025-07-16 07:07:04,,,,I get that it sounds insane but this is the post covidpost ai world where tech is priced at those levels Having thought about it a bit more I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if the ally x drops at 899usd given 10 drop in usd strength since the tariff moves and thats without looking up any specific tariffs that might affect it And maybe a smaller additional point is the massive increase in brand value bringing microsoft on board thatll give people a lot more confidence in the build quality department as asus will be shit scared to make microsoft look bad edit steamdeck will still remain king in the price to performance department for at least a few more years,n3ej8gm,3.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3jo644,GetFvckedHaha,,1,2025-07-17 00:33:08,,,,Its 79999 on ASUS estore still a bit higher than I expected thought it would be 74999,n3eme36,4.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3ju2nv,Rusher_vii,,1,2025-07-17 01:08:20,,,,They clearly already been selling at that price point in the enthusiast handheld space And just incase you missed it thats the 2024 Ally X with the the Z1 extreme chip but these new ones the 2025 modelsboth xbox variant and asus own variant will have the z2 extreme chip and I believe a larger battery So thats where that 900usd range doesnt sound all that far fetched,n3jo644,5.0,1lztzlw

comment,n353cgd,chostax-,,24,2025-07-14 20:31:34,,,,Its because Europe has VAT generally 20 So remove the sales tax and then convert that should get the price,n34i33j,1.0,1lztzlw
comment,n34bitq,xanas263,,636,2025-07-14 18:19:01,,,,Headline feels pretty misleading considering this is not an xbox console It is a handheld PC made in collaboration with Xbox The pricing is inline with the handheld PC market and the pricing is not set by Xbox but by Asus,,0.0,1lztzlw

comment,n3821tl,joeChump,,6,2025-07-15 07:41:45,,,,Kind of but this has been a marketing campaign for ages because cloud gaming allows multiple devices like Fire TV sticks etc to play Xbox games Youll see the title this is an Xbox associated with a lot of different products now and they are officially allied Some people think that Microsoft might ditch the hardware eventually and just have third parties make it,n34h78h,2.0,1lztzlw

comment,n34ypdw,hyperforms9988,,26,2025-07-14 20:10:10,,,,The marketing is literally THIS IS AN XBOX and this thing literally has Xbox in the name To make matters even more confusing Microsofts been pretty good about releasing games on both Xbox and PC so the lines of separation between Xbox and PC are blurrier than any other moment in Xbox history that I can think of I get what the original poster means in essence but its also Microsofts mess that theyve created Xbox is literally in the name who is going to buy this thing and then come to realize some games that theyve purchased for their Xbox Series or whatever arent going to work on this thing Im not going to research too hard into this because its Microsofts mess and I dont feel like sifting through this spaghetti monster that theyve created but as far as I know if you bought a game on Xbox Series and it supports Play Anywhere youll be good You bought it you can play it What if a game you bought doesnt support Play Anywhere Did you just buy a handheld called an Xbox Ally X and yet it cant play your Xbox game because its not actually an Xbox even though its calling itself an Xbox by being called an Xbox Ally X or is that not a thing and it can play every game that an Xbox Series can play How much X could an Xbox box if an Xbox could box Xes So hilariously enough the marketing ought to stress to people that THIS IS NOT AN XBOX to avoid confusing and disappointing people into thinking this is an Xbox and therefore all of their Xbox games can be played on this thing,n34iruq,2.0,1lztzlw

comment,n34np8y,oodudeoo,,0,2025-07-14 19:17:16,,,,I think the clarification here is that the Xbox Quest 3S cannot play any XBOX games locally on the hardware Xbox games can only be streamed via Gamepass Ultimate whereas you would need to buy games from the meta store to play them locally Of course that is a completely different library of mostly VR games though The Xbox ROG Ally can play some Xbox games locally from the Microsoft store but a lot of games on the Microsoft store dont have Xbox play anywhere support So those games would have to be streamed anyways Now I havent had an Xbox since the 360 but as a consumer when a company tells me this is an Xbox I think most people kind of expect that that means that you will be able to play your Xbox games natively on the hardware Right now we essentially have 3 categories of Xbox 1 The Actual Xbox consoles that play Xbox games and have backwards compatibility 2 Streaming devices such as phones that let you stream your Xbox games via Gamepass Ultimate 3 Windows devices that can do streaming AND play games locally but the collection of Xbox games you can play locally is haphazard Just because you bought a game on your Xbox console its no guarantee that you wont have to buy it again THROUGH MICROSOFT BOTH TIMES to play on your PC In addition to that crosssave is a crapshoot There is still a real lack of clarity and simplicity around what it means to be an XBOX and the This is an Xbox branding really just ignores that I honestly dont have too many issues with categories 1 and 2 coexisting because the library and save progress is shared Going forward though categories 1 and 3 cannot coexist without major changes If this is the direction Microsoft is going in then all future games must be mandated to have crossbuy and crosssave across windows and consoles If this means that all future Xbox consoles will run on a version of Windows so that there only needs to be one version of the game then so be it but this needs to be done in such a way that console owners still get a good experience Backwards compatibility also needs to be thoroughly addressed as there is no way Xbox fans would accept a new console that doesnt allow them to play their back catalogue of OG Xbox Xbox Series games Microsoft has the route forward but there are so many ways they could screw it up and any number of those ways will really damage their brand in the long run so they really need to get their messaging right,n34evtq,4.0,1lztzlw

comment,n3c7ish,stilusmobilus,,1,2025-07-15 21:42:13,,,,Puts a fair bit into perspective doesnt it Thats not even getting into capabilities like mouse control and detachable controllers I suppose we should look on the bright side its exposing the clowns The base model of this is real ordinary by the looks and still speculated to be 200 more No OLED either something Nintendo got flogged for Im very happy with the Switch 2 I think I got excellent value out of it,n3big54,4.0,1lztzlw
comment,n3cfsxf,Ollidor,,2,2025-07-15 22:26:59,,,,I always cringe when people complain about the no oled and the price in the same breath because an oled screen would easily make it 100 more I feel like Nintendo just cant win with certain people I love the switch 2 it feels like an extremely good value to me and it plays the old games much better and Im looking forward to new games Im happy,n3c7ish,5.0,1lztzlw
