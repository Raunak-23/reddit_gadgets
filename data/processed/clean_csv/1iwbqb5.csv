comment,mecn7rh,re_carn,,44,2025-02-23 15:12:23,,,,I read a bit of the article it sounds like a storybook for venture capitalists starting with putting an atomthick tattoo on the skin that will not be instantly erased by shedding skin cells which are much larger than an atom and ending with measuring pressure through bioimpedance Using neural networks to learn a pattern is a sad cherry on the pie,,0.0,1iwbqb5

comment,men5rhw,IadosTherai,,3,2025-02-25 03:36:05,,,,Graphene is theoretically a wonder material that could revolutionize basically every facet of technology but what has been achieved in the labs this far is that its great at a lot of things but not quite as great as whatever is already doing those things or in the cases where it surpasses whats currently on the market its also far more expensive,melu30o,2.0,1iwbqb5
comment,meclkf9,Wisdomlost,,15,2025-02-23 15:03:25,,,,It will be a remarkable and amazing technology Being able to have the information about what is happening in your body real time is unquestionably important to humanity moving forward The problem is some company out there is going to be the one who owns and controls this technology and the terms and conditions of its use As amazing and potentially species changing as this technology will be it will also be open to abuse and corruption Its sad that a technology as obviously beneficial as this would be is already being looked at with suspicion and doubt simply because corporations and humans on the whole suck,,0.0,1iwbqb5
