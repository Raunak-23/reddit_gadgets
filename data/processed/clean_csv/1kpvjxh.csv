comment,mt0z9ry,Snoo-7986,,164,2025-05-18 22:16:47,,,,I was not long in a key shop and they get the pinouts for the key on this pc with what I thought which turned out that it was a dos gui wrapper I commented on it as I have a big mouth and it turned out that it runs a bit of kit never asked what and it needs to run dos 62 The PC was modern but they virtualised the original machine which I thought was funky,mt0wsdl,1.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt10kyh,Tithis,,85,2025-05-18 22:24:25,,,,Back when I worked at a small computer shop we had a customer that ran his landscaping business off of a old DOS program like that I suggested that we look into virtualizing it rather than trying to keep a 25 year old computer running They chose you just keep using paperclips and bubblegum I wonder how thats going a decade later,mt0z9ry,2.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt14z87,CocodaMonkey,,31,2025-05-18 22:50:49,,,,Honestly its likely just fine Theres virtually no advantage to switching to a vitualized environment for DOS if you already have a working DOS computer Just make sure you have backups so you can switch when it fails In theory the virtualized machine is more power efficient but in practice its not because it has so much more over head Not much reason to switch until the old machine dies and setting up a virtual DOS system only takes a few minutes,mt10kyh,3.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt1fhd4,Tithis,,24,2025-05-18 23:54:36,,,,Its been a decade so the details are hazy but I brought it up as a possibility because the senior tech said it had already been in several times for issues Old hardware can work for ages but I think relying on it with no game plan for dealing with a failure is stupid,mt14z87,4.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt1zsph,CocodaMonkey,,-1,2025-05-19 02:01:30,,,,The game plan would be to virtualize it DOS runs just fine in virtualized environments My only concern would be making sure you have proper backups Switching to virtualized isnt really a big deal and can be done quickly,mt1fhd4,5.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt2x2kk,cgaWolf,,3,2025-05-19 06:24:14,,,,This would be my biggest worry as well 25ish years ago i was hired as part of a team to replace a QA system that had been running since the early 80ies and the reason was literally that they couldnt source replacement hardware anymore,mt1fn39,5.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt1gdwa,Znuffie,,10,2025-05-19 00:00:10,,,,In theory the virtualized machine is more power efficient but in practice its not because it has so much more over head Imagine getting Windows updates and automatically getting the vm host rebooted when that controller should be running 247 for production,mt14z87,4.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt7zcre,yokoshima_hitotsu,,1,2025-05-20 01:07:26,,,,Your average help desk tech isnt going to be able to service msdos either though HyperV is a bit more approachable however really still should be using Windows Server for that on production for that exact reason to control updates and consolidate machines Itd actually be way easier to troubleshoot backup restore rebuild if it was on a server with out of band management like idrac or ilo with any hypervisor Kvm is but one example given for cost and simplicity reason It might even be possible to replace many legacy machines this way depending on their connections to the equipment you could just run a longer cable to the server room and use usbpcie passthrough to the virtual machines,mt7w4ns,7.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt2acbz,iMadrid11,,1,2025-05-19 03:10:59,,,,The only issue would be the computer hardware As old computers age It would be more difficult to find replacement hardware for it So you better have stockpiles of the same computer hardware available ready to swap when they fail Or you can use virtualization using new computers to achieve the same functionality The new computer doesnt even need to powerful Since its running old software,mt14z87,4.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt31tbp,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2025-05-19 07:11:43,,,,You can run DOS on a modern computer on bare metal even I think the real problem is IO The computer is probably controlling something and if so its sending the message out over some IO and it isnt going to be USB Best case scenario is its via a serial port Youll need to get an adapter and hope it doesnt introduce any issues But there are other more obscure obsolete ports and youd need to source adaptors for those and since theyre obsolete the adapters will get more scarce over time Worse case scenario youve got some kind of custom controller card Then youve got to source a motherboard with compatible expansion slot And good luck finding a new board with something like an ISA slot,mt2acbz,5.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt3br5u,fullmetaljackass,,2,2025-05-19 08:57:17,,,,Worse case scenario youve got some kind of custom controller card Then youve got to source a motherboard with compatible expansion slot And good luck finding a new board with something like an ISA slot There are companies that are still making new motherboards that support modernish CPUs with ISA slots and legacy IO for the industrial market,mt31tbp,6.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt311mv,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2025-05-19 07:03:46,,,,Yeah unless youre leaving the INTELAMD world all the instructions sets that DOS uses are still there I might be remembering this wrong but I feel like Microsoft didnt implement the kernel issuing HLTs when idle until XP maybe it was 98SE though which was after the underlying DOS environment was removed So I would sort of expected if theyre running an old DOS system its not properly issuing HLTs This means the CPU effectively doesnt get to idle which would drive power usage up significantly on modern hardware Virtualization might help resolve that since you to throttle down the virtual CPU speed,mt14z87,4.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt5jcsw,Netmantis,,1,2025-05-19 17:19:21,,,,There are advantages to virtualization however it not only depends on the application but the hardware involved To give an example an old customer of mine used a stenography machine that outputted on 35 floppy discs The software to output transcripts only ran in DOS nothing else The key dongle demanded serial and output was txt files or parallel port postscript printer Finding a serial parallel and ps2 ports on a modern board is asking a lot Then you have getting the files off that computer and onto something with internet access as most clients are now asking for digital files Virtualization means USB is translated before DOS sees it Making using a modern machine a lot easier and cheaper Pass through folders mounted as drives means you can pass files to the host which is on the internet This application demanded virtualization as the old hardware was going extinct In other cases an upgrade actually reduces features or gets rid of something a shop actually needs So you maintain old software in virtual machines that fit on a USB key and replacement just involves installing the virtualization software on the new machine,mt14z87,4.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mtgdt4a,Oodlemeister,,1,2025-05-21 11:22:14,,,,Similar story here when I was working for a small IT company A local hotel had been running a very old computer for years on Windows XP Their booking software was custom built on DOS Original dev long gone The computer finally shit itself and they had to upgrade I had to go through the very basic code and figure out how to get it running on the new machine Ended up just using DOSBox to run it and built a batch file to launch it with all the settings they needed It was really fun figuring out how it all worked from knowing nothing about it,mt10kyh,3.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt1obn5,silentcrs,,9,2025-05-19 00:49:50,,,,The PC was modern but they virtualised the original machine which I thought was funky Not uncommon Some enterprises even do this and then lock off the VM from most of the network If you do it right the risk is relatively controlled,mt0z9ry,2.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt30d62,Killbot_Wants_Hug,,1,2025-05-19 06:56:55,,,,Theres a surprising number of companies that use systems that look like DOS applications may not actually be DOS though Like I work for a company with about 10k employees and billions in revenue One of our core systems is a COBOL mainframe system The application that accesses it got a face life so it no longer looks like a green screen terminal interface But that was only a couple years ago And our company has a legion of programmers as well its just a system considered so big so complex and so core to the operation they dont want to move it,mt0z9ry,2.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt1ptf2,Vox-Machi-Buddies,,28,2025-05-19 00:59:01,,,,Yep a lot of our need to constantly update OSes comes from three or so things Desire for new features Being connected to the Internet Hardware changes A system thats offline or on a highlycontrolled network and does what you need The OS will probably be able to keep working until hardware breaks and replacements are no longer sold forcing you to upgrade to something the OS doesnt support,mt14w6h,2.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt18k5a,blanczak,,26,2025-05-18 23:12:38,,,,Yeah this will be fun when 2038 rolls around The end of 32bit Unix time occurs on January 19 2038 at 031407 UTC This is when a 32bit signed integer commonly used to store Unix timestamps will overflow meaning it will no longer be able to accurately represent time,mt0wsdl,1.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt19aq6,NorysStorys,,25,2025-05-18 23:17:08,,,,Old industrial machines like CNCs and stuff will keep trucking on they dont require dates for the work they do and you would be amazed how resilient those old boards and chips are if you replace the caps every decade or two,mt18k5a,2.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mt19yw4,blanczak,,13,2025-05-18 23:21:14,,,,For sure My concern lies with PLCs and such used for a lot of industrial controls many of which rely heavily on a correlated time reference I suppose maybe if we correlate against an internal clock and go back to 1985 or something we could buy some time per se,mt19aq6,3.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt3jcex,Edward_TH,,26,2025-05-19 10:15:11,,,,There is a second reason why they look like that to be absolutely sure that they work as intended control elements tends to be both shielded AND radiation hardened Certified and tested hardened hardware takes time to reach the market generally 10 years so once it gets to actual costumers its already outdated compared to similar not hardened hardware For example Perseverance launched in 2020 its CPU is a radiation hardened underpowered version of a PowerPC G3 processor that was launched in 1997 The radiation hardened version launched in 2001 but the first time it flown was 2005 8 years after the launch Ingenuity that landed with it was a revolutionary and very experimental probe in that sense because it didnt use radiation hardened electronic but only shielding and indeed used an off the shelf 2014 SoC and so it was much much more powerful than Perseverance,mt2gil1,2.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt9l6kt,Edward_TH,,2,2025-05-20 09:03:55,,,,Its a bunch of techniques that have the purpose of ensuring that electronics are much much less susceptible to radiation Some involves physically altering the manufacturing process eg using much larger transistors size to increase the gap some involve increasing redundancy eg putting spare cache or cores in the die in case radiation destroys one of the main part and some involve running code that accounts for error and corrects them eg ECC ram,mt8zeoq,4.0,1kpvjxh
comment,mtaqxe0,robs104,,1,2025-05-20 14:09:51,,,,The radiation very basically can either make the part operate differently electrically Like it makes voltages screwy It can also physically damage a CPU Imagine super tiny little bullets going a percentage of the speed of light knocking things around in the silicon Hardened means its was less susceptible to those things Again very basically Im far from a physicist,mt8zeoq,4.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt25up0,bcjgreen,,6,2025-05-19 02:39:53,,,,100k for an ultrasound in private practice That makes no sense I work for one of the largest manufacturers of ultrasounds in the world and 50k would be a very high end system for a private practice unless its cardiology or OB Also remember that the OS we use on these machines is NOT the desktop version For example we currently ship with Windows 10 but its LTSC 21H2 which is supported by Microsoft until 2032 the standard desktop version are already med of life Even if its legacy theres likely no need to upgrade the OS unless you are using a machine well past its designed lifetime,mt0yint,1.0,1kpvjxh

comment,mt1lrxg,P0pu1arBr0ws3r,,0,2025-05-19 00:33:49,,,,But fundamentally why Why havent these systems updated Why arent they running a Unix based OS like BSD based older or about as old as windows or Linux which was fairly new around 98xp There are many known vulnerabilities to old versions of windows and potential for more still up to win7 or even 8 at this point However windows is known for excellent backwards compatibility Why havent companies invested in the resources to update these systems A lot of them are running 247 but how many have actually been running nonstop for 20 years without any power outage or downtime for maintnence At some point the computer hardware is going to die before the programs do so why not update the OS as you replace the hardware The issue I see with these ancient systems is theyre all built around proprietary corporate structures As a result once the company said good enough the contractor who set up thr software moved on leaving no instructions on how to upgrade once things fail Fast forward 20 years now that software is the only thing keeping the system alive with various tricks to fix whatever faults come up ending up costing a lot to maintain thr system when at some point it must be cheaper to just redo it at least in theory But then its working with ancient hardware thats no longer compatible with modern hardware not because its old but because its proprietary closed source One example can be a train scheduling system flipping track switches digitally to control the flows of trains get them to leave on time etc Im pretty sure theres transport tycoon games out that have turned that job into a game which can run automated on a raspberry pi A raspi or if needed a larger dev board can easily be adapted with some circuitry to work with any hardware interface and running linux on an SD card or m2 device it can easily be swapped out for newer models over time It can run an embedded version of linux to ensure constant uptime It just needs someone to integrate the new hardware with the old non replaceable one in this case the signaling wire for the train tracks a step requiring companies to hire contractors for and I dont think theyre willing to do that probably not making enough income to pay contractors to replace the old system thats likely costing them to run Now step back 20 years and assume thr company behind making the signaling system wanted their software to be essentially open source or open documentation Now over time a community of developers who enjoy trains or signaling systems or what not can be fascinated by this old software using it for their own model sets _and iterating off of it_ Over time when the old in production system starts to fail now the company can hire a contractor but at a cheaper rate because the contractor wouldnt have to start from scratch making the updated software,,0.0,1kpvjxh
