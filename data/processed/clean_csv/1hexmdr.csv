post,1hexmdr,chrisdh79,The PlayStation 5 laptop is a 9.5 pound portable gaming monster | Includes a massive 17.3-inch 4K display and a full-sized keyboard,1506,2024-12-15 17:32:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1hexmdr/the_playstation_5_laptop_is_a_95_pound_portable/,174.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,m275wsk,HallowedError,,459,2024-12-15 17:57:42,,,,I think Id have to be looking to tell the difference between 1440 and 4k at that display size,,0.0,1hexmdr
comment,m27k06n,antara33,,117,2024-12-15 19:11:08,,,,Yeah at that size even 1080p to 1440p would be hard to tell without comparing directly The DPI of a 4k 173 inch display its absurd but I guess one can make the argument that having more pixels to draw the upscaled games would make the image look crisp vs a lower res display even if the image is not native 4k,m275wsk,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28t8uy,QuickQuirk,,72,2024-12-15 23:15:36,,,,1080 to 1440 is easy to spot But 1440 to 4k is definitely a lot harder to see especially if its fast paced action game Also depends on your eyesight With my glasses on its a lot easier to spot the 4k quality,m27k06n,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2904so,antara33,,13,2024-12-15 23:55:31,,,,I agree with you but take size into consideration here we are talking about a really small display at 24 yeah there is no way to not notice it but at the size of this thing And during gameplay Really hard to tell I guess,m28t8uy,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2938rm,QuickQuirk,,18,2024-12-16 00:13:35,,,,Dont forget that when its a laptop formfactor youre sitting a lot closer I find it easier to spot 3k or 4k on a laptop screen than I do on a 75 monster at normal room viewing distances Lets put it this way 17 display is just under quarter of the linear size of a 75 TV But my laptop screen is only about 2 feet from my eyes whereas the TV is more than 8 feet away ie more than the 14 difference,m2904so,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2969k2,antara33,,3,2024-12-16 00:31:05,,,,Oh yeah youre close to it thats true but its still a really high DPI on a screen that size unless youre reading during gameplay I guess most people wont be able to tell the difference between 1440p and 2160p Still image clarity should be better even if pixel picking gets impossible,m2938rm,5.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29ntlt,QuickQuirk,,1,2024-12-16 02:19:36,,,,yeah as I said earlier its hard to spot in a fast paced action game,m2969k2,6.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2bx1f7,erictho77,,1,2024-12-16 14:13:11,,,,I get what youre saying but youre comparing diagonal length when the actual size area is more like 19 times not 4 times The same pixel on a TV covers 19 times the area not 4 times the area,m2938rm,5.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2d1kjl,QuickQuirk,,1,2024-12-16 17:58:25,,,,Sure but what youre missing is that the sqaure area our vision is encompassing has also increased by the same function ie A TV twice the linear resolution at twice the linear distance takes up the same percentage of our vision Otherwise by your logic the moon would appear much bigger in the sky D,m2bx1f7,6.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29meq5,DuckDatum,,3,2024-12-16 02:10:29,,,,Smaller display for 4k meaning more DPI sounds awesome to me I feel like it would look like 8k because it would be so much harder to notice any issues with the quality,m2904so,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2ar6xj,davemoedee,,2,2024-12-16 07:34:01,,,,You will be sitting right in front of it If you can tell on a 55 TV across a living room you can definitely tell sitting in front of this screen,m2904so,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2a1o1n,alidan,,1,2024-12-16 03:51:32,,,,depends on the aa at 1080p console 4k usually looks worse than 1080p with good aa,m28t8uy,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2aw0xd,lagerea,,6,2024-12-16 08:27:21,,,,I have a 173 4k it looks amazing over any 1080 or 2k Ive had I know it sounds dumb but you can absolutely tell the difference and 4k density should be on every screen,m27k06n,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2bjuth,antara33,,1,2024-12-16 12:39:02,,,,I can imagine that even if youre not able to tell the difference by pixel picking the added pixel density must produce a fantastic image kinda like phones screens do even if we cant tell exactly WHAT changes we feel the difference somehow,m2aw0xd,3.0,1hexmdr

comment,m2cwate,Lied-,,1,2024-12-16 17:31:00,,,,I will always advocate for 4K though so you can do up scaling from 1080p I have 2x27inch 1440p monitors with my MacBook Pro and it is a nightmare to try to program,m2bt8sg,3.0,1hexmdr

comment,m28ta0p,ShadowfaxSTF,,12,2024-12-15 23:15:47,,,,I have an HP laptop with a 156 4K OLED screen link I know you can only take my word for it but it is insane how good 4K looks over regular HD Its like Im looking through a window After all were not talking about a TV sitting 515 feet away laptops are right there only a couple feet from your face 4K has four times the quality of 1440 and its easily noticeable imho,m275wsk,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29c6fb,rachnar,,18,2024-12-16 01:06:29,,,,Just to correct you 4k is 4 times 1080p not 1440p which is itself 4 720p where it gets it name qhd quad hd A 4k screen has roughly 8 billion pixels and a 1440p one has roughly 4 billion and 1080p roughly 2,m28ta0p,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29vomq,zulu10,,7,2024-12-16 03:10:59,,,,million not billion,m29c6fb,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2aqyp2,rachnar,,1,2024-12-16 07:31:28,,,,Yeah my bad The scale is right though Man imagine if we did have billions of pixels on a display you would never even be able to see them unless it was enormous,m29vomq,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2amjad,sh-run,,2,2024-12-16 06:45:14,,,,I have a 28k laptop 2880x1800 14 laptop The display is gorgeous and much better than my old 1080p 14 laptop I have to set scaling to 150 for it to be useful Not sure Ive seen a 4k laptop in person but Id be curious to see if the difference between 4k and 28k is noticeable,m28ta0p,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2b3y7r,oshinbruce,,1,2024-12-16 09:59:42,,,,I went from a 4k laptop with 14 to a qhd at 32 and boy can I see the difference,m28ta0p,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m27pwef,None,,4,2024-12-15 19:41:58,,,,You mean the massive 17 screen,m275wsk,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2arhdw,Eurynom0s,,1,2024-12-16 07:37:10,,,,I think the argument for a 4K screen here isnt that you need 4K on a 17 screen but that 4K is not an integer multiple of 1440p its 225x as many pixels So thered be weird scaling issues,m275wsk,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2bllc9,GoBBLeS-666,,1,2024-12-16 12:52:36,,,,What else would you be doing Its a screen,m275wsk,1.0,1hexmdr

comment,m27a6wv,Themadreposter,,14,2024-12-15 18:20:27,,,,I think he means actively comparing a 4k screen to a 1440 screen against each other,m276y7h,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m27m32n,Maravilla_23,,102,2024-12-15 19:21:56,,,,The new portable PlayStation 5 mod from China is so chunky that gaming laptops suddenly seem sleek in comparison Made by a group called BBook AI and Weighing in at a whopping 95 pounds for the laptop alone plus an additional pound for the power brick you could practically get a workout just carrying the BBook AI Original Edition around Hard pass for me,,0.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2c05tu,x925,,8,2024-12-16 14:33:03,,,,For someone like me that works away it would make sense to throw it in the suitcase and forget about it till i get to the hotel But thats why i bought a laptop,m27m32n,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2782l4,None,,362,2024-12-15 18:09:15,,,,Neat job but without a battery its kind of missing the point of jamming something into a laptop form factor IMO also as much noise as a hairdryer LOL Fun DIY challenge though and it looks clean in a shot should get then whatever attention they were seeking i guess,,0.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28c3un,CorruptedArcher,,108,2024-12-15 21:40:22,,,,most gaming laptops barely play for more than an hour or two without the battery its barely a negative having to plug it in Also not requiring a monitor of tv is a huge plus,m2782l4,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28mj3t,Lurking_like_Cthulhu,,75,2024-12-15 22:36:58,,,,Even within that 12 hour of game time I rarely see it mentioned that the performance also tanks while on battery power Even the high end laptops will struggle to get acceptable performance unless theyre plugged in all the time,m28c3un,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28qd3z,CorruptedArcher,,29,2024-12-15 22:58:39,,,,and the fans sounding like a hair dryer is also a gaming laptop experience compromises are made for it to be portable Nothing that noise canceling headphones cant deal with,m28mj3t,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28ss7r,VeganCanary,,7,2024-12-15 23:12:56,,,,True and the other thing is the performance being drastically different in winter vs summer I can play most games on mine in the winter but if its a hot summers day I have no chance of playing something like Tarkov or Warzone it gets too hot and caps the performance I guess its not the biggest issue as Im unlikely to want to spend a nice day in summer gaming anyway,m28qd3z,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28thpc,QuickQuirk,,5,2024-12-15 23:17:00,,,,For me summer isnt whether the GPU gets too hot its whether I get too hot Those modern GPUCPUs are full on 600watt heaters and its hard to keep the room cool enough,m28ss7r,5.0,1hexmdr

comment,m2a4df8,chainer3000,,6,2024-12-16 04:10:37,,,,Right but its nice being able to disconnect from power without the entire station shutting down Moving from one outlet to another elsewhere etc,m28mj3t,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29l548,iboughtarock,,4,2024-12-16 02:02:19,,,,I mean I guess but if you have integrated graphics you can still get 810 hours browsing or watching videos on a gaming laptop Assuming the battery is around 90Wh,m28c3un,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29o396,whyyy66,,2,2024-12-16 02:21:14,,,,Well yes but thats not really using the gaming part You pay a very steep cost specifically for the ability to play higher end games and if youre mostly going to be browsing and playing low demand games a macbook is far better 12 hours easily,m29l548,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29p05x,iboughtarock,,3,2024-12-16 02:27:05,,,,Sure but gaming is limited on any laptop because of airplanes You can only have a 99Wh battery on an airplane so it will never get better than it presently is Having the ability to browse and game on the same device is huge Just plug it in and you can play forever,m29o396,4.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29qqrd,whyyy66,,2,2024-12-16 02:38:22,,,,Wonder if theyll ever increase the amount allowed on planes would be nice But also it seems like gaming laptops have shit build quality on average,m29p05x,5.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29rzh2,iboughtarock,,2,2024-12-16 02:46:36,,,,Unlikely unless different battery components are used besides Liion And it really depends on what you buy and who you buy from and what you want For me it has to have a numpad backlit keyboard metal shell high NIT screen 8 hour battery life and good screen quality MSI seems to consistently meet those requirements and for 6001500 I have been in the market recently for a laptop since I am going back to school and bought a 4070 MSI from bestbuy for 1000 last week and it was a beautiful computer but the idiots at bestbuy sold it to me with a 45Wh battery when the MSI website has it speced for 90Wh so I had to return it Also got a 4050 laptop from Walmart for 500 on black friday but the battery can only get 25 hours so I have to return that too,m29qqrd,6.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29tv1f,whyyy66,,2,2024-12-16 02:58:57,,,,Thats been my experience they look and feel good externally but its a shot in the dark how they actually perform Ive heard good things about lenovo just avoid acer For school personally id get a mac unless I absolutely had to have windows and didnt want to mess with wine The M chips are insanely good and the build quality is the best by a long shot,m29rzh2,7.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29uqmj,iboughtarock,,1,2024-12-16 03:04:44,,,,Yeah I ended up going with a Lenovo Yogi for 650 you really cannot beat it I dont need any crazy GPU power since I have a rig at home but that MSI I found would have been great except I was unable to find an 90Wh battery online for sale otherwise it really would have been the perfect laptop for me MSI doesnt sell batteries new or used and eBay I couldnt find any either,m29tv1f,8.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29wnci,neonmantis,,1,2024-12-16 03:17:20,,,,You can only have a 99Wh battery on an airplane so it will never get better than it presently is Some planes have plugs It is a real game changer,m29p05x,5.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29ye65,iboughtarock,,3,2024-12-16 03:29:05,,,,Yeah that really is huge but I was more saying that laptop manufacturers will not go over 99Wh due to that reason so it hampers people who will never fly with the laptop not having more battery ability without an at home power station battery solution,m29wnci,6.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2ahupo,neonmantis,,2,2024-12-16 06:00:04,,,,Going back like a decade ago I used to get more life out of my laptops on a plane as it had a removable battery and could take a couple of spares with me The EU has a new law that from 2027 or something will force some personal devices like phones to have a replaceable battery but dont know if that extends to laptops,m29ye65,7.0,1hexmdr
comment,m2cm4qx,iboughtarock,,2,2024-12-16 16:37:21,,,,Easily removable batteries are honestly not something that ever crossed my mind but that really might solve the whole issue Especially if you had another really small battery you could keep on device so you can just temporarily shut down and not lose RAM or have tabs close and such,m2ahupo,8.0,1hexmdr
comment,m29v0ws,CorruptedArcher,,2,2024-12-16 03:06:37,,,,yeah but I bought it for gaming,m29l548,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m27jghf,antara33,,27,2024-12-15 19:08:14,,,,The sound thing is indeed an issue but the battery one Maybe not that much As someone that have a notebook for work stuff that mainly connect to remote servers and rendering farms my device is 100 time connected to the charger And that is the same for any notebook I ever used at home that is For traveling car usage etc yeah I can totally see the battery as being an issue but for home usage with all the outlets at home I can see value on having a playstation 5 that can be moved along its display from room to room with just the need of an electrical outlet Not saying its perfect its not but I guess it can work I guess,m2782l4,1.0,1hexmdr
comment,m28omda,suicidaleggroll,,17,2024-12-15 22:48:33,,,,Ill never understand people that buy a laptop and then leave it plugged into a docking station on their desk and never move it Just buy a desktop Its half the price twice as powerful and will last twice as long,m27jghf,2.0,1hexmdr
comment,m297681,hanlonmj,,3,2024-12-16 00:36:27,,,,Honestly I cant think of any OEM that markets an Optiplexlike system for consumers Its always huge RGBinfested DIY gaming setups that most people arent going to want to deal with just to check email and access Sharepoint or whatever Its not nearly as easy to just buy a desktop as it probably should be these days,m28omda,3.0,1hexmdr
comment,m294skm,antara33,,5,2024-12-16 00:22:28,,,,I can only speak for myself here but in my case at least its a need I need to have a laptop in order to being able to meet with clients in person from time to time and moving all my work related stuff from a desktop to a laptop over and over is simply cumbersome Its not about economics its about having the ability to either use it desktop like or take it away to another place if I need to And from what I know that is why a lot of people do that They have a laptop entirely in order to have freedom of qhere they want to use ittake it,m28omda,3.0,1hexmdr

comment,m2auag2,Raznilof,,1,2024-12-16 08:07:46,,,,Agreed I wonder if perhaps a point to this is less the direct functionality compared to a tv console and more that it allows playing in a compact setting Smaller house shared screen kids desk Probably better use cases than PS5 on the go which a steamdeck does better as an overall experience and software availability,m2782l4,1.0,1hexmdr
