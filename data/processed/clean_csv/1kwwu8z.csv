comment,muoi0sr,M1QN,,-8,2025-05-28 11:19:23,,,,Scalpers dont lose money on you not buying hardware thats the problem They purchase things with bots then sell them on local marketplaces but unlike eg concert or football matches tickets there is no pressure for them to sell it if nobody buys a console or a gpu they just return it get a full refund and buy it again and can repeat so indefinitely It would maybe work if absolutely nobody purchased from them but that is never going to be the case And getting few thousand dollars even from 200300k investment with no chance of losing money will always be considered good,mum4ouj,2.0,1kwwu8z

comment,muo1p9u,Faster319,,7,2025-05-28 08:56:44,,,,Its because game journos have realised they get more clicks from creating articles with misleading headlines especially within regards to Nintendo A good example is the whole 90 debacle or the all games being a download key people currently have such a hatred for Nintendo that any article containing any sort of negativity surrounding it will get latched on immediately and spread The same thing wouldnt happen with the PS5 since that just wont get the same amount of clicks so journalists dont bother reporting on it At least thats my take on the whole situation,muo0ju9,6.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muo3bfi,elton_john_lennon,,0,2025-05-28 09:12:49,,,,all games being a download key Wait wasnt it the case that nintendo wants games to be downloaded and even games that have a memory card will have to download something from the servers to work I thought that was the deal The way I understand it the problem was that nintendo simply wants to have total control over the game market They have 0 control over physical copies that are 100 self contained on the physical medium they are distributed with and they wanted to change that If you already sell a box in the store there is no reason for it not to have all of the game files on it Adding requirement for download or even just a server connection makes you now dependant on nintendo and lets them control second handused market Negativity towards nintendo comes from such practices and overall nintendo pettiness I believe lawsuits and all they seem to be the gaming equivalent of disney Sure it is a business but so is valve for example they also make a ton of money and their approach to consumercustomer is completely different even though they do also have 100 total controll over games that they sell but their case is different because they only have digital distribution and they do massive sales Nintendo wants to do both have games be 60 indefinitely no sales and also have them be digital and dependant on their will to let you play them,muo1p9u,7.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muo9zfx,FireLucid,,4,2025-05-28 10:15:37,,,,Except all Nintendo games are fully on cartridge and its 3rd parties offering the download stuff Its up to the Dev Cyberpunk is fully on cartridge for example Ill be picking that up next week,muo3bfi,8.0,1kwwu8z

comment,mus56lm,FireLucid,,1,2025-05-28 22:23:26,,,,Every Nintendo game is fully on cartridge and does not need anything form the server to work Unless there is a required day 1 patch for the console you can never connect it online and play all games they release minus any online features of course This gives them the least control of the 3 options for distributing games at retail As for bricking the console I live somewhere that has actual consumer laws about that stuff so they didnt even try it,muofj74,10.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muuj4hw,elton_john_lennon,,-1,2025-05-29 08:09:31,,,,You repeated the same thing about nintendos own titles as if that mattered and changed anything Like I asked before why would it matter which ones are which They just increased control and showed their true colours you are just lucky that some of that control may not affect you but that doesnt change their intentions I own Quest3 I can and do use it without connecting it to the internet at all just standalone and PC over WiFi without internet connection and Meta own titles can be played without internet connection after initial purchase and download if they are not multiplier ones Does that change who Meta is what their intentions are and that they want to have control just because I use it offline and happen to live where gdpr should be protecting me Not in the slightest If people show that they are ok with being walked over by nintendo and that they buy those key card boxes just fine next edition of the console might be digital only for all the titles,mus56lm,11.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muyvu10,FireLucid,,1,2025-05-29 22:42:08,,,,You repeated the same thing about nintendos own titles as if that mattered and changed anything Like I asked before why would it matter which ones are which You had an incorrect preconceived idea Nintendo are forcing downloads started off you post with that then went on about to about how its because Nintendo is all about 100 control and you are dependent on their servers and you have to download it they somehow have control over the 2nd hand market Then when I pointed out this was not the case and especially not for Nintendo you double down and say it doesnt matter what Nintendo are doing Clearly 3rd party publishers can choose how they distribute their games just as they do on Xbox or PS5 Fully on disc disccard with download required they are calling it a key card or code in a box ew All platforms have this except PC which dont really do much retail distribution at all MS and Sony all have the same options You can sell a full game or a carddisc with a download required and you cannot sell a code in a box as its a single use code and just about everyone thinks its pretty shit Seems like Sony and MS are the ones after more control they have both sold devices that dont take physical media at all either full stop or require another purchase So in the end I dont understand your point at all as there is nothing here that Sony and MS are not already doing,muuj4hw,12.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muwzv1m,Various_Librarian750,,1,2025-05-29 17:12:15,,,,If Nintendo wanted games to be downloaded they would have gone and removed the cartridge slot from the console As a business their motive will always be to earn from as many revenue streams as possible which is why we have so many options to buy the same game,muo3bfi,8.0,1kwwu8z

comment,muokxr0,MagmaSeraph,,0,2025-05-28 11:40:15,,,,Because a bunch of entitled babies just started getting their first consoles I remember when Nintendo was bricking 3DS because of modding way back in the day Im an old pirate if you want to mod your console do it and share your results with the community without giving up too much info on yourself Theres always a way around this stuff Dont sit there and pretend Nintendo or most other companies will sit there and gleefully allow you to tinker with their stuff,munrzdj,4.0,1kwwu8z

comment,mun1ii4,tony971,,39,2025-05-28 03:40:27,,,,They add no value to the products They simply add in a tiered pricing model that makes products exactly as expensive as people are willing to pay for them And they take the difference for their trouble If they disappeared nothing of value would be lost and people who buy the products to own them would have more money to spend on other things,mun0jkd,2.0,1kwwu8z

comment,mun3fmc,WolverinesThyroid,,-56,2025-05-28 03:53:52,,,,Im not defending scalpers but the value they add is they let people with extra money buy a console without having to fight for a preorder They just pay 2x markup or whatever and get the thing they want Scalpers also usually account for less than 5 of sales,mun1ii4,3.0,1kwwu8z
comment,munjzp3,Marble_Dude,,24,2025-05-28 06:05:38,,,,And who are those people fighting for a preorder Exactly scalpers too These leeches buy them in bulk like a family of 5 every week They just create an artificial demand and take advantage of desperate people,mun3fmc,4.0,1kwwu8z

comment,mun4jy9,tony971,,26,2025-05-28 04:01:52,,,,Yeah instead of 20 people buying a product before it goes OOS they can all wait and buy it for 2x the price from one guy who bought all of them right when they became available Scalpers help create the market urgency that you say theyre alleviating,mun3fmc,4.0,1kwwu8z
comment,mung5ui,mach1alfa,,12,2025-05-28 05:32:30,,,,and if graphics card are anything to go by manufacturers will increase the prices themselves when they see people are fine with paying 2x with a middleman screwing people who are willing to wait no matter what,mun4jy9,5.0,1kwwu8z
comment,munk7ob,heyhotnumber,,5,2025-05-28 06:07:36,,,,This is unfortunately an unregulated capitalism problem and not the fault of people doing what they legally can to make money Shareholders gleefully advocate for much more aggressive anticonsumer behavior all of the time and thats just a standard form of business Scalping will keep happening as long as its legal to do so Its literally just supply and demand at work,mung5ui,6.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muorbug,WolverinesThyroid,,-3,2025-05-28 12:21:55,,,,It would be more like instead of 20 people buying the product for themselves 19 are buying it for themselves and 1 is buying it to sell Then 1 person who didnt bother gets that product because they had more money to spend Its not great but its the minority,mun4jy9,5.0,1kwwu8z

comment,mumg07k,stellvia2016,,2,2025-05-28 01:30:47,,,,Their margin on the original Switch was 10 or less Compare that to something like an iPhone which is around 50 Inflation alone would make the original Switch price of 299 be 399 today Adding in extra factors such as more demand for chips increased shipping costs and possibly a margin for the current market instability Theyre once again making 10 margin or less As for the cost in Japan Its to counter to deflation their currency had against the dollar over the last 4 years It was 1101 back then and spiked to over 1601 before coming down to hover in the 1501401 range lately 110 x 450 49500 The MSRP of the Japan Switch2 is 49980 150 x 450 67500 67500 110 613 USD That is why they get preferential pricing bc everyone there is making the same amount they made 4 years ago If they priced it at current market rates they would price themselves out of their home market based on global exchange rates which is silly,mukntsy,1.0,1kwwu8z
comment,munvti5,elton_john_lennon,,0,2025-05-28 07:58:12,,,,Compare that to something like an iPhone which is around 50 Why would you compare it to something like an iPhone though Do you have to buy 60 apps on the iPhone to have anything to do on it or does it come loaded fully functional and most of what you can think of is either free of costs just a few bucks,mumg07k,2.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muo7ir2,leddhedd,,3,2025-05-28 09:53:16,,,,Well the revenue from the app store certainly contributes and isnt insignificant not to mention its not usual to have consoles on a 23 year upgrade cycle whilst apple would try to have you ever 12 months if they could Nintendo is likely only charging you once or twice a decade for the hardware,munvti5,3.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muoc2m5,elton_john_lennon,,0,2025-05-28 10:33:34,,,,Well the revenue from the app store certainly contributes and isnt insignificant Sure it does but what difference does it make from a consumer perspective Apple makes plenty of money from the app store and yet they still dont charge 60 for an app not even their own crucial apps They could easily charge 99 for calls 59 for imessage 99 for photo app 59 for navigation etc With phones there are free apps sales dollar apps and the device comes fully functional with all required apps for its hardware where with nintendo the hardware comes naked with nothing useful and nintendo wants to charge you for a freakin tutorial its not usual to have consoles on a 23 year upgrade cycle whilst apple would try to have you ever 12 months if they could Nintendo is likely only charging you once or twice a decade for the hardware Its not like they sell you once per decade and have to charge more so that the hardware can last a decade They charge you once a decade and you end up with decade old hardware so that hardly seems unfair Its even worse than that because given that nintendo is never on the bleeding edge of tech its more like charging once a decade for already 3 year old tech You can also easily buy an iPhone and not buy another for 10 year period so that doesnt really make a difference from hardware perspective in this comparison Consoles are in the ink printer business You charge 0 or minimal margin for hardware and recoup on consumables software in case of nintendo That is why it shouldnt be compared to something like an iPhone where they make most of the money selling the hardware and they cant rely on software sales because a lot of people dont even need to buy software to use the hardware because like Ive said iPhone comes preloaded and additional apps are free in lot of cases,muo7ir2,4.0,1kwwu8z
comment,mup5hc1,stellvia2016,,1,2025-05-28 13:42:40,,,,Most of the games available on the console arent provided by Nintendo theyre sold by 3rd parties Many of which charge far less than 60 Also calling most mobile things as free or a few bucks is disingenuous given how heavily they lean into MTX and gacha And given Nintendos margin is 10 or less how much lower do you expect it to be Its not reasonable to expect companies to sell their hardware at a loss Sony and Xbox were doing it trying to build market share and what happened was they lost money on most of their generations Nintendo is the only console maker thats been in the green for all console gens Also a lot of products tend to shoot for like a 30 margin so 10 is quite low,munvti5,3.0,1kwwu8z
comment,mupb6z4,elton_john_lennon,,1,2025-05-28 14:12:06,,,,is disingenuous given how heavily they lean into MTX and gacha They What D Google maps costs no money Signal costs no money ChatGPTGeminietc costs no money Instagram costs no money Uber app costs no money and many more Those are one of the most used apps they greatly expand what the device is capable of millions of people use them and they cost no money There is nothing disingenuous about what I wrote Phone primary function is communicationphotomultimedia that is what it is mostly used for by people around the world and that is even more of a reason not to compare it to a gaming console And given Nintendos margin is 10 or less how much lower do you expect it to be That is not what I am addressing I was responding to explanation of Switch2 price in comparison to iPhone price where that comparison makes no sense in my opinion as those two have rather different business model,mup5hc1,4.0,1kwwu8z
comment,muphj0y,stellvia2016,,0,2025-05-28 14:42:45,,,,So what does any of that have to do with excusing having a larger margin Apple has the highest market cap in the world Theyre absolutely making filthy money off their grossly inflated margins 10 is quite low of a margin for a commodity you only sell one of to a consumer every 78 years The things with less margin than that are generally bc they are regularly consumed items like food or heavily contested markets like basic clothing,mupb6z4,5.0,1kwwu8z
comment,mupjjh2,elton_john_lennon,,1,2025-05-28 14:52:16,,,,So what does any of that have to do with excusing having a larger margin I already explained what they have a different business model and they cant recoup that much money on software as closedsystemconsole manufacturers can so they earn money on the hardware itself Apple has the highest market cap in the world What does that have to do with Nintendo and theirs You brought up apple you have to explain how they can be compared rather than me trying to explain that they cant I only mentioned reasons against it because Im a nice person but its you who have to make a case here really Theyre absolutely making filthy money off their grossly inflated margins So because apple does it then it is okay for others to do it Is that really your argument whataboutism Those are different products that have different target different main functionality and are sold by companies under different business models there is hardly anything that makes sense in this comparison,muphj0y,6.0,1kwwu8z

comment,muwm4ns,epsilonzer0,,1,2025-05-29 16:08:15,,,,Japans Copyright Act generally prohibits renting out copyrighted works like video games for profit without the copyright holders permission This means businesses cannot legally operate video game rental services unless they have explicit authorization from the game publishers or rights holders which is rarely granted Historically video game rentals were more common in Japan but the practice has largely disappeared due to these legal restrictions and industry pushback from game companies For example Nintendo and other major publishers have opposed rental services to protect their sales leading to a decline in such businesses since the 1990s Today physical rental shops for video games are nearly nonexistent in Japan and digital rentals are tightly controlled by platforms like Nintendo eShop PlayStation Store or Steam which dont allow thirdparty rentalsFor personal use sharing or lending games to friends or family is generally fine as it doesnt involve commercial intent However reselling or distributing rented games could violate copyright laws if done without permission,mulnz2x,2.0,1kwwu8z
