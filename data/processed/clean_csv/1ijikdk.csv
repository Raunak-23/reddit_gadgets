comment,mbgpg90,LongBeakedSnipe,,0,2025-02-07 11:51:35,,,,There was always a balance with the old joycons where if you had really big hands they were comfortable because they kind of snugged in to the right place on my palm when using them as a pair However they were unusable for me as a single and this looks uncomfortable as hell Hopefully its workable for people with small and medium hands I already feel the RSI when looking at it,mbg1ngq,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbks26y,descendency,,1,2025-02-08 00:32:51,,,,Part of me hopes this means we will see 3rd party mouse support as well Given that they will have first party mouse support in the box this means developers may be more likely to support it So maybe we can get Nintendo to support regular mice somehow and then use those to play games with instead,mbefaoo,1.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbgfevr,alidan,,-6,2025-02-07 10:18:44,,,,you arent fully grasping how big this is this effectively means EVERY game will be built with a mouse being used because every single person will have a mouse for the console it may be ps4 at best level of graphics but with a mouse and most likely third party switch specific mice it will be the console to play fps on among so many other genres of games I think this has a bigger impact that anyone really understands,mbefaoo,1.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbgpr7s,LongBeakedSnipe,,9,2025-02-07 11:54:03,,,,Im guessing its going to be about as useable as using the PS54 touch pads below the usability of the Deck touch pad Hopefully they allow USB mice also,mbgfevr,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbh21t0,alidan,,0,2025-02-07 13:21:03,,,,useability wise on the controller itself I have a thin small controller by me using it like a mouse is going to be a lot more comfortable than you are imagining granted I have had novelty mice in the past where they were more vertical not sure how that would play out on Nintendos side BUT if every console has a mouse then mice will be an option in every game which will likely mean usb mice at best or nintendo approved peripheral mice at worst honestly very interested in how game devs that are primarily console use this,mbgpr7s,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbjolzt,mao_dze_dun,,0,2025-02-07 21:08:54,,,,Or they can finally figure out you can play FPS games using the gamepads gyro,mbgpr7s,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbgv4wh,celestial-chin-twirl,,3,2025-02-07 12:35:03,,,,Definitely not every game or even close to most Id imagine Its still a hybrid portable console using the mouse would require setting the console down in addition to having an appropriate mouse surface Another thing to consider is that all current gen consoles including the switch technically already support mouse and keyboard as an option for developers to implement Perhaps the switch 2 will push developers to start incorporating it more universally on consoles but as of right now they have their reasons to choose not to In terms of bringing mk games over from pc the lack of a keyboard is a complication for the scope of what devs would be willing or able to do,mbgfevr,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbh3p9n,alidan,,0,2025-02-07 13:31:12,,,,I dont think its as big of a problem as people imagine it to be I have played fps games with a hybrid controller in my left hand and mouse in my right my hands have issues and some times wasd is just painful sometimes its my mouse hand if you had the 4 buttons or a depad on the mouse and a second controller that will cover nearly everything not context based and a radial menu on a button would handle the rest the mouse always being there for everyone means game deves would need to take that into account there are 47 games on ps5 that support mk and of them only 23 really needed it I honestly kind of think you underestimate how many people would be willing to kick stand the console if there was a far better way to play a game on it,mbgv4wh,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbkmi7v,celestial-chin-twirl,,1,2025-02-08 00:02:27,,,,Dont get me wrong I would use the crap out of the mouse mode Im actually someone whos excited for what nintendo has planned for it and how it might influence the industry Mouse analog movement is something Ive wanted for an eternity Halo infinite is a game that plays nice with dual inputs and Ive definitely utilized that My point isnt about if gamers want that functionality or if it has a purpose my point is that is that there are limiting factors in the scope of what developers might do with it Things like the development timecost to implement extra functionality like specialized ui input mechanics etc or the fact that a game requiring the mouse will be limited to the subset of gamers that are willing or able to use the mouse as a primary method of control,mbh3p9n,4.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbhiz4i,Panichord,,3,2025-02-07 14:57:17,,,,Im really not seeing the market for that Console FPS players are used to controllers and either prefer it to mouse or are casual enough to not care Then the people who want a mouse or are sweaty players are going to be playing on PC So I dont see the demand for mouse joycon controls that wont be as comfortable or customisable as using a mousePC Maaaybe people who can only afford one console love Nintendo exclusives and also love FPS Is that a massive group though Not sure,mbgfevr,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbknn2g,celestial-chin-twirl,,1,2025-02-08 00:08:38,,,,this It might be a budget option for people who cant afford a pc but even then there are other options like a base model steam deck,mbhiz4i,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbs3akw,aplundell,,1,2025-02-09 03:50:21,,,,I suspect the intent is mostly to give people a way to click on touchscreen elements when theyre not in portable mode If they really wanted to encourage mouse games theyd give us something to use in portable mode Like Steams touchpads,mbgfevr,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbsxaz5,alidan,,1,2025-02-09 07:47:28,,,,if im nintendo and im looking at the gaming market there is only 1 new innovation in about 30 years of gaming and that would be consumer accessible vr outside of that outside of that the only new things we have gotten were motion controls with the wii and because of how inaccurate they are they only play well with party games and surprisingly with fps games in comparison to a controller pc innovated on motion controls to the point that you could have precision in fps games anything physics based is seen as a gimmick or forced for puzzle solving and seen as eye candy for just inclusion in games we are hitting a point with consoles that they could easily go away and be replaced with sony or microsoft branded pcs and they just become publishers the only people who would be left are nintendo and steam because of their portable machines if you dont care about graphics and honestly I think we had better 10 years ago just because of optimization and unreal pushing taa which is objectively shit along with nvidia forcing ray tracing because they want to have a closed system where they force people to upgrade to play games rather than people who were more than ok with a 1060 6gb up till games required rt hardware to even launch the only other area you could move is just minmaxing control schemes it is a hell of a lot cheaper for nintendo to mandage controller first screen elements in addition to mobile first than give everyone a mouse inside a controller if they were never going to use it for anything more hell look at sinden lightgun they could put a wii style sensor in the controllers and activate it when you need to point at the screen 4 dots to track while you are pointing it and you get relative precision control with the same kind of hardware but it would allow wii games without an issue I would assume they want to make a bigger push into mouse based games and this is there way to make sure everyone has one,mbs3akw,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbvc9du,aplundell,,1,2025-02-09 17:41:38,,,,Sorry dude Its going the other way The percentage of PC users using mouse for gaming is steadily going down Mice isnt a PCConsole distinction its a DeskCouch distinction And gaming is definitely moving away from desks After all sticking a mouse on a console isnt new There was A mouse for the SNES a mouse for the PS3 a mouse for the Dreamcast Xboxes have always supported mice etc etc etc But There was a common complaint about the Switch both from players and developers that touchscreen controls couldnt be used while the console was docked So it makes sense that Nintendo would put in a workaround,mbsxaz5,4.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbeqm4k,mule_roany_mare,,53,2025-02-07 02:21:44,,,,Ive always been disappointed that there isnt a good mouse PC mouse with a good analog thumbstick It could be fantastically useful with good software especially with the gamecube style cutouts for cardinal directions The formfactor for this mouse is obviously compromised but maybe a 3d printed shell will make it pleasant to use Otherwise I am hoping that the controller proves the usecase 3rd parties make a good mouse,,0.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbezg7l,MichaelMottram,,11,2025-02-07 03:12:12,,,,that would require specific drivers to be recognised and implemented by the pc and support be built into the games personally I would love for that to happen but right now analog controls on pc are almost all Xinput and a lot of games dont support both Xinput and mousekeyboard at the same time the alternative is thumbstick emulates wasd or another key combo but thats not full analog could be cool tho,mbeqm4k,1.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbf1yi7,Mental_Tea_4084,,7,2025-02-07 03:26:51,,,,You said it xinput Games that refuse to support both suck already for accessibilityperipheral support But there is also direct input You could even do analog emulation Bind the slow walk modifier to the lower tilt range Flicker wasd inputs relative to the amount of tilt,mbezg7l,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbfkjw9,AL2009man,,4,2025-02-07 05:27:53,,,,XInput was originally designed around Xbox 360 controllers in mind and it shouldve been replaced a long time ago Hopefully GameInput might become a thing and actually replaces both XInput and WindowsGamingInput completely but I dont have any faith in MS,mbf1yi7,3.0,1ijikdk

comment,mbf930w,mule_roany_mare,,1,2025-02-07 04:09:31,,,,I think its very likely that we will eventually get community support for this controller just like we did with the wiimote pretty much every controller ever made Specific game support is ideal but you can do a lot with the firmware in the case of a purpose build peripheral or for hardware you dont control an input mapper running on the host computer Simplest is mapping the analog stick position to keypresses but you could also do neat stuff like mapping one axis to dpi for a kind of friction like effect when moving the mouse or decreased resolution for when you want to make a really fine adjustment in game while moving your mouse a reasonable amount or averaging the xy of the analog stick with the optical sensor No game specific support necessary the input is the same as a standard mouse Another feature you could have is chording the analog stick inputs As an example have all the cardinal directions the analog stick N NW W SW W etc mapped to a keypress say 1 through 8 useful for a weaponitem select If you want more than 8 inputs you could map N to NW or N to NE for 16 additional inputs say F1 through F16 Finally for productivity you could also map the analog stick to keypressshortcut in such a way that the position controls the frequency of input Say you are using a video editing program moving the analog stick to X 20 could send the existing advance 10 frames keyboard shortcut 1 times a second while advancing the analog stick to x40 could send that same shortcut 10 times a second This again gives analog like control without any specific support from the video editor developer,mbezg7l,2.0,1ijikdk

comment,mbedpl3,TheBoozehammer,,42,2025-02-07 01:09:19,,,,Im eager to get some impressions on this as it really strikes me as awkward The tall and thin in that orientation design of the controller seems awkward for a mouse which is much wider Im also a little worried about the controller just being too small Plus it looks like you are expected to be using the stick at the same time Weird but if it works potentially interesting Im really curious what they are expecting in terms of surfaces I personally mostly play in an armchair with a coffee table but it is too low for me to comfortably use a mouse on Most people I know use a couch with no table I could try the arms of the chair or my leg but both dont give a lot of room and arent flat surfaces Is this mainly for use with kickstand mode on the go,,0.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbez9qw,PlaneCandy,,21,2025-02-07 03:11:11,,,,Do you own a switch or had a Wii Then you might be familiar with the fact that without a doubt someone will make an ergonomic grip for this position Just like how using a joycon sideways isnt ergonomic its not hard to find a grip As far as using it like a mouse I imagine youd just have to modify your setup and use it like a desk Not every game needs to support this mode and the mode doesnt need to be played in every situation Just like some Switch games used motion control but also didnt have it Or supported using a single joycon vs both If you cant find a surface to play then just dont buy games that need that,mbedpl3,1.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbf6145,TheBoozehammer,,10,2025-02-07 03:50:44,,,,The grip thing is fair but I also dont think its unreasonable to judge it as is As for changing the setup I could but I suspect a lot of people wont which reduces the effective player base and could easily lead to it being underused by developers which would be unfortunate,mbez9qw,2.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbh7fua,nitrobskt,,1,2025-02-07 13:53:24,,,,Just slapping a mousepad on the armrest of a chair or couch should solve most nonergonomics related issues with the joycon mouse joymouse For anyone who is only used to cheap mice like most workplaces will provide you would probably be surprised at how effective the laser on a decent mouse is Most surfaces are perfectly fine to use if youre not trying to play competitively,mbf6145,3.0,1ijikdk
comment,mbg3384,HRudy94,,2,2025-02-07 08:11:23,,,,Youre likely aware but grips cant really fix most ergonomics issues with joyxons Though at least the new joycons are a bit bigger it will still likely suck ergonomically Nintendo never was the best in that department i mean the NES controllers were square and had sharp corners the N64 ones well you all know those ones the wiimotes the joycons,mbez9qw,2.0,1ijikdk

comment,mbhlvz2,_RADIANTSUN_,,1,2025-02-07 15:12:19,,,,Im not saying you hover the controller Im saying you dont rest your hand on the surface Eg neither wrist nor elbow is resting Like the patent shows the hand holding it downward from a higher angle than one typically holds a mouse A mouse is held more like this This makes more sense using a computer on a desktop vs where they likely expect a Switch 2 to be played eg across a coffee table,mbhllc2,5.0,1ijikdk

comment,mbfbi69,QuantumQuantonium,,5,2025-02-07 04:25:07,,,,The mouse alone isnt in the modern day but designing a controller that doubles as a mouse which is detachable from a small tablet is Now it would be best for open markets if Nintendo opened their patent for other companies to innovate upon but I understand how keeping it closed keeps a notable feature of the switch 2 exclusive to nintendo,mbfaosj,2.0,1ijikdk

comment,mbfgkyi,IMSOGIRL,,1,2025-02-07 04:59:22,,,,You cant copyright form factors or ideas And it takes a simple google search to find out whether its true or not If Lenovo took apart the Switch 2 controller and found that they implemented it in a way thats too similar to their own patent then yes they can and should sue But its much more likely that Nintendo just engineered their own method for implementing it,mbfbn96,3.0,1ijikdk
