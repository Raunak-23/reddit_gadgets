comment,lw9d7xi,jobe_br,,155,2024-11-09 15:26:21,,,,Just soak in a citric acid solution for a bit I get a few ounces of crystallized citric acid on Amazon and put a couple tablespoons in the kettle add cold water heat let sit for a bit to let the CA do its thing usually does the trick first time if theres anything left repeat a second time 30 minutes later and you have a fresh clean kettle,lw9bf8v,1.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lw9txfy,GrynaiTaip,,27,2024-11-09 16:57:42,,,,The switch lever broke on mine because the little plastic tabs on it were very thin and just barely held up for five years I grabbed a piece of plastic sheet cut out multiple shapes of that lever and stacked them to get the right thickness It broke a year later so I made a stronger version Its still working half a decade later,lw9bf8v,1.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwaxb26,None,,5,2024-11-09 20:28:53,,,,Im still rocking a 10 stainless steel cookworks kettle I bought from argos in 20056 The plastic ring on the base broke a couple years back but you could unscrew it from the bottom to remove the wirecontacts and then I used the plastic top of a fairly liquid bottle some milliput and glue to fix it Still going strong now if it breaks again Ill make a replacement using my 3D printer,lw9txfy,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwccht0,GrynaiTaip,,1,2024-11-10 01:23:51,,,,Funny that you mentioned I lived and studied in the UK a few years ago and the rental house had this really old kettle I did some googling and it appeared to be from the 70s The company was still in business so I emailed them asking for an owners manual or some other info just for fun but they never replied That kettle worked great it even survived a renovation when I had to make a cuppa for three guys once an hour for several days,lwaxb26,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwawk3y,gargravarr2112,,13,2024-11-09 20:24:46,,,,My first thought When have kettles ever broken They are like the simplest possible appliance Scale obviously becomes a problem but so much less since designers started using flat bases instead of elements in the water The only time Ive known my family replace a kettle was for aesthetics Ive had the same kettle for 10 years since I moved into my first flat Descale it every year or two and carry on,lw9bf8v,1.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwdokw4,razirazo,,3,2024-11-10 07:24:56,,,,I had one kettle that I throw out due to sensor issue Thing keep boiling until the water dries without any cut off,lwawk3y,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwgi1xq,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-10 19:24:47,,,,I am on my 3rd in 10 years I use it all the time but eventually the electronics go out I guess all of the humidity Now note mine has different temp settings ie for different tea types French press or pour over coffee etc and auto shutoff My issue with this kettle is he basically just lets you swap all of the electronics out Which is guess is better than tossing a whole kettle but still doesnt seem like much of a repair vs someone actually swapping a potentiometer or resoldering broken contacts Then again Im an EE who could probably fix it and I dont bother since spending a day trying to repair a 100 kettle isnt worth my time,lwawk3y,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwgq6vu,gargravarr2112,,2,2024-11-10 20:05:56,,,,Part of my point is that kettles arent supposed to have electronics theyre supposed to be electrical because as youve correctly pointed out the electronics are the usual point of failure Now to be fair I have never had cause to need different temperature settings so I wouldnt understand the benefit I just boil the kettle and toss the hot water in a mug I bought the cheapest stainlesssteel kettle at the supermarket 12 years ago It has exactly two settings on and off I made 3 cups of tea with it today Theres just nothing to go wrong in it But as you say making this device repairable by essentially making the electronics modular doesnt really solve the problem Because as you point out its still an entire electronics module composed of many smaller electronic components that has to be swapped out and then disposed of rather than fixing the one or two actual faulty components It reduces the electrical waste but doesnt eliminate it,lwgi1xq,3.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwgugh4,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-10 20:27:26,,,,Who says they are not supposed to have electronics I bet 80 years ago people said there was no reason they should be electrical why not just use a gas range Thats how we did it as a kid thats good enough for everyone I like my kettle that has 8 temp buttons and a keep warm setting with auto shutoff and emptyno water safety detection I use mine for everything from white oolong green and black teas French press aero press and Americano coffee ramen miso or other quick soups and heh even warming water to defrost small rats to feed my ball python Sometimes my family uses it 10x a day Which is why I guess Im ok that the last one only lasted 5 years,lwgq6vu,4.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwca4wg,boomchacle,,1,2024-11-10 01:09:22,,,,I always just assumed that a kettle is literally just a switch coil and thermometer What is there to break that could be replaced without creating E waste,lwawk3y,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwenns4,gargravarr2112,,3,2024-11-10 13:20:49,,,,Its not even a thermometer its a simple and reliable bimetallic strip on heating one side expands faster than the other causing it to bend and flip the switch to off Those things last decades,lwca4wg,3.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwgidrf,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-10 19:26:24,,,,A lot of decent ones have multiple temperature settings Also a bimetallic strip is basically a thermometer without the needle,lwenns4,4.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwgqxz0,gargravarr2112,,2,2024-11-10 20:09:44,,,,Very true on both counts My point is that a bimetallic strip is extremely reliable dramatically more so than electronics accomplishing the same job and why this kettle apparently exists You could probably use such a strip or a couple of them to handle multiple temperatures rather than doing it electronically but that wouldnt look nearly as modern or futuristic would it,lwgidrf,5.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwh3yt9,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2024-11-10 21:12:54,,,,And at some point a few 010 electrical components is much cheaper to build especially if you dont care how long it lasts,lwgqxz0,6.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwcdmuk,achangb,,-2,2024-11-10 01:30:42,,,,This kettle is obsolete as soon as you buy itWho wants a dumb kettle these days Give me a Bluetooth wifi connected kettle that has OTA firmware updates color screen phine app and can even be hacked to play games,lwawk3y,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwenxuf,gargravarr2112,,1,2024-11-10 13:22:53,,,,Im waiting for a smart kettle that gets around the fact that a human has to physically pour water into it Because flipping a physical switch on the kettle while standing in front of it is far far harder than grabbing your phone opening the app waiting for updates to finish waiting for Bluetooth to connect swiping past the ads and then choosing exactly how you want to boil the water,lwcdmuk,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lw9qq9m,rdmusic16,,15,2024-11-09 16:40:39,,,,Is that true In Canada we have the same and my electric kettle is 15 years old I properly clean it once a year I cant say Ive always used it daily during all that time but Ive always used it and its definitely turned on 34 times a day for a long time now Still works perfectly fine,lw9fb2z,2.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwbfcnf,Tasty-Traffic-680,,2,2024-11-09 22:07:51,,,,Im starting to think it might just be the shitty Hamilton Beach ones Ive bought in the past but even the more expensive one I last purchased only lasted a few years before getting flakey with the connection to the base It has to be turned to exactly the right spot to turn on,lw9qq9m,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lw9yarj,Practical-Custard-64,,4,2024-11-09 17:21:07,,,,Higher current but not that much higher I believe correct me if Im wrong that appliances are limited to 1500W in the US Here in the UK we use 240V and kettles are up to 3500W 13A under 240V,lw9fb2z,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwaj0cq,BeefyIrishman,,3,2024-11-09 19:11:24,,,,Most circuits in a house in the US are on 15A breakers with 14AWG wire about 25mm² so 1800W will trip the breaker The 1500W helps avoid accidentally tripping the breaker all the time This is why you dont see electric kettles as often in the US Usually people just have a normal kettle that they use on their stovetop hob since stoves runs at 240V instead of 120V and therefore you can typically boil water faster than an electric kettle Side note Kitchens are actually required to be on 20A breaker 2400W with 12AWG wire about 4mm² but that is just because you typically have a lot of higher current devices in the kitchen Most devices wont be able to use the extra current as they are designed to run on any circuit in the house You can technically buy some devices that use the 20A but they are rare The 20A outlets are designed to allow both 15A and 20A plugs to be inserted into them but a 15A outlet will only allow 15A plugs,lw9yarj,3.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwb0g1u,None,,3,2024-11-09 20:45:58,,,,Yeah thats pretty low by our standards the UK most kitchens are on a 32A Breaker 75kW with each individual socket rated technically rated to 13A 230V but in reality the UK still gets around 240V tolerance is 216 to 253 Most kettles top out at 3000W though you can get 10KW wall mounted instant water boilers but they need wired on their own connection and tend to be used commercially UK sockets also mostly use 25mm cable twin and earth but wired in a ring so can handle that 32A compared to a radial circuit like used in the US mostly,lwaj0cq,4.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwb4cuh,BeefyIrishman,,3,2024-11-09 21:07:16,,,,You can also get instant water boilers here but they typically will get their own circuit anyways so it can be run as a 240V circuit The odd thing is our mains power is actually 240V we just split that into two 120V lines by tapping a neutral off the center and tying it to ground So if you go L1 hot or L2 hot to neutral you get 120V and if you go from L1 to L2 you get 240V Usually only electric clothes dryers water heaters AC units and stoves ovens and electric car chargers if you have one run at 240V though pretty much everything else runs 120V There is actually nothing stopping you other than cost from running 240V circuits in your house and buying 240V electronics if you wanted to There are 240V plugsoutlets for both 15A and 20A that are very similar to our normal plugs they just have some of the flat pins rotated but you typically only see those used in commercial spaces They are pretty rare in residential I have a few that I installed in my garage for some woodworking tools but most houses dont have them,lwb0g1u,5.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwbao5n,None,,1,2024-11-09 21:42:05,,,,Thats odd must be 180 out phase then We dont have that we can get 3 phase so if you DeltaY it you get 400V this is usually only used in industry though or very large buildings like blocks of flats once it gets to residential its almost never used you can but it costs more for the electric company to hook you up Generally more used for heavy machinery big power tools etc,lwb4cuh,6.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwbijey,BeefyIrishman,,2,2024-11-09 22:26:01,,,,Yeah for residential its 180 out of phase For commercial use we do have 3 phase power and that has many different versions These are the most common from what I have seen at manufacturing facilities where I have worked 120208V 208V Wye 208V between phases 120V any phase to Neutral 277480V 480V Wye 480V between phases 277V any phase to Neutral 347600V 600V Wye 600V between phases 347V any phase to Neutral 208V Delta 4 wire 240V between phases 208V on Phase B wild leg to Neutral 120V Phase A C to Neutral You apparently occasionally see Delta on the higher voltages well but I havent seen these personally 208V Delta 3 wire 208V between phases no Neutral 480V Delta 3 wire 480V between phases no Neutral 480V Delta 4 wire 480V between phases 415V on Phase B wild leg to Neutral 240V Phase A C to Neutral 600V Delta 3 wire 600V between phases no Neutral I am sure there are others as well It can start getting really convoluted in commercial power,lwbao5n,7.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwafxy1,__dontpanic__,,9,2024-11-09 18:54:49,,,,The problem is that most parts arent easily accessible and even if they can be obtained you need additional tools and skills to properly repair the product So that puts it out of reach for most The other alternative is to pay someone to do the repairs but that often ends up costing the same as buying a whole new unit with a brand new warranty Unless manufacturers make repairs easier and cheaper the convenience and economics for the end user will never stack up The only way I could conceivably see things changing is if governments regulate repairability or place a levy or tax on products that dont meet repairablity standards which would hopefully make repairable products cheaper or more attractive to consumers than nonrepairable ones The free market on its own will never solve this problem,lwa5ecd,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwavqwe,None,,2,2024-11-09 20:20:22,,,,No one would buy it to kill it they wont need to The price of these would be obscene for the average consumer Sam Vimes Boots theory no one will spend a 100 on a kettle that in 20 hell even 50 years time theyll maybe assuming the company survives be able to buy replacement parts for for 20 30 If needed Not when they can spend 8 at Asda rn to 20 for a kettle that will probably last 5 years with luck 10 Only wealthy people would to feel good about themselves and even then theyd replace it the next time they decorated the kitchen and it no longer matched,lwaae1m,1.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwb2hnf,theholyraptor,,0,2024-11-09 20:57:05,,,,Are they done by design a little bit But its not the grand conspiracy people love to think Most people want cheap products To hit that level of cheapness designs make sacrifices Take this design Itll cost a lot They are replacing pretty much all the expensive components as the repair So replacement parts will cost almost as much as a new one And this is for an item thats exceedingly simple in design mechanically and electrically A lot of the shitty aspects of electronics for repair is the extreme measures companies go for water proofing and sandwiching the whole product into the smallest form factor possible People care about bulk on their phones and aesethtics And electronics are microscopic these days and require highly specialized knowledge and tools to have any hope of repairing Is their a subsection of the population that wants more dumb products that would be easier to repair Sure But theres many that are either too wealthy too uninterested or would never attempt repairs Do you as a manufacture spend millions to tool up a 2nd product sku for the smaller market Or do you make one that is mostly broadly acceptedpurchased Its mostly economics and design limitations and human preferences not purposeful greed driving these decisions,lwaae1m,1.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwb4wlz,Mysterious-Tie7039,,2,2024-11-09 21:10:19,,,,You dont think that companies refusing to sell repair parts and work only being able to be performed by an authorized dealer is done by design Apple recently specifically designed their glass on their phones to only be replaceable by Apple stores IIRC this has since been undone Auto dealerships are working towards that same thing forcing out the honest mom pop stores John Deere is purposely making it so farmers are unable to work on their own tractors and instead have to pay for a service tech to come out,lwb2hnf,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwb5pbr,theholyraptor,,0,2024-11-09 21:14:46,,,,I would say the vast majority of issues people encounter is not purposefully done Sure some bad actors exist Cars have become complex computers driving the complexity and cost of parts to test and fix many things up Beyond that I dont see too much forcing you to go to a dealer Ive never gone to a dealer for any work and refuse to do so,lwb4wlz,3.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwcl4mx,NextWhiteDeath,,0,2024-11-10 02:16:58,,,,For many companies the cost of having a supply chain for spare parts is very expensive As now you have to document everything keep those document up to date stock the spare parts after the product has been changed or reached end of production More then anything for a lot but not all companies it comes down to price They make stuff that breaks faster because if it is 10 cheaper they sell a lot more of them The same was having a long and detailed supply chain for post purchase support is expensive Especially as often people replace products before they break,lwb4wlz,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwamfa1,TooStrangeForWeird,,0,2024-11-09 19:29:39,,,,Throw the teabag in while its microwaving You can also do multiple cups at once Iirc you actually get more of the nutrients doing it this way too,lwadg1a,2.0,1gnbb2y
comment,lwaootj,denissRenaulds,,1,2024-11-09 19:41:40,,,,The nutrients in your average cup of tea are negligable And maybe you could fit possibly 2 or 3 mugs in the microwave it doesnt match up to the might of the kettle,lwamfa1,3.0,1gnbb2y

comment,lwcp23u,Pizza_Low,,0,2024-11-10 02:42:34,,,,I guess Ive never understood the appeal of a kettle A mug or even Pyrex pitcher in the microwave does the same thing 23 minutes will get a standard mug of water to boiling hot just fine None of the issues with another appliance in the kitchen or the scale buildup and repeatedly reheating the same water every time you want another glass of hot water,,0.0,1gnbb2y
