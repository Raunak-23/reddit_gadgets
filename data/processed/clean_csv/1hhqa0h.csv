comment,m2ub2ay,llDurbinll,,27,2024-12-19 16:17:05,,,,At my last job they used iPads as the registers and shortly before I left there they had finally gotten a card reader that took chip payments I assume they were forced to do it by the credit card companies And they picked the shittiest design for a card reader I had ever seen instead of the standard one most major corporations use that is straight forward this machine required the customer to insert the chip from the top and to have the front of the card facing the machine There was no obvious spot to insert the card except for a tiny white icon where the slot was and the slot was flush with the machine After the first few customers we had with the new card reader we just took the card from them and placed it in the machine and then talked them through pressing the green button to accept the total and pulling their card out,m2tyza9,3.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m2vc4yn,None,,1,2024-12-19 19:45:27,,,,Its this idiotic trend of taking everything and turning it into a web based app Its a stupid waste of time and electricity The critical processing can be done by a cheap microcontroller that can run off a button cell for years but instead its done inefficiently on top end tablet computers that would have to be recharged twice a day if they werent always plugged in,m2tyza9,3.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m2zkwpk,GhostDan,,1,2024-12-20 14:47:47,,,,Inventory data is absolutely automated on newer systems Hell if you walk into some big box retailers they can use RFID tags to identify exactly where the product is all automated When a truck arrives at the location the system sees the trucks inventory stored in a database and imports it into the local inventory or sets a flag that its in a certain store Theres no one on the truck typing 1 box of kleenex 180ct 2 boxes of kleenex 180ct Same with restaurants SyscoRestaurant Depot and others have integrations into inventory systems you can configure and the same thing will happen In both situations beyond historical data there are benefits to not having to manually enter data human error automated ordering inventory control etc You can get a SaaS inventory system for about 50month or you can run your own locally but most POS systems handle as part of their software so I can imagine you havent upgraded your POS in a while either,m2un6uj,4.0,1hhqa0h
comment,m2zlcyk,Mayor__Defacto,,1,2024-12-20 14:50:32,,,,Someone still has to encode the RFID tags Youre just moving the data entry When youre in a small setup theres less value in a system like that because product isnt moving around so much It goes from production to bottling to cases cases get labeled and then from there its to customer Production data must be stored on paper for legal reasons,m2zkwpk,5.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m3h3ya4,GhostDan,,1,2024-12-23 18:42:10,,,,UPC s are set by the manufacturer Theres one UPC per itemsizeflavor 99 times out of 100 How do I know Ive managed thousands of items in inventory using the same exact method That was the entire process The company making the item or the distributor sent me the item it had a UPC code yes already registered in the inventory system UPC code 00000822 is a hammer for example When an item came in that didnt have a RFID tag already I grabbed one from our stash quite a few of our items already had RFID tags because despite your idea that this is super duper difficult most major companies were using them or 510 years ago doing a proof of concept about their use I scanned the UPC code printed on the item then I scanned the RFID tag Done If the item already had RFIDs a LOT of the time I just had to release the batch in the system Weve received shipment 1097321 20 hammers 20 RFID tags associated with the hammers even easier Yes Someone somewhere ONCE had to type in UPC 0923476 are Red 12 Hammers thats pretty standard for any retail inventory system and its typically someone at corporate unless you are a very small business,m3fsdnb,8.0,1hhqa0h
comment,m3hb6v2,Mayor__Defacto,,1,2024-12-23 19:22:12,,,,Problem Im the manufacturer If I was a retailer yes absolutely makes sense Im not the retailer I have to encode the data Lol Each batch has different attributes to track so I cant just make a single barcode and slap it on a box Each box corresponds to a batch number written on a label on the box and each batch number has certain attributes Bottling ABV date of start various other things that have to be tracked and so on So Id need a software that lets me create a centralized database where I can print off a unique code for each batch to link it back to the database where I store the information Its not ultimately much different from what I currently do which is have a binder with each batchs information and label each case with the batch number and the contents with bottle numbers and batch numbers for redundancy If I need to go back to it I just search through using the batch number Rather than buying a printer to print off precoded labels that I have to make up for each case I can just write it on a blank label on the case Since its the same amount of work either way why bother paying an extra 50 a month,m3h3ya4,9.0,1hhqa0h
comment,m3vetw1,GhostDan,,1,2024-12-26 13:33:22,,,,So you make 50k of an item and you think you need to encode each one Why And a single barcode slapped on a box is literally how retail works Grab 20 cases of anything same flavor and size same barcode with some exceptions like between states where one might have bottle redemption and one might not Im guessing you just dont know how this all works and want to make it seem much more complicated than it is Ive been in manufacturing and in retail I can guarantee you one of if not the least complicated processes is slapping a UPC on a million something once its been registered once When I sent something out in a batch its not going to say This UPC belong to this RFID chip its going to say Item 42342 with UPC 2134324 has RFID chips 238747238801,m3hb6v2,10.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m433yzj,GhostDan,,1,2024-12-27 20:26:49,,,,Plenty of businesses work without RFID and the government isnt going after them If you did have to track them you wouldnt be tracking via RFID tag numbers either youd be tracking them via serial number which on more complicated excise forms that do require individual tracking use that as an identifier You are however tracking them in inventory by I have 40 the register just showed we bought one by scanning the UPC now I have 39 I got a shipment with a batch of 10 now I have 49 some smart systems like Amazons stores you dont even need the UPC to scan it goes I have 40 of them Someone just walked out with a RFID assigned to this Im going to ignore further posts because at this point you are just making stuff up and you are boring me If you are manually writing down all this information for tracking well you do you Most professional companies automate it,m3vile5,12.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m31bxfy,LetterBoxSnatch,,1,2024-12-20 20:42:57,,,,Fundamental shift in accounting for things In double entry you cannot have a field without also having a corresponding field All values must eventually account to 0 Total game changer because it created a proof of exchange that could be traced back to any arbitrary transaction removing a lot of potential for fraud both internally and with external parties If an account owes something theres a corresponding entry where somebody gained something and if somebody gained something theres a corresponding entry where somebody gave something Not just a money thing but for the accounting of anything changed trade as we know it,m2uq0r9,3.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m2tqt7f,ergobearsgo,,-1,2024-12-19 14:23:12,,,,I agree with this completely People dont realize how bad tech debt has become across the board Instead of taking incremental steps towards improvement people or businesses will let a running system decay for a decade or longer and then be caught completely on the back foot when it does eventually fail Now they arent two steps away from getting back to where they should be theyre miles away Suddenly the system that didnt deserve any attention for years and years is costing the company ten times its worth to be offline and will cost a hundred times as much to get replaced as no one ever laid out an upgrade path and schedule Obviously this is less applicable to an independent bakery but I see this at the enterprise level at multiple billion dollar global companies and they never learn after their own complacency bites them in the ass day after day,m2t2en6,2.0,1hhqa0h

comment,m2um869,kindall,,1,2024-12-19 17:17:46,,,,I worked at Sears in the mid 80s and a C64 had only slightly less horse power than the register I used there an NCR 2152 which was powered by an 8086 Now that I look the specs it Im surprised they needed a processor even that powerful especially because the system was hobbled by some slowass printers three on each register Fun fact due to the slow printers the machine had a monster typeahead buffer I could enter most of a small order by the time the register got done printing the receipts header,m2tomrl,1.0,1hhqa0h
comment,m2uy0xl,thisischemistry,,1,2024-12-19 18:30:26,,,,They probably just used it because it was a massproduced processor and system not because they needed the computing power Really all a register needs is a limited display keyboard printer and some simple math functions Sure you could use more like connecting to inventorycontrol systems and such but even that can be done with pretty minimal hardware,m2um869,2.0,1hhqa0h
