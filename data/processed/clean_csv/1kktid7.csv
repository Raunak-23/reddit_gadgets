comment,mrx87bj,pizoisoned,,80,2025-05-12 14:56:22,,,,Im having a hard time imagining that the longer diedie path for PCIe lanes 2124 is the only factor resulting in around 15 degradation in performance That said I am not an expert on silicon design so I certainly wont say its impossible There are a few cases where this could be a big deal for a user Someone who is working with large data files could take a noticeable hit to performance with this issue which could include gaming and professional workflows like CAD and video editing The average desktop user will probably notice nothing but this is yet another black mark on Intel at a time where AMD is making pretty solid inroads not only in gaming and server spaces but even in commercial desktops and workstations Its not a great look,,0.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxwijr,Relevant-Doctor187,,50,2025-05-12 16:55:59,,,,Wires have to take intricate routes through a motherboard because theyre supposed to end up the same length for timing purposes There is little to no tolerance on this and intel had to know this problem was there before production I left intel the last time they released a new CPU then changed sockets a few months later All the issues theyve had since further validated me leaving that platform,mrx87bj,1.0,1kktid7
comment,mrypyrg,pmjm,,8,2025-05-12 19:19:44,,,,I left intel the last time they released a new CPU then changed sockets a few months later I did this and then AMD bit me with Theadripper 3000 When there is a duopoly you get kinda screwed either way It makes you wonder how the current discrepancy between AMDIntel performance will eventually change Will Intel improve or will AMD get shittier,mrxwijr,2.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzbfdf,Relevant-Doctor187,,15,2025-05-12 21:07:25,,,,Threadripper is a workstationserver thing Typically you buy once a server and use it for 3 years and buy new That environment I could care less about sockets,mrypyrg,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzldke,pmjm,,5,2025-05-12 21:59:21,,,,Yes but AMD explicitly promised there would be more than one generation on that socket That was a key reason I bought into it They lied,mrzbfdf,4.0,1kktid7
comment,mryum0l,rrtk77,,7,2025-05-12 19:43:08,,,,It makes you wonder how the current discrepancy between AMDIntel performance will eventually change Will Intel improve or will AMD get shittier This is a constant ebb and flow battle Remember that AMD and Intel are competitors essentially in name only The real change is going to be ARM finally hitting consumer desktop viability Its very closethe chips are there the Apple M series are all ARM cloud servers are all moving to ARM chips and it basically just requires either a larger adoption of Linux Ubuntu is basically completely ARM compatible Nvidia is doing lots of work to have ready ARM drivers andor Microsoft finally convincing third parties to write ARM drivers for Windows Large adoption of Linux may seem farfetched but with the rise of handhelds putting Linux in the hands of lots of people that doesnt seem like a pipe dream anymore Because x86 is proprietary only AMD and Intel can make desktop chips But if ARM becomes viable for desktops then a lot of chip manufacturers will start entering the space because why not,mrypyrg,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrz580l,Emu1981,,16,2025-05-12 20:36:03,,,,Because x86 is proprietary only AMD and Intel can make desktop chips There are 4 companies with x86 licenses you forgot Via Technologies and DMP Electronics but only AMD and Intel make x64 chips,mryum0l,4.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzaaq3,namisysd,,11,2025-05-12 21:01:39,,,,ARM is also proprietary ARM controls who can manufacture thier architecture dont expect a change in behavior if ARM becomes more dominant in the consumer market and thats a big if considering outside of the Apple implementation of ARM it has been a massive flop outside of the phone and embedded space,mryum0l,4.0,1kktid7

comment,mry1xt7,pizoisoned,,5,2025-05-12 17:22:14,,,,Many years ago I had a Phenom X4 9550 that was such a garbage CPU that I jumped to Intel and never looked back Until my 14th gen i9 selfdestructed Intel replaced it but I wasnt really thrilled with it to begin with given how power hungry and how hot it ran and the fact that they were prone to failure was the last straw I jumped to the red team and Ive been pretty pleased overall with it So I figure Ill stay this course for a while since it seems like Intel is asleep at the wheel,mrxwijr,2.0,1kktid7
comment,ms02m5s,Noshamina,,2,2025-05-12 23:36:00,,,,They both cost pretty much the same and the AMD company is not foreign to problems People just root for them like teams at this point and find whatever they like in them and root for them and boo the others Both companies offer stuff at every single tier at competitive prices and competitive performance No one would ever be able to tell in a real life workplace a few millisecond difference in completing something or getting 5 more frames per second in some game,mrxwijr,2.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzv99g,raynorelyp,,1,2025-05-12 22:54:53,,,,That Im not saying youre wrong but that doesnt sound right From my days in VLSI the clock frequency is supposed to be as close as youre comfortable to the length of the longest circuit times the speed of light,mrxwijr,2.0,1kktid7
comment,ms4ba69,_______uwu_________,,4,2025-05-13 16:52:13,,,,which could include gaming and professional workflows like CAD and video editing Im having a hard time seeing how gaming would be impacted by storage speeds faster than pcie 4 allows Virtually no one is using pcie 5 SSDs in the consumer sector This is a massive nothingburger for virtually everyone,mrx87bj,1.0,1kktid7

comment,mrxzk98,tastyratz,,21,2025-05-12 17:10:49,,,,PCIE gains are almost never because consumers actually need all that bandwidth in x16 form The big benefits are the ability to save electricitybattery by having the same things run on less lanes and the ability to support faster speeds on a single lane I am looking at you forever majority 1GBE ethernet baseline Most graphics cards these days see almost no performance hit dropping to pcie 50 x8 Other than benchmark SSDs this sounds like an on paper impact more than a realized one to me Im all for reasons AMD can thrive but Im not sure if this will translate to a user disadvantage,,0.0,1kktid7
comment,mryqk2g,bjodah,,4,2025-05-12 19:22:43,,,,Well if you try to do LLM inference with weights offloaded to NVMe SSD then bandwidth is everything I can run Metas Maverick model on my AMD 7950X with 64 GB RAM but my WD SN850X is too slow for this to be practical 2 tokens per second Buying faster NVMe drives I think corsairs fastest can saturate 4x PCIe gen 5 is tempting but then I would want the absolute full bandwidth,mrxzk98,1.0,1kktid7
comment,mryubc8,tastyratz,,14,2025-05-12 19:41:39,,,,This to me is only proving an edge case where veeeeeeeeeery specific scenarios result in a possibly measurable impact on performance which is my point Not that it cant mean something just that for probably 90 of people it wont really change fps level loading time browser and desktop speed etc,mryqk2g,2.0,1kktid7
comment,mrz4l1j,bjodah,,4,2025-05-12 20:32:50,,,,Sure youre right the number is probably even higher than 90 but this is at least a new kind of use case thats on the rise,mryubc8,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrza24d,tastyratz,,5,2025-05-12 21:00:25,,,,but this is at least a new kind of use case thats on the rise There could be dozens of you even Seriously though I wont say it isnt a rising use case but outside of enterprise equipment Im going to say its likely the sub 1 market here and of those influenced by these benchmarks in their outcome a small fraction of that,mrz4l1j,4.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzakby,UnethicalExperiments,,2,2025-05-12 21:03:01,,,,I cant get enough bandwidth for this Bifurcating the slots in x4x4x4x4 config on pci e 45 is fantastic Doing it on pcie 30 not so great if running things in parallel With nvtop I can watch it cycle round robin style since there simply isnt enough bandwidth on 30 bus to handle it Oh ya and lots of nvme drives TRX40 on Alibaba has come down enough to make it fairly inexpensive to build dense nodes without sacrificing performance,mryqk2g,2.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzn3th,bjodah,,1,2025-05-12 22:08:48,,,,Interesting Ive been eyeing threadripper platforms from china but I it looks like second hand market has many more Epyc systems available so next build will probably be an Epyc build with lots of memory channels I searched for TR cpus on alibaba some offer sounded too good to be true what have been your experience,mrzakby,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrzrsdz,UnethicalExperiments,,2,2025-05-12 22:35:05,,,,Ive got a couple of motherboards enroute I can update later on I went with threadripper for clock speed where the cheaper epycs seem to be lacking but im trading off PCIE lanes but for my build plans the 64 is more than enough I did score a pile of bnib arc a380s for 140 cad for another project im working Its a lot easier to sort through sellers here to vet legit ones pricing tends to be inline with what I could refurb domestically but about 20 cheaper Some sellers are really motivated to sell older gear so they are willing to cut a deal which through this process you further vet your purchase If you plan on purchasing a lot id suggest looking into a broker as here domestic shippers ups fedex bend you over for import charges on top of what you might pay even without it I find it be a lot cheaper since people here still want retail for their 2nd hardware thats covered in 3 years of people and pets,mrzn3th,4.0,1kktid7

comment,mryw29q,snakeoilHero,,2,2025-05-12 19:50:24,,,,Nah its all old tech problems Once upon a time Intel would slap dual cores together and call them Quads Limitations like FSB and core coherency were not solved yet Early quad core CPUs were janky Then AMD tried to convince us half cores were cores to compete with Hyperthreading core counts Those CPUs went backwards in performance from Thuban 6 cores to Bulldozer 8 cores 4 cores with tricks IMO Thus at the time 6 old cores would beat 8 new cores all from AMD Helps explain how we got to heterogeneous CPU designs of various core size and counts Why would you need to know SDRAM to RDRAM to DDR RAM You dont anymore Point is the big quad core problems predate Ryzen by a bit,mryl8kl,6.0,1kktid7
comment,mryyaky,eestionreddit,,2,2025-05-12 20:01:30,,,,Ah I was talking moreso about the stagnation in consumer cpu development that occured in the earlymid 2010s,mryw29q,7.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxjsnt,NorysStorys,,15,2025-05-12 15:53:18,,,,They were the go to not because they were good in as much as nothing competed AMD finally figured out how to surpass them and Intel still thinks they are owed the market,mrxe5qr,2.0,1kktid7

comment,mrxo33p,diuturnal,,2,2025-05-12 16:14:32,,,,Intel still thinks were wrong for wanting something smaller than 14nm Its why they tried to shove it into 12th gen cpus,mrxjsnt,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mry6gdi,nooneisback,,5,2025-05-12 17:43:46,,,,Ryzen also has security issues the difference is that they are actively working to discover host an easily accessible and detailed list on their site and fix the ones they could or provide steps to solve them if youre OK with losing performancefeatures Intel just twirls its finger up its bum until enough people start yelling Then release a fix they hail as the new Messiah of software but never mention its effect on performance that can be about as bad as the vulnerability itself Intel CPUs only exist because they had exclusivity deals for laptops and OEMs since nobody thought AMD would make a comeback,mrxe5qr,2.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxgsfo,tylerderped,,-3,2025-05-12 15:38:47,,,,intel has been terrible for years And yet people keep buying them for some reason And OEMs keep buying them too Often without providing other options,mrx0wce,1.0,1kktid7

comment,mrzbxx2,namisysd,,0,2025-05-12 21:10:04,,,,Momentum in supply chains and design workflows are hard to shift rapidly youll never see sudden shift in market share without some insane market and supply chain instability OEMs like Dell are not going to be profitable with sudden shifts in thier supply chains and desing cycles therefore they are not going to rapidly shift from one supplier to another with good reason AMD is steadily taking market share from intel YoY this is a healthy and expected way for market dominance to improve,mrxgsfo,2.0,1kktid7

comment,mrx6q0y,aitorbk,,17,2025-05-12 14:49:00,,,,It would be an issue for me as latency affects compilation time But most people arent compiling large projects or compiling at all And it being latency rather than throughout makes it worse Again light computer users wont notice the performance difference between a pcie2 drive vs a pcie5,mrx5c72,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxa0cu,Moscato359,,15,2025-05-12 15:05:25,,,,It matters for people where pcie5 speeds matter mainly large video editing,mrx5c72,3.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxjclo,aitorbk,,-5,2025-05-12 15:51:06,,,,Would it I thought the main issue was processing the video one you have at least pcie3 not the drive throughput at least if you do it locally server wise absolutely does matter I am asking because this is an educated guess I dont know,mrxa0cu,4.0,1kktid7
comment,mrxob5n,Moscato359,,0,2025-05-12 16:15:37,,,,So there are generally 2 stages to video editing Stage 1 Planning the edits You can use a big GPU to offload this stage You arent actually making any final video but as you work your GPU is doing big work You render stuff as you go With a 5090 this is really fast and can strain your drive This is actually the majority of the human time Stage 2 Making the final version This is generally done on CPU because GPU makes video quality reductions The CPU will never be fast enough to strain the drive This is basically the final step,mrxjclo,5.0,1kktid7
comment,mry3aom,kazuviking,,0,2025-05-12 17:28:46,,,,Lets just ignore the fact that a gen5 drive can only maintain that speed for 30 ish seconds when empty and after that it drops to 3GBps or way less And lets not forget that the best gen5 drive can only do around 5GBps reading which is still under the 68GBps limited speed which you think affects the drives speed Unless you run raid 0 there is ZERO chance you noticing it See why i said its a nonexistent issue with real world performance When there is no drive in existence that can reach it,mrxob5n,6.0,1kktid7
comment,mrznbld,Moscato359,,3,2025-05-12 22:10:00,,,,Your numbers seem to ignore the crucial t705 It gets 18 seconds of 12GBs and then it drops to 4GBs consistent write 12 4 18 is 144GB of excess written prior to reaching steady state write speeds As for reads it consistently hits 67GBs But basically every other drive out there is miserable,mry3aom,7.0,1kktid7
