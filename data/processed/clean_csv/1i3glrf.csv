comment,m7molgi,chrisdh79,,174,2025-01-17 14:10:28,,,,From the article The Apple Watch has been credited with saving another life with a man crediting the device for summoning help after his car crashed leaving him submerged upside down in a pool On December 16 Brent Hill of Easthampton MA was driving his car home but felt nauseous behind the wheel While he doesnt remember what happened next due to blacking out his Apple Watch stepped in to help in the following moments Camera footage from a neighbor shows Hills car accelerating into their garage and into the neighbors swimming pool landing upside down reports WesternMassNews It is assumed that Hills weight shifted after he blacked out placing more weight on the accelerator I didnt know any of this was going on Hill admits When I saw the footage of my car careening down the street and crashing I was shocked because of how fast I was going The next memory Hill has of the misadventure is regaining consciousness thanks to a small voice speaking to him Apple Watch Crash Detection called emergency services automatically and an operator was trying to speak to him If emergency services had not contacted me through that watch and just coached me through that theres no way I wouldve got out of there he adds Within minutes responders arrived to rescue him He could barely hear any of the people outside the car but the Apple Watch voice helped him,,0.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7nl7c8,KyberKrystalParty,,44,2025-01-17 16:55:43,,,,Thank you for this comment Ill piggyback here and just ask if anyone can explain how the watch works to do all of this I couldnt imagine the battery would last long enough to even be there for me at the end of a work day,m7molgi,1.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7nol2r,lolhi1122,,72,2025-01-17 17:12:01,,,,Battery life is like 1820 hours with normal use cellular watch so it can work independently of a phone it can detect when your driving and go into an extreme slowdown so likely a crash it will first prompt you if you need 911 if you dont respond it will auto dial they did have an issue with people on roller coasters were causing it to trigger the 911 call I believe they made a fix for that,m7nl7c8,2.0,1i3glrf

comment,m7po7yl,TheDeadTyrant,,5,2025-01-17 23:07:46,,,,When my now wife and I were just starting out dating she had her watch or phone on top of a table on the pontoon boat we took out on the river Wild blew it over and unbeknownst to us texted her emergency contacts her location and that she might be in trouble The location showed the middle of a river Needless to see when she checked her phone a few hours later with some very worried text messages Fun way to tell your family youre dating someone haha,m7nox18,4.0,1i3glrf

comment,m7p2ddm,djk29a_,,5,2025-01-17 21:14:11,,,,For a while people riding roller coasters were accidentally calling 911 I believe emergency services get some sort of contextual data when notified via an Apple Watch so they know what to look for Im sure theres been software improvements to check for known coasters and other thrill rides where this kind of rapid movement and jerking around is expected,m7nox18,4.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7qr28d,Dfiggsmeister,,7,2025-01-18 02:57:44,,,,It also notifies your emergency contact list and sends out an alert that something is wrong with you I learned that one the hard way,m7nol2r,3.0,1i3glrf

comment,m7npnhk,TheTrueReligon,,13,2025-01-17 17:17:15,,,,From my understanding the watches and some iPhones have an accelerometer that detects when theres been a sudden stop in motion such as someone falling or crashing their car and pops up a notification that a fall or crash has been detected For crashes I believe it differentiates that from falling based on GPS movement If you dont clear the notification letting it know youre all good then it will automatically call emergency services,m7nl7c8,2.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7onu1e,Candle1ight,,3,2025-01-17 20:01:41,,,,Android has a similar feature also will give your emergency contacts info like where you are or if youve called 911 Since gravity is a constant it should be pretty easy for them to differentiate a drop basically see if the sudden stop was after a constant acceleration of 98ms or not,m7npnhk,3.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7qt95y,Forte69,,1,2025-01-18 03:11:52,,,,But if you fall over and hit your head youre still falling at 98ms,m7onu1e,4.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7sitjc,BlahBlahBlackCheap,,1,2025-01-18 12:26:54,,,,Interesting I have had it fall detect for me after taking a spill off a step ladder but not when I dropped the watch and it bounced off the coffee table I guess it knows or takes into account it its being worn or not,m7npnhk,3.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7o22i2,reddit455,,6,2025-01-17 18:16:35,,,,almost no battery is required to listen to accelerometers Manage Fall Detection on Apple Watch Turn Crash Detection on or off bike helmets can give your location in the event of a crash Your Pixel Watch 2 is ready to help when you crash your bike or wreck your car,m7nl7c8,2.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7ntion,itsalongwalkhome,,3,2025-01-17 17:35:51,,,,The watches have the ability to underclock or possibly switch to a low power processor themselves when not in use so that only very basic functionality is running sensor events time waiting for signal from phone When it detects an event it takes up and actually does the processing it needs to,m7nl7c8,2.0,1i3glrf

comment,m7od17u,BeckyLouBob,,28,2025-01-17 19:09:02,,,,I took a hard fall and was briefly knocked out When I came to a voice on my Apple Watch said this is EMS do need assistance I answered that I fell and was bleeding An ambulance showed up a few minutes later My location was known While the EMS guy was putting a compression bandage on my forehead he said your watch is talking to you My Watch contacted my husband and he was patched thru I told him what happened and I was carted off to the ER Apparently I set him up as my emergency contact when I got the watch I was really grateful I had this watch on The only downside is if I bump my arm on something hard it will vibrate and ask if I need 911 It gives a certain amount of time before it calls 911 so you have to press the Im OK prompt,,0.0,1i3glrf
comment,m7qd9ux,FD4L,,15,2025-01-18 01:32:16,,,,This is good technology but as a career firefighter whos stationed near a highway we get false reports all the time from iphones that slide off dashboards and bounce off the floors of cars So if you have an iPhone please secure it while its in your car or if it does go flying and bounce off something try to cancel the crash report if its possible and safe to do so,,0.0,1i3glrf

comment,m7nh6xo,Pineapple_Assrape,,15,2025-01-17 16:36:42,,,,Yeah can it Does it detect a crash and call local emergency services and patch through the voice Or is it only SOS stuff for hiking I googled and I couldnt readily find any occurrences Garmin itself has a saved by garmin page where theres a couple of articles but it all sounds like SOS calls from people lost in the outdoors which isnt really the same thing at all,m7nehdd,1.0,1i3glrf
