comment,m5wn24g,wicktus,,12,2025-01-07 17:52:11,,,,Frankly i am waiting for RDNA4 and AI upscaling FSR4 to get in those handhelds before considering getting one I suspect Valve is working on a custom RDNA 4 SoC with AMD I dont see them refreshing SD1 with Z2 wouldnt make sense,,0.0,1hvra7y
comment,m60o6kp,MysteriousDesk3,,7,2025-01-08 08:02:48,,,,I think the more powerful they make these the less devs will optimise their games and up the graphical intensity thats exactly the way its always been for desktop GPUs If you want to game on the go just get one My Legion GO absolutely kicks ass getting 60fps on an older but gorgeous title like Death Stranding at 800p is possible especially if youre running BazziteSteamOS,m5wn24g,1.0,1hvra7y
comment,m5zqqzp,EVMad,,2,2025-01-08 03:32:09,,,,The current Steam Deck is very capable I played through Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on mine and it was a fine experience With the size of the screen even low settings still looked great and I capped the frame rate to 30fps which kept things smooth On a small screen you would be amazed how well 30fps plays so I cap most of my games at that,m5wn24g,1.0,1hvra7y
comment,m61m61a,wicktus,,0,2025-01-08 13:21:02,,,,Exactly SD 1 is working just fine and can totally stay relevant until a custom rdna 4 SoC is mass produced Indiana jones fantazio elden ring Only saw complaints around dragons dogma 2 and maybe MH wilds but thats on the RE engine issue,m5zqqzp,2.0,1hvra7y
comment,m5zvung,markianw999,,-10,2025-01-08 04:05:03,,,,Stop trying to make 30 fps aceptablelol its not 2002,m5zqqzp,2.0,1hvra7y
comment,m6046tp,EVMad,,7,2025-01-08 05:03:45,,,,Its very acceptable on a small OLED screen due to the small size Consoles still often have 30fps options its really not that bad,m5zvung,3.0,1hvra7y
comment,m6706h1,blackburnduck,,1,2025-01-09 08:07:21,,,,New switch patent includes some different upscale models including model upscaling and filesize but the crux of the problem is that devs got lazy as f Compare Crysis Mirrors Edge battlefield 2042 or even the modern red dead 2 Star wars battlegrounds 2 with new games like star wars outlaws FF 7 rebirth silent hill remake how come that we need massive gpus for games that only look marginally better or even downright uglier than things released 5 10y ago Everything is now a mishmash of TA artifacts while nintendo gave us Tears of the Kingom and Xenoblade 3 on a bloddy tegra that is a mobile chip from 2015 Meanwhile my 3080 ti struggles with jedi survivor we need player mods to make elden ring stable and everything now needs dlss to hit stable frames at 60fps for games that dont really look that good,,0.0,1hvra7y
comment,m6j61w4,SPARTAN1666,,1,2025-01-11 05:02:40,,,,Waiting for a Day when the chip can directly run Cyberpunk at HighUltra at 1080p 60FPS without all the AI enhancements,,0.0,1hvra7y
