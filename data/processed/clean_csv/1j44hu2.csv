comment,mg6mv1x,Binge_Gaming,,13,2025-03-05 17:56:55,,,,I worked in refurbished cell phones and the flips and folds are notorious for the LCD breaking where the fold is in the middle At first there are small air bubbles then a noticeable crease forms then the pixels start to fail and eventually the crease becomes completely dead pixels and the digitizer for one side of the phone stops functioning altogether Terrible phones,mg6ftlc,2.0,1j44hu2
comment,mg6pynb,LogJamminWithTheBros,,5,2025-03-05 18:11:19,,,,Are they taking the screen protector off or continuing to fold them and stress the panel lol Ive had my fold 5 for 2 years nearly and had zero issues,mg6mv1x,3.0,1j44hu2
comment,mg6tset,Binge_Gaming,,4,2025-03-05 18:29:02,,,,No the screen protector on them arent removable and its very apparent youre doing something wrong if you were to try and remove them I dont have a ton of photos but heres the typical progression here,mg6pynb,4.0,1j44hu2
comment,mg6v4ot,LogJamminWithTheBros,,3,2025-03-05 18:35:08,,,,Not sure on earlier phones but the flip 4 and above you can remove the screen protectors If you leave them on and they bubble and you continue to open and close the phone the stress from the uneven weight distribution screws up the screen and cracks it People with issues are going to be vocal about complaints And I know the fold 4 had a hinge issue that broke screens But as I said I have the fold 5 and have used it for nearly 2 years with no screen issues,mg6tset,5.0,1j44hu2
comment,mg6xdb1,Binge_Gaming,,2,2025-03-05 18:45:23,,,,I misunderstood there is the basic protector on them I thought you were talking about the visible layer that looks like a protector on the LCDs that isnt a protector My buddy also has a Fold5 with no issues but I rarely see him actually open it up for the big screen To me theyre still gimmicky the Ultras are still large and have great hardware its all a matter of preference though,mg6v4ot,6.0,1j44hu2

comment,mg7htk3,Zvenigora,,0,2025-03-05 20:20:33,,,,Even their nonstretching folding screens tend to fall apart quickly in everyday use in my experience It is difficult to believe that making them stretchable will improve things,,0.0,1j44hu2
