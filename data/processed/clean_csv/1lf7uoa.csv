post,1lf7uoa,diacewrb,Samsung could soon put some Galaxy Watch features behind a paywall,1064,2025-06-19 10:55:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1lf7uoa/samsung_could_soon_put_some_galaxy_watch_features/,188.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mym1h8z,TwistingEcho,,750,2025-06-19 11:09:47,,,,Everytime basic features get pay walled a not insignificant number of people turn away from the brand Drives prices up so profits must come from the pool of customers still paying Also this is shit,,0.0,1lf7uoa
comment,myo5nc6,fuqdisshite,,86,2025-06-19 17:59:45,,,,my wife got me Atari 50 for the Switch for Fathers Day i put it in and went flipping through the collection of games and there are multiple games that are greyed out and need to be purchased what the fuck like i dont mind that there is DLC but the way the games are already showing on the menu is just dumb it makes you feel like completing the set and is a shitty way to do it,mym1h8z,1.0,1lf7uoa
comment,myol3cu,matsis01,,57,2025-06-19 19:22:14,,,,Just looked up the description for that game on the Nintendo Store A complete package for any video game fan,myo5nc6,2.0,1lf7uoa

comment,myts0a8,ForTheBread,,-4,2025-06-20 15:26:59,,,,It looks like its expansion content that released 2 years after the initial release At least from what Im seeing on Steam I dont see an issue with that if its true Edit checked on the eshop and yeah its expansion content released years after release I dont see how this is worth getting angry over,myoo5rq,4.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mytw4an,fuqdisshite,,1,2025-06-20 15:46:36,,,,if it released later then why is it greyed out on my console physical edition to be clear when i put my physical chip that we paid retail for i was required to download an update for before i could play it does that not make sense if the game was complete when i bought it and the DLC was up to me to purchase then why am i required to look at the games i did not agree to pay for every time i turn the game on i think you are missing the entire point,myts0a8,5.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mytxcmk,ForTheBread,,0,2025-06-20 15:52:27,,,,I do get your point Im just pointing out that it looks like it might be DLC content Plenty of games advertise their DLC within their games I dont really see any harm in it personally You had to download an update likely cause of some update for the game Not sure what relevance that has to do with anything Plenty of physical games have updates Generally a good thing cause if the disc had a bug or something its good to fix that bug You say chip too which confuses me It looks youre playing on an ultrawide Does the Switch Im assuming Switch cause thats the only chiplike game system I know of support ultrawide,mytw4an,6.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mytyupl,fuqdisshite,,-1,2025-06-20 15:59:42,,,,well the original comment was that I do find that shitty if a 10 year old was handed the game and then when he put it in and jumped through the hoops with the Day One Supplement he sees all the new games but a handful are greyed out and asking for more money wouldnt that be a bit disappointing like hey heres a box of LEGO go ahead and build it but you have to download the instructions first AND when you download the instructions you will see 7 distinct pieces that the company chose to add years later and they will remind you EVERY SINGLE TIME you play with the LEGO that you need to spend more to complete your set with how digital downloads work there is exactly zero reason that the DLC has to be visible when i turn my game on it is a petty cash grab that uses shame and FOMO to get that extra 13 like i said we have no issue buying the new games the issue is with forcing the games on to my dashboard for no reason other than reminding me i have not bought them yet that is shitty,mytxcmk,7.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mytza47,ForTheBread,,1,2025-06-20 16:01:48,,,,Idk why you are mentioning day one DLC I didnt mention that Yeah day one DLC sucks You can just ignore it I dont see the harm The game updating years later with extra optional content is pretty nice If they didnt advertise it idk if Id ever have noticed personally,mytyupl,8.0,1lf7uoa

comment,mytgfl9,gbonic,,1,2025-06-20 14:31:04,,,,Yeah its this The entire thing felt like a nice complete package on release While the way they integrated the DLC into the full release is really nice I wish theyd not integrated it like that for people who HAVENT bought the DLC The way its designed makes you feel like youre missing an integral part of the whole instead of optional DLC that wasnt originally part of the package Feels shitty to new users instead of feeling like bonus content as it does to me having had it since launch,myskbjk,3.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mysl5ot,fuqdisshite,,0,2025-06-20 11:27:29,,,,19 games each on the two different DLC 100 on the initial release my wife paid 30ish for the physical games set and they want 799 each for the two different downloads or 1399 for both sope 30c a game for the initial release and then 36c a game if you purchase the bundled DLC the new games are nothing special either,myskbjk,3.0,1lf7uoa

comment,mysjqo6,fuqdisshite,,3,2025-06-20 11:16:52,,,,yup i was really digging the look and feel of the collection was fine with Day One for me Updates knew they had DLC fine with that but then i go flipping through the games knowing four would be greyed out as unlockable but then started noticing the other games that were greyed out too hmm whats this clicks game GIVE ME MORE FUCKING MONEY really shitty way to guilt people in to spending another 15 why not just sell the game for 45 instead of 30 and many of us older gamers would have agreed with no issue i buy 2 to 3 games a year both physical and digital my budget isnt super heavy but we like to change it up sometimes having to be guilt tripped in to spending 50 more is far worse than just pricing the game 50 higher,mysgsyf,3.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mysm6nr,None,,2,2025-06-20 11:35:00,,,,Yeah and its not like its actual work for them Theyre basically flipping a 0 to a 1 and then letting you access a 50 year old ROM Pretty lame,mysjqo6,4.0,1lf7uoa

comment,mymkts9,kerbaal,,52,2025-06-19 13:16:14,,,,meh I really like my Galaxy Watch 3 I bought it without ever having owned a samsung phone because it looked like the best smart watch on the market Mostly because I didnt want a lot of crazy features and apps I just wanted the heart monitor and for it to be an auxiliary notification for my phone maybe use it for presence detection Honestly getting older and thinking a heart monitor was a good idea was my only reason for wanting to go back to allowing a device on my wrist I stopped wearing a watch when I started carrying a cell phone I wanted something simple That said pretty sure I wouldnt have bought another samsung anyway now its off the table,mym1sft,2.0,1lf7uoa

comment,mymqcf6,kerbaal,,10,2025-06-19 13:47:07,,,,The GW3 I am using is only 4 years old and the battery still can make it multiple days on a single charge Unless some other annoyance pops up first I am unlikely to think of upgrading for another 4 years when the battery just doesnt have more than a day and a half or so at that point I will likely spend about 30 seconds considering the possibility of sourcing a lithium polymer cell to replace it myself and then buying a new watch edit thinking a bit more my wife and I got the same watch but she got the smaller one with a smaller battery I will likely actually upgrade sooner when hers stops being viable just so we can stay in sync and I am not supporting two different technologies,mymno7u,4.0,1lf7uoa

comment,myntrwi,Lawdie123,,4,2025-06-19 17:00:43,,,,The problem is all the brand locking certain features not working if your using a different brand to the phone its connected to I would love to use an Apple Watch for example but its locked the Apple eco system half the Samsung watch features are locked to Samsung phones,mym1sft,2.0,1lf7uoa
comment,myn4x8l,axefjord,,11,2025-06-19 15:00:31,,,,After having owned the Garmin Venu 1 and Venu 2 I just converted to the Samsung GW6 some days ago The GW6 is much faster better interface is more customizeable and have loads of features shortcuts gestures apps etc Now the Garmin Venu 2 more expensive has better battery life and probably better trainingfeatures The body battery function was reliable for me But thats it The daytoday smart features are shit The google assistant stopped working half a year ago and even when it worked most of the time it took like 610 seconds to active No useful apps the flashlight was weak and hidden in the training menu Even the alarms were not reliable And nothing synced with the phone Not alarms not silent mode not even the phone contacts You had to choose a few contacts to import that you could call from the watch,mym1sft,2.0,1lf7uoa
comment,myq7pyc,materialvoid,,2,2025-06-20 00:30:28,,,,To be fair some aspects would be better those are watches from 2019 and 2021 compared to 2023 for the GW6 A fairer comparison might be the Venu 3 That said it sounds like you needed a smartwatch more so than a fitness focused one and thats totally fair As a counterpoint I was in the smartwatch ecosystem earlier with the GW3 then AW6 AW SE2 Garmin 255 AW9 then back to my 255 I found I wasnt using any of the smartwatch features even though it was cool for a while and I found most smartwatches werent really good at showing comprehensive health like Garmin does mind you its not perfect and Im wary after they announced a paywall too ugh Someone needs to make a smartwatch that can legit last a week I have no doubt that Android and Apple health will get better but I dont feel that theyre there yet,myn4x8l,3.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mys8tqr,axefjord,,3,2025-06-20 09:44:06,,,,I got the Venu 2 plus 2022 It has pricetag of about 350400 with some offers going down to 250300 The Venu 3 is MUCH more expensive at around 500 around here with few options of getting it for less The galaxy watch 6 is from 2023 costs around 250300 here and can often be found be bought newinbox for 150 as it is bundles with phones Therefore I would say the venu2 plus should be able to be compared to the GW6 And yes you are right that I use the smart functions more than the health features But mainly I just use the assistant to make timers and notifications to myself This really helps during hectic days with many work and family activities This functionality was advertised for the venu 2 plus but Garmin hasnt even bothered to maintain that basic functionalty,myq7pyc,4.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mywymfy,materialvoid,,1,2025-06-21 01:26:29,,,,Yeah thats totally fair Canada here and the prices are robbery I only got the 255 through points reducing the price and it was an older model Smartwatch focus features youll get more power from a Samsungapple price equivalent,mys8tqr,5.0,1lf7uoa

comment,myp2x22,LordOzmodeus,,5,2025-06-19 20:48:35,,,,I think its a great watch as well When my fitbit versa lite died I went for the base model galaxy watch 5 Ive had it for 2 years now and its been fantastic Just as smooth as my phone battery lasts for about 3 days before needing a charge However if this is true about pay walling features ill be moving to another brand The enshitification of goods and services has been unreal lately,myo0uu2,3.0,1lf7uoa
comment,mypcnwy,Kevino_007,,7,2025-06-19 21:37:18,,,,I doubt it like what Heartrate sensor paywalled or o2 sensor ecg Alarmclock mediaplayer time I dont think so And thats really all I want it to do Maybe its going to be some kind of ai summary and insight in your overall health or whatever It has long been known ai will be paywalled so whatever ai is going to the watch will be too probably Dont care,myp2x22,4.0,1lf7uoa
