post,1kbs744,chrisdh79,Raspberry Pi cuts product returns by 50% by changing up its pin soldering | Combining both the big and little solder jobs made a big difference.,237,2025-04-30 21:40:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1kbs744/raspberry_pi_cuts_product_returns_by_50_by/,11.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mpx2ljz,Fit-Produce420,,84,2025-04-30 22:09:11,,,,50 reduction will this improve price or availability Guessing not,,0.0,1kbs744
comment,mpx5e9x,Lachee,,68,2025-04-30 22:24:36,,,,It will improve reliability and reduce the likelihood of DOA,mpx2ljz,1.0,1kbs744
comment,mpxcw8u,shadowtheimpure,,31,2025-04-30 23:06:49,,,,Which will help by them not having to divert stock for RMA claims,mpx5e9x,2.0,1kbs744
comment,mpxe92r,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,12,2025-04-30 23:14:27,,,,Kind of depends on what the return rate is like If the return rate is 1 in 100 then it might help If its 1 in 100000 its almost inconsequential,mpxcw8u,3.0,1kbs744
comment,mqhjg6v,DAMP_ANON,,1,2025-05-04 04:33:53,,,,Considering I would assume return rate is under 1 and then you are doing 50 of that number the answer would be no,mpx2ljz,1.0,1kbs744
comment,mpxri0s,thevillewrx,,21,2025-05-01 00:29:34,,,,Im surprised they were having selective solder issues at all its pretty straight forward with proper preheat and flux especially on an established product like this I wouldnt even announce this if I were them because it comes off as kind of embarrassing SMD headers at these pin counts would have also been suitably strong I personally have never seen a 3 pin SMD header ripped off While not new or terribly difficult paste in hole is the most difficult of the three options I find all of this a bit strange Eliminating selective solder process would be a significant cost savings however But they arent spinning the story that way Edit I see they also mention the ethernet and USB Sometimes connector vendors will cheap out and matte tin the pins prior to trimming them so you get poor wetting on two sides but I dont think that would improve with PiH There are likely a shield though that could be grounded and if that through hole wasnt given a proper pattern to the ground plane than that would wick heat away excessively and cause more wetting issues Possibly reflow gave better overall heating to overcome that But if so than the layout would be to blame My 2 cents,,0.0,1kbs744
comment,mpyyscj,ml20s,,23,2025-05-01 05:07:32,,,,I mean this is also the company that screwed up their USBC implementation on the Pi 4,mpxri0s,1.0,1kbs744
comment,mpzlf32,mark-haus,,18,2025-05-01 08:54:48,,,,And instead of properly implementing USBC PD on the 5 they enforce 5V 5A which is out of spec 25W requires 9V at least in order to power the device with a 3A cable,mpyyscj,2.0,1kbs744
comment,mqazuiq,diablobsb,,3,2025-05-03 02:01:24,,,,Yeah Ive always found this to be stupid even for earlier PIs,mpzlf32,3.0,1kbs744
comment,mpzt7lm,thevillewrx,,2,2025-05-01 10:15:49,,,,Interesting I am admittedly not well versed on their history I assumed they were pretty competent given how prolific the HW is I hear they have good SW support but maybe that is community driven,mpyyscj,2.0,1kbs744
