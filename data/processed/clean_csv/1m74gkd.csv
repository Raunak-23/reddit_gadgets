comment,n4ollnj,FlattenInnerTube,,136,2025-07-23 09:29:26,,,,Im old enough and was fortunate enough to have had and traveled globally with a 701 Super solid and built like an IBM Id get to India with it the unfolding keyboard was a showstopper whether at a customer or when going thru Customs And one of my favorite features was no power brick the power supply was internal and all I carried was the power cord,,0.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4ouca0,mattmog12,,67,2025-07-23 10:46:34,,,,That internal power supply was genius Cant believe modern laptops still make us lug around bricks after all these years The butterfly keyboard was peak engineering nothing today has that same wow factor when you open it Companies dont take those kinds of design risks anymore,n4ollnj,1.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4ox91x,SillyGoatGruff,,57,2025-07-23 11:08:52,,,,Wouldnt the brick add a bunch of extra heat and weight and take up space for other components,n4ouca0,2.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4oyvwb,StraY_WolF,,40,2025-07-23 11:20:54,,,,Yup unfortunately space in laptop is already super limited and thin laptop is selling waaay better than fat ones,n4ox91x,3.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4pnbid,Sup909,,10,2025-07-23 13:45:40,,,,Unless you are carrying around a gaming laptop most everyday laptops like the MB Air or Surface have small bricks that are mostly the size of a phone charger brick these days,n4oyvwb,4.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4puho0,ctrl-all-alts,,11,2025-07-23 14:21:37,,,,Yup The bog standard power bricks are cheap and heavy and a robust and inefficient because of their simplicity But anything with a usbC charging port can be powered from a third party tiny GaN wall charger Even 100W ones arent huge and will cover your phone and tablet If youre moving around that should be your plan If not your cheap heavy brick doesnt really matter,n4pnbid,5.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4q0xw7,Andovars_Ghost,,3,2025-07-23 14:52:11,,,,Exactly My new Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 13 which I had to get since it will be the last with the nub has a very small brick,n4pnbid,5.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4qjkcu,DogmaticLaw,,6,2025-07-23 16:18:05,,,,Oh no How did I not know they were getting rid of the nub Now I guess I need to eye the X1 Carbon even more than I have,n4q0xw7,6.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4qlqfa,Andovars_Ghost,,3,2025-07-23 16:28:10,,,,Lenovo announced that in January and said that the X1 Carbon Gen 13 would be their last laptop with it Said it was time to move on but I disagree That being said I find that I dont use it as much as I used to since the trackpads are much better than back in the day and now I also use a mouse a lot more Still Im glad I have it on my ThinkPad Edit BTW I friggin LOVE this laptop Easily my favorite laptop ever And Ive ownedreviewed A LOT,n4qjkcu,7.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4qnuwy,DogmaticLaw,,2,2025-07-23 16:38:07,,,,Ive read nothing but positive things about the Gen 13 which is part of why Ive been eyeing it to replace my aging T14 gen 2 Its not the freshest I still love Thinkpads as a concept and still use the nub pretty constantly Its so convenient if you just need a quick little movement of the mouse or even more convenient for the middle button scroll while working in web apps The price of that X1 Carbon though woof,n4qlqfa,8.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4qzy74,Andovars_Ghost,,3,2025-07-23 17:32:00,,,,Yeeaahhh the price does suck but it is such a nice computer Ive been OK with it I actually found a really good deal on it through CDW It was several hundred off of the list price for a brand new one,n4qnuwy,9.0,1m74gkd
comment,n5ayk4d,Crowlands,,2,2025-07-26 18:18:14,,,,Shame that they are doing that even if it gets used less than it did that red dot in the middle of the ThinkPad keyboard is an iconic part of them,n4qlqfa,8.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4ptdy5,VirtuousVice,,4,2025-07-23 14:16:17,,,,No there was a time when laptops were insanely bulky and making them more convenient was a huge priority Now were making them as this as possible at the sacrifice of functionality and its positively stupid that the average consumer has blindly accepted this while paying more,n4oyvwb,4.0,1m74gkd

comment,n4pniqi,Tinmania,,11,2025-07-23 13:46:42,,,,I had one too and traveled with it extensively Its probably my favorite laptop taking into consideration the time period I was also on team TrackPoint Once you got used to using it it really was amazing compared to the trackpads roller ball things and whatever else they tried back then Honorable mention goes to the Toshiba Libretto that I had in 1997 Fully functionable and usable windows laptop the size of a VHS cassette tape Talk about being able to travel light When traveling I think more people were impressed by it than by my IBM 701,n4ollnj,1.0,1m74gkd

comment,n4oktcu,got-trunks,,58,2025-07-23 09:21:55,,,,What would be legendary is a motherboard swap vendor for all these sweet old thinkpads they refuse to make anymore Id rather pay 1k ish for a new mobo and battery etc and keep an old chassis for another decade or so,,0.0,1m74gkd

comment,n4q0oa8,InadequateAvacado,,3,2025-07-23 14:50:58,,,,I worked in the Thinkpad support call center in 19992000 This and the modular models were so cool at the time Fun fact We drank the koolaid hard and still used token ring network and BNC in our office Everything would slow to a crawl when everyone logged on in the morning WebExplorer Lotus Notes etc Oh the nostalgia,,0.0,1m74gkd

comment,n5e6ytx,jfdirfn,,1,2025-07-27 06:53:23,,,,I remember having the ethernet vs token ring argument with an IBMer back in those days It was impossible to shift their view that 4mbps through those clunky hermaphrodite plugs was going to dominate networking,n4q0oa8,1.0,1m74gkd

comment,n4q74y9,diacewrb,,3,2025-07-23 15:20:49,,,,I wouldnt say that is 100 true Lenovo did release a couple of weird and wonderful options every now and again like W700ds Had a second screen that popped out at the side X1 Fold Foldable OLED screen Plus Gen 6 Rollable Rollable screen Yoga Book 9i Gen 8 Dual and touch screen Yoga Tablet 3 Pro Had a built in projector,n4q2291,1.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4qwq4d,Party_Cold_4159,,4,2025-07-23 17:17:51,,,,Theyve stayed somewhat close to the original thinkpad brand and more so than any other laptop manufacturer They have been straying with the ultra lights but at least they offer many more options compared to others,n4q74y9,2.0,1m74gkd
comment,n4snz7v,irrelevantusername24,,1,2025-07-23 22:16:26,,,,The tech industry needs to go back to taking the lessons from the early auto industry where everything was interoperable and mass manufactured and stop taking lessons from some fast food chains where for the most part most things are the same no matter where you go but also there is zero guarantee that the owner of one store isnt making random changes to the menu Which to be fair is sometimes a good thing but at the point that single store owner should be able to sell their idea to the main branch because thats kinda the entire point of franchising Anyway as I recently was reminded of this song Theres a right way and theres a wrong way lets do it our way Which is all well and good but if your way is the wrong way you should go out of business at best and at worst end up in prison Not continue doing business as if the level of quality has remained the same Especially not if the businesses outsourced are doing everything and doing their best to keep the quality consistent whilst being consistently undermined by the necessity to subsidize the now effectively superfluous business And to be clear I do have some in mind when I say this but it is probably not who you think because it is complicated More succinctly there are only so many OS and many more manufacturers and those manufacturers make small parts that go in to the final devices and that is like the early auto industry but when the OS are actually the same and are only being differentiated by legalese or code which is exactly as superfluous as legalese and effectively what is happening is in addition to the quality going down that quality is going down because quite literally what is happening is they are selling bits and pieces of what should be a whole and charging a premium for that Selling less for more and selling pieces that are indivisible Tech got too good too fast and the first sin was probably between Nintendo and Sony and Sharp etc But their same logic has been applied to the entire tech industry from beginning to the last mile and has from there infected the rest of society and well gestures broadly Art makes the invisible visible Words and numbers are one thing but art beats both Language and math can both be art but not all language or math is art edit It goes back further than the modern tech industry but it is complicated And even in that specific case attributing blame to certain companies does not explain the truth Because the problem is the same as it always is,n4qwq4d,3.0,1m74gkd
