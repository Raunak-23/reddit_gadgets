comment,mufav72,External_Ear_3588,,588,2025-05-26 23:13:32,,,,It might not be so bad but damn that pricing is downright predatory 300soon to be 400 for the device 30 for a new mouthpiece rated at 200 brushes60year if you only go daily 30 for foam toothpaste that probably only lasts half a year60year an audacious plus subscription The device doesnt have sensors it just has jiggly brushers The subscription includes things like AI and analysis but theres no data to work with its just going to be making everything up A vibrating toothbrush you can get for 20100 and heads probably are recommended to be changed twice a year for 1015year and normal toothpaste 510year I assume you still should floss regardless of the method,muf5opj,1.0,1kw7lur
comment,mufb0ip,dover_oxide,,121,2025-05-26 23:14:24,,,,I honestly havent seen a cheap new and improved way of brushing your teeth than ever advertised The last one I saw that was interesting they had to do 3D scans of your mouth and even then it was a 250 toothbrush that lasted 6 months,mufav72,2.0,1kw7lur
comment,mufbk88,Gnochi,,63,2025-05-26 23:17:38,,,,The most useful thing Ive found yet beyond standard toothbrush and toothpaste is the Slate flosser It means I dont need to be a contortionist to get my molars and the floss itself is strong enough and mounted well enough that I can actually get it between my teeth without shredding it,mufb0ip,3.0,1kw7lur
comment,muflas0,External_Ear_3588,,26,2025-05-27 00:16:08,,,,Ugh proprietary floss refills though on the Slate I am going out of my way to find a refillable flosser I had one from China but they used the wrong kind of plastic and it lasted about 6 months Found a metal one but it has some stupid sharp edges that slice the floss so Im going to file it down when I get a chance and see if I can make it work This isnt rocket science the lack of products just shows the money is in disposable ones Eventually Im going to have one made out of metal with arms that can flex a bit so its easy to create tension,mufbk88,4.0,1kw7lur

comment,mugxd0p,BijouPyramidette,,5,2025-05-27 05:44:03,,,,For me it was a tool I 3d printed I got tired of wrapping the floss around my middle fingers until they turned blue so I printed two short rods with a transverse hole through the middle that i can thread the floss through I give the floss two wraps around each rod and now its held securely like cheese wire The grips sit in my palms and i can use my thumb and forefinger for the fine movements like getting that C curve around the teeth No more blue numb fingertips and my teeth are clean ETA Uploaded it to Theres STL STEP and a Plasticity save file if you want to make your own edits,mufbk88,4.0,1kw7lur

comment,muhet56,TotoCocoAndBeaks,,3,2025-05-27 08:34:01,,,,A similar type of product has been made previously but instead of being powered it had some kind of spring mechanism so you could repeatedly bite down on it for a few seconds and it would brush your teeth nearinstantaneously The important point is that much older product was tailor made via a tooth mould meaning that it would fit your mouth correctly and brush all of your teeth properly Without tailor making this kind of product would be useless Indeed I highly suspect that anyone who relied upon this new toothbrush would end up with deteriorating dental health,mufcctz,3.0,1kw7lur

comment,mug8ik4,EterneX_II,,4,2025-05-27 02:37:58,,,,I totally agree I cant really make time for flossing daily so I use the water floss daily and tape floss weekly and my dentist hasnt raised any flags By the way flossing became a lot easier after removing my wisdom teeth,mug3tge,6.0,1kw7lur
comment,mufnt8k,HiMyNameIsNerd,,5,2025-05-27 00:31:34,,,,Water irrigating is great But as someone mentioned it is meant to be an adjunct not a replacement Personally I use my irrigator 4 nights a week,mufd9b8,4.0,1kw7lur
comment,mugwuif,BijouPyramidette,,4,2025-05-27 05:39:35,,,,I use both daily The floss disrupts the biofilm and the water flushes it away I also have a wisdom tooth that popped up halfway and I use the water flosser to keep the gum pockets clean They collect bits of food otherwise and when that goes bad the whole area gets painful If its super late and Im exhausted Ill just water floss because an imperfect clean is still better than none,mufd9b8,4.0,1kw7lur

comment,mufwqwb,n6mub,,6,2025-05-27 01:25:59,,,,TLDR it doesnt do the main job of a toothbrush Plaque stays on your teeth and too expensive for such garbage Even if you use as directed and buy then replace items as suggested it still doesnt do what a toothbrush is supposed to do My Mums dentist suggested that we get one this brand or something very similar because she was having trouble holding a regular toothbrush and remembering to brush all of her teeth I got supplies enough to last a couple of months and when she tried tried it it was so foreign that she couldnt manage and we gave the whole idea up Using the spare brush I tried the thing myself carefully following the directions When I was done almost all if not all of the plaque on my teeth was still on my teeth and I had another item for the ewaste bin A waste of time and,mufav72,2.0,1kw7lur
comment,mufvr6x,mug3n,,7,2025-05-27 01:19:52,,,,I honestly dont get it Does brushing 30 seconds instead of 2 minutes make THAT much of a difference in ones life Ive learned to just use the 2 or 3 minutes that it takes for me to thoroughly brush my teeth as a minimeditation session to clear my mind Or are people too lazy to learn proper brushing technique and yes there is technique even if you use an electric toothbrush,mufav72,2.0,1kw7lur

comment,mujtodi,Top-Salamander-2525,,2,2025-05-27 17:28:46,,,,The only thing Im worried about is that it might not be getting the back molars as well as I could with a normal toothbrush I will brush normally occasionally and focus on those You also may need to try a different size of their brush to make sure it fits well I was actually hooked on it because I was having trouble getting my toddler to brush twice a day and they have some adorable kids versions and got one for myself as well Have given up using it for him because the occasional gum pain was a deal breaker but still using mine You need to move the brush cant rely on the vibration alone and since I use normal toothpaste Im using probably 3x what I normally would to make sure there is some on both side and in front and back,mujsfku,3.0,1kw7lur

comment,muf6xia,quintic1,,9,2025-05-26 22:50:19,,,,Exactly Idk why dental people hate this If designed right its literally no different than using a regular toothbrush Except way less time For example I take like 5 minutes brushing my teeth I separate my teeth into 6 sections Top left top center top right Bottom left bottom center bottom right So each section is like 50 seconds Electric brushes already do the work for you when you move it around its because youre moving the brush to the other teeth With a U brush like this the brushes would be on all teeth at the same time So Id be brushing all sections in 50 seconds compared to 5 minutes,muf63w2,2.0,1kw7lur
comment,muf8oj0,PM_ME_CATS_OR_BOOBS,,8,2025-05-26 23:00:37,,,,I feel like this would be similar to a retainer where it is far harder to clean than a regular brush just because things can get trapped in the crevices You are also much less likely to regularly replace the bristles and keep them working well because theyre so expensive And thats not necessarily a new tech thing they are always going to be more expensive than just a straight brush Its also a 300 device that saves you ten minutes a week,muf6xia,3.0,1kw7lur

comment,mufw9to,mug3n,,1,2025-05-27 01:23:02,,,,Yeah I have to agree Bringing down my brushing from 120 seconds to 30 seconds adds no value at all to my life In fact I am losing long term because I would be paying a company x a year in perpetuity to buy special toothpaste and the proprietary retainerbrush thingy and they have absolute monopoly because theyll probably be the only ones to make that stuff for a while so there will be a chance the price gets jacked as well Its basically just a more expensive subscription than I am paying over a pack of OralB replacement brush heads which costs me like 25 CAD for 3 and are good for 9 months if I follow the recommended replacement schedule of every 3 months,mufh4iy,5.0,1kw7lur

comment,muf8jmm,bfilippe,,17,2025-05-26 22:59:49,,,,Even a cheap manual toothbrush is far superior and can be swapped out when the bristles get frayed This device is the Silicon Valley approach which is lock every down behind a paywall of subscriptions and AI analysis and custom physical parts that only they sell Toothbrushes dont have to be expensive Floss isnt expensive Even a Waterpik and mouthwash arent too expensive Around 10 minutes a day to brush and floss isnt that much time We spend more time at stoplights and going to the bathroom My advice is to just accept that maintaining our teeth isnt fun Its tedious but spending thousands of dollars on dental repairs because of neglect is far far worse,muf5jqg,1.0,1kw7lur

comment,muf9jq0,bfilippe,,2,2025-05-26 23:05:45,,,,The biggest hurdle with this thing is that you articulate a manual or electric toothbrush sometimes higher up on the gum line and angle downward The worst plaque is at and just below the gum line This device likely cant get at that stuff Its reinventing an already perfected tool Again 30 seconds versus 2 minutes is not much of an improvement If you are struggling with that amount of extra effort it likely is depression that you are struggling with,muf8xre,3.0,1kw7lur

comment,muj5hdf,congenitallymissing,,1,2025-05-27 15:35:16,,,,that was just the first one that popped up theres plenty of studies on the nylon bristled one as well its still severely inefficient and overpriced nylon shows an improvement compared to not brushing at all but remains inefficient to 99 cent tooth brush Ybrush was significantly more effective than no brushing negative control in removing dental plaque When compared to manual toothbrushing for both 45 and 120 s however Ybrush was less effective in dental plaque removal we recommend 120s so thats saying that its not as efficient as manually brushing for a period half the time that we recommend that you do so basically its saying its shitty that study does both nylon y shaped and silicone u shaped btw like i saidtheres plenty of studies i havent read every single one of them because we are all just waiting on one that says that its better that hasnt happened yet what they all show is that it doesnt replicate efficient brushing method it fails to brush cervical gumline regions overall inefficiently removes plaquebiofilm and is significantly more expensive there is no upside except for the wet dream that it will make an already easy task easier believe me if it worked the profession would be selling it everywhere not even so much for my average patient the cost barrier would still be prohibitive but more so for my elderly population that has lost dexterity and my young population that has developed teeth but has not yet developed dexterity to brush tbh there are so many more important studies we should be focused onyet for some reason changing brushing time from 2 minutes to 30 seconds just captivates the public,mufb304,5.0,1kw7lur

comment,mugk5ay,zizp,,4,2025-05-27 03:56:15,,,,The company recently said it would increase the price to 400 blaming tariffs for the rising cost Yeah when a device that costs 20 to manufacture is suddenly 30 with tariffs or lets say 40 even its time to increase the selling price from 300 to 400 Its actually all there is to know about this product and the company behind it,,0.0,1kw7lur

comment,mug300f,Apyan,,2,2025-05-27 02:03:29,,,,But does it work For some reason I think brushing my teeth is one of the most tedious things in the world I cant focus on it Im genuinely thinking about buying the Oral B one with the app cause from time to time I forget which teeth I already brushed I always thought a device like that one would be a great idea cause a lot of people like me would buy it but it looks like I need to go out more hahaha,,0.0,1kw7lur

comment,muh4b5e,slog,,1,2025-05-27 06:48:22,,,,Being upfront I didnt read the article That said I picked up an autobrush a few months ago that looks almost the same as the thumbnail It has been absolutely amazing for me Yeah the toothpaste is dumb and I doubt the colored LEDs do literally anything helpful but it is SO easy and I brush more frequently and more thoroughly because of it Its a bit annoying to fit in the mount at first and doesnt quite do a super great job in the rear molars for me but its absolutely a net positive without question,,0.0,1kw7lur
