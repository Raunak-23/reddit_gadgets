comment,lvl5071,Jestined,,25,2024-11-05 20:55:18,,,,iFixit still sells replacement batteries for the different 3DS models this is of course assuming the charging issues are due to battery wear and not the charging port The New 3DS line is significantly better than the original Theyre insanely expensive now but I have no regrets buying mine,lvk729a,2.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvi9ka5,Dr_Nebbiolo,,918,2024-11-05 11:42:01,,,,I believe when they shut down servers for games they usually close the ability to join but dont kick users off So as long as someone doesnt disconnect they can keep playing But sooner or later even intentional hold outs will lose connection and then they cant reconnect,lvi5euj,1.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvj9i4v,audigex,,45,2024-11-05 15:26:41,,,,Yeah theres normally a soft shut down where as you said you cant login or start a new game but those already in game arent kicked out Sometimes the spinning upshutting down of the servers is automated like appears to be the case for this 3DS and so nobody notices that one server is still running Or they notice but just dont care about the negligible cost Other times the server is actually P2P connectivity and you only need the server to start the game so as long as you keep the game open it will continue running Other times theres a hard shutdown after a period of time forcing a disconnect for the last users,lvi9ka5,2.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvihsqp,Gripeaway,,14,2024-11-05 12:45:55,,,,I loved the 3DS and I understand your perspective But I think that niche just makes a lot less sense from a business perspective now because everyone has a cell phone in their pocket that functions as a proper handheld and obviously mobile gaming is huge It just makes sense to try to sell onthego games to people using the console they already have a phone than to try to sell them an additional console And the Switch is a sort of inbetween that works well on long distance travel multiple hour train rides planes etc,lvhyxfq,2.0,1gk1s0u
comment,lvivy97,Maserati777,,3,2024-11-05 14:13:52,,,,Im glad they released the switch lite since its slightly smaller then the switch But it is very fragile compared to the 2ds xl And Ive looked at cases but every case is designed to carry it and not like a phone case where its designed to still fit in your pocket,lvihsqp,3.0,1gk1s0u
comment,lviwbut,Griffdude13,,6,2024-11-05 14:16:01,,,,Its not that it didnt work in 2017 its that it doesnt work now Especially for games that were built for the likes of PS5 and Series X,lvhyxfq,2.0,1gk1s0u
comment,lvjyjvf,jd451,,3,2024-11-05 17:29:23,,,,The reason it doesnt work is because the Switch is trying so hard to be two different things As a handheld its always been cumbersome compared to its predecessors Even the New 3DS XL the last big beefy DS had a small enough form factor that I could use it while standing on packed buses or trains But the Switch is too bulky for that I can only really play it if Im seated And I cant justify spending for a Switch Lite As a home console using it docked doesnt feel like youre playing on a proper console It feels exactly like Ive connected a handheld to a tv Modern consoles double as media systems but the Switch doesnt have the same catalogue of apps only youtube and hulu I think Its not about the games its about how Nintendo clearly didnt know what they were aiming for with the product They started with a handheld that could be a home console threw ideas out until some stuff stuck marketed it really well and then took any criticisms as inspiration for the newer models Want a bigger screen Get the OLED Switch Want a smaller formfactor pure handheld Get the Switch Lite I get that people worldwide love the Switch but for me as someone who carried my DSs and later on 3DSs with me anywhere I went the Switch missed the mark quite badly,lviwbut,3.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvn3ha4,PlayingDoomOnAGPS,,1,2024-11-06 03:26:50,,,,I caught so many downvotes for saying this when the Switch was in development Its a portable console not a handheld and making it portable made it worse at being a console As we all predicted it would But people love it anyway shit even me so the DS line is never coming back,lvhyxfq,2.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvkkz23,USeaMoose,,1,2024-11-05 19:17:18,,,,I loved my DS and the other versions and it is actually one of my largest game libraries So I would also say that I have more affection for it than for the Switch Although I generally found its 2 screen gimmick to be almost completely pointless A couple games made decent use of it but most did not And with the 3DS I almost always left the 3D toggled off Im not here to complain about a 10 year old console I just have always found it funny that I have so much affection for a console where I found the main gimmick to be almost entirely unnecessary I think I was just happy to have a handheld Nintendo console and it folding up was nice because it protected the screen and you could adjust the angle of the top screen,lvht6to,1.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvjt5y5,Jiopaba,,4,2024-11-05 17:03:13,,,,Its barely worth the effort to engineer a working software hack while its being updated One day theyll call it End of Life and the gates will open At that point they only need one single unpatched software entry point and every remaining console is trivial to mod forever,lvirx3i,4.0,1gk1s0u

comment,lvj8f38,todayiwillthrowitawa,,7,2024-11-05 15:21:12,,,,It might not be hard for the average rgadgets poster it is completely beyond most peoples comfort levels The second you ask most people to start scraping connections off a motherboard or testing diodes youve lost them For an OLED chip for example you need a soldering iron flux solder new wire magnifying glasses specialized screwdrivers flush cutters etc etc and bricking your console is a small accidental hand slip away,lvitql0,5.0,1gk1s0u
comment,lvjarqa,MeMyselfandThatPC,,1,2024-11-05 15:33:04,,,,True but I also believe most people wouldnt think about modding their consoles to begin with and would just buy the new generation But more and more people are tired of buying new consoles because of the lack of backwards compatibility when most of the time the hardware upgrade doesnt justify the cost so I can see some of those same people taking interest in modding,lvj8f38,6.0,1gk1s0u
comment,lvjb7dz,OperativePiGuy,,1,2024-11-05 15:35:15,,,,I agree Even the original switch while easily hackable needed you to either use a paper clip or buy a dedicated jig for he joycon pin thing to enter the exploit Thats already too much for most people It was annoying enough for me that I didnt bother until they had a 3 dollar thing I could buy on Amazon Compared to the 3DS where it was literally just softwarebased for the initial softmodding and then it was permanently good to go its a hassle,lvj8f38,6.0,1gk1s0u
