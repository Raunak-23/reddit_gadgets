comment,m5jci56,TheRabidDeer,,23,2025-01-05 16:01:21,,,,Why does this projector have a motion controlled gimbal In my past AV experience setting up projectors for conference rooms and such as well as the couple Ive had at home it is kind of a set it up once and forget it Seems pretty overkill to need something like this no,,0.0,1htwlzo
comment,m5li5ro,cbzoiav,,1,2025-01-05 22:18:18,,,,It doesnt it has a motion controlled remote you can use to adjust the gimbal Think along the lines of TV remotes that can move a mouse by waving it about except it adjusts the gimbal positioning,m5jci56,1.0,1htwlzo

comment,m5nvlwb,cbzoiav,,1,2025-01-06 07:03:36,,,,Im going to guess that they put the accelerometers into the remote so it can act as a mouse Once there its then trivial to also let you adjust the gimbal that way I can imagine its quicker than using arrow buttons on the remote Eg when you do that it will normally only move slowly on a single axis and ramp up if you hold the button With the accelerometers its essentially point at the middle of the screen push the button move to pointing where you want the screen to be For large movements it can start moving quickly and along two axis immediately,m5m5max,3.0,1htwlzo

comment,m5q0naj,cbzoiav,,1,2025-01-06 17:02:10,,,,This doesnt look like a fixed projector Its the kind of thing you take to a conference booth or customer and project on a wall whiteboard or portable screen Alternatively home users may have one they pull out of a cupboard for movie nights one of the marketing pics for the N1S has it on a bed projecting on a ceiling You could still set it up manually but that either involves fiddling around with screw based adjustors or significant sizeweight and being a PITA for a user with something friction based This also looks more professional when your sales team are setting it up as the conference starts to kick off,m5peo5s,5.0,1htwlzo
comment,m5pvzqd,imakesawdust,,1,2025-01-06 16:39:17,,,,I think the question is why have a motorized gimbal at all What are the usecases where you mount a projector but cant aim it until later,m5nvlwb,4.0,1htwlzo

comment,m5jo4di,daVinci0293,,9,2025-01-05 17:01:32,,,,You know this is a funny comment cause thats true now and is genuinely awesome however I bought my 120 4K HDR projector setup 6 years ago Of course the ubiquity of very large TVs means I will have to consider them when I am ready to replace my current setup but Samsungs first 98 TV was priced at 100k haha Even in 2023 100 TVs were still 6k Having had a projector for half of a decade I can say its an amazing experience and most of the drawbacks didnt have an alternative when I bought it That said when this kicks the bucket I might have more choices And given that oled changed the name of the contrast and quality game You might be right The one thing I will say with a projector theres no big heavy screen that your friends and children can break haha,m5j5vkt,1.0,1htwlzo
comment,m5jusss,HulksInvinciblePants,,3,2025-01-05 17:35:11,,,,Yeah its been a rapid shift and a welcomed one Ive been following USTs for awhile now Theres always been a nagging issue in the back of my mind as it pertains to performance though ALR screens are only so capable and real HDR plus game features are incredible valueadds,m5jo4di,2.0,1htwlzo
comment,m5jzj0r,rtb001,,2,2025-01-05 17:58:21,,,,I dont game too much and Ive been so far pretty satisfied with the Nexigo Aurora Pro I recently bought 100 TVs are becoming a thing but 120 TV even LCD is certainly not affordable If you have a dedicated light controlled room the Mexigo plus its bundled 120 inch ALR screen is still the best bang for the buck because it is under 3000 and an UST type projector is relatively easy to install 120 OLED or microLED or whatever the next gen panel is would certainly be the best but that size screen will probably still be unaffordable even when this Nexigo needs replacing 57 years from now,m5jusss,3.0,1htwlzo

comment,m5kdi5y,chesser45,,-2,2025-01-05 19:02:50,,,,I didnt read the article so it was definitely a case of not knowing anything and commenting My understanding of laser projectors is that they are an integrated system and are not end user replaceable like a more traditional projector using a bulb as an illumination device behind a colour wheel They have a much longer service lifetime over and above 810 years at 8hrs a day but they still have a hard limit where they have degraded and you cannot service them to extend that Is this incorrect,m5iybhq,2.0,1htwlzo
comment,m5n1z90,Linwechan,,1,2025-01-06 03:23:05,,,,Were definitely in the time where Chinese tech is in its innovation era Japan and a lessor extent Taiwan had its heyday and Korea is clearly slowing down after decades of exceptional growth Its fascinating overall to track these rises and falls in tech industries and brands It is true that that laser does have light source lifetime usually 25k hours but most people are okay at that level of planned obsolescence its not obscenely short The tech is more likely to have moved on significantly before the product dies I never had a bulb projector but sounds like it can live forever as long as the brands deem theres a market worth making the consumables for,m5kdi5y,3.0,1htwlzo
