comment,majkgsw,None,,7,2025-02-02 12:24:53,,,,Sure Going back to early days of america the thought was that innovation was spurred by desperation Currently innovation is only currated if there is a percievable consumer as the end game Many thoerize this is why we get cures for cancer ever 5 years but they never cure cancer Wouldnt be profitable compared to months of chemo Hope this helps you out,majjvn5,5.0,1iepikz
comment,mana1t2,alidan,,1,2025-02-02 23:51:45,,,,I somewhat agree but mostly disagree innovation was spurred by desperation you have to innovate or you die we have this all around us but the most ways we see it used are in lets say iems where its a race to the bottom there is an iem called salnotes zero which sound tone wise is on par with 150200 iems when they cost 20 my iems at the time were blessing 2s which tone wise were playing with iems that cost 1000 not quite there but close enough my current iems dusks blessing 3 but with 2 planar magnetics instead of 4 bas are above the 1000 price mark in quality for 360 and the old blessing 2s are currently being played with by 80 truthear hexas tws you have 20 space travels and then they are quality comparable up to the 150 range where I have airpods to compare to and the space travels honestly I say they are better alot of innovation is stunted by patents take a look at uclogic digitizers and wacom for a great example of this it took a hell of alot of innovation for china to be able to side step wacoms patents for releasing tablets in the west the result of that was 60 tablets that were feature for feature as good as 350 wacom tablets and in more recent years penable displays that just kicked wacoms teeth in for form factor wacom was 34 inches thich at a point where monitors were fat at 1 inch and needed active cooling china monitors came out in normal monitor form factors most innovation doesnt come from desperation anymore it comes from a race to the bottom while not sacrificing needed features and quite alot of our current needs are at the point where hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to improve something where as in the past there was quite alot of low hanging fruit for an example of this look at american trucks they arent huge because we want huge they are huge because of emission standards its far FAR easier to make a truck larger to be able to pass emissions than it is to make small truck pass emissions because the smaller a car is the more strict emissions standards are as for a cancer cure the reason its so hard to get one isnt because there is more money in treatment though I do know for a fact major investors openly asked a drug research lab why in the fuck are they researching cures instead of treatments its because cancer specifically is tied to dna any treatment would need to be made specifically for that persons dna all we can really do is get better generalized treatments as for cancer cures look into research on them almost every time the problem is side effects or the treatment does not pan out,majkgsw,6.0,1iepikz

comment,mangy8m,alidan,,1,2025-02-03 00:28:55,,,,in what way what I remember about monoprice is they effectively act as a distributor for chinese stuff that lets them put their name on it and at least were trying to get into more customhigher end markets with audio stuff but I havent paid attention to them in quite a long time,manc7qg,8.0,1iepikz

comment,mannxca,alidan,,1,2025-02-03 01:06:42,,,,googling them dont show me what the patents are just that cases are settled the only issue one would be in 2013 with a seeming clone of klipsch speakers there are currently around 4 million active patens who knows how many are valid or even if they are if they are enforceable at a certain point its better to just put something on the market and find out later through a fine if its legal or not as long as they license the patent or get the patent tossed and honestly I dont think that there is a domestic market for nearly anything on monoprice,manj7dt,10.0,1iepikz

comment,maoajeg,alidan,,1,2025-02-03 03:09:51,,,,there are essentially 4 driver types in iems dynamic drivers either used for everything or bass only blanced armitures which can be used at any point by are best in mids and high planar magnetic drivers which are capable of everything but currently small ones are being used for highs and electrostatic which I think are only used for highs monoprice did make a planar magnetic headphone at some point but it was worse than equally priced hifiman I dont think that was ever a patent problemknock off though,manrr82,12.0,1iepikz
comment,maps4e1,None,,1,2025-02-03 10:30:34,,,,You dont know shit Monoprice was a quarter the price of hifiman And electrostatic is full range Wtf are you even spamming this at me for if you dont know shit,maoajeg,13.0,1iepikz
comment,mau9mju,alidan,,1,2025-02-04 00:51:01,,,,do you purposefully miss the part where I am talking about iems then you go to full headphones IN IEMS this is how they are used now back to your monoprice planar question monoprice if I remember back when they first came out were between 300 and 400 and ended up being worse than dynamic driver options that were cheaper and within 50 of hifiman equivalent headphones that were night and day better im looking at current offerings of monoprice their cheapest is 200 closed back their open back starts at 250 hifiman on sale starts at 100 currently they are and off sale start at 150 their closed back is currently 130 and are normally 400 point is monoprice was worse back then than hifiman I have no idea about todays but I moved from headphones to iems in the time between them first putting out planars and now so I dont keep up with that segment of audio,maps4e1,14.0,1iepikz
comment,mausqik,None,,1,2025-02-04 02:34:11,,,,Back to the point is that monoprice offers clearly patented technology at discount prices So esplain that,mau9mju,15.0,1iepikz
comment,mavl39t,alidan,,1,2025-02-04 05:33:48,,,,ok let me copy paste what I said googling them dont show me what the patents are just that cases are settled the only issue one would be in 2013 with a seeming clone of klipsch speakers there are currently around 4 million active patens who knows how many are valid or even if they are if they are enforceable at a certain point its better to just put something on the market and find out later through a fine if its legal or not There are so many patents that its not viable to read through 12 million pages of documentation many of the patents I have read are 3 pages long of text alone not counting images but text is the part that really makes it hard to parse fast to see if you are violating a patent then to actually be violating a patent it has to be valid patents are not checked against each other and get tossed frequently because some other patent form nearly 100 years ago already did that then you also have prior art patents where the idea was already in the public conscious and you cant patent it all over again in cases like these you go to court and if it is a violation you pay damage and most likely a license for the patent you may not understand this but businesses especially smaller ones its cheaper to fuck around violate patents in this case and find out pay the fine and license then it is to hire lawyers to do everything and yes monoprice is still on the smaller side for having lawyers look over every single thing they do to make sure its all good and just so you know patent law is a civil case not criminal until it hits the point of counterfeiting you go through civil court the closest monoprice got to that was 12 years ago with the klipsch energy clones though I cant find details on that because you mention planar magnetic the tech is over 50 years old patents on many of them are long expired patents last 20 years design patents 15 years once they expire anyone can use them,mausqik,16.0,1iepikz
comment,mawjv3f,None,,1,2025-02-04 11:08:13,,,,Monoprice generates over 200 million in revenue a year So all of what you just said is highly inaccurate They are by no means a small company They are headquartered in cali which is highly populated by cheap lawyers They know what they do and its the same thing as every other company on amazon They harvest patents send slightly reworked designs to china and we get to buy expensive tech for cheal because really nobody cares Nobody cares,mavl39t,17.0,1iepikz
comment,mawqgtt,alidan,,1,2025-02-04 12:04:44,,,,74 million in revenue last year and that at least to my understanding is gross revenue not net so what they made is lower than that a patent lawyer costs 300600 per hour a patent dispute almost always gets settled out of court either in licensing the patent or removal of product due to going though the legal system being 35 years and several million dollars almost always cost prohibitive for both parties send slightly reworked designs no monoprice goes to manufactures and imports from them with their name on the caseing china effectively has a few tiers for how you do buisness with them 1 manufacturer direct you make a large volume purchase from a manufacturer and part it out yourself 2 you cant make the big purchase so you go through a middleman who did this is effectively alibaba 3 you dont want to buy 100 usb thumbdrives you only want one so this is aliexpress tier 4 then you have the people who import from there to the us and sell it on amazon for a fun visual of how this works look up lemon cymbals an electronic drum cymbal a pack of 3 from 14 to 18 inch costs 130 on alibaba express parts them out for 70 each and on amazon you are looking at 100 minimum monoprice is effectively amazon sellers but buying things they know will sell so they dont mark them up out the ass like other people do,mawjv3f,18.0,1iepikz
comment,mawrstx,None,,1,2025-02-04 12:15:03,,,,So circling all the way back to my original point why cancer isnt profitable to cure you are saying if we want cancer to be cured we need to outsource it to china and damn the existing patents,mawqgtt,19.0,1iepikz
comment,mb07c6k,alidan,,1,2025-02-04 22:41:13,,,,cancer wont be cured until a personalized treatments based on dna are viable the main issue is cancer is our dna mutating and no longer self destructing a treatment would not only need to be able to know whats good it would need to also know whats bad till we get that kind of treatment the only thing we can do is general treatments but when we do general treatments individuals will have something that works wonders for some reason or we find a new treatment that only works in a rat news picks up on it and does what news does exaggerate till the news is closer to a lie than truth and there you go we hear cancer is close to being cured and then it goes away entirely if you want to look at something more interesting look up aids that one actually is getting close to cured I believe 2 individuals last I looked at it were now aids free I dont know the details of it but because aids is not our dna mutating its going to be cured before cancer,mawrstx,20.0,1iepikz

comment,maryqbh,Count_Rousillon,,1,2025-02-03 18:14:34,,,,Thats not true for cancer During the 70s there was a push for a War on Cancer that treated all cancers as the same thing But cancer is more like a broad spectrum of diseases rather than a single common illness Theres been a lot of cures for a specific mutation based cancer because theres a lot of different ways to get uncontrolled cell growth Cancer and they have to be dealt with in different ways,majkgsw,6.0,1iepikz

comment,maxmjey,-NotActuallySatan-,,1,2025-02-04 15:19:28,,,,The tech is ready tho Meta Halliday other companies are showing that there are multiple designs you can do but most all of them most likely have some type of data collection keeping the price relatively low under 1k USD Apple doesnt have that same crutch and considering that they make devices that are additive to the ecosystem rather than replacements for existing products they wouldnt want the glasses to replace the Apple watch for example they would need to find a way to make the device unique from the rest of their product portfolio while still providing a valuable cohesive experience with the rest of their products And considering how Apple prices things usually those glasses would cost 1k minimum which I s way more costly than anything else on the market Especially with how lackluster the AVP sold its likely theyre just going to wait until they absolutely have to ie when the shareholders want them to to create a pair of smart glasses The tech is here already but the market for these glasses is still too niche it needs to mature a bit more to justify the effort and investment otherwise they might have another AVP on their hands,mapmaax,6.0,1iepikz

comment,maazxdc,Shapes_in_Clouds,,3,2025-02-01 01:47:54,,,,Its certainly cool but is it actually useful The whole demo while the technology is certainly amazing mostly made me realize how little value such glasses would provide compared to the smart phones we already have today but at probably far higher cost 70 degree FOV is extremely limiting the content is transparent so videos will be see through and the other apps were an incredibly boring looking pong game and AI vision to make a smoothie Why do I want this over my smartphone which today already offers a beautiful full color high res OLED display and is or will be capable of all the same things I still feel like the conceptual ideal of true AR glasses is so far away from technologically possible and even then its not obvious why Id rather wear a HUD than just look at my phone Still feel immersive VR is the better technology as at least its immersive qualities offer truly unique experiences,ma9tble,2.0,1iepikz

comment,maclse5,rtb001,,10,2025-02-01 09:05:48,,,,While that might be true for some of the EV big boys in China like BYD and Geely and conglomerates trying to get into the field like Xiaomi and Huawei also very successful in their EV endeavors the underlying reason between why Xiaomi could build an EV so quickly and Apple could not lies in the fact that China as a nation had spent at least 15 years investing tremendous resources in building up their entire EV value chain industry resulting in a critical mass of technology supply chain and manufacturing knowhow which will allow for anyone to more easily get into the EV game Might be easier for big companies like Xiaomi and Huawei but there are some very successful EV startups in China which basically started from nothing Li Auto and Nio were founded by guys who started out running auto enthusiast websites He Xiaopeng who founded Xpeng started out by creating a mobile internet browser before selling it to Alibaba and taking his money to found an EV company The founder of Leapmotor first founded another company called Dahua a video surveillancesecurity camera company Did these people have the expertise of someone like Lucid founder Peter Rawlinson who was literally the chief engineer behind the Tesla Model S before forming his own EV company Of course not yet all their startups rapidly scaled production past the US EV startups because unlike Rivian and Lucid all those Chinese startups had access to that critical mass of EV supply chain and expertise which only exists in China so they could get their companies off the ground far quicker Then later one when the big boys like Huawei and Xiaomi came along and also wanted to enter the game well theyve got even deeper pockets and could scale even faster than those earlier startups with Xiaomi being the fastest of them all,mabw0h3,4.0,1iepikz

comment,maoqafr,rtb001,,1,2025-02-03 04:45:55,,,,I dont think I am The comment I replied to argued that Chinese advances in EVs is a result of big conglomerates getting into the game My argument is that it was Chinese government support over many years to build out the most advanced and comprehensive EV value chain that is most responsible for how they got ahead on EVs Because that value chain allows anyone to potentially quickly build an EV startup Yes it is easier for a conglomerate like Xiaomi but pure startups like Li Auto or Xpeng have also succeeded The corollary to my argument is also that it isnt a single company that can allow the west to catch back up to the Chinese in the EV sector because that is not the main reason they are ahead To catch up youd have recreate a comparable EV value chain outside of China one which China had spent the better part of 2 decades building up which is nigh impossible at this point,mamyrm4,6.0,1iepikz

comment,macjmqu,rtb001,,5,2025-02-01 08:44:31,,,,I dont know what China being a totalitarian state have to do with building EVs but you are correct that things are different there The difference is that the center of EV technology manufacturing and adoption lies squarely in China which is why Tesla aside and Tesla really only hit their stride after opening up their massive Chinese factory which builds almost half of all EVs they make American EV startups are either struggling while burning cash Rivian Lucid or are just DOA Canoo Aptera Nicola etc Apple is too busy making money hand over fist so they dont have to worry about what their competitors are doing I seem to remember a little company called Intel that DOMINATED its field for DECADES making money hand over fist safe in the knowledge that upstarts like nVidia TSMC or even AMD would never catch up And look at them now But I will agree that Apple is not a stupid company and there is a good damn reason they gave up on their EV project even if the TEN BILLION bucks they put into it represented a tremendous sunk cost The reason itself is quite simple really Apple eventually realized that they simply do not have access to the designers supply chain and manufacturing expertise to build something as complicated as a car even if EVs are relatively simpler to produce than ICE cars in any sort of volume that will allow them to make a profit Because they are in Cupertino and thousands of miles away from the expertise needed to build electric cars They the billions of Saudi cash Lucid has been burning for 15 years trying to keep their car business afloat in the US and realized the odds are against them Xiaomi on the other hand is located in Beijing and could just walk out their front door put up an ad and instantly be able to hire whoever they wanted to design their car source parts and batteries for their car build and manage a new factory to manufacture that car and then just throw some of their own software engineers on the project to put their HyperOS software on it and bam theres a car they can instantly scale into mass production The gulf between how quickly and how costly you can get an EV company off the ground in the US versus China is ridiculously wide Rivian was founded in 2009 and Lucid even earlier in 2007 and now in 2025 Im not certain that both of these companies COMBINED have managed to produce 200000 cars in all these year so of operation Xiaomi started their car project in 2021 reputedly spent 3 years and 1 billion USD on it launched their first car the SU7 in March 2024 and as of January 2025 have already built and sold 150000 cars Goldman Sachs is projecting that Xiaomi will raise their production to 350000 in 2025 and as many as 650000 in 2026 allowing Xiaomis EV unit to possibly turn a profit by 2026 Rivian and Lucid cannot hope to compete with that and neither could Apple And since cars are not Apples core business anyway they got the hell out there despite dropping 10 billion on the project Apple understood that more likely than not the EV race has already been won by the Chinese,mac2onf,4.0,1iepikz
