comment,mx2r7xp,Interesting_Ghosts,,15,2025-06-10 19:56:34,,,,Carbon copy cloner is fairly inexpensive and it works great It is much more reliable than Time Machine since you can verify backups and search them manually Also you can create bootable backups Been using it for 10 years,mx1x84p,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4f1u3,Sevallis,,3,2025-06-11 01:11:45,,,,Its also what you want if you are trying to backup anything besides your internal disk,mx2r7xp,3.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx21k4f,0x831,,55,2025-06-10 17:55:16,,,,Be very careful I used to do this and noticed that Time Machine will appear to be working and doing what you expect but will silently corrupt network based backups Something in the TM code doesnt handle latency variations very well and will cause data corruption and it will not be reported I retried with new drives and had the same problem If its over a wired connection I think youre less likely to run into a problem but dont back up to a NAS over WiFi using TM Someday youll regret it,mx1ksb0,1.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4mn2h,jonny55555,,1,2025-06-11 01:56:09,,,,Yep I stopped using Time Machine because the backup got corrupted constantly I recall I was able to update the frame size or something for WiFi which helped but it didnt eliminate the problem,mx21k4f,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mxgnlvv,None,,1,2025-06-12 22:23:58,,,,Happens to me too Absolutely zero trust in this shit I stopped using it altogether after it failed on me 3 times like this,mx21k4f,2.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx4ilgg,shasen1235,,1,2025-06-11 01:32:34,,,,But to my curious Apple a company that aims for simplicity more than anyone else Would rather axe the function than properly fix it I mean their SMB performance has been tanking and unreliable for ages and that may be the reason for TM over Wifi to fail And whats their alternate solution for us A USB drive,mx21k4f,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4vdpz,sylfy,,2,2025-06-11 02:48:50,,,,Their alternative solution is iCloud backups Which is a better solution for the average user,mx4ilgg,3.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4z2jp,shasen1235,,4,2025-06-11 03:12:52,,,,Im not sure about this iCloud is good for light backup like iPhoneiPad settings photos and videos But when it comes to full Mac backup especially like I have a 1TB MacBook sending data this big will not only clog my bandwidth and a bigger pain when restoring,mx4vdpz,4.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx51x6y,sylfy,,1,2025-06-11 03:32:08,,,,Fair enough thats true Full system backups are probably not a consideration iCloud backup works well when all your applications are installed from and managed through a centralised repositorypackage manager like the App Store on iOS For people with lots of applications not installed through the App Store on MacOS which is probably many people this will require large application backups and restores,mx4z2jp,5.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4rl3c,0x831,,1,2025-06-11 02:25:17,,,,Yeah I suspect it is the underlying protocol or at least an interaction with it,mx4ilgg,3.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx22iaq,is-this-now,,27,2025-06-10 17:59:36,,,,No fooling If their solution is back up to ICloud well be paying for that the rest our lives and the prices will just creep up,mx1ksb0,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx26pwl,GeektimusPrime,,9,2025-06-10 18:19:08,,,,Seems they are referring to those specific products not the TimeMachine service FTA For alternatives networkattached storage NAS solutions like Synology offer a way to continue using Time Machine for wireless backups over the local network,mx1ksb0,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx452i8,cronin1024,,2,2025-06-11 00:13:32,,,,I think this message is good news I think theyve finally decided to make it better and in doing so they realized they have to drop support of those really old products,mx1ksb0,1.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx3jsby,Vladivostokorbust,,1,2025-06-10 22:15:41,,,,Given the industry is totally committed to subscription based products well all be forced to icloud before long While I have some backups on Google drive and Amazon for photos cause its free i make sure everything is backed up locally 2x,mx1ksb0,1.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx1qqco,LupusDeusMagnus,,79,2025-06-10 17:06:08,,,,8 years of support after discontinuation isnt that unusual actually it might be unusual in that its actually uncommon to last this long Also some comments seem to be misunderstanding they dont appear to be dropping the software time capsule just the discontinued AirDrop Time Capsule a piece of hardware You can still just buy a reliable affordable non Apple hard drive and setup backups there,,0.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx1zrqa,obi1kenobi1,,16,2025-06-10 17:47:11,,,,8 years is just the time since the last piece of hardware was discontinued Currently much older versions of the Time Capsule still work Im pretty sure even the first version from 2007 is supported Im assuming theyre doing this so that they dont have to keep issuing security updates and can just say theyre done with the old AirPort hardware The part that worries me is that it says theyre dropping AirPort Disk which is when you plug an external hard drive into the USB port on a normal AirPort base station I thought that used a relatively basic file sharing protocol rather than anything proprietary so I just hope that this is hardwarespecific and wont cause any issues with other NAS solutions Removing Time Machines ability to back up over wifi would be a huge problem and break a ton of backup workflows Also it makes me wonder about the future of AirPlay support on the hardware The last generation AirPort Express still has a niche following in the hi fi community since its a cheap and easy way to add AirPlay audio streaming to an old stereo that doesnt have it built in Theres no reason it shouldnt continue to work indefinitely but if theyre dropping features arbitrarily so that they can deprecate the product that would be a problem,mx1qqco,1.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx61oe4,gadgetboyj,,3,2025-06-11 08:43:35,,,,AirPort Disk like Time Machine on the Time CapsuleAirPort uses the AFP protocol for file sharing which is whats being removed Any other NAS solutions that arent pretending to be a Time Capsule should already be using SMB and continue to work without issue,mx1zrqa,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx2yq72,KenUsimi,,2,2025-06-10 20:31:28,,,,Got it definitely misread I was pissed id have to get new software and probably have to reformat my backup drive,mx1qqco,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx1lmyt,notfork,,12,2025-06-10 16:42:44,,,,Not only that I can set up my NAS to be a time machine simple as one button But really that is only there if I had a bunch of legacy machineswhich I do not have So for my one mac it gets backed up the same way as my other machines to the nas and offsite,mx1hkk3,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx1k33y,SportsterDriver,,8,2025-06-10 16:35:19,,,,Ive used Carbon Copy Cloner instead for years to make backups to external or network drives,mx1h2rn,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx535w6,green_link,,1,2025-06-11 03:40:45,,,,yup this is what they want to push subscription based cloud backup,mx1pads,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx4238o,elton_john_lennon,,2,2025-06-10 23:56:16,,,,solution to the void this will cause I dont think it will since you can still use local storage to do the backup its just specifically Apple products that are getting axed from what I understand from the article,mx1h2rn,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx2d9s8,truethug,,1,2025-06-10 18:50:03,,,,How big is your hard drive And do you want to keep multiple versions of things like Time Machine does 50gb runs out very quickly for backups,mx2a2t5,3.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx2zw1h,Alan_Shutko,,10,2025-06-10 20:36:55,,,,I suspect theyre killing Time Machine over AFP They switched to SMB 2 quite a while back but I dont think the old AirPortTime Capsule supported that,,0.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx1jrba,phoneacct696969,,9,2025-06-10 16:33:44,,,,Guarantee the whole plan is to encourage these types of users to use subscription based iCloud,mx1iip8,1.0,1l82ukc

comment,mx20jab,BabyWrinkles,,5,2025-06-10 17:50:39,,,,You guarantee that based on what exactly Is it not more likely that theres some changes coming to Time Machine backups that wont be supported by the decade old hardware that theyve supported up to this point Say some new disk structure AFP or something Theyre not discontinuing Time Machine theyre just not supporting it in new software for hardware thats not been sold in nearly a decade for software theyre releasing a decade later That seems hella reasonable to me If you really dont want to migrate from your decade old time capsule just stick with MacOS 26 Otherwise go buy a 500 Unifi UNAS Pro and slap a few disks in there and youre good to keep your Time Machine backups going forward,mx1jrba,2.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx2a3gn,Jmackles,,7,2025-06-10 18:35:04,,,,Im of the opinion that if it is an ecosystem locked thing like this that bricks dependent backups then the manufacturer should be compelled to open source the software so the end user can continue to self maintain or seek support with their existing techequipment elsewhere,,0.0,1l82ukc
comment,mx5lhm7,dyslexic__wizard,,5,2025-06-11 06:06:22,,,,Uh your opinion isnt relevant because nothing is bricked,mx2a3gn,1.0,1l82ukc
comment,mxfitdq,Jmackles,,1,2025-06-12 18:59:07,,,,Okay I disagree on the principal that I personally believe that if your device stops operating and the manufacturer has dropped support for it its is effectively bricked And to pre empt your rebuttal I know this is industry standard and I hate it This sort of thing is entirely what right to repair is about Theres no reason why a third party specialist couldnt maintain obsolete equipment well past the manufacturers support date Its not like The Library of Appleandria is getting burnt down and nobody can find the docs Apple HAS the relevant information that they could disperse They could even profit from it by making you purchase the schematics or firmware documentation through them They could easily lead the world on how to bring back the veritable Maytag Repairman AirTag repair man Ok Ill shut up Particularly when it comes to system backups the concept of which should be a no brainer when it comes to long therm support,mx5lhm7,2.0,1l82ukc

comment,mxfr51z,Jmackles,,1,2025-06-12 19:38:53,,,,Am i misunderstanding If support is ended it means if your operational equipment goes down even if you didnt update it you have no resources or official assistance to resolve issues,mxfkknu,4.0,1l82ukc
