comment,mdcg7t4,AlexHimself,,25,2025-02-18 00:22:16,,,,This is actually really cool and seems to be a novel method that sounds CHEAP Its just a couple radio emitters and a reflectorsticker like thing Cameras Lidar GPS etc can struggle indoors depending on the environment and this is just crosspolarized radio wave reflections with 7cm accuracy that can accurately locate a drone Seems like a good final tech to close out the last little leg where drones currently struggle plus Id guess the cost to implement this all over the place could be dirt cheap,,0.0,1iro58y

comment,mdccfvo,Horatio-Leafblower,,6,2025-02-18 00:01:35,,,,They have had this for a good while This is just a new incarnation of these technologies Drones have been flying in mines for years We flew through the new Sydney Metro tunnels over a year ago,,0.0,1iro58y
comment,mdcffe5,AlexHimself,,-1,2025-02-18 00:17:54,,,,Huh This is a new tech developed by MIT,mdccfvo,1.0,1iro58y
comment,mddr9b7,PineappleLemur,,3,2025-02-18 05:07:28,,,,This seems more like a DIY version of an industrial level system that uses much more expensive and accurate relays that also covers a much larger area Indoor radio units for positioning isnt a new thing,mdcffe5,2.0,1iro58y

comment,mda0vr9,__Muninn__,,5,2025-02-17 17:23:04,,,,Its ment to be used in places where GPS can be problematic And while I am sure implementing something like GPS signals inside such places could be done this reads like it would be significantly less expensive implement,md9yzlc,1.0,1iro58y
comment,mdbdaht,blueman0007,,6,2025-02-17 21:05:13,,,,Radar helped by a reflector sticker tag on the wall I dont understand why they say that lidar doesnt work well,md9yzlc,1.0,1iro58y

comment,mdc3mwa,Roguespiffy,,2,2025-02-17 23:13:28,,,,Maybe the drone moves too quickly Every lidar thing Ive seen people use they move really slow with it Im just guessing and have no idea though,mdbdaht,2.0,1iro58y
comment,mddrgap,PineappleLemur,,1,2025-02-18 05:08:54,,,,Lidar definitely works but more taxing But lidar is needed anyway for obstacle avoidance So this is kinda pointless lidar or NIR cameras see in any light conditions,mdbdaht,2.0,1iro58y
