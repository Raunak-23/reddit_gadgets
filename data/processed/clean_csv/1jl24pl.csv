comment,mjzyssh,OrganicKeynesianBean,,123,2025-03-27 12:14:05,,,,The fake RTX 4090 was initially sold to someone for a mere 3800 around 530 well below the RTX 4090s MSRP let alone its current realworld market price This sucks but come on A little common sense goes a long way,,0.0,1jl24pl
comment,mk00rmq,NG_Tagger,,62,2025-03-27 12:27:20,,,,It was sold as nonfunctional according to the article right above what you quote as well as the source Id assume without knowing the prices for nonfunctional GPUs that something like that would bring the price down a fair bit,mjzyssh,1.0,1jl24pl

comment,mk01a34,NG_Tagger,,21,2025-03-27 12:30:44,,,,Scammer makes a 3090 look like a 4090 Puts it up for sale as nonfunctional hoping someone will buy it thinking they can probably get it fixed cheap Because its nonfunctional the legitimacy cant easily be checked with just slotting it in a system The scammers made sure that youd have to take it apart to actually notice the difference,mjzztmi,1.0,1jl24pl
comment,mk2fscy,tophergraphy,,12,2025-03-27 20:30:00,,,,Man the people who would take a gamble on fixing a video card are definitely more likely the type of people to notice though Scammers are rarely ever that smart they think of one step and dont put much further into it,mk01a34,2.0,1jl24pl
