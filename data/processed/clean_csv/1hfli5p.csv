comment,m3gzdj1,therealduckie,,1,2024-12-23 18:17:16,,,,This was my daily carry until recently I no longer have the Dell Axim as I had some health issues and needed money Ive been paring down my life to just the essentials but also trying to minimize tech in my life Also where I live near Asheville we had massive destruction of our infrastructure due to Helene Having a phone with 5G was absolutely necessary So even though I want to move to a more rational smaller phone I am stuck looking at only 4G replacements which will not do If theres another emergency I absolutely NEED to have communication due to my disabilities I want to move away from my 4 yr old OnePlus to a more reasonable phone And normally I would not be able to afford it on my limited income Having a Jelly phone would solve all my issues with the bonus of having a quality phone with the latest tech Thanks,,0.0,1hfli5p
