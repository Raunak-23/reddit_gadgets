comment,mqjprc9,Moto_Guzzisti,,2,2025-05-04 15:11:57,,,,Absolutely lol With a jet engine fuel tank ducting system with control motors frame electricals electronics human interface none of which is present in those videos other than a frame btw It blows my mind that anyone sees these videos and believes its real The fuel tank would need to be much larger than the CGI videos suggest Jet engines are very thirsty at low altitude low speed flight Small jet engines are even worse because theyre turbojet design rather than the more modern turbofan to save space and weight In the video there is no thrust apparatus no lift apparatus no space within that body for a jet engine no space for a fuel tank unless the entire body is a fuel tank with nothing else in there no air intake for the massive amount of air ingested by a jet engine the frame looks like it would barely be strong enough to hold a grown man A jet engine spinning several hundred thousand rpm generates a good amount of rotational inertia You have to have an entire system designed into the vehicle to counteract rotational inertia even more weight and space requirements or you just flip over as soon as you leave the ground There have been fullsized aircraft that struggled to deal with rotational inertia due to improper engineering and thats even with massive flight surfaces wings giving it stability The thing in these videos has NO flight surfaces The problems go on and on This guy made a few AIgenerated CGI videos and has been promoting it as real to get traffic to his socials Dont fall for it When someone makes claims of a paradigm shift gadget that turns everything on its head it is not the time to suspend all disbelief and critical thinking I have a small jet engine that generates 1000 lbs of thrust which is likely too small for an application such as this It weighs almost 300 lbs on its own dry sitting on the bench It is also long enough that youd see it stick out in front or behind the tiny body of the BS we see in those videos 2nd point that number is assuming he MEANT to say 17th the weight of a superbike Not the same thing as saying 7 times lighter which is mathematically impossible,mqiqpil,3.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqt615d,StickyNebbs,,1,2025-05-06 01:16:03,,,,thats cool and all but weve been making 40lb turbojet engines that can lift a person since the 70s with carbon fiber and new material science it is totally conceivable to make that weight also this tech is not new by any means Gravity Industries makes a wearable pack that you attach the jets to your wrist and also only weighs 60 pounds repackaging it into a bike form would take reengineering but far from impossible your anecdotal experience with one jet engine that youre not even sure of the actual performance ability of doesnt make you an expert on the feasibility of these things nor put you in a position to so boldly claim that the entire presentation is fake,mqjprc9,4.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqtwt3a,Moto_Guzzisti,,2,2025-05-06 04:04:38,,,,This has all been covered already Name the model of these turbojets that weigh 40 lbs and can lift a person plus an entire vehicle plus the amount of fuel you would need for more than 1 minute of flight plus all the control motors and ducting you would need on a vehicle that you would not need on a human mounted system given that a jetpack uses the humans own body as the thrust vectoring system not how it works on an actual vehicle etc etc etc also the loooong list of other problems detailed There ARE actually modern small jet engine jet packs that people can wear and fly Sort of For 1 to 3 minutes before it runs out of fuel There is a world of difference between a thing that a human can wear and hover around for a minute or two and a vehicle that requires all the controls and ducting and higher thrust and higher lift and far far more fuel and rotational inertia countermeasure systems that a vehicle would need personal aircraft Theyre big and heavy theyre slow they have 4 massive electric motors driving propellers or ducted fans they have large fuel tanks or even larger batteries You think this scam is real Contact him and ask for a press call so you can film it in person He wont do it If he does I have no problem paying my own way to fly to Italy and film it in person Ill do it tomorrow I wish it were real or even just remotely possible but Im not going to stop using critical thinking just because I want it to be real Thats just religion lol Im not sure why you think I dont know about my own jet engine that Ive rebuilt several times and have used to make speed runs on a motorcycle on the Bonneville salt flats but I certainly never said I dont know the engine Its not an anecdote Its the entire aeronautical industry A paradigm shift gadget that turns an entire industry on its head demands extreme proof Thats why when the Segway was invented they held countless press calls and allowed everyone to film it Every news outlet had their own videos People were allowed to ride it but thats just cherry on top The cake is being allowed to film it rather than shit websites being the only ones regurgitating the obvious CGI released by the inventor a known scammer who stole money from investors on prior projects and looks to be doing the same here Try to find any real news outlet that has covered this thing and filmed it By all means though send him your retirement savings Im sure itll work out Who needs due diligence,mqt615d,5.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mquanvx,Moto_Guzzisti,,1,2025-05-06 05:58:32,,,,There are many brands making jet engines in every size down to tiny things for RC jets The subject is too broad to help someone find one without knowing a lot about the intended project If youre actually interested rather than just trying for a gotcha start googling Mine is about 3 ft long and is from an old aerial unmanned target drone commonly used for test purposes I got it cheap from a private contracting firm while I worked on the White Sands Missile Range It was one from their inventory that never got used when their contract ended and the target drone model was deemed obsolete as tech advancements allowed a shift in target design to much much cheaper design schemes It was good for my use because there are many many parts available for it online It wasnt designed for longevity but I use it for short high speed saltflat runs so its fine for me and I can just rebuild it as necessary Im not going to say the brand or model number There are many options and many brands to choose from if youre going to get into jet powered stuff Hold onto your wallet its an expensive hobby,mqu7s2b,7.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqudiu5,TonyBennett3000,,1,2025-05-06 06:26:07,,,,Ideally I want the smallest turbofan putting out over 500lbs of thrust Id settle for a turbojet as well but the fan would be better from an efficiency standpoint I know a fair amount about turbines in general and have a few RC model ones but finding larger ones is a mystery to me If I could find a williams small turbofan Id be thrilled but I doubt those ever hit the civilian market,mquanvx,8.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqw75yp,Moto_Guzzisti,,1,2025-05-06 14:54:08,,,,Thats a big segment Lots of options from a decent list of manufacturers There are models that arent sold to the civilian market but you can find them online Or make friends with people in defense contracting I once found a crashed rocketdyne engine just outside of WSMR while hiking It was never gonna fly again so I left it there Desert decorations lol,mqudiu5,9.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mqkn0sb,ModestMoose99,,2,2025-05-04 18:00:51,,,,Nah the video looks a little weird and was probably heavily edited but its clearly not AI or CGI It claims to use an electric jet engine and you can see the air displacement hitting the ground clearly throughout the video Im guessing it has an incredibly short runtime and its very weird to ride though,mqhtulf,2.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqntdpp,Moto_Guzzisti,,0,2025-05-05 05:25:32,,,,No it actually is CGI and it is obvious to anyone with any experience in video graphic design The plume of air displacement youre referring to is wait for it CGI Watch any Sci Fi movie You see the same thing Star Wars did it in the 1970s just not as polished Doesnt mean Sci Fi is real You can literally do that with a few basic and wellknown video AI prompts It is also obvious to anyone who has edited videos of real objects that fly or anyone who understands aeronautical engineering or the physics of flying objects This thing does not move correctly It is also literally missing things it needs Things that youd be able to see Anyway see the long and incomplete list of other reasons why this thing is not possibly real Read the entirety of my breakdown comment within my own post about this thing within the rgadgets sub,mqkn0sb,3.0,1kd1qfw
comment,mqrc9zb,ModestMoose99,,1,2025-05-05 19:25:08,,,,Yes I am aware that scifi movies arent real But I doubt some small personal aviation company is making cgi that looks better than big budget movies And while its getting better AI is still easy to spot at this point By all means though if you think you can get AI to make something that looks even close to this show me There might be some kind of video trickeryediting to make this look better but thats definitely a real physical thing with a real person on it Again it probably flies for 5 minutes and is loud as hell but it more than likely exists,mqntdpp,4.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mqli5ix,duhvorced,,0,2025-05-04 20:42:50,,,,This is actually a good argument one that I will happily concede The only other weak argument I could offer here is that you dont need much lift to have a nonzero glide ratio Any configuration and orientation of the vehicle pilot that imparts forward motion while falling arguably results in gliding Albeit with a stillfatal end result And Ill just selfcounterargue that by pointing to the Unpowered flight section of the Wikipedia article on Flying and Gliding Animals that defines gliding thusly Gliding flight falling at an angle less than 45 from the horizontal with lift from adapted aerofoil membranes which is probably as good a definition as any And definitely rules out the vehicle above,mql41c5,7.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mq7wpfg,Maleficent-Owl,,7,2025-05-02 16:14:03,,,,Legally this things weight and top speed are high enough to qualify it as a fullsized aircraft not an ultralight so you would need an actual private pilots license and FAA airworthiness certification for the aircraft We already have the legal framework for this kind of thing and it involves miles of red tape for a new craft like this Im not an expert but thats what a few minutes of searching turned up,mq7ey9x,2.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mqbkzlw,seddit_rucks,,5,2025-05-03 04:30:42,,,,Battlestar Galactica had a brief sequel series in 1980 People were pissed that the OG series had been cancelled so rapidly so the network contacted the producer and gave him the green light for the sequel series but no money for it The original series was far too expensive for a TV show thats one of the main reasons it was canceled So the sequel nixed Apollo Starbuck recycled a lot of the effects and even changed up the premise Galactica had finally found Earth and the crew was trying to figure out what to do next Setting most of the action on contemporary Earth made budgetary sense Want to film a bar scene Go to a regular bar and film it Most of the costumes were offtherack regular clothes Cheap and easy But it wasnt like the Galactica bellied up to Earth and announced their presence They wanted to do some surveillance so they sent a couple spies to the planet to infiltrate modern American society They were given modern clothes currency and transportation that could help them blend in I think there was maybe a hint of Prime Directive going on something like that Anyway and thanks for staying with me here that transportation was pretty cool to 8year old me Believe me just a few years later I was avidly catching as many episodes as I could of Knight Rider Airwolf Streethawk Blue Thunder Viper and all the other shows based around cool vehicles But that sequel series Thats where it started for me Because and I can hardly believe Im typing this but its totally true Battlestar Galactica had flying motorcycles and here is the receipt And believe me again even 8year old me looked at that and thought This is stupid those guys are going to kill themselves I remain convinced that the meager budget would have served the show much better had it been spent on Apollo Starbuck rather than a pair of stupid flying motorcycles Life lesson,,0.0,1kd1qfw

comment,mqawrk3,haarschmuck,,1,2025-05-03 01:42:16,,,,No such thing as flying cars or airbikes The moment a vehicle leaves the ground it is considered and aircraft and falls under the regulatory authority of the FAA You will need a pilots license to operate this as it can operate above the max speed of 55kts Also would never fly something like this Even helicopters can glide when suffering power loss as helicopters use rotating airfoils these are even worse They will drop like a rock if anything happens,,0.0,1kd1qfw
