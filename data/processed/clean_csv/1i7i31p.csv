comment,m8qw7l9,koolaidismything,,3,2025-01-23 16:29:08,,,,Bold to show Apple love outside their subs lol Totally agree though using an almost six year old iPhone I bought new and still works great I was buying a new android every 18 months before I finally gave up,m8pp3vp,4.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8rfa4w,jessepence,,2,2025-01-23 17:56:03,,,,Because anecdotal evidence isnt the whole story For instance my girlfriend has a 12 mini that she complains about constantly and it was really easy to find a thread where someone complains and dozens of people voted me too Im sorry I was rude That ad hominem attack was unnecessary I just hate both Apple and Google equally so I reacted poorly,m8r6ysv,6.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8rirpk,roguebananah,,3,2025-01-23 18:11:47,,,,The 12 mini has 2227 mah battery the 13 PM has a 4352 mah battery and the Pixel 4a has a 3140 mah battery I mean to me if you bought the mini that wasnt an all day battery from day 1 RIP if any Mini owner hasnt changed out a 5 year old battery I personally never understood the Mini as a phone and the reason for buying the Pro Max was purely just battery size and more ram But still Comparing the 4a having a 30 larger battery than the Mini is oranges and bowling balls no matter the company Oh yeah Im with you I like Apple but not to a fan boy level by any means They do wrong as does Google I guess Ive just had way way better luck with Apple even if the stuff is way more expensive up front,m8rfa4w,7.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8wwpl6,EetswaDurries,,3,2025-01-24 14:23:01,,,,The bricking updates were because iPhones were literally freezing and force restarting because the batteries couldnt supply the voltage required for the SoC anymore,m8udq1j,8.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8pa8fh,harmboi,,2,2025-01-23 10:23:58,,,,the first time i even had one i believe Google was on the 6 It was the best quality camera I had ever had on a phone and the speaker was the loudest and clearest speaker of any phone Ive ever had I moved to the current Pixel after and than the 7 and hated them both Moved back to a regular pixel 3a and hated it as well It was just the XL So I cant give you many definitive answers on why it was better to me besides the camera and speaker and the OS just seemed to run smoother The battery also lasted a long time,m8on5n0,6.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8mbk64,Framed-Photo,,13,2025-01-22 22:19:05,,,,Ive never had an update silently install on me as a rooted pixel user I used to get nagged a bit about it but not these days Im still running the december update on my Pixel 6 and havent seen a single notification about it Maybe they started differentiating stock from rooted but they definitely wernt doing that for the longest time Either way its probably worth trying this and having it not work then to have 4 hours of battery life lol,m8masl9,3.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8mchd2,Starfox-sf,,13,2025-01-22 22:23:41,,,,If you are rooted it should fail on verifying update since the boot partition wont pass AVB check And the setting to autoupdate is there in dev settings,m8mbk64,4.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8mhgvd,Framed-Photo,,2,2025-01-22 22:48:53,,,,I know it fails to verify thats why I dont do OTA updates Even when I try to do the recommended method of updating then applying root through magisk to the inactive partition it doesnt work And yes Ive got auto updates disabled but that used to still bug me about updates in my notifications when one was available it no longer does that is what Im saying So if OP wanted to try running an older version without root it might not be a big deal Its at least worth trying considering the alternative,m8mchd2,5.0,1i7i31p

comment,m92iotl,CatpainLeghatsenia,,0,2025-01-25 10:10:52,,,,I wouldnt claim planned obsolescence that fast on Google Its not the first rodeo where google botched an update and had to fix in a future version Lets wait if they address the issue in February or March,m8l2gf9,1.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8l4r2g,Mini_Slider,,347,2025-01-22 19:06:32,,,,Had to go buy my GF a new phone this weekend because her Pixel 4 wouldnt hold a charge for more than 2 hours despite having no issues prior to the update The only fix they offered was to send it in and get a replacement battery and be without a phone for 3 weeks Or mail them the defunct phone and get a 100 credit towards the Google store Needless to say we did not get her another Pixel We went with Samsung,,0.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8mbcel,TotallyNormalSquid,,112,2025-01-22 22:18:02,,,,Maybe phone makers dont give a fuck because they take turns being so awful that people lose track of which theyre boycotting Remember when one Samsung phone was recalled en mass because the batteries were exploding due to a design flaw,m8l4r2g,1.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8my9bv,_RADIANTSUN_,,84,2025-01-23 00:17:15,,,,Samsung handled that with basically the maximum amount of grace that could even remotely be expected of a rollout that massive,m8mbcel,2.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8ouomn,TotallyNormalSquid,,-28,2025-01-23 07:42:03,,,,Actually doing a recall sure thats good Releasing a small time bomb in the shape of a phone Yeah Im not gonna trust their designers for a good while even if they did the right thing when it was discovered,m8my9bv,3.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8pc4y1,_RADIANTSUN_,,14,2025-01-23 10:43:16,,,,It had nothing to do with their designers but rather a manufacturing defect,m8ouomn,4.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8pkvsr,TotallyNormalSquid,,3,2025-01-23 12:02:04,,,,I heard the battery was known to expand by some amount most phones were designed with expansion gaps but those gaps were removed in the design in this case Unless Im totally misinformed seems like a design issue,m8pc4y1,5.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8po6d2,_RADIANTSUN_,,8,2025-01-23 12:27:32,,,,The issue was in the manufacturing process of some of their battery suppliers which caused the positive anode to have sharp micro burrs which pierced the separators between the electrodes if there was slight deformation They relatively quickly fixed the issue and continued on with their more space efficient battery designs and havent had such an issue again Most Note 7s had no issues manufacturing and distribution was just too undifferentiated and the PR focus too high to risk a partial response it seems,m8pkvsr,6.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8qm3x2,GL1TCH3D,,1,2025-01-23 15:41:30,,,,My note 7 still lives I remember them announcing it was less than 1 Sadly I still have mine because refunds were set to process in like 69 months and I couldnt be without a phone especially since I got used to the stylus,m8po6d2,7.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8oo43u,TwoBionicknees,,7,2025-01-23 06:40:49,,,,its not a battery issue If your battery is fine one day and cant last 2 hours the next after an update do you think the battery went bad overnight Sure theyd get it back and maybe a fresh battery would last 3 hours just like an old battery might last 20 hours instead of 30 hours but its still going to be no good Google fucking everyone to force people to upgrade,m8oajud,2.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8r5y43,Own_Potato5593,,1,2025-01-23 17:13:32,,,,3 Years is fine for the most part the OS and Apps tend to out compete the hardware after about that point in some cases actually making things feel very laggy In some cases these updates have been either intentionally or unintentionally used to prod the user into replacing a device they hadnt planned to before After 3 years allow the bootloader to unlock easily which would put the option on the user to continue to update a device with a custom ROM that has updates that work with the device Its fine to offer the updates BUT when the updates come they shouldnt be device degrading which is difficult to do 5 to 7 years down the line given how much tech moves along,m8pytqa,2.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8rqww3,judokalinker,,2,2025-01-23 18:48:57,,,,Looks like Pixel 4a was a 3 year update plan They ended their official updates Sept 2023 This whole update is very confusing,m8r5y43,3.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8t1egm,Own_Potato5593,,2,2025-01-23 22:20:51,,,,At best it was a badly carried out but generally nice idea at worst it was to drive people into upgrading hence the coupon for upgrading I personally think they should have left the devices alone,m8rqww3,4.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8wulvn,Own_Potato5593,,1,2025-01-24 14:11:30,,,,Nah I think like Samsung did with the Note 7 they would fix it first then admit an issue if it didnt work or made things worse,m8t9mv1,6.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8mbrwk,TooStrangeForWeird,,29,2025-01-22 22:20:09,,,,They let you unlock it easily on Pixel devices It doesnt really nag on boot either It might say something about being insecure on the initial splash screen but it doesnt make you click anything or really affect you in any way The real downside is getting stuff like banking apps or iirc Netflix to work Then you have to screw around with Magisk and try to hide the fact that its unlocked,m8mb1h8,2.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8mdzf5,Starfox-sf,,4,2025-01-22 22:31:09,,,,Most Pixel VZW variant excluded And do you trust the average user to be able to jump through hoops like that For fs sake they go into their carrier stores asking to reset their TwatterZuckbook pass And since RCS requires SN cert now to even enable not to mention custom ROM would have a hard time passing basic to begin with,m8mbrwk,3.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8p2med,scummos,,2,2025-01-23 09:03:38,,,,And do you trust the average user to be able to jump through hoops like that I installed GrapheneOS on my Pixel 4a recently just before this update You can literally open a web site connect your phone via USB and click 5 buttons on the website and everything will happen fully automatically Anyone with minimal tech literacy can do that Its a lot of text but basically you connect your phone and click the buttons in order,m8mdzf5,4.0,1i7i31p

comment,m8pkhyh,anarchyx34,,3,2025-01-23 11:58:59,,,,No they absolutely did not throttle all phones If you replaced the battery performance returned to normal Their solution throttling was correct Their mistake was not informing the user and this was before phones reported on their own battery health This was also almost 10 years ago and those phones are STILL receiving security updates,m8p705f,6.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8n3oe7,luluhouse7,,2,2025-01-23 00:45:42,,,,This claim always drives me up the wall The throttling was to prevent spontaneous shutdowns in older batteries I hold on to my phones forever and it was definitely a problem I experienced prior to the update especially since I live in a colder climate Its possible that Apple took advantage of the problem or that it conveniently pushed people to replace their phones earlier though battery replacement will reset the speed but the basis for the change is legitimate Id rather have my phone be a little slow than crash randomly when Im in a bind,m8ldfa9,2.0,1i7i31p
comment,m8n7e0k,lord_mixalot,,1,2025-01-23 01:05:10,,,,Apple did the exact opposite They throttled the phones performance in order to maintain the battery life What they were punished for was not telling people they were doing it You can argue if what they did was a good thing or not but they definitely didnt deliberately kill the battery life,m8ldfa9,2.0,1i7i31p
