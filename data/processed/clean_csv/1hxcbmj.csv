comment,m6n4gbi,Affectionate-Memory4,,4,2025-01-11 21:44:52,,,,In my experience and opinion they were the last ones to routinely outperform the FE cooler design My 3080ti runs dead silent and isnt terribly large compared to some of the others out there No coil whine Hotspot is well under control Every other card in that generation is either louder at the same size or larger for similar performance The FE card is smaller but its also far from silent,m698h7u,3.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69cbfn,mattumbo,,32,2025-01-09 17:49:17,,,,Nividia is definitely moving toward just selling FE cards and cutting out board partners I think well see a gradual transition to that as partners exit the business due to the forced low margins and undercutting as Nividia increases FE supply Might see some board partners stick around to sell the high end specialty cards but Nividia clearly wants to own the base spec market with how much effort theyre putting into FE card design,m697ymn,2.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m6bkfla,Taoistandroid,,4,2025-01-10 00:33:58,,,,EVGA was the only company to give me a better experience than Nintendo EVGA did cross shipping which few companies will do they sent me a new card and I returned my defective one Power color by comparison my 5800 xt reference black had a defect they couldnt provide me a replacement and instead offered me an inferior 5800 xt that didnt even my itx case I argued with them and their stance was to take it or leave it They had a card that had an MSRP only 30 higher that would have fit but they wouldnt budge,m6asbhq,6.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m6954hq,Racxie,,40,2025-01-09 17:14:39,,,,This happened a couple of years ago but essentially the main two reasons were that Nvidia was really bad at communication in ways that came across as intentional and undercut them on the higher end cards to the point where EVGA lost money on those cards,m6945d7,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69cia6,gg06civicsi,,14,2025-01-09 17:50:11,,,,They dont communicate or work well with their partners Apparently their board partners find out the same time we do what the FE prices will be and if its too low it may screw their own projections,m6945d7,2.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m687tc2,drmirage809,,59,2025-01-09 14:23:55,,,,Oh yeah The founders edition cards are not the old blower cooler reference cards of yesteryear These things actually have decent cooling on them Theyre also almost impossible to get in Europe for some reason Dont think Ive ever seen anyone have them in stock,m687883,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m698qlx,nalc,,25,2025-01-09 17:32:13,,,,not the old blower cooler reference cards of yesteryear Oof feeling my age today The Internet was shocked amazed and also a little outraged when the first GeForce FX launched with a squirrel cage blower that exhausted air outside of the case and wasted an entire second expansion card slot That was 22 years ago and prior to that it was just a fan in the center of a radial fin heatsink that blew outward like this,m687tc2,3.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69pujh,drmirage809,,4,2025-01-09 18:54:12,,,,Damn Thats even worse than the blower For all of its faults it at least kicked heat out of the case They were noisy buggers though,m698qlx,4.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m69k5y2,nuenoxnyx,,6,2025-01-09 18:26:59,,,,Wtf thats higher than the power consumption wattage of entire PCs Cant imagine the electricity bill 5060 and 5070 will have plenty of performance for way better power efficiency,m683rvx,1.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69pj5b,soulsoda,,17,2025-01-09 18:52:41,,,,Its not as bad as you think Cards dont operate at their TDP 100 of the time unless your pushing their limits youre unlikely to push the 5090 over 500 watts sustained not peak unless youre doing like 8k modeling or benchmarking Also People would power limit their 4080s4090s taking like 100watts to 50 TDP and would still get better performance Infact a 4090 running at 50 TDP still had about 77 of its base performance based on testing done by Toms hardware A 4090 was 197 faster than a 4070 so 77 x 197 is still 151 better performance over a 4070,m69k5y2,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6bq0ri,HeckXX,,5,2025-01-10 01:04:41,,,,A 4090 was 197 faster than a 4070 Source for this I assume you also mean 97 faster but most benchmarks I find puts the 4090 around 3040 faster than the 4070,m69pj5b,3.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6bvami,soulsoda,,3,2025-01-10 01:34:11,,,,Your statement is correct I meant it as a benchmark s not speed my bad Im also assuming stock performance The 4070 is still the more efficient card regardless especially since you can also under clock that card Personally the sweet spot for good performance is 7080 TDP for either card and you only lose 5 performance in fps,m6bq0ri,4.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6mbw20,nuenoxnyx,,1,2025-01-11 19:12:31,,,,Tomss hierarchy puts the 4070 Super at 33 less 1440p performance 4070 at 49 less But theyre all 97 fps,m6bq0ri,4.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69vi9y,lxs0713,,6,2025-01-09 19:21:25,,,,Yeah I have a feeling its going to be one loud card I guess most PC gamers just use headphones all the time so they dont care but I hate loud PCs Those overbuilt coolers may be overkill and any performance gains you get from them will be negligible but at least theyre able to run full tilt with really low fan speeds I dont have a tiny SFF case so Ill take better noise and thermals over a small card anyway,m683rvx,1.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6aaq4p,tooldvn,,1,2025-01-09 20:35:26,,,,Theres a video that was poster earlier today that PC world did with the Nvidia product manager What they did to achieve cooling in such a small package was to break up the normally 1 long pcb into 3 pcbs This allows airflow to pass through without hitting the wall of the long card Whats cool is that potentially you could take it apart and with some custom connectors mount the GPU pcb somewhere else If you damage the pcie connector you could theoretically just replace that board saving money and the card overall,m683rvx,1.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m68fwlm,saposapot,,37,2025-01-09 15:09:05,,,,Are these cooling improvements also applied to the lower tier cards It would be cool to be back to smaller cards all together I havent found anything about the other models,,0.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6a465x,gameguy600,,8,2025-01-09 20:03:19,,,,RTX 5090 5080 and 5070 will have founders edition models with this style of cooler 5080 and 5090 at least will have the same dual slot cooler if Techpowerup is to be believed 5070 will also be dual slot but the dimensions dont seem to be available 5070 TI on the other hand will be AIB partner only so it wont have this cooler style Size will vary between retailers and their models,m68fwlm,1.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6ax3xz,H3nryb14,,3,2025-01-09 22:25:59,,,,Only 5080 and 5090 will have this style cooler 5070 will have same style cooler as the 40 series,m6a465x,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6c6lqz,saposapot,,1,2025-01-10 02:38:18,,,,Disappointing but if they also shrink down the PCB for the 5070 it could still be good news and an open door to even smaller cards,m6ax3xz,3.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m688wx7,fiftyshadesofseth,,99,2025-01-09 14:30:17,,,,i love the aesthetics of founders edition cards the design is a subtle reminder that it is cutting edge technology aftermarket cards just look to gamerfied to me,,0.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m693pt6,fiftyshadesofseth,,18,2025-01-09 17:07:48,,,,its probably a marginal difference tbh,m691yw6,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m69if3u,ScarletNerd,,11,2025-01-09 18:18:37,,,,Just an anecdote but my previous EVGA 1080ti and 2080ti ran hot and loud maxed out Usually around 7075c with all fans screaming My 4080S FE runs around 60c maxed out and is whisper silent Huge difference Granted I dont have a nonFE card to compare against but this FE cooling seems to be better than any I ever had aftermarket Looks way nicer too I plan on always trying to snag FE cards in the future after this experience,m691yw6,2.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m69ltba,snicker422,,3,2025-01-09 18:34:56,,,,The 5090 FE cooler is probably very efficient compared to 3rd party designs considering its size and assuming that Nvidia has reasonable thermal targets However that doesnt mean it will have the absolute best cooling performance,m691yw6,2.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m6adwy0,tooldvn,,1,2025-01-09 20:50:56,,,,Check this out for how they got the cooling done in the 5090 They split the big pcb into 3 allowing more pass through airflow,m691yw6,2.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m68abql,Vresa,,43,2025-01-09 14:38:26,,,,Most of the size of a graphics card is actually the cooler assembly The board itself is surprisingly small A lot of it comes down the altering the PCBs dimensions to allow better airflow around the board which lets the cooling be more effiecent so they can shrink the size of the heat sink needed I would assume Nvidia took the RD time to ensure their new custom PCB design and cooler assembly can keep the GPU from overheating on their founder edition cards Though weirder mistakes have happened Well have to see how it handles when the performance embargo is lifted and content creators can compare Nvidias Founders Edition spec with their board partners like ASUS,m687dhm,1.0,1hxcbmj
comment,m68iovk,danielv123,,12,2025-01-09 15:23:41,,,,Also the coolers for the 40 series were massively oversized There is speculation that they thought they couldwould have to give them more power to hit performance targets,m68abql,2.0,1hxcbmj

comment,m69wb3g,Vresa,,4,2025-01-09 19:25:16,,,,Im assuming you mean the 5080 vs 5090 here Its almost certainly cost cutting andor a manufacturing throughput limit The custom PCB for the 5090 is likely pretty expensive to manufacture compared to the standard nvidia board since it would require new tooling It could also be the case that they simply cannot make this PCB form factor at the scale to meet the demand for the 5080 Since the 5090 is a lower selling card at a higher price point its easier for them to offset a higher cost of component production without hurting their profit margin This likely isnt the case for the 5080s lower cost and higher production targets,m69001h,3.0,1hxcbmj
