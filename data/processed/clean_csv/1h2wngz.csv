post,1h2wngz,chrisdh79,FTC: Most smart device makers break the law by not adequately informing consumers of software support terms | Companies would rather drop support on old products and then sell you a new one,3191,2024-11-29 21:42:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1h2wngz/ftc_most_smart_device_makers_break_the_law_by_not/,77.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,lzmf2a1,Q3b3h53nu3f,,243,2024-11-29 22:00:17,,,,Wish they would add right to repair into the conversation It is not fair for consumer products to sell you the product and keep ownership of the software Cite Chevy goes as far as saying you may own the car but not the software If you buy something shouldnt promote the practice that companies software prevents anyone but the company to diagnose and repair This slippery slope forces the consumer to service through the dealer BMW is piloting this on some models,,0.0,1h2wngz
comment,lzx3avj,ngoni,,4,2024-12-01 19:44:17,,,,Theres a lot of manufacturers John Deere and Apple being some of the first and most openly egregious that are taking steps towards making it impossible for owners or independent repair shops to fix their products The other half and I think a big part is software support A big part of that is security updates that keep people safe This will likely get government attention as device makers move into the health and home safety markets Most people justifiably dont want to junk expensive things just because a 12 yr warranty is over Manufacturers get away with this in the healthcare industry because theres so many layers between the service and the consumer almost no one actually cares about senseless systemic waste The other big part of software updates is the over reliance on cloud to make devices work You can have perfectly functional gear that becomes a paperweight in a day once a bean counter says to turn off the largely useless cloud infrastructure behind it,lzmf2a1,1.0,1h2wngz

comment,lzoiivm,JerkBreaker,,-16,2024-11-30 06:52:47,,,,It is not fair for consumer products to sell you the product and keep ownership of the software Cite Chevy goes as far as saying you may own the car but not the software We cant abuse the meaning of right to repair or it will not happen You dont get the schematics of the circuits in the products you purchase or the recipe to Coca Cola for buying a bottle You should get a binary and no further restrictions Right to repair means at best exposing pins for a programming port somewhere on the board as well as disabling code signing and secure boot None of these is particularly great for security on a massmarket item,lzmf2a1,1.0,1h2wngz
comment,lzolbcz,Xin_shill,,24,2024-11-30 07:22:13,,,,No the right should extend to each of those products as well Anyone who produces this electronic waste with the expectation of abandoning it without the ability of 3 rd parties to update and configure them should be subject to legal penalties,lzoiivm,2.0,1h2wngz
comment,lzos4ck,JerkBreaker,,3,2024-11-30 08:36:56,,,,I have developed products in this category selling in the millions and managing a few percent of the electricity grid people with skillsets to reverseengineer and update rinkydink consumer products like these will be much more effective at reducing ewaste by either tackling it directly or by helping to avoid it in the first place As difficult as it is to get people to update the supported software on their devices when they are literally paid to do just that it will actually be impossible to get consumers to change software on the smart plug that they got as a Christmas gift in the name of reducing ewaste,lzolbcz,3.0,1h2wngz
comment,lzqwvlu,Xin_shill,,2,2024-11-30 18:23:59,,,,So you are endorsing a company spending a ton of resources and making every attempt to lock out their device from users actually owning it or being able to take it over at any part of its lifecycle or even after the company abandoning it If the option was pretty straightforward for using a new tool to take over the old device the users would be more likely to not create ewaste,lzos4ck,4.0,1h2wngz

comment,lzpriik,divDevGuy,,-4,2024-11-30 14:23:28,,,,Thats not accurate and hasnt been for a number of years Pixel Fold and all 6 and 7 series Pixel phones are guaranteed a minimum of 3 years of Android version updates and 5 years of security updates from date of launch All Pixel 8 and 9 series phones get 7 years of both Android version and security updates from date of launch Even once the hardware is no longer receiving updates it still remains largely functional It may not be as secure as possible but after a couple years of updates at the OS version level itll be frozen at most of the critical bugs have been discovered and worked out Most apps will continue to be updated and receive bug fixes and enhancements including many Google apps If its a quality app it should gracefully degrade functionality if possible when the OS or hardware doesnt support a desired function If you participate in high risk activities where you need a secure phone you probably arent relying on a 5 year old cell phone Not that the phone becomes obsolete but the hardware wears out Screens crack buttons fail batteries go bad phone carrier network changes etc It just becomes not worth it to continue to repair or unreliable to trust for daily activities For casual everyday usage for communications web browsing playing games etc its quite likely no more of a security issue than anything else in modern life,lzn141h,1.0,1h2wngz

comment,lzzk0ym,Moses_Rockwell,,1,2024-12-02 04:16:11,,,,I remember there was a bill in the US Senate or House that would have mandated the standardization of low voltage power cords for a huge number of personal electronic devices This idea was buried by the multiple industry lobbyists The Swiss or the Finns iirc had implemented this law well over ten years ago and the benefit was immediate Cellphones headphones speakers all kinds of gadgets are powered by 5v DC power and the same goes for the battery chargers for the litany of gadgets that use them The main reason for an iPhone and a Samsung just one example although quite a massive one to have separate charging cords and even different types for changing models is to need and have their respective owners pay for them separately The waste of money and resources on this is just thatwaste on a scale thats hard to comprehend and even harder to find much publicly available US material to begin to do so for obvious reaons of course,,0.0,1h2wngz
