comment,m62i8lf,ymmvmia,,2,2025-01-08 16:21:04,,,,Absolute worst time though While i happened to get a deal on the used market this is the worst possible time to buy a gpu NEW Best time would have been November and December Tons of deals and there was more availability The GPU companies planned on selling out their stock of current generation before the launch of the new generations as usual So theres barely any deals right now and many gpus that were available are discontinued or gone or marked up Like the RX 7900 GRE is discontinued and now unobtainium though to be fair it was a limited launch as it was a former China only gpu Now if tariffs do happen as I suspect they will maybe with an exception for certain items like computer hardware though I doubt ANY TIME before tariffs start is the best time to buy a gpu lol So I agree with you though its a gamble as trump likes to walk back lots of his promises as evidenced by his first term Its just awful that its tied with new generation graphics card launches normal advice would be to wait 26 months from now But its totally possible that with tariffs new graphics cards will have the prices raised by 2550 50 due to knockon effects and trade war consequences 25 is JUST the tariffs So the idea of a new cheaper performance per dollar generation just EVAPORATES overnight And as soon as gpu prices start climbing due to tariffs the used markets prices will follow And the used markets supply will very quickly become limited then become HIGHLY predatory similar to the gpu shortages of a few years ago with the gpu mining craze,m625ral,2.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63p3ql,420smokekushh,,3,2025-01-08 19:50:30,,,,TSMCs new semiconductor manufacturing facility in Phoenix Arizona will face production costs approximately 30 higher than its Taiwanbased operations when it begins mass production in early 2025 The increased expenses stem from higher tariffs and transportation costs associated with importing necessary materials from Taiwan The Arizona facility will start producing 10000 12inch wafers monthly using a 4 nm node with plans to double output to 20000 wafers at full capacity Four major technology companiesApple NVIDIA AMD and Qualcommhave committed to purchasing chips from the plant for their AI and highperformance computing needs The 445hectare facility highlights ongoing challenges in Americas semiconductor industry Despite the aim to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing the plant must import materials from Taiwan to maintain production quality revealing gaps in the US semiconductor supply chain This overseas dependency drives up operational costs significantly While TSMCs investment marks an essential step in rebuilding domestic capacity the substantial cost difference between US and Taiwanese production raises questions about longterm viability TSMC has already begun trial production at the site and plans to expand operations with additional phases The companys Phase 2 facility is completed and equipment is being installed while future expansions aim to produce 2 nm chips by 2028 However unless the cost gap narrows the higher production expenses could impact the plants competitiveness in the global semiconductor market even competing with its own Taiwanese facilities where customers could decide to use Taiwanese fabs due to lower costs Meanwhile TSMC continues to expand its Taiwan operations with plans to build new 2 nm facilities in Kaohsiungs Science Park starting next year,m62ps2g,8.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m62pmle,ShrimpCrackers,,3,2025-01-08 16:57:13,,,,Thats a drop in the bucket towards what Taiwan spends In actuality its equivalent to like 200 billion And for TSMC they have to export their supply chain since the USA doesnt have it which means chips being manufactured in the USA are at least 3 times more expensive and 2 generations behind Its mainly meant so if Taiwan gets obliterated at least the US military and some sectors might have some chips But what do I know my only sources are TSMC employees that have been shipped over to Arizona and my company also helps handle their transition,m624he2,5.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m632jg0,rudimentary-north,,3,2025-01-08 18:02:05,,,,Well great then it makes far more sense to build chip factories here than to export the silica to China where they can insert malicious code into their chips and then increase the cost of reimporting their products via a tariff,m632c44,10.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63392s,MildlyExtremeNY,,0,2025-01-08 18:05:35,,,,Thats not the goal of tariffs Jesus Christ Its cheaper to export the silica and reimport the chips because of labor costs The idea of tariffs is to make the USlaborcost based manufacturing more competitive compared to Chinese labor Its the same idea as the CHIPs act making domestic manufacturing more competitive just using a different mechanism But people like you want to scream about tariffs being horrible and the CHIPs act being great solely because of who is advocating each policy,m632jg0,11.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m635599,MildlyExtremeNY,,1,2025-01-08 18:14:44,,,,No it isnt Because there is no ongoing incentive from the CHIPs act once the factories are built We built automobile factories in Detroit and when the economic conditions changed they moved to Mexico and elsewhere We built textile factories all over New England and the MidAtlantic We used to manufacture over 90 of our clothes In my own lifetime we manufactured 5060 of our clothes Now its 3 The existence of the physical factories did not result in continued domestic production because once economic conditions change producers will respond accordingly So you need to change the economic conditions Plopping a factory down somewhere doesnt do any good if it still costs 125 to produce something someone else can produce at 1 and sell to the same market,m633tlc,13.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m6378r9,rudimentary-north,,2,2025-01-08 18:24:41,,,,youre talking about solving an economic problem but my understanding is that they want to produce chips domestically because of national security If domestic production of chips is truly a national security issue we should happily be subsidizing domestic production out of our national security budget Taxing imports is an incredibly indirect way to solve that problem,m635599,14.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m639jhf,MildlyExtremeNY,,1,2025-01-08 18:35:36,,,,The national security issue is a red herring because chips arent the only thing we need to manufacture domestically I only addressed it because someone brought it up as an excuse If it truly were a national security issue we wouldnt be paying foreign chip makers to build factories wed pay American companies As I mentioned our clothing production is down to 3 of our consumption If it costs 4 to make a Tshirt here but 2 to make it in Asia and 1 to ship it here then US producers cant be competitive If you slap a 2 tariff on the Asian Tshirt then yes the cost to the consumer goes up but the US production becomes more competitive We used to manufacture automobiles And steel And tools But then we globalized the economy and there is much cheaper labor available overseas so tens of millions of American jobs have been lost,m6378r9,15.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63b4v1,rudimentary-north,,2,2025-01-08 18:43:15,,,,The national security issue is a red herring because chips arent the only thing we need to manufacture domestically I only addressed it because someone brought it up as an excuse If it truly were a national security issue we wouldnt be paying foreign chip makers to build factories wed pay American companies The biggest recipient of CHIPs funding was Intel a US company TSMC is a Taiwanese company a nation with whom we have good relations theyre our ally against China Similar with Samsung South Korea and North Korea Micron is based in the US Global Foundries is based in the US,m639jhf,16.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m6947d1,TheAmenMelon,,1,2025-01-09 17:10:10,,,,So Im not necessarily arguing that its good policy but I think the concern with it being a foreign company doesnt really come into play in scenarios where having a domestic foundry becomes a national security issue In the case where some sort of international event where needing to have domestic access to advanced chips happens it doesnt actually matter that the company is foreign its moot Its going to be filled with US workers in the middle of US territory even if the company even if the company were to shift policy to be hostile to the US they cant effectively do anything since everything is in the US Compared to a scenario where this doesnt happen the US would effectively have to invade the country try not to destroy any infrastructure PLUS would have to prevent any sabotage to equipment One of the issues with tariffs though which I think is partly why it was condemned and this actually happened last time Trump was president is that tariffs are a really heavyhanded and blunt instrument to go about accomplishing the goal of trying to bring domestic production back and doesnt actually achieve the stated goal So the reason why this is a pretty heavy handed method is that raising tariffs on Chinese goods doesnt actually cause companies to shift their supply chain back to the US what it does cause and what actually happened in the previous administration is that it causes companies to shift productionsupply chains to the next cheapest location For example when this happened previously companies shifted production from China to places like India Vietnam BangladeshCambodia because guess what those places are still cheaper to produce than the United States So actually to do this you would need to apply a Tariff to China and then also to all the other countries that could potentially do this cheaper,m62x98k,6.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63023c,Solar_Nebula,,1,2025-01-08 17:50:09,,,,The other thing people seem to miss is the tariffs will be assessed on a lower wholesale value than the full retail price Apples iPhones for example only cost around half as much to produce as they retail for For the USmade stuff theyll have to pay say an average of 40 tariffs on the parts they import but that doesnt mean the final cost of the laptop goes up 40 it just means the parts will be assessed at whatever they cost BEFORE shipping assembly and markup on the final product In other words likely half the retail cost of the laptop will be subject to tariffs A 1200 USassembled laptop wouldnt just spring up 40 in price it would include the cost of tariffs on some 600 in parts plus potentially additional markup from the manufacturer placing it around 1500 Thats a 25 increase at most not 40 And thats assuming the Trump administration levies the full tariffs on every country involved in the supply chain plus 100 on China Hes been happy with SOME tariffs on China in the past building SOME of the border wall and getting SOME concessions in the renegotiation of NAFTA As long as he can say he made a Great Deal hes happy Blanket tariffs on the entire global supply chain isreally unlikely,m61w0bu,1.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m627dhg,DarKliZerPT,,-48,2025-01-08 15:25:56,,,,Untrue The reason for them to lower prices accordingly to tarifftax cuts is competition Those whod attempt to increase their profit margin by keeping the price the same would be undercut by competitors In this example of game theory the profitmaximising move is to decrease the price and maintain a competitive profit margin After all a huge profit margin on a sale is no good if you cant sell The only way to maintain high profit margins would be through monopolyoligopoly which is not the case for laptops If it were prices would already be much higher As for recordlevel profits its what youd hope for in a growing economy You surely wouldnt complain about recordlevel wages,m62107v,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m62mppg,DarKliZerPT,,-2,2025-01-08 16:43:02,,,,First were discussing the elimination of tariffs which are essentially a sales tax on foreign products not corporate tax cuts Heres an example on how in Portugal the temporary elimination of VAT for food products led to a corresponding decrease in prices of affected items The tax cut was passed onto the consumers Since you mentioned it as for corporate taxes their incidence is upon workers consumers and shareholders and the proportions are not known Most defenders of corporate tax cuts argue that they should be cut to attract investment a race to the bottom with other countries where corporate investment could be more favourable not necessarily to increase worker wages or decrease prices for consumers This paper concludes that improve aggregate efficiency but exacerbate inequality We find that private incomes increase by 97 billion and tax revenues decline by 88 billion implying a net aggregate output gain of 9 billion equivalent to approximtely 004 of GDP In the the model reducing corporate tax revenues by 1 generates an additional 010 in output implying substantial efficiency gains from corporate tax cuts We also find that the gains from corporate tax cuts disproportionately flow to those with high incomes We estimate that approximately 56 of the gains accrue to firm owners 12 accrue to executives 32 accrue to highpaid workers and 0 flow to lowpaid workers When we adjust these calculations to allow for the empirical fact that many workers hold equity portfolios we estimate that 78 of the gains flow to the top 10 of the earnings distribution and 22 flow to the bottom 90,m62j3pa,9.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m68sktg,DarKliZerPT,,1,2025-01-09 16:13:34,,,,Economists say it happens and more importantly lasts when there are high barriers to entry If Lidl decided to join in on the oligopoly new competitors would quickly appear to undercut them grabbing all of the oligopolys consumers and forcing them to lower prices You can only keep an oligopoly alive if there is a high barrier to entry that heavily discourages the appearance of new competitors Otherwise someone is eventually going to allocate resources to compete with you destroying your cartel out of their own selfinterest,m68rfpk,7.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m64aprm,iamezekiel1_14,,2,2025-01-08 21:35:12,,,,Yeah weirdly when you looked into it Chrome had formally abandoned it way before Steam did so it actually scared me a bit in some respects as to how protected I may or may not have been Where I was a Firefox user I wasnt really exposed until they effectively abandoned it last September after providing effectively a years warning that it was coming legacy support,m63pvm3,8.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m62j1u5,robby_synclair,,1,2025-01-08 16:25:05,,,,In the 30s America made things Free trade is great when goods are going bot ways The US putting a tariff on Canadian lumber and then Canada putting a tariff on the furniture thats made from that lumber is redundant Provided the value going back and forth is equal When the product is only going one direction it is not the same story By the next decade manufacturing was so strong it helped the US win ww2 Blaming the depression on a tariff bill is narrow minded at best,m620xma,3.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63btmr,Giantmidget1914,,1,2025-01-08 18:46:32,,,,Cool story but manufacturing was already here Fact the consumer will pay the tariffs Fact companies will not lose money charging the consumer for the tariffs Everyones still getting paid So please tell me how higher prices and the corporate bottom line not changing is going to create an environment where it makes sense to spend millionsbillions in up front hard costs and much higher ongoing labor costs rather than continue to make profits doing nothing maybe even raising prices further to blame tariffs while posting record profits Also by the next decade we were at war Mobilizing a nation tends to spur economic output Its also what brought us huge increases in income tax to fund the effort so I guess we can look forward to that Accepting the great depression recovery was all due to manufacturing is narrow minded at best,m62j1u5,4.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63fhg7,robby_synclair,,1,2025-01-08 19:04:03,,,,Ok ill try to explain Yes the consumer will pay more at first This is good because it will create completion which will lower prices If you can start a company and be competitive in pricing with someone over seas then they have to lower their prices If they just eat the cost then their profits go down and so do their share prices You could be making clothes toys furniture whatever Yes mobilizing for war did spur economic output but liek you said the factories were already here Because tariffs made doing your manufacturing abroad unfeasable We just changed their uses Right now the factories dont exist so if pearl harbor happened today we would not be able to mobilize in the same way This conversation isnt about about defence though I never said that depression recovery was because of manufacturing just that tariffs werent the cause But since you bring it up putting Americans to work was the solution to the depression not moving labor abroad It was a lot of public works projects though not necessarily manufacturing,m63btmr,5.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63qnxt,Giantmidget1914,,2,2025-01-08 19:58:01,,,,Yes the consumer will pay more at first Correction The consumer will pay more Peroid This is good because it will create completion which will lower prices It will create competition AT HIGHER PRICES Still shit for the consumer so far If you can start a company and be competitive in pricing with someone over seas then they have to lower their prices Ah I see youre banking on companies taking a hit to profit so they can bring prices down Thats hilarious Also you know labor costs are not part of the tariff right So how is a new company paying 725hr going to compete with a company that pays 7week Lower prices Maybe but lets not forget about the tariff on materials If they just eat the cost Lets not talk about fantasy This is so remote its not worth discussing further Yes mobilizing for war did spur economic output but liek you said the factories were already here Because tariffs made doing your manufacturing abroad unfeasable We just changed their uses Right now the factories dont exist so if pearl harbor happened today we would not be able to mobilize in the same way Exactly So where is the company making the extra money to open a new factory Also thats a long effort before they even break ground I guess youre expecting me to pay double for a laptop in the interim Thatll definitely help the economy Or we could hang on to tech longer which will also happen but thatll effect companies like Apple Intel AMD etc which happens to be where Americans retirement investments live We can bail out the companies again but theres still a world of hurt for the consumer The concept sounds great on paper Then again so does pure socialism In practice well weve seen this before,m63fhg7,6.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63silq,robby_synclair,,1,2025-01-08 20:07:06,,,,Your main issue is you dont understand competition If 5 companies are selling widgets then the consumer will pick the lowest priced widget If only 1 company is selling widgets then they get to pick the price Now lets say I want to start selling widgets The only way for me to do it is to go to China and get a factory to make them for me Then I have to figure out the logistics if getting them here Then I have to figure out distribution once they get here Now lets tarrifs are high enough that Big Widget has to raise their prices 60 Now i can make widgets in my garage and still sell them to the local store at lower prices than Big Widget The only way for Big Widget to compete with me is to either eat profits to put me out of business But you said we shouldnt even entertain this fantasy Or move production to the US to bypass the tariffs,m63qnxt,7.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63wmp0,Giantmidget1914,,2,2025-01-08 20:27:15,,,,Lets assume what you wrote above is 100 accurate The price was 100 It goes up 60 on goods I cant avoid Its now 160 The widget you produce is 150 even though materials are still foreign but ignoring that The consumer is still paying 150 where they used to pay 100 But thats going to create competition to bring prices down Ok But its now 125 for what was 100 We cant bring prices down to 100 because we couldnt afford the labor costs Further even if we bring the production back and somehow source everything ourselves the price is higher because its now produced with more expensive labor The only benefit to the whole thing is Trump wont be able to blame anyone else If you truly believe that increasing costs is going to bring prices down I have nothing more to add Its been a healthy debate Good luck out there,m63silq,8.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63yxv1,robby_synclair,,1,2025-01-08 20:38:28,,,,Your almost there Now where is the labor cost going Instead of shipping all of that money to China it goes to American laborers More laborers are needed More techs are needed More managers are needed etc We are back to competition This doesnt just affect this field every industry is pulling from the same US citizens This causes wages to go up across the board And the new prices are able to be absorbed Helping human rights and environmental impact at the same time All that being said Trump is not the one to lead this cause So I have little faith in it working Cheers mate,m63wmp0,9.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m64bwos,Giantmidget1914,,2,2025-01-08 21:41:00,,,,A larger supply of workers does not raise wages Conversely available jobs do not equate to good pay nor jobs people actually want And you still havent explained how prices are coming down from the higher costs You say they can be absorbed with higher wages but looking at the data were more productive than ever now and we arent getting paid Whats going to drive companies to pay more How are the companies that now pay more going to afford it Oh right back to the fantasy Theyll take it from profits,m63yxv1,10.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m61wv2b,Pythagoras_314,,5,2025-01-08 14:27:53,,,,The thing is you cant just move production over to the US overnight It could take 10 years to secure a manufacturing location get the required equipment and on top of that employment and getting things actually up and running A better solution would be subsidizing companies to encourage them to manufacture domestically Tariffs may work in the longrun but in the short term everyone hurts,m61uect,2.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m67tibp,TitaniumDragon,,4,2025-01-09 12:52:45,,,,Trump caused massive inflation in his first turn when he gave away tons of money in his last year in office There was a lot of inflation in 2020 but it was hidden by oils price tanking When oils price recovered in 2021 and 2022 all the 2020 inflated prices stayed high but everything dependent on the price of oil went up in price as well Moreover Trumps hand out programs mostly didnt hand out money until 20212023 after he left office I worked for one of those programs Getting the money out was a logistical nightmare because nothing was set up beforehand so all the programs were very slapdash and the first programs led to tons of fraud Plus he literally just handed out thousands of dollars in 2020 and 2021 directly to everyone The reason why inflation is down now is because Trumps ridiculous overspending cutting taxes increasing spending finally ran out,m642ph4,2.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63xxf4,CondescendingShitbag,,1,2025-01-08 20:33:32,,,,Its not an argument its the straightforward facts of the matter Less than 50 of the country voted for either specific candidate Those who didnt cast a vote dont count Thats how it works You can make whatever assumptions you wish about how those who didnt cast a vote might have voted but at the end of the day thats all it isassumption You could just as easily make the same claim that the people who didnt vote would have voted for Harris but didnt because they bought into the notion Harris was already going to win without their votes Since assumptions dont add anything productive to the conversation Ill stick with the identifiable facts,m63utf2,4.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m6500lp,akc250,,-1,2025-01-08 23:46:22,,,,Youre arguing over semantics This is not purely assumptions The FACT is too many eligible voters stayed at home Whether its because they dont trust the democratic process theyre indifferent they think going to vote is a burden rather than a life or death situation or they are ok with Trump being president We dont know for sure but the one thing thats for sure is these voters lacked the intelligence to understand the value of true democracy and how many people died for their right to vote and how many oppressive regimes out there currently prevent their citizens from voicing their opinions So do these people who didnt vote deserve the blame for Trump being elected In my opinion absolutely,m63xxf4,5.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63acfh,HaxusPrime,,1,2025-01-08 18:39:27,,,,I think tariffs that significantly adversely affect important sectors like the tech sector are bad Considering the US is at the forefront of tech and information this will impact us greatly The best solution here is to encourage and incentivise domestic production Not only would that increase jobs on US soil but it would drastically lessen our reliance on foreign produced goods The downside is that while one of the goals is to lessen the financial burden on US consumers domestic production may be more expensive assuming todays pre Trump tariff state proposed The problem with outsourced production of tech hardware and software abroad are the security concerns of that tech being shared or easier to be stolen by other countries Imagine Taiwan were to be successfully or even unsuccessfully invaded The impact to the US would be even greater than tariffs alone So we need a strategic approach if we we to impose tariffs When how to do it how much etc All need to be addressed concerning domestic production vs foreign production and tariffs alike,,0.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m641z8p,SiIverwolf,,1,2025-01-08 20:53:00,,,,Taxes like VAT or GST Australia are added at the time of purchase and paid directly and thus transparently by the consumer and are on generally all goods regardless of origin Tariffs are charged at import to the importer and thus raise the base cost of the item assuming said importer doesnt want to take a loss But the consumer doesnt see WHY the increase in price just that its gone up As an example lets say 2 countries introduce new taxes Country 1 charges a 10 purchase tax to consumers and Country 2 charges a 10 tariff to importers Item is imported in both countries at a cost of 100 and the importers also then directly sell the product to consumers with a 10 markup on their import costs at 110 Country 1 introduces their sales tax of 10 Importer still charges 110 but thats now 110 11 sales tax for a total of 121 visible on the consumers receipt Country 2 introduces their 10 import tariff Importer is now paying 110 to have the product imported so still wanting their 10 markup they now charge 121 In both instances consumers now pay 121 but sales tax means customers can see WHY the product has increased tariffs hide the reasoning making it easier to shift blame for why,m63t9j7,1.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m64533p,enki941,,1,2025-01-08 21:07:57,,,,I appreciate the reply Ill preface this by saying that I am in the US and am only casually familiar with VAT but whenever I see anything listed for sale on a UK website it always has the postVAT price and says VAT Included or something similar I dont know if that is the case universally but it seems like VAT is equally hidden and consumers are only seeing the total price including VAT In the US sales tax is always added after the fact and clearly itemized Also my understanding of VAT is that it is actually added to each step of the sale process Manufacturers get it from the distributor who gets it from the retailer who gets it from the consumer who ultimately pays for it all in the end Or something like that where each leg of the transaction gets credit for the VAT they paid vs what they collected from the other side If I am not mistaken UK also charges hefty import duties as well As do most other countries Not only on purchases from stores but even on persontoperson transactions I know this because many people in those countries often ask for an item to be marked as a gift to get around paying insane import fees So it seems like the UK and many other countries get hit by fees all around To be clear Im not saying adding import tariffs to the US would be a good thing Im personally against it as I dont want the costs of good to go up either directly or indirectly I just find it a bit hypocritical when peopleorganizations in other countries talk about how bad this is and yet dont equally complain about their own system which is even worse But based on what Ive seen it seems like the US not charging import fees on most items is actually the unusual outlier compared to most other countries Which is why our products are so inexpensive compared to other countries Well one of the reasons,m641z8p,2.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m64ex9h,SiIverwolf,,0,2025-01-08 21:55:20,,,,Import duties are something paid I think the world over Here in Australia if I import personally something valued at over 1000 then I have to pay those myself Tariffs are different in that theyre generally used in a much more targeted fashion at specific origins or industries Here for instance we have a specific luxury vehicle import tax which was ostensibly meant to protect Australian car manufacturing which has now still left our shores and were still left paying 200000 for a new Audi or BMW very generalised and somewhat hyperbolic but you get the point Youre correct that sales tax is the whole way through the chain Our GST is a goods and services tax which basically means if someone is getting an invoice for something on that invoice there is a line that adds 10 GST which is then incorporated into the total This is why in my example I simplified it to from importer to consumer Because even without taxes theres also then all the markups that happen in that chain so each layer gets their piece of the pie Sticker prices on shelves for consumers will usually have a singular GST inclusive price with something like inc GST on the sticker but our receipts will still have that itemised which was what I said above,m64533p,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m64l6cf,flompwillow,,1,2025-01-08 22:26:18,,,,Nope I am correct Tariffs if you care to study the macroeconomic impacts will generally cause 1 Protected domestic industries to expand 2 Consumer costs likely rise during the transition 3 Trade partners generally retaliate with their own tariffs Point three is to be expected we dont sell shit in China which is the target and the US will start consuming what we do sell currently our raw materials China can choose to not buy our food Thats totally fine and we can protect that industry Its pretty amazing that people dont even realize that this is how China shifted so much of the US industry to China over the last three decades It works but not in a one two or even five year timescale It takes time which Americans dont seem to appreciate,m64iux0,2.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m64pxg6,curtrohner,,1,2025-01-08 22:50:54,,,,Tariffs can work if used like a scalpeltargeting specific issuesbut Trump wants to use them like a sledgehammer hello SmootHawley Sure they might eventually force more domestic production but only because the economic mess hed create would push wages down to compete with foreign labor costs The rich Theyll protect their profits while everyone else gets squeezed And lets be realif a foreign product costs 1x and a US product costs 15x raising the foreign price to 125x doesnt magically lower the domestic price The structural advantages that make foreign goods cheaperlike lower labor costs or relaxed regulationsarent things we can replicate here So wed just end up with higher prices across the board and a weaker economy,m64l6cf,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m62pqb3,thput,,4,2025-01-08 16:57:47,,,,To further this when the costs of a good increases a company needs to adjust by either increasing the price of the good or decreasing other costs The executives of a company have an obligation to stabilize profits and when they can increase them JimJimmery is right that a company cannot operate at a loss They may have investors expecting returns There may be creditors expecting repayment and interest there may be customers expecting products already in order Depending on the product there may be customers that use the product to create their products Much like raw materials components circuit boards laptops Imagine that copper is mostly imported If the total cost of importing copper increases we will pay more for what we would normally use I happen to be a chip manufacturer and now I need to produce some chips and my copper costs have increased Well if everyones cost increased then prices would increase to offset the costs Unless we could source elsewhere where the good could be found lower In that same manufacturing chain the cost gets passed on to each link until we have a finished product that is out in sale at an increased price This is how inflation impacts prices How scarcity impacts prices and how consumers ultimately pay the price for government decisions But the same goes for subsidizing products The general public pays for that indirectly as well Through either taxes paid or if subsidized by tax breaks deficits or loss of programs due to a lack of resources,m62fhii,8.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63suck,CocaineIsNatural,,1,2025-01-08 20:08:40,,,,Once again if costs increase for every manufacturer then those costs are passed on I used to work for a computer manufacturer And it wasnt charge what you want but what are others charging This caused profits to be low and thus the buffer to eat losses was not large So you cant just eat larger losses And when others raise prices to cover the losses then you can also raise prices to cover losses People dont like companies that raise prices But are far more tollerant if the company says they are raising prices because of a tariff So they can raise prices without the negative press Do you think companies dont raise prices when the costs significantly increase,m63oe0b,9.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63duui,Kythorian,,1,2025-01-08 18:56:15,,,,You typically cant just raise prices to offset a tax increase You may want to raise prices because a tax increased but the market needs to accept the new price If the market was willing to accept that new higher price it would be raised already Without the tariff if you raise prices people will just buy from a competitor instead With the tariff all the competitors have to raise their prices too Of course some people might just not buy at all at the new price but its still going to force the prices up for everyone,m621cz9,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63g4v2,Kythorian,,3,2025-01-08 19:07:13,,,,How do you explain President McKinleys famous success with the economy through tariffs That didnt happen The tariffs you are talking about increased prices for consumers and stifled the economy It just also happened to be in the middle of a simultaneous gold boom population boom and territory boom so the economy grew in spite of his tariffs not because of them The increases in prices from McKinleys tariffs were so unpopular that it directly led to the very first peacetime income tax in order to maintain government revenues as the tariffs were removed and Joe Biden keeping most of Trumps tariffs when he got in office He shouldnt have It was a stupid thing for Biden to do too but at least it was massively smaller in scope than what trump wants now Tariffs can reduce foreign competition and boosting jobs Adding inflation which is already a major problem in order to add jobs when unemployment is not a major problem is still stupid,m62tcku,3.0,1hwkbyx
comment,m63iecl,CocaineIsNatural,,2,2025-01-08 19:18:05,,,,McKinleys famous success What gave you this idea The tariff was not well received by Americans who suffered a steep increase in prices In the 1890 election Republicans lost their majority in the House with the number of seats they won reduced by nearly half from 171 to 8814 In the 1892 presidential election Harrison was soundly defeated by Grover Cleveland and the Senate House and Presidency were all under Democratic control Lawmakers immediately started drafting new tariff legislation and in 1894 the WilsonGorman Tariff passed which lowered US tariff averages15 The 1890 tariff was also poorly received abroad Protectionists in the British Empire used it to argue for tariff retaliation and imperial trade preference16,m62tcku,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m63u6v8,INVEST-ASTS,,1,2025-01-08 20:15:12,,,,Funny how Biden retained and increased every tariff that the prior Trump administration put in place except for ONE The tariffs are designed to increase domestic production and the tax plan will give tax incentives for domestic producers as well It is a repudiation of the prior globalist policies that started in the 90s which gave tax incentives to offshore production and leave Americans unemployed or underemployed The theory of tariffs increasing prices assumes a static world where offshore manufacturers add the tariff into the price and the consumer has no other alternatives In most cases the manufacturers have to absorb the tariff into order to remain competitive or otherwise lose market share There is no evidence that tariffs have added to inflation or increased prices on specific products or in general The ultimate goal is no tariffs however tariffs must be used to encourage other nations to open their markets to US producers and in some cases they are very effective economic weapons to influence other nations to be cooperative and assist us on issues such as illegal immigration,,0.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m67ddte,MrCharmingTaintman,,2,2025-01-09 10:30:21,,,,Yes thats how tariffs work if you actually have an industry for the product The reason why it doesnt work for laptops is because you dont You not only have to build factories you also have to build the infrastructure This will take years on top of being insanely expensive for these companies Youd have to do this over several industries because laptops consists of many separate parts And thats disregarding getting the materials to build these parts Sure you could import these or go a step further and get the parts to just assemble the laptops in the USA but that doesnt work either because theres still tariffs on everything needed to build a laptop On top of all that you have to pay your workers more they work less have more protections and you have to stick to a bunch of rules All of which takes a chunk out of your profits Laptops produced in China will simply still be cheaper than the stuff produced in the USA even with tariffs applied,m66zard,3.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m6aya88,lockenl0ad,,1,2025-01-09 22:32:03,,,,But why would I charge so much less when theyre selling for 14 I did my market research and determined the going rate from your mugs It would cost me a lot of money to even get started so Id be looking to recoup my costs as quickly as possible Hell if I priced the mugs at 11 people might question the quality and choose the higher priced one because yours is a name brand and therefore assumed to be better quality Actually Id be better off if I tried to make my mug more aesthetically pleasing or cram in some useless tech looking at you ember This way I can differentiate myself from your mugs and charge a higher price with a marketing campaign that attacks the quality of your mug Theres a reason people keep buying iPhones when you could get an equivalent phone for much less money,m6au81x,5.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m62ycls,AggravatingFinding71,,3,2025-01-08 17:41:55,,,,I work in tech distribution Without heavy and consistent subsidization no manufacturers will be moving from overseas to the US It is simply not cost effective across multiple business segments even with tariffs in place China has no labor laws whereas the US despite what people think has very strict labor laws including minimum wage benefits for full time and part time workers and PTO It simply costs more to pay people in the US The US does not have the physical infrastructure in place for simple manufacturing Its hard to conceptualize but planning developing and implementing manufacturing plants is extremely difficult in the US We have a lot of land in the US but our population is isolated into many big cities The US has historically done a great job of identifying specific complex manufacturing industries that are extremely profitable like aircraftaerospace in locations close to large cities to be attractive to workers Lastly we dont have the workforce for simple manufacturing We have relatively consistent and low unemployment Most average Americans have quality 95 jobs that pay decently To bring back basic manufacturing to the US you would need those people to quit their already profitable jobs in the segments they work in today and then move to manualphysical labor jobs More than likely they will also need to relocate to less ideal locations where plants can be built And without subsidies they will also almost certainly be taking pay cuts Youve also left behind gaps in the workforce that they left to trade for low education simple manufacturing The end result of these tariffs at least in the tech world is manufacturing will stay where it is The price of goods will increase across the distribution landscape all the way to the end customer If you see any tech companies moving manufacturing from overseas it will be due to subsidies that you are paying for with your tax dollars Its fine if you want manufacturing in the US Regardless the prices of the goods will go up You will be the one funding the prices of the goods going up with your tax dollars and paying the higher prices You will be relegating your workforce to low education manualphysical labor pools rather than the current profitable business segments that we are world leaders in like IT Security Pharmaceuticals Aerospace The only people that want any of this are the people that are low education laborers or the wealthy that want to keep people lower class,m62na0v,1.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m646phx,DoubleJumps,,2,2025-01-08 21:15:48,,,,Blanket tariffs dont do that The amount of money it would take to produce the infrastructure here would be insane and it would take most of a decade if not longer Even then after everything was built just to start producing those things here resources would still have to be imported for production and now labor would be dramatically more expensive so the consumers still end up with a massively more expensive product and American buying power is greatly reduced Its literally cheaper for all of the companies impacted by this to just wait for it to blow up in everybodys face so that a government change would see somebody removing the tariffs Anybody who tries to start building that infrastructure here would just be wasting money until the tariffs would eventually be removed after backlash from the damage they cause on American consumers and then they would just be competing with the cheaper imported products anyway so it would be a losing effort,m641yii,1.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m6djjh1,Zyxyx,,1,2025-01-10 09:04:21,,,,Thats why you dont raise it by 20 you raise it by 25 20 of 10 or 20 of a million dollars is still going to be 20 that you have to pay Yes that is how percentages work But 20 of a million dollars leaves you with 800k 20 of 125 million leaves you with a million So you raise prices by 25 to move the tax burden on the consumer This is why in the US many places do not list the tax on their products to hide the fact theyre moving the tax burden on the consumer and appear more competitive I do not believe you run a business if you do not know even basic percentage math taught in elementary schools Edit in the example numbers I gave you I never stated what the expense was to make that 10 profit Its a simple math problem You said taxing 20 of 10 profit costs 2 Then raising prices you specifically said prices by 20 would end up with 12 in profit and 24 in taxes The only way profits increase to 12 or 20 when raising prices by 20 is if the margin is 100 because expenses do not scale with a price increase you should know this much if you ran a business If the price is 100 percentage units and expenses are 80 percentage units of that raising prices to 120 percentage units and expenses remaining at the old 80 percentage units would make your profit margin from 20 percentage units of 100 percentage units to 40 percentage units of 120 percentage units In other words raising prices by 20 would increase your profit margin by 667 Unless you had no expenses 100 profit margin and therefore itd remain the same This isnt rocket science you silly goose Your expenses do not magically multiply if you change the price,m6aasg4,12.0,1hwkbyx

comment,m6465ui,ahoneybadger4,,0,2025-01-08 21:13:10,,,,Hint Its not just laptops In the first scenario the CTA which has a vested interest here as it obviously would rather not have saleskilling levies on consumer goods predicted the price of laptops and tablets would rise 45 percent for American buyers games consoles would rise 40 percent monitors would cost 31 percent more and smartphone prices would rise 26 percent But if Trump who ran for office on a promise to lower peoples grocery costs announces the harsher tariff regime laptops and tablets prices would soar by 68 percent consoles would see price increases of 58 percent monitors would cost 48 percent more and smartphones would be 40 percent more expensive it is claimed,m643rkn,1.0,1hwkbyx
