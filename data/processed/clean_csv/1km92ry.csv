post,1km92ry,a_Ninja_b0y,Google wants to make stolen Android phones basically unsellable | Google is upgrading Factory Reset Protection to make it even harder for thieves to sell stolen phones,3956,2025-05-14 07:15:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1km92ry/google_wants_to_make_stolen_android_phones/,198.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,ms8fil6,afurtivesquirrel,,886,2025-05-14 07:41:30,,,,All this is actually going to do is take a chunk out of the secondary recyclingresale market iPhones have had this for ages and its not like no one steals them anymore,,0.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8jux9,methanol_ethanolovic,,495,2025-05-14 08:27:18,,,,If the posts here on Reddit are anything to go by Id believe most stolen iPhones are torn down for spare parts as most people whove had their phone stolen report tracking it to a particular location in China I think this wouldnt be as viable with Android phones as for many models spare parts are readily available whereas if watching Louis Rossmann has taught me anything its that Apple makes extra sure you cant get spare parts for their stuff,ms8fil6,1.0,1km92ry
comment,ms91if2,Slightlydifficult,,114,2025-05-14 11:15:01,,,,iOS 18 actually started tying individual parts to an Apple Account to mitigate this If your phone is stolen the major parts are basically useless,ms8jux9,2.0,1km92ry

comment,mspr0cf,Background-Hyena,,1,2025-05-17 00:05:20,,,,So they register the individual parts serial numbers to the account Or is it all tied to the IMEI,ms91if2,3.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8p520,arthurdentstowels,,11,2025-05-14 09:23:17,,,,This makes the most sense to me I remember when I was working in tech some time ago Apple paired the fingerprint reader to the motherboard on the I think iPhone 5s so that replacements would render the reader useless If people steal iPhones they would only have to discard the motherboard and a couple of other parts then sell the leftovers in the same way that people strip down cars Replacement parts for a 16 Pro Max are insanely expensive The battery is 120 just for the part and the screen alone is nearly 800 without installation for a genuine part Even the lesser models of the 16 line arent much cheaper because the difference is mostly in the motherboard and camera You dont need to sell a complete phone once its stolen its worth almost its retail value sold in pieces,ms8jux9,2.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8r0mr,nagi603,,18,2025-05-14 09:42:39,,,,Apple paired the fingerprint reader to the motherboard on the I think iPhone 5s so that replacements would render the reader useless Not just that but they also rendered completely legal OEM parts useless,ms8p520,3.0,1km92ry
comment,ms93e88,ThinkExtension2328,,11,2025-05-14 11:29:04,,,,Yea so this dosent work perhaps on old iPhones but modern iPhones have each component registered to a user So say someone stole my Taptic sensor while I was getting a screen fix they couldnt just slap it into another device as it will be paired to my account To unpair it the user must have fully signed out and removed the device,ms8jux9,2.0,1km92ry

comment,msb6gj4,__theoneandonly,,-7,2025-05-14 18:02:22,,,,if watching Louis Rossmann has taught me anything its that Apple makes extra sure you cant get spare parts for their stuff Apple has a website to buy parts and even rent or sell you the same tools that they use in the apple stores Louis Rossmann only has issues because he buys counterfeit parts that are so bad that US customs refuses to let them in the country Then he goes online and whines that theres some conspiracy that Apple is somehow puppeteering the US government into confiscating illegal goods,ms8jux9,2.0,1km92ry
comment,msjtpra,GreggAlan,,3,2025-05-16 01:13:56,,,,He bought macbook batteries from the same company that supplied them to Apple Apple then contacted Canadian customs and flat out lied that the batteries were counterfeit to stop Rossmann from getting them You must either be an Apple employee or super fanboi,msb6gj4,3.0,1km92ry
comment,msk0cvc,__theoneandonly,,-1,2025-05-16 01:54:44,,,,Neither because thats just objectively not true He bought them from a company that made samples for Apple but Apple declined to purchase from that company When they do that at the phase where batteries are being produced its usually for things like failing Apples child labor audit Then that company decided to continue building more batteries and selling them without authorization from Apple Thats pretty much the straight up definition of counterfeit of a counterfeit part So Rossmann was happy to swoop in and buy the counterfeit child labor parts Also Apple did not contact customs about that shipment of batteries Apple like most companies provide customs with a guide to determine if goods are genuine or not And those batteries failed the test that Apple had given customs How does Rossmanns dick taste,msjtpra,4.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8j8tc,Ijustdoeyes,,58,2025-05-14 08:20:49,,,,The difference is that iPhone parts are worth money theres only one source for them and Apple charges a lot for them Android parts not so much Most manufacturers sell parts or knock offs from Shenzen will work fine,ms8fil6,1.0,1km92ry

comment,ms8h1t2,stuckyfeet,,11,2025-05-14 07:57:27,,,,Its a travesty and such waste Edit Answer to the person who replied to me and deleted their comment Its not too hard its impossible to reset second hand apple stuff even if its completely outdated and it produces a large amount of electrical waste In effect you dont actually own the device you buy from apple anymore they own it and allow you to use it at their discretion,ms8fil6,1.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8rczo,YZJay,,14,2025-05-14 09:46:04,,,,They changed it last year As long as a phone is unlinked from your account you can harvest it for any part you need after you unlink and factory reset it,ms8h1t2,2.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8rxcy,stuckyfeet,,-12,2025-05-14 09:51:40,,,,Yeah thats the issue though you cant factory reset it even something as simple as an ipod and the customer service is non existent They even limit the amount of emails you can send from a single email account,ms8rczo,3.0,1km92ry

comment,ms98v56,stuckyfeet,,-1,2025-05-14 12:07:19,,,,Not exactly You can own the device but it can be activation locked if the old owner did not remove the account so it is effectively a huge waste of resources,ms98h3h,9.0,1km92ry
comment,ms991s6,OneSeaworthiness7768,,6,2025-05-14 12:08:32,,,,Youre completely distorting the argument now lmao You first said you cant reset your own devices Now youre talking about a second hand device you bought from a rando that was activation locked Make up your mind The person who sold you the device is at fault You can still factory reset your own device and remove the account when youre the device owner You probably bought a stolen device and thats the whole point,ms98v56,10.0,1km92ry
comment,ms99giu,stuckyfeet,,1,2025-05-14 12:11:15,,,,Im not in an argument its just uneccessary electronical waste Imagine if old gameboys vinyl players or ccasette walkmans were activation locked that would be nuts,ms991s6,11.0,1km92ry
comment,ms9w0hn,nybble41,,-4,2025-05-14 14:20:15,,,,Their argument has been consistent and you are the one acting obtuse The owner of the hardware is not necessarily the same as the owner of the account the hardware is registered to Apple refusing to recognize the legal owner of the hardware as the device owner is exactly the problem It is not uncommon for someone to sell or otherwise legally transfer a device without unregistering it from the original account They may not even have the necessary credentials for the account lost password device was inherited from someone else abandoned property etc Once those devices would have been usable after a factory reset Now they are ewaste,ms991s6,11.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8t4gg,YZJay,,8,2025-05-14 10:03:14,,,,You dont own something that you cant enforce the ownership of If just about anyone can factory reset your phone and harvest it for parts without you disabling the lock then it might as well not be your phone,ms8rxcy,4.0,1km92ry
comment,ms8xcpq,stuckyfeet,,-8,2025-05-14 10:41:48,,,,Either way with the activation lock it never really was your property anyway Ownership without autonomy is just licensed use,ms8t4gg,5.0,1km92ry

comment,msamf57,snakeoilHero,,-2,2025-05-14 16:28:00,,,,You mean like how you cannot replace the screen in an iPhone anymore If you do expect that camera to get wobbly Software wobbly Better buy the new one Buy Buy Buy Spend Spend Spend Noobs dont know iOS breaks the camera app when it detects a nonmatching screen They must think its 100 down the way and new screen just as good,ms8fil6,1.0,1km92ry

comment,ms9rp9i,Hendlton,,10,2025-05-14 13:58:02,,,,Factory Reset Protection Basically if you factory reset a phone that has it it requires the users email and password to unlock The problem is that nobody remembers their damned emails and passwords It would be nice if it actually worked for preventing theft or something but you can literally just google how to bypass frp and you get instructions It does nothing to stop thieves and it locks legitimate users out of their phones Only the dumb users sure but there are a lot of dumb people out there which includes a significant portion of my friends and family,ms9pyqb,4.0,1km92ry
comment,msadbpt,dandroid126,,4,2025-05-14 15:44:33,,,,That last part sounds like an implementation problem not a problem with FRP in theory I really think we should normalize using password managers That would solve the first issue,ms9rp9i,5.0,1km92ry

comment,ms9cubw,Zillatrix,,22,2025-05-14 12:33:01,,,,just throw away their phones So they arent really reselling their phones not bother to unlock or factory reset anything Then they arent really in the market for reselling their phones forget passwords Thats their problem Can you sell your reddit account if you forget your password If phone owners forget their google account password AND their screen locks then they havent been actively using that phone for quite a while They arent any sizable part of the resale market In fact according to my statistics that you have zero way of disproving 9998 of all phone sales that are legitimate not stolen are done by people who either remember their google account or their screen lock passwords Also 100 of all stolen phone resales are done by people who cant log into the google account and cant know the screen lock,ms9cb1o,3.0,1km92ry

comment,msb58cx,Zillatrix,,6,2025-05-14 17:56:34,,,,No one resets before selling They just give it away with their dick picks on the phone How many phone sales have you participated in Also those who dont remember their account passwords most grannies can still remember their screen lock which is enough to reset with the new protection,msb4rpw,3.0,1km92ry

comment,ms8k7oz,THX_2319,,2,2025-05-14 08:31:05,,,,Yeah the Apple thing is so anti right to repair Its the extreme end of things which ultimately hurts consumers You SHOULD be able to repair individual components yourself if you know how especially considering that generally speaking when a phone dies there are functional parts that can be put on another phone that needs it In an era where phones are lasting longer than they used to this has never been more necessary The trade off is that the market for these things continues to exist,ms8jhr7,4.0,1km92ry

comment,msb7l3u,__theoneandonly,,1,2025-05-14 18:07:47,,,,Not really These days Apple wont stop an unauthorized part from running in their phone unless its a part that was taken from a device that is marked as stolen Then the OS will refuse to use that part Theyll put a message in the settings menu that an unauthorized repair was done and tell you which parts were replaced It even tells you what authorized repairs were done too But I think thats a good thing if youre buying a used phone youll want to see that Apples gotten a lot more repairfriendly in the last few years As the world governments have been trying to keep them on a tighter leash theyre trying to pick their battles more carefully,ms8jazy,3.0,1km92ry

comment,mscnr96,__theoneandonly,,1,2025-05-14 22:30:46,,,,That was a bug that was fixed like two years ago Each screen has a configuration profile on Apples servers from the calibration done at the factory and autobrightness and True Tone require that configuration information When you use a nonApple screen there was no profile to download so the phone would throw and error and disable the features But now they have it where it defaults to a generic profile,msc3jdb,5.0,1km92ry

comment,ms95sh2,IgnitusBoyone,,1,2025-05-14 11:46:20,,,,I once forgot my pin on a Samsung phone Just straight looked down and couldnt remember it Proceeded to guess things that came to mind and activated the lockout this spiraled in to a one month lockout or something insane as the delay kept increasing Eventually I gave up and reset the phone I swear to God no hackerthief would have tried so long to brute force my phone as the real owner attempting to honestly remember his password They likely would of just used some exploit to get around it or reset it like I did If lockdown has been secure I likely would of been screwed as I doubt I would of ever had set up recovery on my 20th generation cellphone we replace them to often to bother after a while and issues only happen once in a blue moon My honest guess is making factory reset harder will only punish standard users in the end and is ultimately a sales ploy,,0.0,1km92ry

comment,ms9w2ng,timelessblur,,3,2025-05-14 14:20:33,,,,That argument is like going to immobilized chips on cars was to make it harder the car owners and way to force people to pay more money for keys Reality is immobilizer chips in cars drove car theft into the ground It reduce it more to car jacking and ways that require the theft to get the key with the car Well until Kia got caught cheaping out and the Kia boys happened There was a reason why the most common stolen cars was sticking around year 2000 never moving up It was shortly before the chipped keys became common place It will basically drive phone theft into the ground and have very limited effect on resale For every example like your chances are there are 10 stolen phones this would protect from,ms95sh2,1.0,1km92ry
