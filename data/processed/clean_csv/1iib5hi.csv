comment,mb6ccm9,simfreak101,,12,2025-02-05 21:10:18,,,,FYI for anyone looking at doing something similar you can buy 12mm OD copper pipe online its not cheap but man is it nice and much cheaper than getting pipe from people that sell water blocks the ID is larger than 16mm acrylic with out the worry of cracking I found 12mm OD is the smallest you can find for compression fittings that go into a waterblock Also i found that instead of soldering you can get copper glue that works just as good This makes the process 1000x easier as the glue sets in about 5 seconds which gives you time to angle it properly Once it sets its like a rock I also used some copper polish to make the pipes bling system details While my case is bigger i managed to squeeze 3 radiators in there so you can run that 4090 full speed for days and not worry about the water getting much over ambient,,0.0,1iib5hi
comment,mb8ei9v,PyroDesu,,4,2025-02-06 03:35:37,,,,you can run that 4090 full speed for days and not worry about the water getting much over ambient The ambient temperature of the room will probably go up a fair bit though and also your power bill,mb6ccm9,1.0,1iib5hi
comment,mb9npxw,mmoonbelly,,1,2025-02-06 09:52:51,,,,Any ideas how to make it look more like an Alambic Think Hennessy might go for it as an exhibit in their new art foundation here,mb6ccm9,1.0,1iib5hi
comment,mbc24zl,simfreak101,,1,2025-02-06 18:23:20,,,,Make what more Alambic His or mine It would be hard to make mine steam punky since it was designed around the case its in It had to go together in a very specific order to even get the lid on So even if you took the side panel off you wouldnt see much since there is a massive rad right there The reason i have the fittings i do inside the case was they are swivel so it allowed me to make the angles i needed With out that it could never be put together you were often times putting something in on a angle and then lining the pipe up as it went in so the fitting had to move as it was going in If i had a ton of money i could build my own from scratch I always wanted to build a case where the case was the radiator Basically using the copper tubing as structural elements So basically it would be a open air case like his probably a little larger since for functionality you want to use larger tubing g14 fittings are 95mm so using 6mm od creates a lot of head pressure and lowers contact time which will yield less performance,mb9npxw,2.0,1iib5hi
comment,mbc3za2,mmoonbelly,,1,2025-02-06 18:31:44,,,,The cognac houses here esp Martell Hennessy have funds for art and like installations with function that look like their businesses Hennessys investing heavily over the next years theyve bought half of the riverside houses for their new foundation,mbc24zl,3.0,1iib5hi
comment,mbdsplq,SryUsrNameIsTaken,,1,2025-02-06 23:15:37,,,,Do you think you could do a similar setup on a multi 7900 xtx build Like say 4 of them,mb6ccm9,1.0,1iib5hi
comment,mbe8wch,simfreak101,,1,2025-02-07 00:43:01,,,,Anything is possible But you would need a 1800 watt powersupply which means you need a 20amp outlet to plug it into What are you doing that you need 4 7900s I went the route of a big case last time and i hated it It weight like 100lbs so you couldnt move it around it was big and barely fit in my desks cubby By going ultra small i can hide this thing anywhere and its small enough to put in a back pack,mbdsplq,2.0,1iib5hi

comment,mbboin0,nathan753,,3,2025-02-06 17:20:45,,,,Just to be clear and accurate on the timeline LTT was originally given the block free and clear no stings attached It was okayed by Billet to use the different card After the video came out Billet decided they actually wanted it back LTT agreed to send it back no obligation to at this point The block was labeled wrong in ltts inventory and an employee left an email in draft which lead to it being in a charity auction not sold off LTT dropped the ball a bit but they didnt sell for profit a 1 off prototype and have since compensated billet labs for the block,mb45oit,1.0,1iib5hi
