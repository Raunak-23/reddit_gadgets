post,1hab7ld,chrisdh79,ViewSonic to unveil 1440p OLED gaming monitor with 520Hz refresh rate at CES 2025 | Alongside a dual-mode 4K monitor,654,2024-12-09 14:41:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1hab7ld/viewsonic_to_unveil_1440p_oled_gaming_monitor/,219.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,m179j2j,W8kingNightmare,,71,2024-12-09 15:03:13,,,,what the hell does dual mode 4k mean,,0.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17b77r,BoldNewBranFlakes,,61,2024-12-09 15:12:52,,,,I assume its similar to Dells dual mode monitor where you can have 4k but it will have a lower refresh rate or you can have 1440p or 1080p at a higher refresh rate,m179j2j,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17sans,-SlowtheArk-,,26,2024-12-09 16:45:24,,,,A lot of CRTs were like this They could only display at a certain framerate ex 60 at high resolutions but if you brought the resolution down a bit you could easily output 90 Crazy shit back in the day lol,m17b77r,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1c9xhd,Q__________________O,,3,2024-12-10 10:42:07,,,,My old LG could do 1600x1200 t 60 hz or 1024x768 at 100hz It was awesome,m17sans,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m185uki,Xendrus,,0,2024-12-09 17:55:17,,,,That just sounds like a 4k monitor that isnt very good to me lol,m17b77r,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m18z5vb,Vabla,,-2,2024-12-09 20:26:10,,,,So you can choose between slow 4k blurry 1440p or overpriced 1080p,m17b77r,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19bt9x,rpkarma,,10,2024-12-09 21:31:13,,,,Why would the 1440p be blurry They dont scale anything The 1080p is 4 OLED pixels for 1 1080p pixel and being able to switch between these modes makes it a great monitor for esports gaming and regular gaming The best monitors out now do this,m18z5vb,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19d7x6,Vabla,,4,2024-12-09 21:38:36,,,,What do you mean they dont scale anything Does it crop the 4k monitor area down to 1440p then,m19bt9x,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19gjn0,rpkarma,,3,2024-12-09 21:56:07,,,,Previous monitors in this class do exactly that yep They can also scale if you ask them too but that obviously looks trash lol,m19d7x6,5.0,1hab7ld

comment,m17b9oh,None,,9,2024-12-09 15:13:15,,,,Change resolution and get different refresh rate 4K at half refresh of 2k So you can choose,m179j2j,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17xcnr,W8kingNightmare,,5,2024-12-09 17:11:43,,,,1440p isnt half of 4k so there would have to be some scaling happening,m17b9oh,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19bz21,rpkarma,,1,2024-12-09 21:32:04,,,,It wont scale most likely itll have borders if its like other panels that do this Its for esports games where you want a smallerthan27 monitor anyway The 1080p mode does a 41 integer scale at the hardware level,m17xcnr,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19bh08,rpkarma,,4,2024-12-09 21:29:27,,,,Means my wallet is going to hate me In actual it means I can play Valorant at 1440p 520hz but use my desktop and play other games at 4K at a lower refresh rate while having it look native still,m179j2j,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1bek0n,lavadrop5,,1,2024-12-10 05:12:48,,,,I think it means 4K but lower refresh rate and 1440p without scaling but higher refresh rate,m179j2j,1.0,1hab7ld

comment,m17qwfq,None,,99,2024-12-09 16:38:08,,,,Neither is 144 160 165 but we have monitors that have that refresh rate,m178eh2,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m18mwc5,NotSoCoolWaffle,,35,2024-12-09 19:22:47,,,,144 and 160 are multiple of 8 and 16 So they kinda make sense As does 240 165 is really odd one out there,m17qwfq,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1bio7z,TheBigBo-Peep,,19,2024-12-10 05:47:03,,,,Theyre all multiples of 24 or 30 165 is to specifically use all the bandwidth in a specific DisplayPort standard,m18mwc5,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19tcdr,elite_haxor1337,,9,2024-12-09 23:07:33,,,,its because it is what is achievable with 144 Hz displays when you overclock them it became standardish,m18mwc5,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1ai78o,Hobbit1996,,6,2024-12-10 01:36:14,,,,werent 144hz the 120 overclocked,m19tcdr,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1akhfp,elite_haxor1337,,4,2024-12-10 01:50:05,,,,youre probably right I only said what I know for sure that seems likely though,m1ai78o,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1byjed,Hobbit1996,,2,2024-12-10 08:29:00,,,,i know my old asus 144 was but at this point i think youd have to take panels case by case When they first got released refresh rate and where they are now,m1akhfp,6.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19fhop,PenguinsRcool2,,6,2024-12-09 21:50:34,,,,Hey hey hey now i like my 165hz panel lol Legit cant tell the difference from 144165 I however will say that i can tell you the difference from 60120 And i can tell 120144 in some games csgo mainly,m18mwc5,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1b9ice,ChrisG683,,3,2024-12-10 04:33:41,,,,For 120 and 144 I could be wrong but I think the initial thoughts were to natively support multiples of 24 fps to eliminate judder on moviesvideos in that format,m17qwfq,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1bl9p4,im_thatoneguy,,1,2024-12-10 06:10:24,,,,And 30p videos 1080 60hz TV only really exists interlaced anyway so thats just 30p in a stupid package,m1b9ice,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1kxfta,Visual_Dimension_933,,1,2024-12-11 20:24:33,,,,I have a Asus PG32UCDP monitor with 240hz 4k and 480 1080p with a strix rtx 4080 I play HZD Remastered and HFW on 4k Ultra and getting 140145 cyberpunk 120 130 hz Not bad at all For me as long as its beyond 100hz I good Used to have and lg its 27 inch 1440p 144 hz I like the woled cos of the black and colors,m17qwfq,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m18pplw,Komodor123,,14,2024-12-09 19:37:16,,,,Who cares They have dymanic refresh rate anyway right,m178eh2,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19b747,rpkarma,,10,2024-12-09 21:28:05,,,,Correct Being a multiple of 60hz would only matter if you want to use software Black Frame Insertion modes in emulators but freesync means that doesnt matter that much either Just set it to 480 FPS with BFI 240 actual if you really want that Any other game or use case it being a 60hz multiple hasnt mattered for years,m18pplw,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19ykdy,Fredasa,,5,2024-12-09 23:38:27,,,,Never really understood the point of BFI One of the biggest advantages I notice every single day I stare at OLED is that the PWM you get with every LCD is basically not there at all BFI just adds that effect right back in No matter what problem its ostensibly intended to solve the afterimage effect of staring at a screen that is actually black 60 or 120 times a second is just far too much of a downside,m19b747,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1a05ws,rpkarma,,2,2024-12-09 23:47:57,,,,Yeah I agree though at 360hz it was less noticeable I found,m19ykdy,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1aki0m,jensen404,,1,2024-12-10 01:50:11,,,,I love it on my LG CX at 120Hz It has 40 persistence so it has the motion clarity of fullpersistence 300Hz Thats the point Yes it comes with tradeoffs For nongaming uses I prefer it to be off Reading isnt as comfortable with PWM Its a shame its been removed from newer models,m19ykdy,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1bz6dj,rpkarma,,1,2024-12-10 08:36:27,,,,Thats hardware BFI which is decent especially with OLED Software faked BFI via emulators is pretty crap though IME even at high frame rates,m1aki0m,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19xvle,mangage,,3,2024-12-09 23:34:20,,,,For gaming it doesnt matter but for watching 2430fps TVMovies its nice having a divisible refresh rate and not dealing with 23 pulldown,m18pplw,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1o8p3q,Komodor123,,1,2024-12-12 10:29:54,,,,Bro you do understand that you dont have to deal with pulldown since the screen will dynamic refresh with a multiple of 24fps or whatever then,m19xvle,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1ovqbv,mangage,,1,2024-12-12 13:46:24,,,,Gsync is actually kind of ass when watching 24fps fixed frame rate content no matter the refresh iirc gsync also only works like over 40fps,m1o8p3q,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1oxnyp,Komodor123,,1,2024-12-12 13:58:55,,,,Yes and for that reason EVERY variable refresh monitor doubles or triples any rates below the lower threshold,m1ovqbv,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17idby,AweVR,,19,2024-12-09 15:52:38,,,,Nah my eyes can see 50000000hz and my brain is like a fly can process millions of hz 520hz is like nothing for me I need the same monitos that Flash have to play doom,m178eh2,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1azr5w,reeeelllaaaayyy823,,1,2024-12-10 03:26:17,,,,I hear you bro My mouse is 1000000Hz polling rate and its not fast enough for my reflexes,m17idby,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1cdkwx,OFred27,,1,2024-12-10 11:20:53,,,,The question is more about the benefit of having 520Hz,m178eh2,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1922js,scstraus,,-6,2024-12-09 20:41:11,,,,Im curious if people can actually see the difference between this and say 240hz Even from 60 to 120hz is not that noticeable to me,m178eh2,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m194crt,HallowedBuddy,,20,2024-12-09 20:52:54,,,,If you are gaming 60hz to 120 is night and day,m1922js,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1994ou,kalirion,,3,2024-12-09 21:17:26,,,,Depends on the game You probably wont notice it too much in say Hollow Knight,m194crt,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19zj6i,Fredasa,,5,2024-12-09 23:44:12,,,,Thats largely because the actual animation of that game is something like 12 fps in most cases One of my main critiques actually At least for the protagonist that the player stares at for dozens of hours they probably should have provided a full 60fps for everything he does and the flow of his cloak and whatnot,m1994ou,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1a1a0i,kalirion,,-3,2024-12-09 23:54:28,,,,And even if theyd provided full 60fps for everything he does and the flow of his cloak of whatnot you wouldnt be able to tell much difference between 60Hz and 120Hz during gameplay,m19zj6i,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1abkht,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-10 00:56:01,,,,I think 60fps is a fine baseline because most people myself included would be forced to closely scrutinize the animation to identify that it isnt 120fps The same cannot be said for something animated at 30fps 24fps or certainly a dubious 12fps especially while every other aspect of the game flows at a silky smooth 60,m1a1a0i,6.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1acrl8,kalirion,,2,2024-12-10 01:03:17,,,,Im sure I could tell the difference between 60 and 120 or even 120 and 240 if it was a twitch FPS and I used the mouse to quickly turn around,m1abkht,7.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1agurd,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-10 01:28:04,,,,Oh sure But maybe not so much the animation of a diminutive character in a platform game I could tell if I looked closely obviously but I wouldnt then harangue the devs for not handanimating the guy at 120fps,m1acrl8,8.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1alun8,jensen404,,1,2024-12-10 01:58:25,,,,I actually find the most benefit with side scrolling games like Hollow Knight because the image scrolls at a constant rate so its easy to see the motion clarity with higher framerates 120Hz looks much clearer than 60Hz 120Hz with BFI on my LG CX has the motion clarity of a 300Hz display and further improves the look of the game,m1994ou,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19aryf,Usernametaken1121,,2,2024-12-09 21:25:54,,,,Its a difference but nowhere near the jump from 30 to 60,m194crt,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1a1itm,scstraus,,2,2024-12-09 23:55:53,,,,Its better but I generally will take resolution and graphics over it unless Im playing a fast twitch FPS or something,m194crt,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1a2zzn,HallowedBuddy,,1,2024-12-10 00:04:44,,,,Yeah pretty much resolution is the way to go until its quick and fast pace and you need that ms,m1a1itm,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m198t6r,uncledr3w-,,-3,2024-12-09 21:15:48,,,,night and day is a bit dramatic lmao,m194crt,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m199ll7,Simulation-Argument,,4,2024-12-09 21:19:52,,,,It is not dramatic at all Not for me at least I cannot stand playing at 60fps anymore after making the switch to 144hz years ago If a game is running at 60fps I genuinely cannot and will not play it like that I will adjust settings to get the right frame rate Anything below 90 is just awful in my opinion Everyone has different preferences What you should of said is you dont think it is a night and day difference Which is fine but other people are not somehow wrong for thinking differently,m198t6r,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m19zx5r,Fredasa,,2,2024-12-09 23:46:30,,,,If a game is running at 60fps I genuinely cannot and will not play it like that It sounds like youre pretty tolerant of 1440p and thats where I draw the line I sit about 25 feet from a 55 inch display so 1440p is never going to work for me again There are a lot of games that simply cannot be played at anything above 4K60 so thats where my standards have settled,m199ll7,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1a6hwh,Simulation-Argument,,1,2024-12-10 00:25:34,,,,Maybe you already know about this but that could be an issue with pixel density which can make certain resolutions look bad to the viewer depending on the resolution of the display and how close they sit to the display Sometimes people buy the larger monitor because they think bigger is better but that monitor is in the same resolution as the smaller ones so the viewer actually gets less pixel density which will look worse They even make pixel density calculators for this reason I also have a 55inch TV but am about 3 feet from it 1440p still looks great to me especially at 100 frames per second I need smooth gameplay first though it just doesnt feel good to play but obviously everyone is different Hopefully DLSS keeps improving and 4K120 becomes a much more feasible setup,m19zx5r,6.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1adbqq,Fredasa,,0,2024-12-10 01:06:42,,,,Maybe you already know about this but that could be an issue with pixel density which can make certain resolutions look bad to the viewer depending on the resolution of the display and how close they sit to the display Trust me Im keenly aware of the downsides of 4K at this much FOV It basically means I can still easily identify individual pixels in an era where thats simply not the norm any longer They even make pixel density calculators for this reason I got it for two reasons Secondarily because if Im staring at a display and Im reaching retina levels of clarity then that means I am leaving some of the displays resolution off the table for no damn good purpose The solution to this _is not_ to run games at a lowerthannative resolution because outside of the idealized scenario where Im literally using eg 1080p on my 4K display the imperfect divisor 1440p on 4K for example means I am corrupting the 2D matrix of the games output and that _does_ manifest visually even in a hypothetical scenario where the 1440p is still technically retinait manifests as moiré and aliasing that would not be present on a pixelperfect output When a good display comes out that offers about 6K of resolution Ill probably be done chasing the perfect combination of resolution and FOV Primarily Ive been on a largedisplayasmonitor since 2010 Once youve experienced it you dont go back The impressive FOV gives any game a visceral quality that you cant achieve without it A bit like tapping into the potential of VR but without all the headache and ritual And nongaming productivity is crazy enhanced with a screen this big in front of you I couldnt imagine trying to get anything done while squinting at a 32 inch monitor I view that prospect with probably the same dubiousness that someone on 32 inches regards the thought of returning to the good old 17 inch days The average user might imagine that the solution is to use two monitors To me thatd be like taking this big crystal clear screen and taping horizontalvertical bars to it so I can partition it I thankfully dont have to,m1a6hwh,7.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1adtiw,Simulation-Argument,,1,2024-12-10 01:09:41,,,,I am well aware of how good TVs are as monitors now This 55 inch LGCX is the best monitor I have ever owned I dont think I will switch back either,m1adbqq,8.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1agj9k,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-10 01:26:10,,,,QDOLED here Had to give LG a miss primarily because of chrominance overshoot which is a bona fide dealbreaker but also because the nits dont really reach proper HDR levels And third because the TV I picked was cheaper at the time I bought it,m1adtiw,9.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1amulm,Simulation-Argument,,1,2024-12-10 02:04:35,,,,Those were not a thing when I got this TV LG TVs consistently get amazing reviews and this one has many thousands of hours and essentially no burn in Granted QDOLED has some issues of its own from what I have read including with burn in pertaining to whites and an odd pixel shape that gives small text a pink hue Apparently Samsung has recently made a QDLED display that wont have any potential for burn in Wonder if this will be better than QDOLED and OLED It will apparently be cheaper to manufacture as well Hope my TV holds out until those prices are a reality,m1agj9k,10.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1aqia7,Fredasa,,1,2024-12-10 02:27:22,,,,burn in pertaining to whites These things _will_ burn in in a heartbeat But the phenomenon is deeply exponential I run mine at 2050 brightness for day to day usage and despite the fact that many elements are on my screen for 12 hours of every day I have yet to burn a single thing in I use full brightness for things like movies and HDR gaming and in the latter case I take precautions to avoid static GUI elements These are things I understood in advance that I would need to do in order not to ruin the display The flipside argument is that I could easily just keep nits below 800 to mimic LGs limitations and then my display would be almost completely burnin proof just like LG But I have the option to not do that odd pixel shape that gives small text a pink hue Speaking as one who is far pickier than 999 of folks overblown Also solved by MacType The reliable red and blue edges of text with a traditional submatrix is far more noticeable and only gets a pass because its familiar Apparently Samsung has recently made a QDLED display that wont have any potential for burn in X for doubt If its based on OLED then what it almost certainly means is _Weve put a hard cap on maximum brightness and if we figure out its still not foolproof then well lower it again and again via forced firmware_ Samsung unfortunately sucks I didnt let this dictate my choice of TV though I was just very careful about what updates I gave my display If Id held off because of the known quantity of burnin concerns Id still be waiting today whiling away my days on a miserable QLED,m1amulm,11.0,1hab7ld

comment,m19z4se,Fredasa,,2,2024-12-09 23:41:50,,,,I want to say that 240Hz vs 520Hz would be very hard to differentiate but that entirely depends on how good the motion blur is If there _is_ no motion blur then 520Hz absolutely would look better particular whenever there was any rapid motion and especially motion that doesnt conveniently follow straight vectors Just visualize swirling your mouse pointer in quick circles and youll get it Even at 240Hz there are massive gaps in those circles where no mouse pointer is displayed Those gaps will be significantly lessened at 520Hz but they still wouldnt be completely gone,m1922js,2.0,1hab7ld

comment,m18f8yj,unseen0000,,-4,2024-12-09 18:43:29,,,,Theres nothing to be gained is the point whether its the same price as the current average monitor or not Going above 240hz is pointless in the grand scheme of things Were already talking frametimes people cant even register and whatever smoothness people perceive are not attributed to framerates when going above 240hz but more so timings grey to greys even input lag becomes the bottleneck before additional frames do This is a gimmick And anyone suggesting that youre gonna gain from going over 240hz doesnt understand that its actually a step backwards considering the additional processing power youre gonna have to throw at it to have it run at that framerate which in turn usually means less eye candy as youre gonna have to compromise settings for literally nothing Its like driving a car going 305mph and going 320 mph in another one Whatever perception you may have of going faster is more than likely attributed to the handling of the car and how low to the ground you are rather than the extra 15mph,m185d7b,4.0,1hab7ld

comment,m18ea6z,unseen0000,,0,2024-12-09 18:38:30,,,,but incredible response times alone arent qgood enough for great motion clarity on a sample and hold display You need frames Im well aware And that article you posted explains nothing of the sort because it didnt take into consideration the massive upscale we had in recent years Which isnt weird as its from 2018 Explain to me why your experience is due to frames and not due to having an overal better panel that absolutely contributes to whatever clarity youre perceiving Also the difference in smoothness is unreal If anyone that plays competive fps games says that they cant tell the difference between 240hz and 480hz well I would be shocked I mean you can even tell by looking at your mouse cursor on your desktop by wiggling it around Noticing it with enough focus sure But youre not gonna notice it when actually playing any kind of fast paced game vs the same monitor running 240hz Again youre comparing an older monitor with a newer one and the frame rate alone isnt going to be the biggest factor in your perception Obviously I wouldnt be able to tell the difference between small increments or be able to tell you exact framerates by looking at a picture in motion but the difference between 240 and 480 is apparent when moving your mouse in a game Your idea of a blind test is a good idea though Ill have to set something up with a friend and see what jumps in frames I can accurately perceive Yeah give it a shot Youre gonna be in for a surprise considering you attribute the differences to frame rates mostly when in reality thats simply not the case,m187wp6,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1blca5,lifestop,,1,2024-12-10 06:11:05,,,,it didnt take into consideration the massive upscale we had in recent years What do you mean by upscale Noticing it with enough focus sure But youre not gonna notice it when actually playing any kind of fast paced game vs the same monitor running 240hz Results of testing between 240hz and 480hz so far You are correct When I pay attention I can tell the difference between 240hz and 480hz 100 of the time in the game Overwatch But if I had just gotten home from work jumped on the game for a match and someone had secretly switched my settings Well I probably wouldnt notice Something might feel off but I doubt I would put much thought into it At 240hz the image appears lightly vaselinecoated in motion and less crisp than 480hz I appreciate the difference but I doubt it would help me to rise in rank,m18ea6z,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1e10nz,unseen0000,,1,2024-12-10 17:39:40,,,,What do you mean by upscale The upscale in framerates refresh rates and overal panel quality Results of testing between 240hz and 480hz so far You are correct When I pay attention I can tell the difference between 240hz and 480hz 100 of the time in the game Overwatch But if I had just gotten home from work jumped on the game for a match and someone had secretly switched my settings Well I probably wouldnt notice Something might feel off but I doubt I would put much thought into it At 240hz the image appears lightly vaselinecoated in motion and less crisp than 480hz I appreciate the difference but I doubt it would help me to rise in rank That makes sense to me But ask yourself the question who needs that 480hz monitor over 240hz Let alone a 520hz monitor Its such a small difference and the requirements to push those framerates are absurd Even if you get a 9800x3D and a 4090 Youre not gonna be able to run half the modern titles at anything over 200fps let alone 520 lmao Its a gimmick its pointless,m1blca5,6.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17e4x8,Enorats,,1,2024-12-09 15:29:30,,,,People who claim they cant tell the difference between 60 and 120 are right They cant tell the difference because they bought a fancy graphics card that outputs 120 but then plugged the free 60 hz monitor that came with the computer into it The monitor cant display above 60 so 60 and 120 look the same In reality with a monitor that can display 120 the difference between 60 and 120 is absolutely huge I have to admit Im a lot more skeptical of people being able to truly distinguish much above that,m177ugf,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m17qttg,unseen0000,,-2,2024-12-09 16:37:46,,,,Whats a practical use of a 520hz monitor to begin with Absolutely nothing Whoever claims otherwise doesnt know what theyre talking about Your example however isnt the best 60 to 120144 is definitely noticable Its nothing major but its big Then the step to 240hz is gonna require a trained eye and even then the difference isnt gonna a whole lot for the vast majority of people Moving up to 360 even less Now were doing 520 And Theres absolutely no point in it Its like arguing about pixel density at some point its no longer relevant Gotta get dem 16k on a 24 inch monitor for that high PPI s,m177ugf,1.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1aqo7k,jensen404,,2,2024-12-10 02:28:24,,,,The labels on this map are unreadable at 60 Hz They are unreadable at 120 Hz At 240 Hz the labels can be discerned with a bit of concentration At 480 Hz they are easy to read At 960Hz the scrolling image will be nearly as clear as a stationary image,m17qttg,2.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1dzwsb,unseen0000,,1,2024-12-10 17:33:54,,,,So youre saying in a simulated test made to showcase the difference between two panels shows differences Who wouldve thought The point is that youre now focussing exactly what the test wants you too Higher frequency monitors are made for the gaming market When youre gaming youre not gonna hyperfocus on whether the texture that pops out on the right top of your screen is indistinguishable from whatever it would look like on say 360hz or 240hz The difference is so niche its pointless Unless theres a fast paced game like the test that requires you to read certain things at a high pace Go figure,m1aqo7k,3.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1ezchj,jensen404,,1,2024-12-10 20:37:17,,,,The simulated test looks like any side scrolling game In a side scrolling game it means that the image remains clear in motion I can easily see the difference in real world games If the image is scrolling horizontally at 960 pixels per second and youre playing on a 1080p 60 Hz monitor that means the monitor effectively looks like a 120 by 1080 pixel resolution monitor At 480 Hz it looks like a 960 by 1080 image You could say higher than 480p resolution is niche Higher than 30 FPS is niche HDR is niche The thing is these ultra high refresh rates are just bringing us back to the status quo of motion clarity of games in the 80s played on CRT Maybe that isnt important to you Thats fine But its simply not true that Theres absolutely no point in it Even an untrained eye can easily see the difference in at least some situations in some games,m1dzwsb,4.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1f1kto,unseen0000,,1,2024-12-10 20:48:45,,,,Youre missing the point Whatever gains you have are negligible to begin with And even if they are significant they are for a niche category of gaming and even then its pointless because what are you expecting to gain exactly I grew up in the 90s watching video tapes on a small TV The sound quality was horrible the TVs quality was dogshit Yet the whole experience was great because if the movie is good enough or the game is good enough it really doesnt matter if you can differentiate between someones nosehairs or not Sure the added steps to higher resolutions pixel shift times latencies refresh rates etc absolutely add to the experience But at some point in this case 240hz the added frames are adding fuck all to the experience and thats only IF you can actually push these numbers which is going to require the best of the best hardware and even then the vast majority of games arent gonna run even remotely close to 520 fps to fully benefit from it Hell 240 is a huge stretch for the majority of games,m1ezchj,5.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1fupbv,jensen404,,1,2024-12-10 23:24:13,,,,Yet the whole experience was great because if the movie is good enough or the game is good enough it really doesnt matter if you can differentiate between someones nosehairs or not Sure but as I said you can say that about every improvement in graphics or display technology There are now monitors with an infinite contrast ratio There are monitors with Retina resolution where any higher pixel density will be indiscernible at an average viewing distance Why not improve refresh rates until we get to a similar place I think the relative importance of high frame rates is underestimated when compared to other factors such as resolution In some games especially gamepaddriven sidescrolling games a 1080P resolution at 480 Hz will look better than 4K resolution at 120Hz despite both having the same GPU workload in pixels rendered per second and even if you are viewing the 4K display from a close enough where the resolution increase over 1080P is clearly visible I think ultrahigh framerates are less important in first person mouse drive games because side to side movement tends to be jerkier less consistent so your eyes wont be directly tracking the motion of the scene The original Super Mario Bros has clearer motion on a CRT than on any modern fullpersistence screen IF you can actually push these numbers which is going to require the best of the best hardware and even then the vast majority of games arent gonna run even remotely close to 520 fps to fully benefit from it Hell 240 is a huge stretch for the majority of games Thats currently true for most AAA games but most of the games I play arent Not every game is going to max out every aspect of the display and some games will benefit more from ultra high framerates than others And there are techniques for framegeneration that will enable ultra high frame rates even in AAA games These techniques are much better than the motion smoothing done by TVs Also I agree with you that every doubling of framerate is less important than the previous doubling,m1f1kto,6.0,1hab7ld
comment,m1ko6go,unseen0000,,1,2024-12-11 19:38:36,,,,Sure but as I said you can say that about every improvement in graphics or display technology No im specifically saying it about something that has hit huge diminishing returns I remember the first Full HD monitor i got That was a significant step My first 120hz monitor was a significant step OLED is a significant step Those arent gimmicks There are now monitors with an infinite contrast ratio There are monitors with Retina resolution where any higher pixel density will be indiscernible at an average viewing distance Why not improve refresh rates until we get to a similar place Im not saying we shouldnt Im saying were 97 there and we can gain 3 and thats a gimmick and its pointless I think the relative importance of high frame rates is underestimated when compared to other factors such as resolution In some games especially gamepaddriven sidescrolling games a 1080P resolution at 480 Hz will look better than 4K resolution at 120Hz despite both having the same GPU workload in pixels rendered per second Okay So which are those amazing side scrolling games that people play on their 9800x3d 4090 combo to run at 480hz People are gonna buy top tier hardware and a 480hz monitor to play side scrolling games lmao Thats currently true for most AAA games but most of the games I play arent Not every game is going to max out every aspect of the display and some games will benefit more from ultra high framerates than others None of the top 50 most played games are benefitting from these monitors Not even close And even if some did people generally dont have the hardware to push those framerates Youre arguing nitpicking very very niche reasons why these monitors make sense But in the grand scheme of things they are absolutely not worth any investment unless youre some incredible sidescrolling game enthousiast who has epileptic tendencies with lower framerates And there are techniques for framegeneration that will enable ultra high frame rates even in AAA games These techniques are much better than the motion smoothing done by TVs No theyre not Youre talking frame interpolation Thats not true 480520whatever hz That would be even more silly Boy i cant wait to run this 520hz monitor at half its framerate and double it with this technique to not render it at its native 520hz and not benefit from the added frequency at all Also I agree with you that every doubling of framerate is less important than the previous doubling This is always true Regardless of the number Look im fine with these monitors being produced and hitting the market Im fine with people buying them do whatever u want with your money But theres not a single person who can convince me that these monitors are going to add to the experience Its like audiophiles who im somewhat one of Getting a dedicated sound card for your PC is almost never an added experience Only purists are going to find SOME benefits to it and even then its close to non existant,m1fupbv,7.0,1hab7ld
