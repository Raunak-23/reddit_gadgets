post,1leh1bm,chrisdh79,BOE unveils 8K 120Hz panel with 4K 240Hz dual-mode support for high-end monitors | 8K 120Hz cables are also emerging this year,212,2025-06-18 13:24:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1leh1bm/boe_unveils_8k_120hz_panel_with_4k_240hz_dualmode/,44.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mygcxo7,xondk,,78,2025-06-18 14:26:32,,,,Must admit at that size it seems meaningless to have 8k I wonder what the use cases will be the dpi seem beyond the ability for eyes to resolve,,0.0,1leh1bm
comment,mygtcr7,DarkModeOnly,,70,2025-06-18 15:44:04,,,,One advantage is that 8k cleanly divides into 1440p as well as 2160 and 1080 so you have a number of resolution choices for games that dont require complex scaling that inevitably reduces sharpness In the long term that seems like an interesting benefit because you get a lot more options for increasing framerate But its a tough selling point at the cost these panels are now Besides Id guess most potential customers of these just want to run it at full resolution for the sake of it Ive certainly had times I wished I could run my 4k monitors at 1440p without the significant loss of clarity that comes with it though 1080p is a huge jump down,mygcxo7,1.0,1leh1bm
comment,mygu5dj,xondk,,19,2025-06-18 15:47:45,,,,Huh yeah that would be nice Didnt consider that was focused on the native resolution,mygtcr7,2.0,1leh1bm
comment,myiu3j4,MeatSafeMurderer,,15,2025-06-18 21:28:45,,,,While a nice bonus on paper I dont remember the last time I saw a display that actually supported nearest neighbour scaling on integer multiples It was always the same old blurry shite,mygtcr7,2.0,1leh1bm
comment,mz53uaq,DigitalStefan,,1,2025-06-22 12:16:54,,,,Nearest neighbour is called integer scaling within Nvidia driver options Theres a similar feature for Radeon but I forget if its called the same thing or has a different name Doesnt help with the fact that 4k doesnt have perfect scaling down to 1440p though but with many GPUs and games supporting upscaling what could be an internal game render resolution of 1440p could use DLSS FSR to take it up to 4k without the usual janky blur,myiu3j4,3.0,1leh1bm
comment,mz6rl30,MeatSafeMurderer,,0,2025-06-22 17:44:30,,,,Nearest neighbour and integer scaling are actually two separate things although they are most useful when combined You can do bilinear filtered integer scales and you can even do nearest neighbour noninteger scales but you shouldnt It shouldnt be locked behind a driver feature either its high time displays supported it natively,mz53uaq,4.0,1leh1bm
comment,mykq0oa,CosmicCreeperz,,1,2025-06-19 04:08:05,,,,Hah or just buy 2 displays Hell could probably buy 4 for the same cost,mygtcr7,2.0,1leh1bm
comment,myi9acr,FlarblesGarbles,,7,2025-06-18 19:47:26,,,,I think youd be surprised at how much resolution people can actually resolve 315 isnt even that big it puts it into the same region of pixel density as a high end Macbook display Im a photographer and it would be useful to be able to properly see image details from their thumbnails and this sort of display would be on its way to doing that Plus something people dont really talk about is that nonintega scaling looks way better the finer the pixels With high enough density displays wed be able to use monitors in a simlar fashion to CRTs in terms of resolution choices because the pixels would be so fine that youd never be able to tell what the native resolution was supposed to be,mygcxo7,1.0,1leh1bm
comment,mz54c4j,DigitalStefan,,1,2025-06-22 12:20:31,,,,4k at 27 has been the sweet spot for me for productivity stuff I use Windows display scaling at 150 to make the effective screen space mimic a 1440p display I get the same zoom level as a 1440p display just with much crisper text Id be interested in this 8k display for productivity except I have a pair of 4k displays at the moment which physically are about the right size for what I need to do on a daily basis I have previously worked with two 1600p 30 displays side by side with big bezels so probably as big as this new 8k display it was a bit clunky Moving to the 4k displays was a definite upgrade in terms of usability as well as display quality,myi9acr,2.0,1leh1bm
comment,mykokai,CosmicCreeperz,,2,2025-06-19 03:57:46,,,,It is Thats why almost everyone else making displays and devices has given up on it Complexity in the hardware the software the video content etc with very minimal gain,mygcxo7,1.0,1leh1bm
comment,myh9zd1,danielv123,,3,2025-06-18 17:02:08,,,,I have been looking for 24 4k because my eyes are good That dpi is hard to find outside laptops Ill admit 8k 31 is more than even I care for,mygcxo7,1.0,1leh1bm

comment,myh7xyg,hisfootstancewack,,12,2025-06-18 16:52:47,,,,Its funny because Im sure people thought 4k 120hz monitors were overkill back in the day I wonder if this will eventually be more common in top end setups or if we will truly hit a ceiling,,0.0,1leh1bm
comment,myryr9i,Keteo,,6,2025-06-20 08:05:40,,,,People have been saying that the eye cant see more than 60 Hz and that you cant see the difference between HD and 4k I think this mostly comes from people who havent tried it I saw a 32 inch 8k monitor next to a 32 inch 4k monitor many years ago before 4k became mainstream and the difference is night and day Ive been waiting for proper 8k monitors ever since,myh7xyg,1.0,1leh1bm
comment,mz5azap,DigitalStefan,,3,2025-06-22 13:05:57,,,,The eye cant see people come from the generation who never played around with a CRT monitor to get it to 200Hz at a low resolution Its taken more than 3 decades for flat panel displays to get close to the colour depth contrast and motion clarity of a CRT,myryr9i,2.0,1leh1bm

comment,mygwegb,Asleeper135,,7,2025-06-18 15:58:13,,,,Thats neat but Im not really sure who would buy one It better have at top notch HDR too or else even people that want needless overkill wont go for it,,0.0,1leh1bm

comment,myjqqfg,a_rabid_buffalo,,2,2025-06-19 00:26:57,,,,Nice now lets actually make GPUa that can support those kinds of frames and fidelity without ai upscaling and not cost 4000 7000,,0.0,1leh1bm
comment,mz2szjx,ninereins48,,1,2025-06-22 00:54:39,,,,New 50 series cards support DP 21 UBHR 20 a 50805090 would be able to do 4K 2408K 120 on older games easily AMD has supported it even longer Even games like Halo Infinite I can render at around 6K 120hz without too many drops on a 5080,myjqqfg,1.0,1leh1bm

comment,mygyxqu,stahpstaring,,-14,2025-06-18 16:10:11,,,,Barely any human can differentiate between 4K and 8k especially on the screen sizes we use in our homes Basically its just a gimmick to get to sell more screens to idiots who want the new cool thing,,0.0,1leh1bm
comment,myh5f4k,andynator1000,,8,2025-06-18 16:40:54,,,,8k is overkill but you could absolutely tell a difference between the two at a normal viewing distance with a 32 monitor especially with text,mygyxqu,1.0,1leh1bm

comment,myh5wc1,whaletosser,,3,2025-06-18 16:43:09,,,,The human eyes ability to distinguish pixels often measured in pixels per inch PPI varies based on viewing distance and individual visual acuity While some sources suggest the average human eye can perceive detail up to around 300 PP this can be higher or lower depending on how close the viewer is to the image At closer viewing distances the eye can resolve more detail 315 at 8k is about 280 pixels per inch and with correct scaling it makes fonts look fantastically sharp,mygyxqu,1.0,1leh1bm
comment,myhnhaa,Specken_zee_Doitch,,1,2025-06-18 18:03:18,,,,It makes a normal to large desktop sized monitor a Retina display to borrow Apples wording it means text is newsprint quality Its pretty close to the end of diminishing returns for displays after that its color brightness longevity improvements Obviously higher resolutions for some very specialized use cases like medical imagining and miniaturization so that we can get dual 8k 120hz in a head mounted display,mygyxqu,1.0,1leh1bm
