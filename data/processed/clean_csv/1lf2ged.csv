comment,mylagpg,saposapot,,167,2025-06-19 06:56:19,,,,Love the company and their goal and the price doesnt seem too much but the economics are really though When you can basically buy 2 laptops for the price of this one it makes very hard to justify the durability and repairability They need to have some quality redeeming features which they seem to have with the keyboard experience Probably need to offer a better display everything else seems to be more or less reasonable for this model goal Hopefully they get bigger and bigger and I can find it on my country,,0.0,1lf2ged
comment,mylfbrl,StraY_WolF,,106,2025-06-19 07:42:36,,,,Its chicken and egg problem they can lower the cost once they got many orders which they wouldnt get because currently their stuff is expensive,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged

comment,mymakgy,WFlumin8,,69,2025-06-19 12:14:17,,,,At 800 its right in the crosshair of the MacBook Air which is sort of the antithesis to this laptop a very NON repairable and NON modular laptop that has Build quality 100 aluminum most rigid chassis of any laptop manufacturer Speaker quality best sound quality of any laptop period unless you compare it to a MacBook Pro Keyboard quality best scissor style switch style keyboard of any laptop Battery life best battery life for any laptop in any price bracket Considering the MacBook Air exists for the same price I think framework definitely needs to get the laptop to a price point just a tiny bit lower to avoid the comparison,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymkul4,VictoriaRose0,,24,2025-06-19 13:16:22,,,,Thats my problem with laptops currently Apple has been making strides with Macs and honestly if they release a new base MacBook thats cheaper than the Air theyll probably get even more interest I bought a 1000 laptop that had terrible build quality battery life and screen but was powerful enough to play games Cool but the M1 MacBook Air I got two years later felt like I could actually use it like a laptop while still having enough power to run some stuff while the current Mchips are way more powerful on Macs All I can think is that is that there has to be some way to get that experience at the same prices its crazy that theres still no 11 MacBook alternatives and I say that as someone that wants to have a Linux laptop but cant even find a decent windows one to just install over Im just waiting for OLED to upgrade to a new MacBook,mymakgy,2.0,1lf2ged
comment,myoil04,m0rogfar,,14,2025-06-19 19:09:25,,,,The rest of the laptop industry has always struggled to make a laptop experience thats as nice as Apples at the same price Thats been true largely nonstop since the PowerBook 170 release in 1991 The laptop format just plays too much into Apples strengths of topnotch driver integration and needing the OEM to actually be competent Choosing a nonApple laptop has almost always been about either cost nonApple laptops have almost always started at far less and while theyre compromised saving the money could be worth it to you wanting a fundamentally different feature mix the most common being a laptop thats okayish at games but terrible at being a laptop or platform lockin if you need Windowsonly software you may have to settle for a worse product even if youre willing to pay more than Apples price,mymkul4,3.0,1lf2ged

comment,mymbzs8,unematti,,10,2025-06-19 12:23:25,,,,How I justified it was easy Either I get a repairable thing like the fw13 or a cheap chromebook Because it doesnt matter what any other company offers I can do my gaming on GeForce now if I really want to And browsing is fine on a chromebook And they come in at 300 euro on sale sometimes Right next week they opened the fw16 preorder So yeah I definitely am never gonna think about buying other brands unless they can bring the same level of features And if you use it for work price really isnt the thing to look at About the display Yeee on all 3 I hope therell be a compatible oled Id pay another 1k or more for an oledmicroled,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymebg3,VampyreLust,,6,2025-06-19 12:38:06,,,,Question my understanding of the framework laptops is that theyre repairable in the sense that framework themselves offer specific parts that you can swap in and out to either repair or upgrade but these arent standard parts so if the company goes under youre boned I have an old laptop kicking around from around 2018 that is slow af but you can replace the ram hd wifi chip battery ssd screen fans etc on if you have a torx set and the tiniest bit of knowledge Since these are all standard parts it doesnt matter if the company goes out of business because the company doesnt make them Is this not the better way to go about repairability like it used to be when you could change out components at will and not have to rely on only one company to supply them No shade meant just asking the question to the community,mymbzs8,2.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymjhcr,unematti,,19,2025-06-19 13:08:35,,,,They use a screen thats originally was for another brand so you can get a new screen from aliexpress RAM is standard sodimm ssd is nvme wifi is also Schematics are open so if you start a company wanting to make input modules for the fw16 you can The cards are also open theres a projectI hope that isnt dead that aims to make a dual type c card I also have a pair of RGB input module matrices that was made by a third party and to which the CEO themselves contributed by sending casings so the guy can build them easier And all this with a factory supplied screwdriver they ship with the laptop I think even the boards are open sourced so technically you could build one but thats way outside my expertise to even think about Theres a RISCV board for the fw13 which I think is third party technically,mymebg3,3.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymkrib,VampyreLust,,6,2025-06-19 13:15:53,,,,So to be clear if you bought a framework laptop you could upgrade it yourself by buying any compatible SSD or ram from your local computer store,mymjhcr,4.0,1lf2ged

comment,mz60kxx,Careve,,1,2025-06-22 15:28:37,,,,You can go even further buy their laptop without ssd and ram and then use your own I did that and saved around 100,mymur53,7.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymg3th,ironmaiden1872,,12,2025-06-19 12:48:54,,,,No they go a step further and make available the schematics so you can actually fix the laptops with good ol soldering,mymebg3,3.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymgqvh,VampyreLust,,-4,2025-06-19 12:52:43,,,,Ok what are the percentages of normal people that will do that compared to ones that will just buy a new mobo,mymg3th,4.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymhvy6,ironmaiden1872,,19,2025-06-19 12:59:20,,,,The schematics are available to third party vendors as well That means you can also bring it to a shop and they can actually fix things This community is also very DIY for the record,mymgqvh,5.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymk9ij,VampyreLust,,-5,2025-06-19 13:13:03,,,,Thats cool When you say the community do you mean the community of people willing to solder or the community that is cross shopping it with an HP or Dell cuz thats the only way a company that makes laptops will be around in 10 years if they can appeal to the masses,mymhvy6,6.0,1lf2ged
comment,myoetgi,lordraiden007,,4,2025-06-19 18:48:39,,,,Being able to reduce future costs by easily switching in new motherboards is a pretty big sell for some No need to buy another full laptop the next time and the mainboards are usually less than half the cost of a full device eg the Laptop 12 costs 799 for the base model but the mainboard for same costs only 249 Basically you can switch to a new mainboard as long as its the same form factor I believe,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,myozj78,saposapot,,0,2025-06-19 20:32:19,,,,Problem is 799 plus 249 gives you 1050 which is more than enough to buy 2 maybe even 3 laptops with similar specs the economics are really hard to justify Sure in 10 years it will compensate but will they support it for 10 years For 5 years for example doesnt seem to justify,myoetgi,2.0,1lf2ged
comment,myp5xud,lordraiden007,,10,2025-06-19 21:03:13,,,,Its a luxury brand no one is denying that You pay for the quality of the build the high degree of customization the open sourced part platform the options for EOL hardware etc I can buy a framework laptop upgrade the board 35 years later when it gets old then 3D print a chassis to make the old board into a SFF server to run stuff on Ive even seen posts of people turning their old boards into a small NAS supporting up to 9 SATA drives Name a single laptop brand that lets you do the same things Its definitely niche but it has value to the people its meant to cater towards,myozj78,3.0,1lf2ged
comment,mysom44,tylerderped,,5,2025-06-20 11:51:58,,,,When you can basically buy 2 laptops for the price of this People say the same thing about Macs Neither Framework nor Apple sell bottom tier crap tho,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,mynut9y,Heyitsthatdude69,,3,2025-06-19 17:05:50,,,,In my experience cheap laptops last the shortest amount of time possible Its Boots Theory Sure you can buy a 400 laptop twice but their longevity battery life useability is gonna be lackluster in comparison to a nicer laptop like the framework It makes the economics make a lot more sense imo At the end of the day it is more upfront expensive to build a laptop this way Thats just something you have to swallow as a consumer if you want to support this type of manufacturing But it will get cheaper and the dividends are there,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,myozyqz,saposapot,,1,2025-06-19 20:34:26,,,,That is true but this 12 is trying to get a different market of cheaper laptops chromebooks Its harder to justify the higher quality for this market For me it can still justify because I just cant use a bad keyboard or a bad LCD so I dont mind paying extra but Im not the target for this specific model,mynut9y,2.0,1lf2ged
comment,myq7a3d,nsaps,,1,2025-06-20 00:27:49,,,,I love the idea of frameworks but heres the thing businesses buy a shit load of laptops then get rid of them after 3 or 5 years and you can get a quality computer for a few hundred dollars Its not as sustainable but until you get the businesses on board itll be hard for something like this to really take off My family that just needs an everyday YouTube and internet shopping laptop I hook up with old thinkpads 300 gets you a solid computer that will last a few more years with minimal upkeep its hard to argue for something much more expensive thats upgradable when they can just get another 300 leftover laptop in 3 years,mylagpg,1.0,1lf2ged

comment,myl6tcj,speculatrix,,32,2025-06-19 06:23:22,,,,Earlier this year Framework announced it was making a smaller 12inch laptop and a beefy desktop to go alongside its 13 and 16inch notebooks A few months later and the former has arrived putting the same modular repairable laptop into a slightly smaller body Unlike its bigger siblings the Laptop 12 is a 122inch touchscreen convertible clad in brightly colored plastic Its aimed at students with a focus on robustness and quality you wont see in the usual machines you find at the top of the bargain list,,0.0,1lf2ged
comment,mymyyu9,Chanw11,,34,2025-06-19 14:31:27,,,,I know this isnt a good conparison but i think its really interesting that the price comes around the same price as a new MacBook air Wildly different objectives but at the same price The least repairable laptop vs the most repairable laptop You can really see where they put the money at,,0.0,1lf2ged
comment,mysx3sl,Mathisbuilder75,,13,2025-06-20 12:46:24,,,,The Framework also doubles as a tablet so you could get a lot more value out of it especially as a student,mymyyu9,1.0,1lf2ged

comment,myss2uy,lwurl2,,9,2025-06-20 12:15:03,,,,For me its the principle of the company knowing I can make my 800 last much longer My FW13 also is more than other comparable devices but having had to replace the keyboard deck and another friend who just broke her display When I said Id replace the display for her for just the cost of the parts she was like THIS IS AMAZING,,0.0,1lf2ged
comment,myogizs,Gregsticles_,,16,2025-06-19 18:58:04,,,,It was a good read until the actual specs came out Charging 800 for something like that isnt viable in any market And the market is cutthroat af this company needs to really figure out something fast,,0.0,1lf2ged
comment,mys4nrc,simon132,,14,2025-06-20 09:03:28,,,,It depends if your other computer has a battery problem speaker dies etc there goes the value of a nonrepairable laptop With the framework you can just pop it open and swap a part instead of buying a new laptop You can also just buy a new motherboard for your laptop two years later which costs about 250 instead of buying a whole new laptop soits actually better in price and you can keep up with specs,myogizs,1.0,1lf2ged
comment,mytjmte,artguy55,,5,2025-06-20 14:46:40,,,,OMG so short sighted look at the total cost of ownership including the cost of being locked in to the apple or MS system you have to include the cost of years of apple care and then the framework price is much better,,0.0,1lf2ged

comment,myx5add,sosthaboss,,3,2025-06-21 02:08:12,,,,I havent had to pay a single cent in repair costs for my 2017 MacBook that I still use daily The one time the screen broke because I dropped it on a tile floor they replaced it for free even though I didnt have applecare because the tech appreciated me being honest about dropping it instead of trying to say it just stopped working Otherwise its run perfectly without any breaks or issues So no clue what youre really on about Maybe try taking care of your electronics,mywxxgg,3.0,1lf2ged

comment,myyi31t,chriscwjd,,3,2025-06-21 08:55:20,,,,You wouldnt typically get a free repair for drop damage I expect you would think differently had you been charged the market rate Also you lectured artguy55 on taking care their electronics having just told us you dropped yours on the floor which is amusing,myxwlah,6.0,1lf2ged
comment,mz0bd38,sosthaboss,,2,2025-06-21 16:29:19,,,,One drop in 8 years is pretty good And they were implying Apple laptops break easily on their own all the time which they simply dont And I know I wouldnt normally get it for free my point is that even when the damage is the users fault Apple still doesnt always charge you So his point about high repair costs is stupid They rarely break,myyi31t,7.0,1lf2ged
comment,mzjjhed,BreakfastTypical1434,,1,2025-06-24 16:56:44,,,,I have a friend who works at a middle school with macbooks I think he would disagree He is a always telling me how they break constantly from random hardware failures to cracked screens to issues with needing to be reset I mean it sounds like you were the exception not the rule Also use case varies but apple is a top of the line product for a reason I think their apple care is a consistent thing most people pay for,mz0bd38,8.0,1lf2ged
