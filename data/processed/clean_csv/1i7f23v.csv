comment,m8n3rq7,WillArrr,,16,2025-01-23 00:46:11,,,,It is The backstory to the Dune universe is that humanity originally entered the interstellar age with more typical scifi technology namely advanced AI machines powered by supercomputers This is how ftl travel was first accomplished with the AI plotting courses and making adjustments based on billions of onthefly calculations and predictions The problem was that AI was also super useful in other ways such as media manipulation and direct control of the masses by the ruling elite who controlled the machines Eventually the masses got sick of it and a revolution took place called the Butlerian Jihad The aftermath of the Jihad resulted in the universal agreement that man must never be replaced or ruled by machine and anything that could be construed as a thinking machine became forbidden to the point of being sacrilegious Hence the weird regressive technology seen in the Dune story they quite literally got rid of everything more advanced and replaced it with human power and drugs,m8mlvi7,3.0,1i7f23v
