comment,mhinr8z,PineappleLemur,,3,2025-03-13 05:07:35,,,,Just cheaper size of this is a bit misleading This is just the microcontrollers IC it needs a bunch of peripherals and other components to actually function or do something useful Its equivalent of making GPU the size of a AA battery You still need all the other parts to make use of it on its own its not so useful,mhi7w6i,1.0,1ja21dy

comment,mhmi9ir,alidan,,1,2025-03-13 20:02:53,,,,real world for us we have cameras we can swallow in pills internal medicine is a big use of miniaturization of shit like this if its cheap to make it smaller it also means that the cost of silicon goes down for products and you can either make them cheaper or make the products for cheaper increasing profit realistically it can be used to insert into a design and potentially circumvent being traced as a spy tool take for example intels sub cpu for their management it acts and never lets the user know what its doing then cysco had a backdoor that if it was used would let traffic go through a network without telling the user or logging anything if you have something that could act as a keylogger sending data out in ways that arent reporting home gg on security,mhi7w6i,1.0,1ja21dy
