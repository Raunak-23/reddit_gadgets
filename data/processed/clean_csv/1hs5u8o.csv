comment,m56y4ih,GigabitISDN,,3,2025-01-03 15:18:33,,,,Thats a whole separate issue that unfortunately occurred shortly before the 24H2 issue so a lot of people are confused The launcher issue is easily fixed by removing a folder but the 24H2 issue has to do with DRM certificates Apparently quite a large number of older games were impacted,m56v6fa,3.0,1hs5u8o

comment,m56kioj,Jaquemart,,5,2025-01-03 13:57:32,,,,Because theres no company where it wouldnt happen Because you still have that ink subscription Because you had a good experience with the old printer And of course because its all Microsofts fault not the printers makers,m56470z,3.0,1hs5u8o

comment,m55n3w0,stellvia2016,,13,2025-01-03 09:02:15,,,,I honestly feel like the butthurt over 11 is mostly overblown Ive used it for around 16 months or so and its been fine I think the biggest litmus test on whether people mesh with 11 or not is if they were already used to using the search bar for most actions when using Win10 The Quick Menu in 11 is really nice when you customize it and when youre used to simply typing the first couple letters of whatever you want to do and hitting enter That said I realize Im not necessarily the general consumer experience because Im running W11 Pro and not Home and its been ingrained in me over the years to turn off all the telemetry including doing some registry edits The entire process only takes like 30mins on initial setup and I dont even think about it again Not that Im condoning MS releasing 24H2 in the state its in but IMHO life is too short for me to waste many brain cycles on stuff like that Ill just hit pause andor lock in my feature update in the registry until its fixed,m550o4a,1.0,1hs5u8o
comment,m55rnxz,mumbullz,,2,2025-01-03 09:50:42,,,,I agree tbhI suspect sneaking 24h2 and copilot on people is the main culprit for the hate aside of some required customizations to make 11 feel and look a bit like 10 I didnt understand the hate till it happened to me but after downgrading back to 23h2 and setting a policy to stick with 23h2 and opting out of new system features things are fine But it is understandable that a lot of consumers cba with customizing update settingssetting policies and editing the registry,m55n3w0,2.0,1hs5u8o
comment,m57a47e,stellvia2016,,1,2025-01-03 16:21:32,,,,Sure but at the same time there are utilities out there that will do it for you Someone else mentioned Win Aero Tweaker for example Maybe Im not the norm but I understand nothing will be tailored to my exact wants and needs out of the box so Im okay with taking 30 mins to configure it I also take it as a matter of course that newer isnt always better so I will defer patches unless I hear theyre a critical Day0 security patch So many times I hear people say theyre crashing and its because they download the latest GPU driver every time for example Even Linux for all its positives still requires a lot of customization Arguably more than Windows simply in different ways,m55rnxz,3.0,1hs5u8o
