comment,m7xvfh5,grafknives,,2,2025-01-19 06:12:30,,,,The issue is that apple and Google statedmore FUD than legal statements that phone with alternative aps is compromised Not safe anymore And because we use phone ls as our digital identity it was very effective But from 2024 there are alternative store fronts for Apple and they are official And because of that Google changed its billing method That was EU force acting on google,m7v38b3,6.0,1i422l9
comment,m81v5hh,FireLucid,,1,2025-01-19 21:26:42,,,,Google changed its billing practices because Apple allowed other storefronts That makes no sense Id say its the EU force like you said later on Dont live in the EU so missed that,m7xvfh5,7.0,1i422l9

comment,m7tt5i8,thisischemistry,,4,2025-01-18 16:59:08,,,,Apple even wants to take 30 cut of things like your monthly subscription to spotify if you subscribe while using their device Someone makes an app for X dollars sells it for Y on a service they are charged a percent for selling it so the app store makes money Someone makes an app for X dollars sells it for nothing on a service the service gets nothing because a percent of nothing is nothing However the app sells subscriptions to pay for development Now the app store doesnt make money unless it also collects on those subscriptions There are lots of ways to try to stop this kind of skirting of the rules for example you could charge a flat amount for selling an app on the service That would punish smaller companies that are selling simple and small apps and give larger ones a nearlyfree ride So we end up with the current solution Its not perfect but every solution is going to cause some issue this is large companies pointing fingers at each other and generating rage in their users to the companys benefit,m7tf7an,4.0,1i422l9
comment,m7trmy8,thisischemistry,,4,2025-01-18 16:51:44,,,,Not just them its an industrywide thing Epic Microsoft Sony Nintendo Valve and many others charge approximately the same fees to sell on their devicesapp stores Its the price of doing business Now perhaps we should look at that practice but Im not sure that it can be changed Yes it might be good to cut down profit margins and lower prices but that will only go so far At some point people need to get paid for their work its just a matter of how much is fair So whats a justifiable cut for creating API developing tools running an online store vetting products on it and so on I cant say A lot of times the fees drop down to 15 for those stores so it can be done but how low can it drop before it becomes unprofitable to run them The old models of individuals selling software without a combined storefront had its costs too ones that severely punished the smaller players A Microsoft can create an online store and sell their stuff through it at a very discounted cost an independent developer would have to spend a ton of their time and money on running one So it can be a very good thing to have a Steam or similar it allows smaller developers to sell their stuff without the large overhead of a store So whats a fair fee for that sort of thing Im not just talking about a guess at the amount Im talking about a detailed analysis of whats fair For all we know 30 might be fair After all back in the day of physical stores they might sell a product to a retailer for 10 and the retailer would resell it for 20 Thats a 100 cut A 30 cut when it first came out was looked at as an incredible value by many independent developers,m7s2qg6,3.0,1i422l9

comment,m7sdn6v,_EleGiggle_,,0,2025-01-18 11:42:13,,,,Dont forget the yearly 99 subscription fee from Apple even if you only submit free and open source apps Id imagine thats a reason why Android has more free apps Unfortunately some of those are malware eat the rich From the perspective of the cheap workers that have to assembly your iPhone for pennies thats you Edit Given the downvotes did the change of perspective offend you How youre much richer than most people on the world that make the stuff youre buying and wearing Sure you and someone like Jeff Bezos have an even higher difference of net worth money but to him youre like the factory worker that Apple or basically everyone else in manufacturing pays pennies for assembling 1500 phones,m7ry2vb,3.0,1i422l9

comment,m7se4bl,_EleGiggle_,,-8,2025-01-18 11:46:36,,,,You can use two smartphones and compare their readings In my opinion consistency of the readings matters more than accuracy unless youre going for a noise complaint and need the exact decibels Also I assume thats a known fact otherwise why would anyone buy specialized equipment,m7rvcvd,2.0,1i422l9

comment,m7sl3bg,Superseaslug,,3,2025-01-18 12:45:03,,,,It was a general example And dynamic gain can throw off your reading immensely And if you dont need a specific number why bother other than loud anyway,m7siund,5.0,1i422l9
comment,m7smqau,_EleGiggle_,,0,2025-01-18 12:57:20,,,,It can be helpful if you want to file a noise complaint The logs of an app with timestamps is probably better than just saying they were loud in the night Although it probably wont be admittable as proof in court but enough for the police or your shared landlord,m7sl3bg,6.0,1i422l9
comment,m7smw0q,Superseaslug,,3,2025-01-18 12:58:29,,,,I suppose that would work but looking at an audio waveform would likely be more accurate The dynamic gain would probably read a lot higher than it actually is in that instance although that likely would help your case,m7smqau,7.0,1i422l9
comment,m7so4ae,_EleGiggle_,,1,2025-01-18 13:07:21,,,,I doubt that the police would actually know the difference and you probably dont want to record the whole week for a single waveform They probably want an average or something like that Or the waveform during the night where they woke you up I guess with an added recording so they know its not you making the noise unless thats included in the app,m7smw0q,8.0,1i422l9

comment,m7sasxn,_EleGiggle_,,4,2025-01-18 11:15:37,,,,This You have to pay 99 a year just to be able to submit free apps to the Apple App Store while the Google Play Store is free Although both have a commission for paid apps and ingame purchases But the amount of apps with expensive subscriptions is way too high on iOS compared to Android Youll have to install like 10 apps if youre looking for something basic like an alarm that plays a song or Spotify and 910 apps come with an expensive subscription On the plus side iOS preinstalled stock apps are usually slightly better than their Android version I mean youll have to pay a premium and I hope some of that was spent on additional app development and usability studies So those apps might be enough for many users I dont mind paying 35 once for a good app that I use almost daily But something like 999 a month is ridiculous Even MS Office charges less a month for the complete package Although I get it that a onetime purchase might not cover a reoccurring yearly fee for apps with a small user base I dont get people who rather sit through multiple ads per day or the ones who permanently take 14 of the bottom screen Especially if its a onetime payment for no ads thats less than 5 and they use the app daily Just buy one less Kebab or Starbucks Coffee and youre good I know theres a rather complicated workaround to use Spotify as your alarm but that shouldnt be necessary Just make it part of the alarm tone selection Even Apple Music would be sufficient,m7s9i14,2.0,1i422l9
comment,m7tjgo4,apocolipse,,1,2025-01-18 16:11:07,,,,100 incorrect Im an app dev and this couldnt be further from the truth Apple isnt forcing devs to ad anything Devs can still release free apps the yearly dev cost has been the same 99 since the AppStore came out What Apple has done is make subscription options significantly easier for devs to charge subscriptions Previously it was just onetime cost or free but subscriptions you had to manage payment yourself Now Apple manages subscriptions for devs so its just easier to add The REASON more apps are using a subscription model is very simple one time purchases dont pay for continued support and development Put it this way Theres no financial incentive to fix bugs for users who wont give you any more money since they already paid once Subscriptions on the other hand incentivize devs to continuously improve in order to KEEP subscribers Additionally apps usually hit a peak user base in order to keep generating revenue Devs must either get more users which is impossible at a certain point make new apps or charge for usage Subscriptions fit the bill there Developers need to get paid in order to justify continuing to work on something Yes the subscribe and forget effect does factor into that calculus which plenty of greedy companies take advantage of but the primary driver is just having a continuous revenue stream instead of one giant lump then nothing,m7s9i14,2.0,1i422l9

comment,m7sla6c,andyooo,,4,2025-01-18 12:46:29,,,,They mean that the camera also has clean HDMI output and you can output that into an HDMI to USB capture card so it behaves like a webcam But that is is completely missing the point There are other ways to do it yes but thats not the issue here its Canon charging a subscription for software that doesnt merit it Its not even needed to cover development they can just charge for updates later if they want,m7sem74,2.0,1i422l9
comment,m7sn1j6,_EleGiggle_,,1,2025-01-18 12:59:35,,,,I see I kinda assumed they would all use their own proprietary output instead but thats good news Do they have to pay the subscription if they connect the camera with HDMI I cant tell what the EOS Webcam utility actually offers Edit Is it for cheaper cameras without HDMI output or whats the added value,m7sla6c,3.0,1i422l9
comment,m7snkv4,andyooo,,5,2025-01-18 13:03:29,,,,No thats just the cameras functionality I dont think OBS needed either any webcam compatible app should work But while this is still scummy by Canon their newer cameras like my R6 Mark II have a webcam function baked into the firmware so theres no need for the Canon app just connect the camera via USB and its a regular webcam so the blog post the article is based on is exaggerating a bit,m7sn1j6,4.0,1i422l9
comment,m7snqjt,_EleGiggle_,,1,2025-01-18 13:04:38,,,,I see That sounds pretty nice to not need any software at all anymore But yeah the subscription seems pretty scummy Edit I hope that Windows and Android offer that feature as well so that any newish Android smartphone is instantly recognized as a webcam They could probably make it part of the dialog when you plug it into a computer if you just want to charge or file access It being mounted as a webcam could be an additional option,m7snkv4,5.0,1i422l9

comment,m7skkcy,andyooo,,7,2025-01-18 12:40:58,,,,If going from DSLR to mirrorless there is no loss of quality cause the adapters are basically just spacers without any optics but switching brands may probably will result in some settings not working due to the electronic communication between lens and camera,m7sj8jj,4.0,1i422l9

comment,m7tlxry,critical2210,,1,2025-01-18 16:23:32,,,,There might be but one of the reasons I switched to Nikon Z over Canon R was that the glass was much cheaper for older high end gear so part of me actually wanted to buy new lenses I still have my canon 6D its still an awesome camera and I use it to teach my friends how to take photos,m7sxzuz,3.0,1i422l9
