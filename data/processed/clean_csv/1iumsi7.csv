comment,me0vcmn,unfinishedtoast3,,50,2025-02-21 17:42:30,,,,Ya the founder dude is in there I watched an interview with him on BBC I want to say last week He wouldnt let them film the inside of the car wouldnt allow them close ups or even let them get within like 50 feet of it Then he jumped in it and flew like 15 feet above the ground while another car drove under him He said it could also be driven like a normal car but he didnt show that and I absolutely doubt it has a standard engine AND drone fans Its just a massive drone in a car shell,me01mt2,3.0,1iumsi7

comment,mgzyn2s,Human-Assumption-524,,1,2025-03-10 10:04:06,,,,I mean it is an actual vehicle Whether or not it meets the specifications they claim or actually makes it to production which neither will probably be the case is another thing In the case of Theranos they never even had a prototype just hype,me2a2zp,5.0,1iumsi7
comment,me21leq,psilent,,1,2025-02-21 21:02:55,,,,Yeah most likely they cant drive it yet from the other images there seems to be nothing near the wheels that might be a motor Id still take a giant single seater drone though that sounds fun,me0vcmn,4.0,1iumsi7

comment,me4vjmm,ILikeCutePuppies,,1,2025-02-22 08:48:05,,,,The cool thing is that the car sides become wings so that it can actually have more than a few minutes of flight time Well that is the idea at least They are a long way off,mdzacm8,2.0,1iumsi7

comment,me6uagz,Xenobsidian,,1,2025-02-22 16:49:39,,,,You dont want to fly you want to place the traffic in three dimensions This technology is called bridges and tunnels And for longer flights we have helicopters and airplanes The issue with this concept is its neither a good car since most of it is an empty plastic shell nor is it a good aircraft since it has to carry the extra weight of the empty plastic shell wheels and what else it needs to pretend to be a car Its like Swiss army knife yes you have many options but neither of them is nearly as good as the dedicated tools would be,me6oxe3,5.0,1iumsi7
comment,me6x02w,ILikeCutePuppies,,1,2025-02-22 17:02:02,,,,You cant walk outside to your helicopter unless you are mega rich Planes only fly to certain places at certain times and sometimes you are sitting at the airport longer than the flight takes I have literally driven to Vagas from the airport in LA and gotten to the hotel before the plane I was going to take landed Then you have to fly to dedicated ports and switch to a car thats not anything like being able to drive to a dedicated fly location and immediately take off then land and continue on your way There are significant amounts of downtime in between They will never be able to build enough bridges etc to solve traffic Bridgesroads require a huge amount of investment time and negotiations and often they are just cancelled Its never going to be a good solution I would consider this car closer to a motorbike You arent gonna be using it exactly like a car but it does take 2 passengers and has more protection than a motor bike with its protective dome Its still in very early concept phase and its probably not going to work well without using the most bleeding edge technology for motors and batteries I am not putting money on it but I could see a company succeeding in this area at some point,me6uagz,6.0,1iumsi7
comment,me6zful,Xenobsidian,,1,2025-02-22 17:13:19,,,,Let me rephrase that you dont want to fly over the traffic you want the traffic to work properly and there are plenty of ways to achieve this This thing will never be a commercial solution Just imagine you want to fly over the traffic jam and the guy three cars before you takes off at the same time Crash Or imagine you can fly for three minutes but the line is so long that you cant get a place to lend before you run out of energy Crash And we havent even started what licenses and legal requirements you need to operate the thing in the first place I am sure at one point it will be a a product you can buy but it will be a rich peoples toy with very little practical applications A dedicated multicopter that never tries to be a car or sufficiently developed autonomous cars with a coordinated system that avoids traffic jams will be soooooo much more useful for the general customer,me6x02w,7.0,1iumsi7
comment,me727tb,ILikeCutePuppies,,1,2025-02-22 17:26:20,,,,I dont think initially these cars will be used the way in the video Theyll drive to dedicated spots for taking off You might be able to get one at your home Youll also be able to land in dedicated spots I think it will be a long time until one is hopping over cars This is the same with other car planes that already are lisensed Licensing the owner of these things is not new There are phase and they work with the FAA Initally the vehicle requires a person have a pilot license I agree that initially the wealthy will have these but thats how things normally work with technology Initally only the wealth had cars I dont agree that it will never be able commerial solution We already have car planes that are purchasable see PALV There is always someone saying it wont work and then 20 years later it is common place I remember people laughing at the first delivery drones for example and now there are millions of drone deliveries a day,me6zful,8.0,1iumsi7
comment,me7hlpt,Xenobsidian,,1,2025-02-22 18:39:24,,,,I dont think initially these cars will be used the way in the video Theyll drive to dedicated spots for taking off You might be able to get one at your home Youll also be able to land in dedicated spots I think it will be a long time until one is hopping over cars This concept already exist for pure multicopter that does not waste recourses on the car part This is the same with other car planes that already are lisensed Licensing the owner of these things is not new There are phase and they work with the FAA Initally the vehicle requires a person have a pilot license Yes and all of this concepts are just expensive toys I agree that initially the wealthy will have these but thats how things normally work with technology Initally only the wealth had cars I dont agree that it will never be able commerial solution We already have car planes that are purchasable see PALV Before this will become commercially meaningful you already have commercials meaningful mylticopter services and autonomic cabs that solve the problem It will not make sense to combine them There is always someone saying it wont work and then 20 years later it is common place As you mentions there are flying car concepts since decades and they never worked But not because it is technically impossible it obviously is but because the actual problem it solves is solved easier another way and that will not change The only possibility is that tech billionaires take over and let the infrastructure of fall apart then you need a vehicle that individually overcomes the issue Under such circumstances it would start to make sense I remember people laughing at the first delivery drones for example and now there are millions of drone deliveries a day The delivery drones make sense under certain circumstances but in other areas where other forms of delivery work better drones still have a hard time,me727tb,9.0,1iumsi7
comment,me7lbm4,ILikeCutePuppies,,1,2025-02-22 18:57:06,,,,Divery drones really didnt exist 20 years ago Just because it doesnt exist now doesnt mean it wont in the future In the case of delivery drones sure they dont solve all cases but they are expanding fast into more cases There were 800 though drone deliveries in 2023 and there are going to be millions in 2025 By 2030 probably well probably be in the hundreds of millions of drone deliveries In the case of flying cars no the current technology being used did not exist and technology is a huge part of the hurdle Vtols and flying cars are much cheaper to develop today for example with better performance and safety characteristics which is needed for a technology to move towards increased adoption,me7hlpt,10.0,1iumsi7
comment,me7odcg,Xenobsidian,,1,2025-02-22 19:11:43,,,,You dont quite get the point The technology is secondary There have been flying cars since decades Just the demand for them is not there Maybe a desire sometimes but if you consider all the hurdles it comes with you suddenly think twice about it With drones it is completely different They are comparably cheep became reliable and improve a certain aspect of delivery cheeper than the alternatives could Thats why they seem to be successful The flying car however there will hardly ever be a demand that justifies the problems it has Is it possible to build Sure Does it make a lot of sense No,me7lbm4,11.0,1iumsi7
comment,me14y4m,GrynaiTaip,,1,2025-02-21 18:26:39,,,,Multicopter is a drone that uses more than one propeller for lift Regular typical ones are usually quadcopters,mdzacm8,2.0,1iumsi7
comment,me19tzo,Xenobsidian,,4,2025-02-21 18:49:13,,,,A drone is an unmanned vehicle but this is at least supposed to be manned Quadcopers are vehicles with four exactly four since quad means four propeller Mylticopter are vehicles with any nimble of propeller more than one I dont know exactly how many propeller this thing has but if memory serves it was at least two which is why I picked this term,me14y4m,3.0,1iumsi7

comment,me0irtj,BizzyM,,1,2025-02-21 16:44:35,,,,Drone should mean unmanned and autonomous These are Remote or Radio Controlled RC but RC seems to mean almost exclusively toy Quadcopter should just apply to the method of locomotion 4 rotors Quadcopter Drone vs RC quadcopter depending on method of control,mdz7ulw,2.0,1iumsi7
comment,me0ljsi,Scurro,,1,2025-02-21 16:57:25,,,,RC hobbyists tried correcting the usage of drone from the public years ago Drone is now just the go to word for anything small that flies without a human inside even if the drone requires a human 100 of the time to operate,me0irtj,3.0,1iumsi7

comment,me2lu0r,Knut79,,1,2025-02-21 22:40:45,,,,Except drone had mean rc craft for a couple of decades before that so w they were wrong The original use of drones where target practice rc planes And towed planes and ships behind kilometer long cables for life fire target practice and weapons tests,me0ljsi,4.0,1iumsi7

comment,mdzqqtp,veloace,,18,2025-02-21 14:27:49,,,,Not ultra light it says ultralight in the article which is different An ultralight is defined in 14 CFR Part 103 as an aircraft that is under certain weight and performance requirements and therefore does not require a pilots license to fly when flown in certain areas I havent done any research on this vehicle yet but I assume they built an ultralight version as a proofofconcept so they wouldnt have to go throw the certification process for their flying car to get an airworthiness certificate Edited to add Looked into it more and it looks like theyre flying under a Special Airworthiness Certificate Still it looks like theyre testing the software and related systems so a cheaper version is better to test with,mdyo92y,1.0,1iumsi7

comment,me07yhu,BERND_HENNING,,1,2025-02-21 15:53:48,,,,Oh thats interesting thank you for the insight Sounds like it would apply to something like drones I still wonder what concept they are trying to proof though since this seems to be vastly different from what theyre trying do Couldnt they just test an actual prototype given that they have one on private property like in a factory hall or something The only thing that this seems to proof is that a few interconnected drones with an extremely light load can take off vertically fly a few meters and land and i feel like ive seen that years ago But im no expert so im honestly curious how this is worth a message,mdzqqtp,2.0,1iumsi7
comment,me0em4m,veloace,,2,2025-02-21 16:25:16,,,,So in the US regardless if you are on private property or not youre on part of the National Airspace System so you have to abide by the FAA rules regardless whether it be drones manned aircraft rockets balloons etc so even if they wanted to make a fullsize version and test it on their property it would still require them to obtain an experimental airworthiness certificate That process is somewhat complicated but it isnt that bad as amateur homebuilders often go that route but it is a lot more work than just not getting an airworthiness certificate which is what you can do with an ultralight Furthermore if you certify an airplane as experimental you can do more with it BUT it must be flown as an ultralight So for this product the ultralight has two advantages 1 Its cheaper and quicker so they really can just throw it together real quick to see if it even works If the concept does then they can put the work towards building a fully operational larger aircraft 2 An ultralight does not require the operator to have a pilots license so in that aspect it is a much true flying car If it was any larger and NOT an ultralight it really wouldnt be a flying car anymore as the operator would need a pilots license So its just an airplane at that point Also if they are short on funding and a small company the ultralight prototype is a great way to show it can be done without going completely broke As for drones this is borrowing drone technology for the manned space which is great but a manned drone is no longer a drone And youre right its nothing particularly groundbreaking it just sounds like nerds having fun Which I dont know the size of the company but if it is just a few people getting together to build this and not something done by a large aerospace company it is a pretty impressive feat,me07yhu,3.0,1iumsi7

comment,me0tbto,That-Makes-Sense,,1,2025-02-21 17:33:16,,,,I applaud their efforts but this just doesnt look practical at all Its going to be a lousy flying vehicle and a lousy car Just like the amphicar and the aerocar when you try to design a vehicle for two completely different environments theyre going to suck at both Notice how they dont show it driving around I would be very surprised if this vehicle could pass any NHTSA crash tests And if it was designed to pass the crash tests it would be too heavy to fly Look at small airplanes and how thin their structures and exteriors are And thats with winged aircraft which require much less power to fly than VTOLs This design is DOA,,0.0,1iumsi7
