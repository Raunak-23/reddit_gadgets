comment,miwq5xc,silentcrs,,2,2025-03-21 02:28:28,,,,Well kind of Theyre built into the OS whatever it is and theres no way to change them out I dont know if you can call them apps if you cant actually manage them like apps Its like the Calculator program in MacOS 7 It and a few other programs came with the OS You couldnt get rid of them They were just there,miui1w5,1.0,1jfstt2
comment,miwqlzu,APirateAndAJedi,,10,2025-03-21 02:31:06,,,,An application is just software doing specific things A game is an application unequivocally It has nothing to do with how portable it is,miwq5xc,2.0,1jfstt2
comment,miws1zh,silentcrs,,4,2025-03-21 02:39:38,,,,Right but theres a term for this kind of thing other than applications In MacOS it was called something like desk toy Edit ok I looked it up It was called a desk accessory It had a very specific configuration under the hood Pretty interesting,miwqlzu,3.0,1jfstt2
comment,miwsuxr,APirateAndAJedi,,6,2025-03-21 02:44:26,,,,Anything used by an end user to perform a specific task is a computer application A desk accessory is an application A game is an application A clock widget is an application You are trying to differentiate things from applications that are in fact applications Youre trying to have a semantic argument and you are simultaneously incorrect about the semantics Thats all I was saying,miws1zh,4.0,1jfstt2
comment,miwvs9a,silentcrs,,2,2025-03-21 03:02:24,,,,Ive been in computing for 40 years Im having an architecture discussion not a semantics discussion Theres no such thing as an application for an embedded system Not to mention applications as a term only came to popularity with the general public around 2010 Before that we called them programs Before that it was just software,miwsuxr,5.0,1jfstt2
comment,mixy3m9,APirateAndAJedi,,-2,2025-03-21 08:40:38,,,,You literally said right but theres a different term Not only are you having a semantics argument by your own admission youre losing it And like most tech professionals youre absolutely incapable of admitting error even though everyone can see it in black and white Im guessing youre not a super successful tech professional,miwvs9a,6.0,1jfstt2
comment,miypi2p,silentcrs,,0,2025-03-21 12:36:34,,,,And like most tech professionals youre absolutely incapable of admitting error Thats a take Can you point on the doll to where IT hurt you,mixy3m9,7.0,1jfstt2
comment,miyvn82,APirateAndAJedi,,1,2025-03-21 13:13:47,,,,Prove that take wrong Point out to everybody here that the link you provided on Desk accessories refers to those accessories as applications in the article itself To anybody else reading this he posted a link to make his semantic argument and he didnt even bother to read the link But yes school us all about your 40 years in computing Did that really not include basic reading comprehension,miypi2p,8.0,1jfstt2
comment,mizlqg2,silentcrs,,0,2025-03-21 15:29:11,,,,Again Im talking about architecture Do you know how to talk about technology architecture Read the article Desk accessories ran as drivers They essentially ran at kernellevel Thats a huge difference from applications which run in user mode,miyvn82,9.0,1jfstt2
comment,mizpjjd,APirateAndAJedi,,-1,2025-03-21 15:47:50,,,,Now youre moving the goalposts You responded to my comment My comment was about what qualifies as an application You butted in corrected me got proven wrong and then claimed that you were talking about a subject that was not the subject you responded You were wrong You got busted Trying to condescend me when everybody can see you fucked this up and then claiming you were talking about something else is just embarrassing Stop making it worse Im betting youre used to this though Youre very lonely I guarantee it Its your fault Its because you wont admit fault Thats why youll continue your sad life Dont bother trying to convince me I didnt just peg you cold I know I did More importantly you know I did and nothing you say can change that,mizlqg2,10.0,1jfstt2
comment,mj0r6op,NihilisticAngst,,1,2025-03-21 18:48:57,,,,Lol you are projecting so hard The other user just wanted to discuss the semantics and to be honest theyve got a point they certainly were never proved wrong And for some reason you went crazy and decided to refuse communicating like a mature individual and decided to just start throwing insults for no reason Your quite strange and abnormal level of anger is almost tangible through your comment but the fact of the matter is that there is really nothing here for you to be mad about other than a perceived challenge to your ego Your ego is clearly highly fragile The fact of the matter is that the other commenter was communicating with you respectfully the entire time the trying to condescend me thing is just your narcissistic delusion I dont think they were being condescending whatsoever They didnt say anything that could even slightly be considered condescending until after you were condescending and insulting first You should take a good hard look in a mirror,mizpjjd,11.0,1jfstt2
comment,mj0soam,APirateAndAJedi,,1,2025-03-21 18:56:08,,,,I mean everybody can see that isnt true There is projecting going on here but it isnt by me The other user You are probably the other user using an alt which is just sad Youd be more believable if your comment resembled the reality it refers to Everybody can see that it does not,mj0r6op,12.0,1jfstt2
comment,mj0vlm8,NihilisticAngst,,0,2025-03-21 19:10:23,,,,everybody can see that isnt true Who is this everybody you keep referring to Are they here with us right now Because I dont see them You are probably the other user using an alt Classic resorting to a conspiracy theory you just pulled out of your ass because you cant believe the possibility that youre in the wrong and multiple other people think so It just gets more and more hilarious that you criticized someone else for not being able to admit error when thats literally been your MO the whole time That is the projecting Im referring to Also my writing style is not like the other commenters but sure keep believing your delusions,mj0soam,13.0,1jfstt2

comment,miuj3wp,Lendyman,,2,2025-03-20 19:24:03,,,,Opinions are subjective obviously but the Atari 2600 has the longest running active homebrew community for a reason,miuifhb,4.0,1jfstt2
comment,miuumd5,G3R4,,10,2025-03-20 20:18:42,,,,Im not even sure what youre specifically arguing here Is it that the hardware is solid Thats the common element between older software and modern software Modern homebrew releases on these older home computers have the benefit of building on the ideas and mechanics weve collectively worked on for 40 years at this point The games released in the late 70s and 80s are obviously less likely to have the refinement of anything coming later But those older unrefined games ARE the games from the 1st and 2nd generation I dont think the homebrew scene 47 years later has any impact on that fact,miuj3wp,5.0,1jfstt2
comment,miv0lib,Lendyman,,1,2025-03-20 20:47:33,,,,Eh The point is there are plenty of people who love play and create for old hardware,miuumd5,6.0,1jfstt2
comment,miv3eiz,G3R4,,4,2025-03-20 21:01:18,,,,Well thats definitely true and Im glad people are this passionate about older hardware I tend to emulate but Ill always appreciate the romhacks and homebrew coming out for the GBA and SNES And the demoscene stuff of course,miv0lib,7.0,1jfstt2

comment,miv7xwy,Lendyman,,9,2025-03-20 21:24:09,,,,So was Star Wars D Add to my other point there is a market for the old stuff ATARI wouldnt be making game watches and products like the 2600 or 7800 if there wasnt,miv4ehm,8.0,1jfstt2
comment,miwfj7k,Particular-Sell1304,,2,2025-03-21 01:23:53,,,,Its because its not ATARI as we used to know then Its just an IP that has been passed around and now a new organisation is in control of it so they want to cash in on their investment,miv7xwy,9.0,1jfstt2
comment,mix1k38,Lendyman,,2,2025-03-21 03:40:22,,,,Well of course it isnt But the fact that they are able to sell those products and that they are successful products enough that they keep selling more of them and different versions of them says that there must be a market for it,miwfj7k,10.0,1jfstt2
comment,mjfpxqv,SolidOshawott,,1,2025-03-24 05:49:44,,,,But youre assuming this is a product that took more than 50 and IP ownership to develop,mix1k38,11.0,1jfstt2
comment,miv86vu,Ok_Track4357,,2,2025-03-20 21:25:24,,,,Agreed And at least there WAS a Star Wars in 1977,miv7xwy,9.0,1jfstt2

comment,miy4o71,Paladia,,2,2025-03-21 09:49:43,,,,I think the bulk of the retro gaming community starts at NES and equivalent As it has many games that hold up well today Before that it is mainly a small niche,miub1ow,3.0,1jfstt2

comment,miuut6z,pagerunner-j,,3,2025-03-20 20:19:37,,,,Many of them were pretty poor even at the time but hey it was a VERY new medium The games I still have from that time I had an Atari 400 but a lot of the library overlaps are things like PacMan Centipede Qbert Froggerthose still definitely hold up Also the States and Capitals loading music was iconic Fight me,miu4myg,1.0,1jfstt2
comment,mix39xk,bored_manager,,3,2025-03-21 03:52:23,,,,It begs the question what is it that you long for Atari games or your that slice of your life when you were playing Atari games,miu4myg,1.0,1jfstt2
comment,miy95iu,triad1996,,2,2025-03-21 10:32:14,,,,I dont believe it begs the question I believe a good percentage of adults would like to relive part if not all of their childhood whether they had a video game console or not if nothing elsemaybe do things differently IMO thats not an Earthshattering take but thats not me Like I said at the time since home video games were a relatively new thing it was kinda fun because thats all we knew A block with a line thats supposed to resemble a tank and you have to get past obstacles to shoot at the other player was ok but it wasnt anything special I dont think it warrants to have the game on a watch but thatjustme If you want to play Atari 2400 Tank Pitfall are Activision games on there as well or the janky version of PacMan on a watch please have at it Im in therapy for many things Wanting to relive my childhood aint one of them,mix39xk,2.0,1jfstt2

comment,miw4z9y,Fredasa,,2,2025-03-21 00:20:26,,,,I remember that page He goes into a lot of detail and theory but doesnt actually bring up the one bug that was legitimately meaningful in the game In fact the bug isnt even mentioned anywhere in the page so I assume it wasnt addressed That bug is this _After you exit a pit and ETs neck unextends ET will shift downward by one pixel If you happen to have exited a pit from above you will fall right back in immediately due to the downward shift causing a collision_ I know I have to give a lot of leeway to the folks he mercifully refers to as novices but as a 7 year old kid I frankly had zero difficulty navigating the games quirks including that bug Yet I can definitely imagine a lot of players simply not getting whats going on missing the fact that ET is shifting down and then colliding back into the pit again On the other hand he is _very correct_ to point out that _ET_ was in fact a trailblazing game Its actually one of the top 10 or 15 games ever released on the console The bad rap the game has is largely the result of a cumulative series of circumstances most particularly some fairly modern scapegoating done for entertainment,mivqilz,4.0,1jfstt2
comment,miyvj0y,fuzzbox000,,5,2025-03-21 13:13:06,,,,2600 games are so small and memory is so cheap that there is no excuse for only having 4 games on this thing Id be willing to bet that since it makes no sense to make lowcapacity memory chips nowadays the memory in it is 999 empty This should have at least 100250 games on it Even if most of them are never played it would make the customer not feel like theyre being taken advantage of,,0.0,1jfstt2
