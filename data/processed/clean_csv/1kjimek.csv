comment,mro9gk0,Andrew_hl2,,67,2025-05-11 00:28:41,,,,Maybe they could start by making the batteries on their shavers replaceable Last one died after about a year of being used just twice a week,,0.0,1kjimek

comment,mryi66n,Andrew_hl2,,2,2025-05-12 18:40:47,,,,Thats good for you but that hasnt been the case for me or many other if you read amazon reviews Point is that theyre touting themselves as being so green and right to repairish when something as basic as a replaceable battery is not something theyre offering This 3d printing thing is just a marketing gimmick 3d printing is still a niche relative to the average joe its good that they offer it but i can guaranfuckingtee that if you were to ask users what would be the thing they would like to repair easiest on their electric shaver is the battery,mrxua91,2.0,1kjimek

comment,mrnkbv9,FilipBDNR,,22,2025-05-10 21:49:27,,,,Barber shops dont use Philips products They use Wahl and other professionaltier brands Those have far more rugged parts I actually worked on a student project for Philips in college for a shaver and interviewed some barbers for it Philips are completely consumertier barbers dont use them For example you cant generally sharpen the blades on consumertier shavers,mrn009f,1.0,1kjimek

comment,mrng9fg,Bhraal,,8,2025-05-10 21:24:53,,,,I mean I broke off one of the legs on one of the hair guards on my Philips trimmer when I accidently dropped it a couple of years ago There are a lot of ways parts can break As for the straight up cost it might still be cheaper just to order a replacement part no idea what filament costs but having blueprints freely available would help in situations where replacement parts are out of stockdiscontinued Also if you have the material already at home and no plans to use it for anything else then why not print your own,mrn009f,1.0,1kjimek

comment,mrr9xjd,PocketNicks,,1,2025-05-11 14:54:45,,,,Ive had tines break in them before or the little snap on lip that holds it on the shaver head can break or become loose I had to buy a replacement set for my shaver like 3 months ago but it only cost 12 for an entire new set of heads So probably not something Id bother 3d printing,mrn009f,1.0,1kjimek
comment,mrs37o5,aaahhhhhhfine,,1,2025-05-11 17:29:45,,,,Unfortunately I suspect thats the devils in the details stuff with this I bet theyll release only some models and specifically in areas that dont make them any money anyway They can do these shaver attachments for example because they already sold the shaver and they know that anybody could model it anyway So they arent losing any sales And they might make some sales from people who like the initiative There are probably a few things like that all over their product lines But I doubt well see these models for anything that somebody couldnt pretty easily just make themselves or that Phillips has a decent side business for,mrn009f,1.0,1kjimek

comment,msakr01,tinwhistler,,1,2025-05-14 16:19:59,,,,I had a beard trimmer guard on my Wahl break I usually took the guard off to closecrop some parts of my face and then put the guard on for where I wanted the hair longer It eventually broke due to flex stress at the tab that holds the guard to the trimmer I spent a fair amount of time modeling a replacement which while not perfect did the job for me If i could just download replacement files for stuff theres a good chance Id prefer Philips products over others which is what I assume theyre hoping forbetting on,mrn009f,1.0,1kjimek

comment,mrr8u7v,Ultrabot500,,5,2025-05-11 14:48:57,,,,Just a week ago I fixed an Epilady by designing and 3D printing the gear thats attached to the motor It didnt look exactly like the original but it worked really wellin fact I think it performs better than before The original gear was made of nylon I believe and it had cracked on one side causing it to spin freely The one I printed was made from PETG on my Kobra 3 printed at 100 infill since its very tiny I made the center hole a bit tight so I had to heat the rod just enough for the gear to melt slightly and pressfit onto it,,0.0,1kjimek
comment,mrw977z,RefdOneThousand,,1,2025-05-12 11:23:46,,,,Brilliant work IMHO we need laws forcing manufacturers to supply spare parts for a fair price or to publish the specs of spare parts so people can make their own,mrr8u7v,1.0,1kjimek
comment,mrqf3h6,TheAVnerd,,4,2025-05-11 11:32:17,,,,Back when 3D printers were first becoming available on the retail market but the basic built it yourself version was still in the thousands of dollar price range I worked at an ad agency that had an RD Lab which bought two printers It was cool to think that having a 3D printer might cut down on wasteand save lots of items being tossed out simply for a broken part a part you could now print a replacement for It was also so inspiring to see that you could rapid prototype something on your own without having to spend weeks of back and forth with an industrial design firm The possibilities were endless The RD lab spent weeks printing dicks,,0.0,1kjimek

comment,mrp6o87,Prince_Uncharming,,12,2025-05-11 04:17:04,,,,Oftentimes if you need just one replacement especially as an end customer it is easier to just 3D print it if thats available Plus companies dont continue making customershippable parts forever Its outside their logistics scope to sell and ship you something thats worth less than 1,mroi78w,1.0,1kjimek
comment,mrpa4ja,Dje4321,,12,2025-05-11 04:45:24,,,,And its an awful deal for you as a consumer The price difference between 1 replacement item and 10 of them are basically the same Paying someone to drive a 2 ton truck to deliver a 030 piece of plastic to a singular address makes zero sense regardless of how you spin it,mrp6o87,2.0,1kjimek

comment,mrq3n2b,FairBat947,,-1,2025-05-11 09:39:41,,,,Fair point I like the concept but in practice I still need a serviceshopmachine to make them for me a consumer thats still more effort at time of speaking than ordering a spare part Reason I am still sceptical about the concept is that it is promised to be the next big thing for so many years but still not working in a practical way for everyday consumers For custom or nonmassproducts it makes a lot of sense But factory products should be replaceable and repairable for years Big company advertising for harder solutions can be a red flag,mrp9tr8,2.0,1kjimek
comment,mrvg2fk,Brotaoski,,1,2025-05-12 06:32:07,,,,You greatly underestimate how affordable and end user friendly printers are now Many companies like bambu and pursa have printers that work right out the box with no tinkering Just like a fridge or washing machine printers will eventually become a household appliance The home maintenance upgrading and repairing and hobby expanding capabilities makes it one of the most valuable tools I own As more people get into printing and creating solutions to problems and uploading free files to download off repositories the more assessable it becomes to people who dont know how to model or care to learn,mrq3n2b,3.0,1kjimek

comment,mryc9cr,obi1kenobi1,,2,2025-05-12 18:11:43,,,,Im skeptical about this being an actual initiative rather than an easy PR win that will never lead to anything Also the trailer basically just showed the kind of parts tinkerers have reverseengineered on their own without permission or support for years so ultimately what theyre proposing wont change anything about the repairability of their products But that being said it still has the potential to widen awareness of right to repair and the capability of 3D printers to repair consumer products and having the actual files that were engineered by the company to work perfectly rather than reverseengineered by a hobbyist to work good enough is definitely a step in the right direction so I really hope this is successful and inspires other companies to do the same,,0.0,1kjimek
comment,mrpkluu,snowflake37wao,,3,2025-05-11 06:20:57,,,,The OneBlade is fragile af other than that its prob my fav shave boomzoombam done But because no one sells replacement blades locally where I buy the buzzer itself it is actually cheaper for me to buy a brand new OneBlade than a two pack replacement blade with shipping online This wont fix those blades but its a step the right direction by the maker Fragile is an understatement for those things Seriously When a device has parts inevitably requiring consumable replacement parts like buzzers and blade the maker really needs to hard press retailers to buy both or no deal At least on a 11 ratio Like I get models and designs change but none of the stores I bought my 4 freakin OneBlades from had replacement blades in their stock log let alone stocks They never stocked the replacement blades There may be a predatory excuse behind it but Im giving this co the benefit of doubt because its stupid marketing if it was intended Fire that dumbass who had the idea if so Dont know the practicalities and its not my job to know the how I know the why Phillips needs to figure out the how and I think everyone wins,,0.0,1kjimek
