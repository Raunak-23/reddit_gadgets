comment,mzwk91a,Raymond_Reddit_Ton,,21,2025-06-26 16:03:21,,,,My friends and I actually do use this feature and love that nintendo added it As huge MarioKart racers we used to makeshift this solution for the entire original Switch generation aside from the shitty camera quality the VTC feature is a great addition for gaming with my friends who are not local Being able to trash talk in real time I do hope it gets upadates over the coming years,mzwh9hj,1.0,1ll31ov

comment,mzzimmq,ohnotony,,5,2025-06-27 01:05:16,,,,Mustve been a boring one my childhood was filled with eye toy on ps2 and then the ps3 camera when that came out Me and my siblings LOVED the camera games and would play them all constantly You presumably as an adult saying that its a pointless Nintendo thing is fine if youre speaking for adults maybe but for children Youre forgetting that children dont have the same pessimistic standards as people like you Children still have magical experiences with things adults could care less about and in the end Nintendo is a company for children first and foremost The camera is there for the kids that will have fun with it and you as an adult can ignore it and have the exact same experience on your switch I dont really see the issue here tbh,mzzhxnc,3.0,1ll31ov

comment,mzy29bj,Grimreap32,,3,2025-06-26 20:19:40,,,,So my neighbour bought the Switch 2 with the webcam and was complaining about it So I asked to borrow it and test it on various monitors and TVs When the Switch 2 webcam was announced in the reveal I said it looked bad and that release it would be worse Turns out I was right even though some fanboys doubted me When has a demo product ever looked as good as the final release In this case it looked bad at the start release looked much worse Its 2025 and the quality is something akin to a Webcam from 2010 It looks absolutely terrible on anything above a 21 screen I know Nintendo like to work with older tech to get the most out of it but with a Webcam theres no real excuse for this atrocious quality at the price theyre asking,,0.0,1ll31ov
