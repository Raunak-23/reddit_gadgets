comment,n3cfz7z,devilscr,,115,2025-07-15 22:27:58,,,,So it is more expensive than the cheapest medium format camera today Wild,,0.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3ebodc,ICC-u,,35,2025-07-16 05:32:14,,,,It seems completely overpriced How can it cost more than a superior A7R,n3cfz7z,1.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3enm13,hosky2111,,20,2025-07-16 07:18:21,,,,It also isnt really competing with either of the current R cameras this weighs 498g the a7cr weighs 515g and the a7r v weighs 723g and for the latter two you still need to add on a lens Even compared to the smaller and lights a7cr that is going to weigh likely 300 grams more and be much larger by the time you add an equivalent lens This is a lifestyle camera I dont imagine any professionals would pick this over an interchangeable lens alternative so value is less important than desirability This is competing in a much smaller market with consumers willing to spend a lot of money on luxury products to get the best only really the similarly priced gfx100rf and the leica q3 which costs almost 7k compete directly and this looks to be pretty competitive with both on paper There is also a lot of brand loyalty in the segment so Sony probably knows they can charge whatever without losing customers ironically even without considering a lens ecosystem There are definitely major compromises to get it to the size and weight no ibis and fixed screen are a miss and a 2mp evf is criminal in 2025 but given the cult status the prior gen had I think this will have fans among the very small market segment its targeting,n3ebodc,2.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3fxbym,dekachenko,,4,2025-07-16 13:19:47,,,,Yeah if anything its a sunday camera for the professionals who use the Sony system If number on paper was the only thing that determines the value of the camera this might be a hard sell But there are many who would find this an ideal camera I wont be getting it myselfI personally dont mesh well with Sonys doctrine but I appreciate that they are making this kind of niche camera,n3enm13,3.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3c4mp3,CGI_OCD,,97,2025-07-15 21:27:52,,,,But it wont have the same depth compression as an actual 5070mm lens When will people get it and dont fall for this I still think its quite stylish and minimal and i love that tho but 5100 Bucks for FFthats pretty bold innit Edit 300 thumb gripwtaf SONY You good,,0.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3djicj,ozzilee,,67,2025-07-16 02:12:44,,,,No cropping and zooming are exactly the same other than resolution You can try it yourself and I encourage you to Depth compression isnt a real thing Distance to subject is the only thing that matters Taken from the same location a 50mm f28 shot will look exactly the same as a 25mm f28 shot cropped 2x,n3c4mp3,1.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3fg0m7,merelysounds,,8,2025-07-16 11:33:41,,,,Correct about no change to composition Note that using actual lenses with these parameters would result in different out of focus areas at least as reported by For a 25mm f28 FF lens at 100cm distance the reported diffusion circle is 0229mm For a 50mm f28 FF lens at 100cm distance the reported diffusion circle is 094mm,n3djicj,2.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3fmoiw,ozzilee,,3,2025-07-16 12:17:49,,,,Id have to try it on real lenses again but I think when you crop and then scale the images to the same physical size the out of focus areas end up looking the same I played around with that calculator and didnt actually see a way to crop You can change the sensor size but that doesnt quite work because aperture on a lens is relative to the size of the image area Edit Im wrong cropping gives you less background blur than zooming at the same aperture,n3fg0m7,3.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3g7hxi,merelysounds,,2,2025-07-16 14:12:51,,,,I played around with that calculator and didnt actually see a way to crop You can take a screenshot and crop that thats equivalent to what the earlier comment describes and what the newly announced camera does,n3fmoiw,4.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3gkc72,ozzilee,,2,2025-07-16 15:13:30,,,,Ah true Yeah youre right then the background blur is different I guess that makes sense since aperture is also relative to focal length the same physical aperture size would probably create the same blur regardless of focal length but f28 on a 80mm is significantly larger than f28 on a 40mm,n3g7hxi,5.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3e7brb,KowalskiePCH,,0,2025-07-16 04:55:04,,,,It will not I dont know what people are chiming in to say but I have a range of focal lengths and cropping does not yield the same results as using a different focal length,n3djicj,2.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3ecaey,ICC-u,,24,2025-07-16 05:37:28,,,,Cropping does yield exactly the same result as focal length minus a little bit of leeway for distortion caused by different lenseszooms Stand in one spot Photograph an object of a fixed sizedistance A telephone box post box park bench etc Take two photographs from the same spot at two different focal lengths Overlay the two images and crop them you will have almost exactly the same image The opposite is to then take the same object and move with the camera so it is the same size in the viewfinder with both lenses This time you will see that a wide angle includes more background extremity and everything is more bulbous The telephoto will mean you stand further away and everything gets compressed this is where the compression term comes from Did an evening class in photography and this was like the second assignment on the first day after we did shutterapertureiso,n3e7brb,3.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3d4q9s,Drolevarg,,17,2025-07-16 00:46:28,,,,Cropping to a 5070mm equivalent does have the same background framing I assume thats what you mean by depth compression The only difference except resolution of course is that the depth of field is deeper by cropping You can try it yourself The background will be framed identically except for the bokeh which will be less blurry with smaller specular highlights,n3c4mp3,1.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3drtjy,illiteratebeef,,7,2025-07-16 03:04:02,,,,Heres another source that tested this and says the same thing background compression is the same on optical or digital zoom,n3d4q9s,2.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3dffh3,ArchieThomas72,,-8,2025-07-16 01:48:56,,,,Compression of the image from different focal lengths is different than framing,n3d4q9s,2.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3djsp2,ozzilee,,11,2025-07-16 02:14:27,,,,There is no such thing as focal length compression Distance to subject is all that matters You can prove it yourself easily enough As long as you stay the same distance from your subject cropping and zooming are exactly the same other than resolution obviously,n3dffh3,3.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3djrxj,Drolevarg,,8,2025-07-16 02:14:20,,,,But other than the depth of field it will be identical Cropping a 70mm equivalent frame on a photo taken with a 35mm at f28 will result in the same background compression as a photo taken with a 70mm lens at f56,n3dffh3,3.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3dfkvs,correctingStupid,,5,2025-07-16 01:49:47,,,,You think that the depth compression factor of a camera is anything a consumer has ever wondered about lol The people that buy these wonder about one thingsize,n3c4mp3,1.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3c0zyn,Doug24,,28,2025-07-15 21:10:02,,,,It comes with a macro ring that enables users to get as close as 20cm to subjects and features Sonys new Step Crop Shooting function that allows 35mm 50mm and 70mm focal lengths by cropping into the sensor just like the GFX100RF can do with a similar button,,0.0,1m0trk3
comment,n3c38pf,Curious_Document_956,,17,2025-07-15 21:20:59,,,,Its not nearly as powerful as the A7R V for video but can still handle 4K 30 fps video with 10bit 422 color sampling along with 1080p video at up to 120 fps No log mode is available but you do get the loglike SCinetone that boosts dynamic range a bit Other features include a single SDXC UHS II slot a mic input but not headphone jack a microHDMI port and a USBC input The R1XR III is much more expensive than the RX1R II was at launch Itll go on preorder soon for 5100 with shipping set to start on July 31st Sony is also offering a handful of accessories also expensive including a 300 thumb grip 250 body case and 200 lens hood,n3c0zyn,1.0,1m0trk3

comment,n3cze4j,SEND_ME_FAKE_NEWS,,7,2025-07-16 00:15:24,,,,Probably heat related if I had to guess I very briefly thought of getting this but I think Ill just continue travelling with my A7CR 35 18,n3cexhw,3.0,1m0trk3
