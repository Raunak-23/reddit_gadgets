comment,mvuhdp5,Hvarfa-Bragi,,7,2025-06-03 21:52:45,,,,I was thinking more of an agnostic fiduciary protocol that advertises its presence at the entrance to a restaurant or venue and tells your AR device how and what to lock onto for tracking allowing you to opt in to menus live markers of which cocktails are being made at the bar being able to zoom in on the top shelf to explore the bottles and their prices what cocktails they can be used in etc from your booth in the back seeing a progress bar for your food at the window or lighted paths to the bathroom etc etc etc etc etc Any AR companies want to hire a programmer with vision whos waiting for a competent display No cool cool cool,mvueolo,5.0,1l2lbdd

comment,mvuaig1,darth_voidptr,,8,2025-06-03 21:17:37,,,,You go to the park here someone left a marker As you approach the marker a visual thing happens It could be a sign This is where we meet it could also be the entry point to a shared ARVR experience Anything in between And yes theres an obvious concern here so there would hopefully be an optin and a whitelist so you may not want the subsidized glasses,mvu6lrl,5.0,1l2lbdd

comment,mvwn09r,scummos,,6,2025-06-04 06:05:52,,,,Maybe I dunno I wouldnt want to wear such a thing all day for a variety of reasons I think the biggest problem is that the augmentations it can potentially provide for my everyday life just arent impactful enough to justify having a gadget for them at all Like whats it gonna do Navigate me to the super market I visit every day Present me the Wikipedia article of the bananas Im looking at Beam some notification I absolutely do not care about at that moment directly into my eyes For specific applications sure could be amazing But does the average person have enough such specific applications to make it worth buying such a gadget But technology also really isnt there yet and with the current trajectory likely wont be for at least several decades I think people underestimate the amount of minifying that has to take place here,mvtv4sj,2.0,1l2lbdd

comment,mvwf4ks,Kep0a,,1,2025-06-04 04:59:46,,,,Not necessarily Im mixed on having a camera on the glasses itself I think its inevitable but for now it increases size and makes the glasses obviously creepy a lot of people really hate the idea of having a camera on your face The LLM will just be the user interface method for the whole personal context thing Lists reminders navigation conversational context Maybe it creates a vocal imprint of people you talk to and surfaces contextual reminders like their birthday a summary of your last conversation But its all speculation I just like thinking about it since people tend to dislike disruptive technology and I think these types of glasses will be the answer,mvw6oji,2.0,1l2lbdd

comment,mvtyrsw,HappyHarry-HardOn,,1,2025-06-03 20:20:55,,,,Presumably youd focus on specialised markets initially then expand the focus to consumer marketplace once things develop The Quest 2 showed there was a market the quest 3 showed meta had no idea what to do once it had interested consumers,mvtvlfp,3.0,1l2lbdd
comment,mvu47h2,fraseyboo,,4,2025-06-03 20:46:53,,,,The Quest is arguably more akin to a PlayStation than a computer weve seen that theres a market for VR games but its still minuscule in comparison to regular console PC and mobile gaming The Quest Pro was a commercial failure and the use in industry is still niche Itll be interesting to see whether Meta and Apple can actually make an AR device that doesnt get ridiculed when worn in public,mvtyrsw,4.0,1l2lbdd
comment,mvvdx7x,FlyingBishop,,1,2025-06-04 00:55:47,,,,In terms of consoles I wouldnt be surprised if theyre rethinking what theyre doing Theyre releasing Quests on the sort of cadence people do for smartphones they could release them on a Console 5year schedule and focus on getting exclusive titles etc and make a lot of money Although they might not be interested in Nintendolevel revenue,mvu47h2,5.0,1l2lbdd
comment,mvxatk7,fraseyboo,,1,2025-06-04 09:57:20,,,,Metas investors dont have the patience for those kinds of release cycles the Quest 2 was lightning in a bottle and became as relevant as the PS5 around Christmas time for children so theyll try to replicate that every year now The tech in VR headsets is still steadily improving and Meta will continue to release headsets so that they stay relevant to the younger generation that are impressionable and want new things For Meta this isnt about making an immediate profit its about getting children hooked on their social networks Instagram Messenger WhatsApp to counteract the demise of Facebook As long as user engagement remains high then Meta will still make bank off of advertising supposedly 50 per user per year Its not as prevalent in VR but now that every device has its own unique advertising ID added in v77 well likely see advertising encroach on this space too,mvvdx7x,6.0,1l2lbdd
