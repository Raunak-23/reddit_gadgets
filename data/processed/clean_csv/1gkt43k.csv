comment,lvpr87t,Fafnir13,,84,2024-11-06 14:26:37,,,,To be fair its a near perfect Mariokart experience Graphics could be updated slightly polish added to some of the DLC courses and theres still a significant roster of courses that could be added Anything new would be expected to have fewer courses at the outset though,lvoqy8l,2.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvpv89c,Fartfart357,,55,2024-11-06 14:45:52,,,,Oh definitely Hell the graphics are so good I can see them not really needing to be better But its still a WII U game and thats really funny,lvpr87t,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvpwjj3,Fafnir13,,15,2024-11-06 14:52:05,,,,I bought a Wii U primarily because of the Mariokart trailer That Rainbow Road music kicked me hard in my gamer nostalgia Helps the game remains a ton of fun I still play it weekly with my siblings,lvpv89c,4.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvr7861,alexanderpas,,7,2024-11-06 18:21:22,,,,Anything new would be expected to have fewer courses at the outset though Unless they give it the Smash Treatment All the courses All the riders Everyone is here for the Ultimate Mario Kart Experience,lvpr87t,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvvr39t,Smyles9,,1,2024-11-07 11:44:16,,,,What other kartscharacterstracks are left I feel like if they were going to do that it shouldve just been with the other waves to bring absolutely everything over Wii karts like bullet billstar shooterbaby kart cant think of any remaining characters and tracks maybe a few from Wiitour,lvr7861,4.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvr860z,alexanderpas,,5,2024-11-06 18:25:39,,,,I just wish it had a single player career mode where new races and speeds would get unlocked as you win the older ones The Deluxe version for the Switch was the only version that did not have this the original version for the Wii U still had this feature,lvqb2g5,4.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvvquhd,Smyles9,,2,2024-11-07 11:42:12,,,,I thought pretty much all of the courses got ported I thought there were maybe 48 remaining that would be worth it unique enough and not too similar to already ported tracks was there significantly more tracks available in tour I feel like the time to do that though is either at the end of wave 6 which the time has passed to do that or when they reveal the next Mario kart to get people hyped and still have something for switch 1 owners too The mk team might be too focused on the new game to do something like that though unfortunately,lvpr87t,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvw1t2d,Fafnir13,,1,2024-11-07 13:03:12,,,,There are loads of them SNES Kart still has a couple unrepresented styles of courses Kart64 has a slew of fairly unique ones that would be fun to see given a modern update Koopa Beach the jungle one and Bowsers Castle are the ones that spring most readily to mind DoubleDash has a bunch too like Mushroom City Mushroom Bridge and Wario Stadium which would bring some unique elements still Peach Beach is another standout with the fun of a rising tide and the flipping guys wandering around I played 7 only a little bit because I disliked the motion controls and graphics felt kind of dull so any courses from that one would feel new to me Same goes for the DS game Im just not into handheld gaming so never played them I feel like the team has a pretty good track record heh of finding ways to deliver new twists to even the oldest styles of tracks I dont mind having even simple figure 8s redone as theres always a little something thats slightly different from the others Its nice to have the largest possible playground of options,lvvquhd,4.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvpkhrw,_Burro,,23,2024-11-06 13:53:13,,,,As someone who actually loved playing through Scarlet it bothers me that the performance was never addressed properly I cant say Im too hopeful for their first game on a new system those tend to fumble a bit in comparison to the games that come after them,lvp14hx,2.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvqz1hp,EnjoyerOfBeans,,16,2024-11-06 17:44:13,,,,Nah Sword and Shield is literally the only instance where that was true RubySapphire for the GBA is absolutely beloved so is DiamondPearl Their first game on the 3ds XY looked stunning for the time as well Gamefreak as a company is completely incompetent with actual 3d environments is all,lvpkhrw,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvrmg85,_Burro,,1,2024-11-06 19:30:21,,,,Keep in mind I said in comparison the to the games that come after them XY looked good but were extremely barebones and Sun and Moon looked way better Diamond and Pearl struggled with loading so bad that the original Japanese release had the void glitches And compared to HGSSB2W2 they do lag behind Ruby and Sapphire didnt really lose anything to FRLG and are very similar to Emerald so that one doesnt fit what I said,lvqz1hp,4.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvrqa12,EnjoyerOfBeans,,0,2024-11-06 19:47:42,,,,I do agree they make improvement in future releases for any console but thats somewhat expected especially since they are working with a brand new console every time that no one in the world has experience with but I wouldnt say any of these titles fumbled on graphics or performance The improvements in future titles are relatively minor to the point where the average consumer probably couldnt tell you which games came out in what order SM and USUM had performance issues as well I played both gens quite a bit and I wouldnt say XY was worse in this regard the game was just relatively poor in terms of content The issues Japanese releases of some of these titles faced were the kind of issues that could be fixed with a patch nowadays too Compared to SwSh or SV its just a completely different world,lvrmg85,5.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvrvkt6,_Burro,,2,2024-11-06 20:11:45,,,,Back to the original comment though I believe SV and PLA could have been improved probably not fixed per se through updates For Legends some smaller stuff like floating trees some models going low poly at extremely short distance and being able to see into the skybox in several maps For SV stuff like pokemon clipping into walls specific areas with low framerates and QoL changes for shinies Alas it didnt happen I dont believe these changes were too much to ask I was there when people believed the Battle Frontier was going to be added to ORAS,lvrqa12,6.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvtlr1w,NeoTechni,,0,2024-11-07 01:21:35,,,,Sword and Shield is literally the only instance where that was true RubySapphire for the GBA is absolutely beloved so is DiamondPearl Their first game on the 3ds XY looked stunning for the time as well No RS looked terrible compared to GoldenSun the 3DS games looked terrible compared to Resident Evil Revelations which ran completely in 3D too Every since the GBA games the Pokemon games have looked inferior to what was on the system,lvqz1hp,4.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvs82rt,edvek,,4,2024-11-06 21:08:13,,,,They could be told were not making it for the switch anymore but for PC so go nuts And they will still shit out the bare minimum unoptimized garbage because people will buy it day 1 Obviously if they abandon the switch which they wont sales will plummet Point being even given unlimited potential they will take the fastest and easiest route because why cut into your profits if you dont have to,lvp14hx,2.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvs7f3l,darkbreak,,3,2024-11-06 21:05:15,,,,You know before the massive leaks recently I would have agreed 100 But considering what we know now it seems like the real villains for Pokemon are the higher ups in The Pokemon Company that enforce strict release dates I cant say for sure that Game Freak would have made the newer games absolutely flawless but they undoubtedly would have ended better than what we got,lvp14hx,2.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvx4ejq,MrHedgehogMan,,1,2024-11-07 16:31:11,,,,Its because of the merchandising behemoth that is Pokemon They need new Pokemon to move more merch and this typically comes from the games,lvs7f3l,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvpqlly,sunkenrocks,,3,2024-11-06 14:23:34,,,,I actually like the animations in SV There could be a lot more but at least the Pokemon themselves I think are quite charming,lvp14hx,2.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvtp9h0,LionIV,,1,2024-11-07 01:40:42,,,,Voice acting would elevate the games to such high levels people would easily dismiss other flaws Literally the Persona games have been doing it for decades on a fraction of the budget and people like me still eat that shit up,lvpqlly,3.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvv8lix,jaaval,,1,2024-11-07 08:33:37,,,,The problem with these platform services is that monopoly is actually in many ways better for consumer Nobody wants to have multiple game platforms running at the same time Same goes with streaming services More competition has meant fragmentation and higher prices I want to just open the app and have everything there And if music is not in Spotify it just might not exist I dont mind valve controlling the world even if I have to pay 10 more for the games I am pissed when good games are launched exclusively to epic or something Im sorry Tim Sweeney but I dont understand how its better for me that I have to share my data with your corporation too,lvppbsl,3.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvppzhh,Hallc,,9,2024-11-06 14:20:34,,,,I dont think any digital platform lets you play a single purchase of one game across three devices at once though You can usually get around it via doing various account things like going offline etc Steam also wont let you play a shared game if someone else is already playing it Im not here to defend Nintendo I dont really feel strongly either way just confused that this is your core complaint honestly since nowhere else would let you do that either,lvpcrbh,4.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvokunq,Dave-James,,9,2024-11-06 09:52:50,,,,When they announce it they have to build in an middle layer or emulation layer to do so see PS3 when Nintendo does it its because it means theyre going to use the same offtheshelf chipset as a base for their system and therefor it ALREADY can play those games and likely limited at 1080p and 30fps anyone who wants respectable modern specs will just end up emulating the chipset via software so they can actually have 4K 60,lvocoq5,2.0,1gkt43k

comment,lw11y1v,Dave-James,,0,2024-11-08 04:42:45,,,,They are not going to use an output resolution that almost nobody even has a TV with the native resolution of Thats even LESS LIKELY than 4K Not to mention the obvious both 720p AND 1080p Will upscale perfectly to 4K by an interval of 3 and 2 respectively 1080 doubled fits into 21604K and 720p tripled also fits into 4K but 1440p will NEVER correctly scale to 4K so imagine releasing a console that cant even scale to the current industry standard 4K It will either be pseudofake 4K see tech like DLSS reallyfake 4K most likely rendered at 1080p and then pixel doubled and antialiased by a hardware processor or it will be 1080p and your TV will have to automatically upscale it also likely Its Nintendo,lvub4ol,6.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvsdyav,justaboxinacage,,1,2024-11-06 21:35:05,,,,Ill have to correct you a bit an offer he couldnt refuse is a quote from the Godfather and originally it was meant to imply a threat of violence is used to coerce someone into selling something they would not have otherwise sold The original meaning would seem to match pretty well here if you replace the threat of violence with the threat of legal action,lvs1o8u,6.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvs98kd,Erdago,,0,2024-11-06 21:13:28,,,,While it wasnt officially confirmed mainly because the console wasnt confirmed in any detail the language used to explain the situation makes it clear thats what theyre looking into The presentation explained that until the Switch they couldnt easily carry over software history over generations but with the Switch accounts this has became viable for them Then they brought back the prior Switch 2 pseudo announcement and said that Switch 2 will have NSO and will be able to play Nintendo Switch software they currently own I feel it would be hard to assume that in general all Switch purchases will carry over to Switch 2,lvptnn8,2.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvuv68i,EpicRive,,2,2024-11-07 06:19:57,,,,The only reasonable omission for Sony is the PS3 and to a lesser extent PS2 both of these consoles have very bizarre architectures which make them hard to emulate to this day so they cant really promise blanket compatibility with the library across the board That being said the vast majority of PS2 games now can be emulated mostly with minor to no issues and near perfect PS3 emulation should be possible in the near future once PS consoles have enough threads and power to brute force the emulation of the Cell,lvuk6fr,1.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvokod0,fatmustardcheese,,4,2024-11-06 09:51:03,,,,Tbf N64 to Gamecube was a complete format change in a time when back compat wasnt as big and the Switch felt like Nintendo trying to forget the previous 6 years and reset,lvoa7uk,2.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvoetd5,FeedbackBoth6035,,-3,2024-11-06 08:53:38,,,,Did they confirm the backwards compatibility to say that it is still ok to buy the old console before they announce the new because switch sales are falling,,0.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvvez35,jamster126,,1,2024-11-07 09:44:36,,,,WiiU had a digital store also dawg They could have easily let you have kept your digital games And they could have built an external disc drive for physical games that people could buy if they wish But instead of opting in for backwards compatibility they said no and they would just resell you all the Wii u games for full price again So they didnt set a good precedent this generation for what they might do for switch 2 I am glad they have decided to keep backwards compatibility,lvvcc1e,4.0,1gkt43k

comment,lvr18in,Timlugia,,1,2024-11-06 17:53:59,,,,And thats not far off from actual Honda hence the comparison I owned multiple gen of CRV they were really incremental improvements from the previous gen Plus op doesnt seem to like Nintendo to begin with considering they were using the derogatory terms on popular Nintendo titles,lvr0l8v,3.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvrenre,Rekadra,,1,2024-11-06 18:54:51,,,,Unless youre saying Honda never release new generations then I dont see how youre using this explanation to dismiss my point Either way Nintendo does release new generations and this person is simply expressing their disappointment that it is simply an incremental improvement Whats wrong with that,lvr18in,4.0,1gkt43k
comment,lvrgj0d,Timlugia,,1,2024-11-06 19:03:18,,,,You clearly missed their second half comments just to play those little Mario and newly woke Zelda games and then they remake Zeldas Adventure from the 90s and call it Echoes of Wizdum I think OP just didnt like Nintendo to begin with just using Switch2 as an excuse to rant Thats why they got so many downvoted rather than about still unknown spec on Switch2 They were also factually wrong how is recent Zelda even considered as woke And how is EoW any related to Zeldas Adventure Again if they hate Nintendo titles so much why even bother Their past video game comments were all critical at Nintendo consoles specs Just go get the console or PC they want They are just not NintendoSwitchs targeting audience Thats why I said why look for luxury car in a Honda,lvrenre,5.0,1gkt43k
comment,lw51iq6,Rekadra,,1,2024-11-08 20:33:07,,,,They arent looking for a luxury car from Honda Theyre looking for the new generation of car Thats the point I just made I dont think that you can say they are factually wrong about such a subjective opinion and even so I dont really have much interest in discussing that We were more having a discussion about the Nintendos direction particularly relating to hardware and implementation of software For example would you be just as offended at a person asking more than the Wii They arent the target audience They might hate all the Wii iterations of Nintendo properties but believe they still have potential with better hardware and leadership etc,lvrgj0d,6.0,1gkt43k
