comment,mvvoo37,junglespycamp,,62,2025-06-04 01:58:46,,,,The original Switch had a pretty mediocre screen even by LCD standards then and especially by LCD now Initial impressions seem positive for this new screen being much better Ill be curious to see in person but it does sound like there isnt really much to complain about OLED isnt inherently superior and LCD could be better in brighter rooms too,mvvjzpd,1.0,1l2rw63

comment,mw5f1an,junglespycamp,,2,2025-06-05 15:28:25,,,,Circling back to this I now have a switch 2 in hand and my initial impression is the screen is MILES better than the LED Switch It is directly comparable to the OLED ignoring the HDR question That said I think the OLED is slightly brighter and crisper and the nicer of the two displays still What I wouldnt say though is that Id ever upgrade for that difference whereas with the original it was worth it These are too close for an upgrade,mw0tt61,3.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvwhjel,obi1kenobi1,,25,2025-06-04 05:19:14,,,,Its not HDR though Not even close Its technically HDR in the sense that the circuitry can speak HDR it can receive the signal and display it without any errors but thats true of every TV and computer monitor from the past 68 years it doesnt mean it can display HDR So its the kind of false advertising where they arent going to be legally accountable for lying because HDR is such a meaningless term and its capable of deciding the HDR data stream But a lowcontrast LCD with no active backlight and a 400 nit brightness is simply not capable of displaying an HDR image in high dynamic range even if it can technically decode the data Its such a shame because like I said most TVs and computer monitors do the same false advertising claiming theyre HDR when theyre not so unless youre spending a lot on a really nice TV and as far as computer monitors go ones that can actually display HDR are almost nonexistent theres a good chance most Switch 2 buyers have never experienced real HDR It could have been such a great way to introduce a new audience to HDR and encourage developers to actually implement HDR because they could be confident that people would be playing on a real HDR display but Nintendo had to be Nintendo and cheap out Even the Steam Deck OLED has a true HDR display and there are like three PC games on Steam that support HDR natively But those three games look amazing on the Steam Deck This screen is going to be very disappointing to anyone who is coming from an OLED Switch because even an SDR OLED looks a million times better and has significantly higher dynamic range than an HDR LCD The 120fps screen is neat I guess although most Switch 2 games will be struggling to hit 60 so I dont really see the point I think it was probably just something they chose to distract people from the choice to go with a cheap lowquality LCD And just like HDR the technical capability to display 120fps is meaningless Just look at the 120hz ProMotion display on the MacBook Pro technically its 120fps but its such a slow display in terms of refresh and response time that its not really any better than a 60hz display In the Macs case it doesnt really matter because they just did it to make the UI feel a bit smoother and color qualityaccuracy and resolution is much more important than frame rate but the Switch is meant for gaming so hopefully its a very fast 120hz screen I wont be holding my breath considering the lies about HDR but I guess I wont know for sure until tomorrow Edit well its not quite as bad as I was expecting Like I thought no local dimming and it has the terrible contrast offangle colorcontrast issues and severe backlight bleed of an LCD But that being said its a good LCD By LCD standards the contrast and vibrancy is decent not enough to make up for the lack of local dimming but tolerable Brightnesswise it seems around the same but maybe slightly brighter than my OLED model at full brightness at least when looking at the home menu because I dont have two copies of any games to compare People were suspecting this was a 400 nit display and I read somewhere that the OLED was 350 though some sources said 400 so that tracks The OLED of course has much higher dynamic range in terms of contrast and the colors are still a bit more vibrant and saturated but the LCD doesnt look as bad as I was expecting It seems on par with a good midrange computer monitor rather than the bargain basement LCD used on the original Switch But when booting up Mario Kart World I noticed something the backlight bleed suddenly got noticeably worse On HDR displays a common trick mostly a gimmick to make them seem more impressive rather than any technical reason is to have two separate brightness ratings one for normal content and one for when it detects HDR content For example the Steam Deck OLED has a normal brightness of 600 nits but HDR content boosts that to 1000 nits and iPhones have brightness of 1000 nit and can get to 1600 for HDR or even 2000 when outdoors for better sunlight readability But that last example is proof that its a gimmick because it will reach higher than its HDR brightness when viewing SDR content if it detects direct sunlight If you have a smartphone with an HDcapable display and youve ever noticed that scrolling through videos online one of them seems like it turns your brightness up thats HDR So my best guess is that like a real HDR display its increasing its maximum brightness when viewing HDR content which I wasnt expecting it to do I have no way to test this but anecdotally it doesnt seem anywhere near as bright as a Steam Deck OLED or an iPhone in nonHDR mode so definitely not the industry standard of 1000 nits My best guess is maybe like the 500700 range Or maybe Im just fooling myself and what I saw wasnt actually the brightness changing when launching the game and all Im seeing is the slight increase in base brightness compared to the OLED Switch But for me someone who has had very pessimistic expectations about the screen since the first rumors that it would be LCD its better than I had expected Still not HDR in the way that most people mean when they use the term just in the way that they cant get sued over it but I was expecting the absolute worst and got mediocre so thats an improvement I was expecting something on par with the Sony PlayStation Portal a decent screen that gets the job done but not one that has very impressive specs or image quality It definitely seems noticeably better than that display though how much of that is because its not streaming compressed video like the Portal I dont know And if youre coming from an original Switch or an LCD Steam Deck it goes without saying its far better than those displays But in terms of contrast and vibrance its definitely a downgrade from the Switch OLED offset slightly by its better brightness,mvvpibw,2.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvww1yi,obi1kenobi1,,4,2025-06-04 07:29:58,,,,I havent seen one in person yet but based on what little information Nintendo has released and handson reports from reviewersnews sites it sounds like a normal edgelit LCD with 400 nits of brightness no local dimming and no HDRlevel brightness Which makes sense because if it had local dimming theres no way Nintendo wouldnt be advertising it to combat the bad press from not using OLED even though OLED is better few would have complained about an LCD with local dimming My understanding is that local dimming is only really cost effective at very large screen sizes where OLED is still prohibitively expensive or in specific scenarios where super high maximum brightness or static UI elements like on computers and tablets would make OLED less desirable But even in those cases OLED has made some huge improvements over the past decade they can get super bright albeit not quite as bright as the best mini LED and burn in is basically a nonissue Small highresolution OLED displays are so cheap now that an LCD with local dimming probably would have been a far more expensive option than OLED,mvwuklg,4.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvyspka,fullup72,,1,2025-06-04 15:23:53,,,,OLED only has better energy consumption when most of your screen needs to be dark The Switch home screen is mostly white for example and in that scenario a regular old LCDbased screen is more energy efficient Games are probably a toss regular gameplay usually favors OLED in power consumption but menusinventories also tend to use brighter colors so it evens out a bit,mvvw9qp,2.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvwfvga,VagueSomething,,4,2025-06-04 05:05:49,,,,OLED isnt worth the price increase for casual gamers especially as OLED still has burn in with heavy use which means things like game UI will eventually become floating ghosts if you play the same game a lot Burn in has been improved but not removed it is ideal for TV and movies but gaming and working should avoid OLED unless you dont mind spending to replace it If launch console was OLED then youd be increasing the chance that people complain about ghost image before the next gen Switch came out Launch an OLED version mid to end of life and youll give them less time to cause the burn in,mvvjzpd,1.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvytp1j,DFrostedWangsAccount,,1,2025-06-04 15:28:30,,,,I still have one not the one I had as a kid but the same kind And its the rarer kind Not everyone knows this but in the US they released two versions of the SP The AGS001 and the AGS101 The 001 has a front lit screen which is fine and a huge upgrade over the older gameboys But when I was a kid I got my toys later when they got cheap and nintendo quietly released the 101 in the US about a year before the DS came out Thats the one I got for christmas and honestly it was a great deal because GBA games went on sale when the DS came out The 101 wasnt sold for long before it was replaced with a new console so not as many of them are still around but it has a backlit screen and is the best looking gameboy in my opinion About 15 years ago I got one on ebay that was all beat to hell but the screen was flawless no dead pixels or scratches Swapped it into a neon orange shell a color they never sold it in so its harder for someone to steal and it looks beautiful I got that and an EZFlash IV cart takes a microSD card Did you know every GBA game released in north america is less than 5GB total Also the cart lets me play homebrew or modded games like pokemon randomizer on real hardware,mvvif8m,2.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvxsmca,DrDoctor18,,0,2025-06-04 12:13:21,,,,Good luck finding a battery pack with 45 watt charging Youll still have to stop wait for it to fill back up,mvwbluj,4.0,1l2rw63
comment,mw0l5ng,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2025-06-04 20:27:23,,,,Zero chance that Switch 2 will actually be pulling 45W to function even if it can charge at 45W At 34 volts 45W means the 5200mAh internal battery would last like maybe 2530 minutes Nintendo is estimating 265 hrs playtime lets say that playing Cyberpunk 2077 it lasts a solid 1 hour that would mean the draw is like 225W For comparison max power draw of the Switch is 18W even though it can accept up to 40W charging An M1 MacBook Air at max load draws like 29W even though it can charge at up to 45W Lets say its 23W for Switch 2 Well eg the Icemag 1 is 10000mAh and can provide up to 30W charging and itself charges in like 15 hrs Meaning you could playandcharge on it charge the power bank and put it back in when the internal battery gets low like infinite portable time,mvxsmca,5.0,1l2rw63
comment,mw16b66,DrDoctor18,,1,2025-06-04 22:11:51,,,,I mean I was saying that in the context of the steam deck more which charges at 45W and lasts maybe 90mins2 hours on battery in a fullon game Still a standard battery pack will be what 5V 24A maybe So half the requirement just barely reaching your output of 225W,mw0l5ng,6.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvwmeiq,GoodbyeThings,,11,2025-06-04 06:00:32,,,,Yeah I absolutely love my steam deck but with its protective case its bulky as fuck And its quite heavy Its still amazing and for shorter trips for sure But I travel a lot and I didnt take it with my for last trips The switch in comparison would take up much less space,mvw03m7,2.0,1l2rw63
comment,mvwu30p,TheGreatBenjie,,4,2025-06-04 07:10:23,,,,Yup the Deck is great in a backpack but the Switch can fit in your pocket especially if you split the joycons off and put them in another,mvwmeiq,3.0,1l2rw63

comment,mvyyxyl,Bill_Brasky01,,-2,2025-06-04 15:53:15,,,,The cost for that would be huge The whole point of the switch is to streamline manufacturing to drive down costs There might be 100 people who would buy that,mvxfkb3,2.0,1l2rw63
comment,mvz1zga,BrewKazma,,2,2025-06-04 16:07:42,,,,I think you wildly underestimate how many people never pull the switch out of the dock They also made a version that is only portable for the switch so this is not unheard of,mvyyxyl,3.0,1l2rw63

comment,mw2ulh0,Angstycarroteater,,1,2025-06-05 04:09:35,,,,I have no idea how many there were it seemed like more than 500 but that doesnt mean much I was just told thats how much the whole trailer had cost We had 2 AP people and 3 bosses watching the entire time in an area with hella cameras It was highkey dummy stressful and took a whole 10 hour shift to do granted it was a lot of sorting tags and stuff to ship to the correct stores,mw2jxxy,2.0,1l2rw63

comment,mw3bio2,sean_themighty,,1,2025-06-05 06:29:38,,,,Why Maybe no reason at all if the black levels are the most important deciding factor to you But maybe you want a bigger screen or 120Hz or to play Switch 2 exclusives or you want the better ergonomics or bigger joycons or you want to use the mouse feature If you have no compelling reasons to upgrade then dont Its smart not to release the 2 with OLED because it would substantially more expensive and most people dont care or get more benefit out of the larger and faster refresh rate Not to mention the LCD on the 2 is much better than the OG Switch,mvxkyp6,1.0,1l2rw63
