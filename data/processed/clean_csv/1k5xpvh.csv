comment,molifai,UnsorryCanadian,,1271,2025-04-23 12:27:43,,,,But I thought they said they were ordering so many Switch 2 consoles to be made that there couldnt possibly be a shortage Or something,,0.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moljwxo,SomeBoxofSpoons,,479,2025-04-23 12:37:16,,,,To be fair Japan has their own unique SKU Production targets had to be split between how many to make just for Japan and how many to make for the rest of the world and it sounds like that ratio mightve ended up lighter on the for Japan side than it needed At least for the My Nintendo Store orders,molifai,1.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momlpwm,Jazs1994,,72,2025-04-23 15:55:49,,,,I like to think because the Japanese language models are cheaper than the rotw that people were happy to just buy it at face value,moljwxo,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mommcr6,SomeBoxofSpoons,,39,2025-04-23 15:58:52,,,,Other people have said that its only really cheaper going by official exchange rates and that going by the actual buying power of the Yen right now its about as big an expense for them as our prices are for us,momlpwm,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mop1rj8,submerging,,24,2025-04-23 23:12:57,,,,But what about the countless other countries that have less buying power than the US yet still have USadjusted console prices,mommcr6,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mope5xm,rpkarma,,24,2025-04-24 00:23:08,,,,Sucks to suck basically lol Its wild to see kids defending region locking Yall dont know how bad the rest of us get fucked by it,mop1rj8,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,morfk7b,error521,,4,2025-04-24 09:50:11,,,,To be fair its more language locked I believe game cards are still region free on that console and they are offering a more expensive regionfree variant,mope5xm,6.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mork379,Wizard-of-pause,,-2,2025-04-24 10:31:54,,,,Did you forget that Nintendo hates its fans If they could they would drown every single consumer Not to gain anything but just out of pure hate,mop1rj8,5.0,1k5xpvh

comment,momon6a,None,,23,2025-04-23 16:10:07,,,,Yeah Its still relatively more expensive in Japan than say a Switch 1 But theyre making that Japanese exclusive model that is region locked to discourage people in the West who hold stronger currencies from buying a Japanese model Switch that is artificially cheaper for them because of the strength of their currency relative to the Yen Otherwise many in the West would just buy tons of JPN Switch 2s for like 330 and just change the language and region essentially stealing a console that could have been sold to a Japanese consumer or at the very least outbidding them,mommcr6,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqhhck,SupMonica,,1,2025-04-24 04:27:32,,,,I somehow assumed that the Yen was more or less on Par with the US dollar 1 Yen was like a 1 Cent coin,momon6a,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqn22k,ThataSmilez,,2,2025-04-24 05:09:14,,,,Its a bit weaker than that now want to say its more like 140 yen to a dollar nowadays,moqhhck,6.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mooa2bq,None,,6,2025-04-23 20:46:25,,,,Stealing an opportunity And thats not far from the truth of it If people in the US are importing tons of consoles that are artificially cheaper when buying the Japanese model then that leaves lower stock available for Japanese consumers And Japanese consumers cant turn around and import stock from other Europe or somewhere because the Yen is weaker so it would just be even more expensive than if purchased locally Thats a problem that could get out of control very quickly making for a massive shortage of devices for the companys home market Markets have to be supported if theyre going to succeed there and Nintendo cant leave the Japanese market unprotected in this economic situation given how important the Japanese market is to their overall success,moo1c5a,6.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqhkk8,Inner-Bread,,2,2025-04-24 04:28:11,,,,So are they selling Japanese models at a loss or price gouging the rest of us though Its not like the production costs per unit change just the shippingtariffs,mooa2bq,7.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mos8dus,F1yMo1o,,2,2025-04-24 13:17:03,,,,1 All of the big players have considered selling the base consoles at a loss in order to lock in the marketplayer and make money in the lifetime of the unit not stating that is necessarily so now and it changes the further they get from launch 2 Cost structures are different in the various regions marketing is different logisticsdistribution can be different It isnt 1x1 and Im sure tariffs play a role now too 3 If Nintendo releases geographic segment data in their financials you can see the impact of whichever strategies they pick in their results,moqhkk8,8.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moo2q5h,AuroraFinem,,2,2025-04-23 20:11:05,,,,Theres a limited supply its an absolutely valid concern and term used Product costs are adjusted based on buying power in that locality and the costs to produce and import to that location Its not really a big issue to use a VPN into a low cost country and purchase something digital for cheaper because there are no physical barriers When it comes to physical product youre taking a limited supply item which is reduced cost only because of the local buying power out of circulation for that target population They would then have to pay scalped prices because someone else took one they werent supposed to be allowed to purchase Region locking is almost universally used in order to make this not appeal to people trying to snipe a cheaper one from a country with higher buying power in order to make sure supply remains available at the local price point that people there can actually afford,moo1c5a,6.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moq1ryd,roehnin,,2,2025-04-24 02:40:59,,,,Yes its more expensive than the previous one by quite a bit In terms of buying power and average salaries its probably a higher relative expense to income than the US price to Americans For foreigners living in Japan wanting to buy the international model its very expensive,mommcr6,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,monr0gy,DragonDropTechnology,,1,2025-04-23 19:14:20,,,,Yeah that was basically the point of Nintendo offering this Japanonly region locked Switch 2,mommcr6,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momgkd5,cosmos7,,18,2025-04-23 15:31:00,,,,To be fair Japan has their own unique SKU Theres no hardware difference though its just software regionlocking bullshit,moljwxo,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momljbf,SomeBoxofSpoons,,83,2025-04-23 15:54:57,,,,Yes but that means separate batches of consoles with different firmware installed in the factory Its not like they can change which version it is after they packaged it,momgkd5,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momrwg9,Cakeking7878,,67,2025-04-23 16:26:06,,,,Its a sign this person hasnt worked in manufacturing before Everything from ordering the right number of boxes with the Japanese text to ordering different plugs to different manuals etc etc etc Hell just doing a separate job to open up packages product to wipe it then put the new firmware all takes time and then mistakes might happen in doing that and break your product Especially for large production runs with millions of consoles You cant just move things around this was all planed out months in advance and even with years of experience still run into issues Hell Im just spitting balling theres probably so many more issues,momljbf,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momv9ci,SomeBoxofSpoons,,21,2025-04-23 16:42:28,,,,Exactly Regardless of what a different SKU is a different SKU is a different product Full stop,momrwg9,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momrl6i,fevildox,,6,2025-04-23 16:24:34,,,,Well no Before a company ramps up to mass production of a consumer product even if theyre only ever going to make an international unlocked version the operations people need to split quantity depending on the SKUs ie US market gets 30 APAC gets 40 etc This is based on forecasted demand and is needed to figure out shipping from FATP and downstream supply chain If the demand suddenly goes beyond what was forecasted prior to product announcement andor ramp to MP theres of course going to be an imbalance Hence the warning,momgkd5,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mommr6a,windowtosh,,9,2025-04-23 16:00:49,,,,The idea is to make sure Japanese consumers have stock available to them without having to compete with international markets There will still be region unlocked consoles but more limited,momgkd5,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momh7ec,SegaTetris,,8,2025-04-23 15:34:06,,,,Yeah but the supposed hypocrisy being pointed out in the first place doesnt make sense is the point There very well could be enough for the US Canada and Europe Japans situation is irrelevant to this community,momgkd5,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moolzr7,Jsr1,,2,2025-04-23 21:46:20,,,,But if they miscalculated for Japanese market how much do you trust the other country estimates,momh7ec,4.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mor8ncn,AnRealDinosaur,,1,2025-04-24 08:38:42,,,,I was about to say its not like this is the only production run and this is your only chance but then who knows what the situation will be in the US We could get 5000 tariffs on things that are square tomorrow,moqm4q6,6.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molqvwa,FisicoK,,38,2025-04-23 13:19:00,,,,Nearly every single console launch in Japan has shortage a typical launch week number there is in the 100600k range the latter is the historical record it was PS2 not sure whats the worth of that 22M number but if these are real potential buyers W1 this is a ludicrous number The question is whether the shortage will last a couple weeks or a couple months it can come back later on like it did for NSW eventually after COVID,molifai,1.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom3rew,AStringOfWords,,16,2025-04-23 14:28:17,,,,This one was going to be different Nintendo wanted to avoid being tarred with the paper launch accusations of the Nvidia 5000 series and PS5 so they made FOUR MILLION units for pre order Even that wasnt enough,molqvwa,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molk5ss,Cottontael,,67,2025-04-23 12:38:50,,,,This is the cheap Japan only version since their economy is fucked right now Im not sure what the difference is besides software but I imagine theres at least an added chip for region locking,molifai,1.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molnjii,masagrator,,69,2025-04-23 12:59:22,,,,They already said that your language is locked to Japanese and your eshop account will be locked to Japan No region locking games which means you can still play cartridges from other countries only region locking eshop and language,molk5ss,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molobzs,Cottontael,,21,2025-04-23 13:04:07,,,,Yeah I understand that I just figured they would do something to stop people from flashing the international isfirmware onto the cheaper Japan hardware I dont know how feasible that is I am not a genius,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molzukj,masagrator,,15,2025-04-23 14:08:31,,,,On Switch 1 you can do that only on hacked Switch Chinese units have separate firmware but after reflashing you wont be able to use any Nintendo Online functionality Game updates eshop NSO without getting swiftly banned So while Switch 2 is not hacked there is nothing people can even try to do,molobzs,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom1240,Kalicolocts,,4,2025-04-23 14:14:50,,,,Do you know if games downloaded from the eshop will be playable only in japanese,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom1nwv,masagrator,,13,2025-04-23 14:17:54,,,,Unless game has option in menu to change language they will be locked to Japanese Almost all Nintendo games on Switch 1 dont have such menu,mom1240,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom5p5z,stellvia2016,,2,2025-04-23 14:37:54,,,,It will mean you dont have access to some games however as AFAIK there are digitalonly games that only appear on the eShop in some regions,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom7wx2,masagrator,,2,2025-04-23 14:48:48,,,,Thats correct but there was nothing stopping you from changing eshop region to Japan and buying that game from fe USA Only con was that you were losing money in wallet when changing region you could use only Japanese debit cards and gift carts,mom5p5z,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momf6be,TomTomMan93,,2,2025-04-23 15:24:17,,,,Im probably out of the loop here but why do they do this If the games arent region locked and the locks are mostly software based why not just have more of the same product If you want more in Japan just allocate more to Japan Itd take away from the global supply but still seems like a cheaper option,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqmqhr,stellvia2016,,4,2025-04-24 05:06:38,,,,Because the yen devalued against the US dollar by like 3540 over the last 34 years or so So they decided to release the console into their home market at a significantly reduced price in USD to offset that disparity in purchasing power However that means scalpers and dropshippers would seek to buy up the Japanese stocks enmasse to resell in other markets at US MSRP and turn a tidy profit Hence Nintendo putting hard limits onto the Japanese SKU to combat that Although Im sure someone will figure out how to bypass it eventually,momf6be,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momfzs1,masagrator,,2,2025-04-23 15:28:14,,,,It shows they didnt expect such high Japan sales in preorders I bet if they knew that it will sold so well in Japan they wouldnt make special cheaper unit for Japan Last data they had was that whole globe preordered 15 mln Switches And now in Japan alone you have 22 mln preordered Switches 2 excluding third party stores,momf6be,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momzmvd,sali_nyoro-n,,1,2025-04-23 17:03:19,,,,I mean they might The Japanese market is a higher priority for them than foreigners,momfzs1,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mompo06,Swastik496,,0,2025-04-23 16:15:08,,,,japan has cheaper models than the rest of the world By 100 even on switch 1,momf6be,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,morj8y9,staryoshi06,,1,2025-04-24 10:24:24,,,,Why though,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mp2zy8h,Embarrassed-Weird173,,1,2025-04-26 02:40:59,,,,Thats dumb They should at least let you switch to American so that everyone could use it,molnjii,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molkmcu,Gnash_,,11,2025-04-23 12:41:41,,,,probably no added chip but firmware changes and specific packaging which makes Nintendo allocating more Switch 2 to Japan not an instant thing,molk5ss,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom5hl1,stellvia2016,,15,2025-04-23 14:36:51,,,,Remember that this may be cheap to you but because of the 40 currency deflation that happened to them over the last couple years its basically about the same equivalent price in purchasing power to the global version,molk5ss,2.0,1k5xpvh

comment,moo2v1h,pay_student_loan,,4,2025-04-23 20:11:45,,,,I was just in Akihabara and saw shops selling used PS5s for 50000yen That roughly converts to 350USD which isnt terrible for Americans but that feels like 500 for Japanese people as for the longest time 100yen roughly equaled a 1 Thats awful for a used console 4 years into its life,mom6ggg,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqn3rm,stellvia2016,,2,2025-04-24 05:09:37,,,,Theyre even more screwed in the PC hardware market The 4090 sellssold for over 4k USD Prebuilt gaming systems youd get for maybe 2k in the US were going for like 3500 there,moo2v1h,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mopx72a,Worried_Pineapple823,,1,2025-04-24 02:13:45,,,,Its something that can make or break the bottom line for international companies I remember during the Wii era that the yen to dollar changed so much that both Nintendo and Sony stopped exchanging the currency on sales in usd to yen The exchange rate at least for the Wii had effectively dropped the cost by the equivalent of 100 In that at launch 300 usd was say 30k yen and when they made the decision 300 usd was only 20k yen Numbers estimatedmade up for example purposes,mom6ggg,4.0,1k5xpvh

comment,molyvtp,Mean-Evening-7209,,5,2025-04-23 14:03:24,,,,Im sure they just modified firmwarelogic to implement a region lock With all the SoCs they use nowadays you can do pretty much anything on it,molk5ss,2.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mounuw4,Cottontael,,1,2025-04-24 20:21:36,,,,Their economy is finally catching up to US Theyve been in deflation for like 2 generations but strain from Covid and wage stagnation for them finally quickened inflation rates a year ago They are starting to feel poor,moum13s,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,monp9s1,KazzieMono,,3,2025-04-23 19:05:47,,,,I dont think that was ever the case They came out saying they produced like a million consoles for launch and Im just like Oh So its going to be out of stock everywhere,molifai,1.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mor9em0,AnRealDinosaur,,1,2025-04-24 08:46:45,,,,3rd party US sellers opened their preorders at midnight last night and theyre already sold out from what I can tell Nintendo themselves is doing their lotteryinvite thing in May I wouldnt worry though This is still all preorder and they might be hard to get at first but its not like theyre only producing a set amount or something I remember being super frustrated on the waitlist for a steam deck but once production got going it all worked out,monp9s1,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,molkuty,Gnash_,,300,2025-04-23 12:43:08,,,,Title is slightly underselling the Switch 2s preorder situation 22 million people have ordered the Switch 2 in Japan through the My Nintendo Store So the actual number is probably even higher,,0.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom63qi,RoyalCities,,49,2025-04-23 14:39:54,,,,Was it the only place you could pre order for the Japanese model It could be matter of people placing it there just in case I know a bunch of people try to preorder at different stores just because theres a chance their preorder is cancelled then they can it at the extra stores once they know theyre safe and its coming,molkuty,1.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom91hb,Gnash_,,11,2025-04-23 14:54:17,,,,Preorders havent opened in other Japanese stores from what I understand so its hard to gauge what the actual number of preorders will be plus Nintendo said a significant number of people who participated in the raffle will not have a Switch 2 So yeah I dont know hard to say anything conclusive atp It will be interesting to see how popular the Switch 2 will be at launch though Nintendo seems to have set incredibly high expectations for themselves this launch window,mom63qi,2.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mopbnzk,noor2436,,3,2025-04-24 00:08:44,,,,Actual demand must be insane Nintendos about to print money with this launch Scalpers are gonna have a field day if they cant meet demand,molkuty,1.0,1k5xpvh

comment,molvaav,HKei,,67,2025-04-23 13:43:57,,,,I mean you dont _want_ undersupply as a company its not good for customer relations and youre leaving money on the table youd rather have money now than later most of the time But you REALLY dont want oversupply Your product staying unbought on shelves forever is a bad look PR wise and youre printing negative money,molmzvj,2.0,1k5xpvh

comment,momg86l,billythygoat,,8,2025-04-23 15:29:23,,,,Its nearly impossible to have an oversupply of a video game console now If nintendo made 20 million Switch 2s they would all be sold The thing is making enough now so they dont have a ton of excess right before launch because 20 million consoles is a lot to have on hand Also ordering takes time if there are any major issues with the console they sometimes do a lightly updated version on the next batch too,molzdy9,4.0,1k5xpvh

comment,moowrkk,Slight_Ad5318,,3,2025-04-23 22:45:23,,,,Oh yeah they really fucked the launch on that up My point isnt that I think the switch2 is going to flop its just that they do stumble sometimes and they seem to like playing it safe,mon5601,7.0,1k5xpvh
comment,moqnxby,stellvia2016,,3,2025-04-24 05:16:16,,,,Storing the excess in warehouses costs money it also multiplies any miscalculations in supply for specific markets And another consideration If Nintendo can even reserve any more production capacity from Samsung for the chips They may not be on the very latest process but theyre still on one of the leading edge ones so Im sure demand is still high for their fabs,momg86l,5.0,1k5xpvh

comment,moqdk1k,pmjm,,2,2025-04-24 03:59:29,,,,For things like GPUs undersupply can work in their favor But consoles are essentially a lossleader The manufacturers might make a modest profit margin but the real money is in selling games which they cant do if people dont have consoles Undersupply ensures they dont take an L on a potential flopped launch but it also puts a ceiling on earnings,momsigd,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mook918,cat_prophecy,,3,2025-04-23 21:37:12,,,,The sale will be made regardless of supply Whether the person buys from them immediately buys from a scalper or waits and buys it once supply stabilizes is irrelevant Nintendo is just gambling that people wont be turned away even if they have to wait or overpay for a console and largely they are right,molvaav,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mom5se6,Competitive-Call6810,,3,2025-04-23 14:38:21,,,,The marketing gimmick of this console seems to be online play with friends I already have friends who cant afford it gonna suck if I also have friends who just cant get ahold of it,molvaav,3.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mopmwoq,teeny_tina,,1,2025-04-24 01:13:40,,,,when it comes to japanese products occasionally you get a genuine issue of undersupply but for the most part its artificial scarcity You cap the first round of orders to 1 see what the demand is like and 2 increase the peoples FOMOimpression of the product then open subsequent orders with stronger metrics Not sure if they do this is as much in the US but its a common sales strategy in south korea and japan,molvaav,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,monuji0,None,,0,2025-04-23 19:31:34,,,,Undersupply has been the rules of the game from Nintendo for a long while which is how they justify prices never going down it was a particularly nasty artificial scarcity around the amiibos,molvaav,3.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mop67v4,Enchelion,,2,2025-04-23 23:37:49,,,,Building enough supply to completely cover launch demand would likely mean delaying to console and related software by years Or so massively overcommitting to manufacturing lines that you have to overpay and lose tons of money In both cases you risk massive overstock that screws your finances,molmzvj,2.0,1k5xpvh

comment,momcr8v,UnidentifiedRoot,,7,2025-04-23 15:12:32,,,,Not really tbh they broke even on the Wii U generation thanks to the 3ds which isnt preferable of course but given the war chest of cash they had thanks to the Wii Im not sure Id call it dire Like it wasnt as bad for them as the PS3 gen was for Sony where they actually made a pretty rough loss Obviously its not impossible especially now where they dont have a second device acting as a safety net but people overestimate just how bad the Wii U gen was for them,momau5o,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momdhw3,None,,2,2025-04-23 15:16:08,,,,Look nobody is saying that Nintendo was gonna totally die out but similar to where Microsoft seems to be heading atm its not an impossibility that they would have had to pull out of the console market Yeah the 3DS was still doing well absolutely but if the Switch had underperformed or even flopped like the Wii U did and the Wii U did do bad Then Nintendo as we know it today absolutely would not be around,momcr8v,5.0,1k5xpvh

comment,molst42,badger906,,3,2025-04-23 13:30:00,,,,I sold it because I wasnt using it as the next game I wanted Mario wasnt out for 67 months post launch and my colleague was struggling to get one I didnt sell it for personal gain or lack of enjoyment I sold it to be nice In fact Ive only ever sold 2 other consoles in the 36 years Ive been alive That being an n64 to fund my ps2 still have it and a ps4 pro as I got a ps5 and that was sold to a family friend at Christmas for her kids Again at a price lower than I could have got for it at the local cex or cash converters Some of us arent materialistic and some of us dont give a shit about trying to make as much money as possible Im a store owner Im the little guy my entire job revolves around fighting big companies at low margins trust me I cant abide ripping people off more than the average person,molrqo3,5.0,1k5xpvh

comment,molrftc,FisicoK,,2,2025-04-23 13:22:11,,,,The real price cut they did on NSW is not increasing its price in a market where everyone else increased prices its an half serious answer Otherwise DS 3DS GC Wii Wii U even NSW with the Lite SKU went through some kind of price drops If the hardware is successfull its through a cheaper SKU usually Wii Mini DS Lite 2DS or a straight up price cut if the hardware isnt successful GC Wii U,molofjd,5.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mom47ai,AStringOfWords,,1,2025-04-23 14:30:27,,,,True but they didnt do that either They genuinely thought a production run of 4 million units would cover all preorders and allow them to still have stock on launch day To be fair everyone would have thought the same to expect the switch 2 to outsell the switch 1 by over 3 times as many units would be crazy optimistic Yet here we are,mom1yqp,8.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mosjor9,AStringOfWords,,1,2025-04-24 14:16:49,,,,Me too Ive got a retail pre order UK I signed up for the Nintendo store and the Amazon wait lists and got an email from both saying sorry youve not been successful So I camped out every retail website for 12 hours and snagged a restock I dont think there will be any problems for retailers fulfilling preorders Nintendo will deliver the exact number of units they promised Only issue is if your retailer was sloppy and accidentally sold too many and even then Nintendo are usually pretty good and overallocate a small percentage to account for that I have faith we will both be playing MKW on launch day,mom500q,10.0,1k5xpvh

comment,momwxlh,Flimsy_Atmosphere_55,,1,2025-04-23 16:50:28,,,,I think the biggest reason I cant understand how well it seeks is the lack of full backwards compatibility I know for many consoles they also dont have full backwards compatibility but with the switch no one wants to carry around 2 handhelds With a living room type console its not hard to just keep two consoles there,mommukw,4.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mon3bhu,geminijono,,2,2025-04-23 17:20:44,,,,Backwards compatibility almost never covers the entire catalog regardless of system A handful of games from PS1 would not work on PS2 and more than a few PS2 games would not work on PS3 further compounded by later hardware revisions and eventual removal of backwards compatibility completely Nintendo has done this before as you cannot tradeimport Pokemon from Gens 12 to Gen 3 games with original hardware under normal circumstances It is in their best interest to make sure all the greatest hits play on their latest system but it appears that they built a Switch 1 emulator into the Switch 2 likely to save costs but the trade is that not all games may function with it,momwxlh,5.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mon4m5m,Flimsy_Atmosphere_55,,1,2025-04-23 17:26:45,,,,I get why not all games are backwards compatible in most consoles but from what I can find a switch 2 is just an upgraded switch so the hardware should be very very compatible Its not like the x86 and PowerPC of the OG XBox and XBox 360,mon3bhu,6.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mon6a99,geminijono,,2,2025-04-23 17:34:38,,,,That is extremely reductive and nitpicky Nothing is ever that simple under the hood or at the firmware level Most people who want a Switch 2 will already have an OG Switch to play that back catalog natively Nintendo wants people to buy the Switch 2 This is the cycle of consumerist things Further games like Labo and Ring Fit Adventure require OG Switch hardware because they were made to use that hardware At the software level not every developer is going to do the legwork or spend the money to make and issue an update to ensure compatibility but some will make an effort Just enjoy things as they are or if you really are so inclined do something to make them better,mon4m5m,7.0,1k5xpvh
comment,mon84wb,Flimsy_Atmosphere_55,,1,2025-04-23 17:43:20,,,,I dont think my take is nitpicky or reductive at all The difference between other consoles and a handheld one like the switch is that other consoles sit at home theres nothing extra that needs to done but carrying around 2 handhelds is something extra Just enjoy things as they are is not a very good take imo because theres always something that could be improved and since Im not a developer at Nintendo there is nothing I can do to make it better lol I wasnt trying to stir any debate I was just trying to understand and I have gotten a lot of opinions that changed my mind at least somewhat I could see my take as reductive if Nintendo didnt do something similar before but the Wii had excellent GameCube support because at the heart the Wii was just a super beefed GameCube If there plan is to make 98 of games backwards compatible and will improve their selection over time then I will retract my criticism of the backwards compatibility,mon6a99,8.0,1k5xpvh

comment,monc7iy,geminijono,,2,2025-04-23 18:02:25,,,,Here are Nintendos own numbers Turns out there are even more 3rd party games than my original count which pushes the total of incompatible games even lower A great deal of those are probably slop but the ones that sold well will likely receive updates As for Nintendomade games most will work with Switch 2 which to be honest are the main draw for any Nintendo system Compatibility crisis averted,monaq7w,11.0,1k5xpvh
comment,momq7kb,error521,,1,2025-04-23 16:17:47,,,,The Switch 2 while still fairly large is still a much skinnier and more portable device I could actually take out on the bus without feeling like a giant tit Cannot say the same about the Steam Deck I have a gaming laptop so if I need a powerful enough PC that I can still lug around places that has me covered Steam Decks less powerful and jankier than that and isnt really portable enough to be something I can comfortably lug around wherever so its basically no mans land territory for me Also dont have to mess about with tweaking settings to get games to run okay its probably more powerful switching between docked and handheld is seamless first party games etc As for game sales while Steam definitely has the advantage there a lot of thirdparty games go on the eShop for cheap frequently For example right now you can get Diablo 2 and 3 for 17 Skyrim for 16 Hogwarts Legacy for 12 Doom for 4 etc you arent paying full price for every game on there,mome4xy,1.0,1k5xpvh

comment,mona9o2,replus,,1,2025-04-23 17:53:17,,,,This is in Japan though where there isnt quite the same notion of a fixed 70 ex60 price tag for AAA games The game pricing structure is probably not as unsettling to Japanese customers who have been accustomed to games sometimes costing this much for a while now For example Monster Hunter Wilds just launched at 9990 yen the same price as Mario Kart World,molnmkz,1.0,1k5xpvh
