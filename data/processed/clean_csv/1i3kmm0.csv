comment,m7r2b2n,RoryDragonsbane,,1,2025-01-18 04:13:12,,,,Just to clarify you can 3D print a gun that will fire multiple times Firearms are made of multiple parts but the one part that is classified and serialized as the firearm is the receiver This means you need a background check to purchase this part but can buy every other part online and shipped directly to your house without a background check With some guns notably Glock pistols and AR15s the receiver isnt under a lot of heat or pressure and can reliably be made out of plastic and used multiple times without failure In effect you can 3D print a receiver without a background check and assemble a complete firearm out of other parts including parts that would have to be made of metal like the barrel etc The bill is still political theatre as the vast majority of crime guns are either stolen or strawpurchased someone with a clean background buys and then sells to a criminal but I still wanted to clarify,m7o89n5,2.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7on9i3,User1539,,6,2025-01-17 19:58:53,,,,I agree 100 We live in a really hard society and that makes people hard Hard people shoot people Why did we have fewer gun controls in the 50s but also fewer shootings Probably because Americans in the 50s were the highest paid workers in the world Regulating guns even 10yrs ago was a conversation about regulating manufactured guns and that was probably possible Other countries did it right All Im saying is on the issue of regulating 3D printed guns we dont even know where to start Im not sure its even possible If your argument is that we need to start with getting people what they need to stop WANTING to shoot one another I think youre right because the guns are starting to flood countries with manufactured gun bans already and were probably just months away from a school shooting in America with one People who want to commit crimes are going to do it with the most easily available weapons and in the next decade I suspect thats going to switch even in America from manufactured to 3D printed guns,m7olwka,3.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7ohrm9,True-Surprise1222,,1,2025-01-17 19:32:03,,,,Im not saying its easily enforceable but when America is all out of ideas it just seems to put harsher penalties on the item And I would say the world is pretty good at keeping illegal content off the non dark web internet At least blatantly illegal content Now imagine they treat 3d gun files like that and you will have a lot fewer people spreading them because law abiding enthusiasts will give it up Basically just make anyone spreading them a terrorist and people will stigmatize ghost guns and a decade or two down the line it will be a thing you turn your friends in for if they mention it in passing Theyll say it doesnt violate the 2a because you can still buy your guns like a real patriot etc tbh just find something that gives tons of powers to the government and doesnt hurt capitalism and thats generally the solution,m7ogel0,6.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7rv5gj,LarrcasM,,1,2025-01-18 08:31:10,,,,In order for a 3D printer to help make a gun worth a damn you either need to buy every single moving part for a firearm in metal or be able to make every moving piece out of metal yourself My point is that anyone capable of doing it is either basically just buying a gun already or capable of making whatever they were going to 3D print themselves with shit from Home Depot Regulating plastic is kinda just absurd to me Shitmy printer is a resin printer and even if you wanted to make a handle for a firearm with it itd probably break the second you thought of putting recoil through it lmao,m7oko2g,4.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7uilo2,User1539,,1,2025-01-18 19:06:13,,,,The FGC 9 comes with noweld instructions for rifling a barrel I agree regulating 3D printers is essentially pissing in the wind but the difference between making a gun 15 years ago and now is huge I know people thinking of making one as a fun weekend project where they wouldnt have been able to before Then3D printer and instructions available have taken this from a dangerous project with a steep learning curve to a geeks weekend project,m7tw7dj,7.0,1i3kmm0
comment,m7unb6x,LarrcasM,,1,2025-01-18 19:29:58,,,,You dont use a welder to rifle the barrel you use it for the bolt You legitimately need to be able to weld to make one of these things as far as I can tell Rifling the barrel is an entirely different set of problems that also requires specialty tools and knowledgeskills to do correctly Not welding it just means youve got a gun held together by JB weld lmaowhich is just going to hand grenade at some point Im sure itll work great until it doesnt and then youre going to have a really bad time lmao As a geek one that already knows about 3D printing this isnt a weekend a project Its going to take time and learning to get this shit done Anyone who thinks this is like some lego kit doesnt know enough about it Again there are kits that legitimately are basically Legos that convert metal CO2 airsoft pistols into an actual firearm The internet has made this accessible to anyone vaguely handy already without 3D printers Its a problem but its impossible to stop anyone determined to make a gun from making one with or without a 3D printer The best you can do is make obtaining parts like barrels trigger mechanisms etc more difficult but even then youre going to see hillbilly pipe guns that absolutely were made in a weekend by someone whos handy,m7uilo2,8.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7q5sot,User1539,,1,2025-01-18 00:47:48,,,,I dont think its one or the other On the one hand yes making guns more easily available makes gun violence more prevalent in any society that has violence issues Removing guns from that equation might be like hiding the steak knives from a prison psychopath and you can certainly make the argument that treating the psychopath is the better of the two options But Im still going to want you to hide the steak knives at least for a while right Now to beat that metaphor to death were selling 200 Steak Knife makers to the prisoners and I dont know how to stop that I still think we should probably do our due diligence not to just hand out steak knives though,m7q154x,3.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7qj6qf,peoplejustwannalove,,1,2025-01-18 02:08:15,,,,I think youre being a little too negative on the impact of gun control 3d printing doesnt make it meaningless and is itself a barrier to making a firearm due to cost and more importantly knowledge 3d printing does have a learning curve after all Plus the important parts like barrels and bolts cant be printed at least to a durable standard Even small gun control policies like waiting periods can significantly reduce suicide And truth be told if a felon wants a gun they can easily find someone willing to sell a Glock AR15 etc for less than a quality 3d Printer 3d printing is not going to be anyones first choice for an illegal firearm and while it might impact states with tighter gun laws more so than others 3d printed guns printed by individuals for use in crime are mostly a hypothetical especially since 90 firearm kits still exist last I checked,m7o03pt,2.0,1i3kmm0

comment,m7rjuws,User1539,,1,2025-01-18 06:36:21,,,,Fair enough and Im 100 in support of that But the guides to building a FGC9 teach you to rifle a barrel in a 2 hour process I think 3D printers have brought gun manufacture into the hands of average people and outside of regulating every piece of pipe theres not a lot you can do People are building them for fun and criminals are already turning to them in places where manufactured guns are scarce Hell there are wars being fought with them Anywhere you cant get a gun you just make one Im not saying we just give up and yes regulating the barrel is an obvious step to at least slowing things down and probably worth doing But when you can make an accurate barrel in 2 hours Im not sure how much that accomplishes Im not against regulation Its probably all still worth doing even if to just deter the children and the laziest and most impulsive of future gun criminals But I dont know how you stop people from making guns in a world where its as easy as downloading a file and following some instructions over a weekend,m7r8ovy,3.0,1i3kmm0
