comment,m8pkj5o,Expln,,1965,2025-01-23 11:59:15,,,,For some reason it feels like the period between ps5 and ps6 is way shorter I guess its because a lot of us only got a ps5 not too long ago due to the unavailability and scalpers,,0.0,1i8122n
comment,m8pofoc,Pool_Shark,,1037,2025-01-23 12:29:28,,,,I think its the software too They have been really slow to roll out gen exclusive games,m8pkj5o,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m8pq7rr,ExeTcutHiveE,,531,2025-01-23 12:42:17,,,,A very very strong argument for exactly why I am not even going to think about buying a PS6 for years after its release Bought one on release day since the PS2 but not gonna touch the PS6 unless they give me a reason to buy the hardware,m8pofoc,2.0,1i8122n

comment,m8rk1dg,RedOctobyr,,52,2025-01-23 18:17:29,,,,Changing my 4 Pro to an internal SSD made a huge difference in the UI and in game load times It was totally worth the price and this was a few years ago,m8qpyk2,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8tyebd,thiefwithsharpteeth,,4,2025-01-24 01:10:22,,,,Yes I put a solid state in my PS4 Pro a few years ago Was definitely worth it At this point Id probably just recommend that anybody with that problem just putting the money toward a PS5 though,m8rk1dg,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8u1crc,RedOctobyr,,9,2025-01-24 01:26:18,,,,Thats fair Though it looks like you can now get a 1TB SSD for 5060 so the upgrade cost isnt terribly high at least,m8tyebd,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m90jw0j,crazyjoco,,0,2025-01-25 01:01:35,,,,I would wait for PS6 at this point Odds are it will be backwards compatible to PS5 Buy a not too expensive SSD to last over,m8tyebd,7.0,1i8122n

comment,m8wym0y,RedOctobyr,,1,2025-01-24 14:33:14,,,,In my case because I had no need for a PS5 this was 2 or 3 years ago and the SSD was like 80 at the time The change was easy and far cheaper than a PS5 But that was just my situation If someone is already saving up for a PS5 sure for some folks maybe its a waste to update their PS4 But it was a great solution improvement for me,m8wolkf,7.0,1i8122n

comment,m8tztqw,thiefwithsharpteeth,,1,2025-01-24 01:18:01,,,,I had a PS2 slim burn out its optical lens once but that is because I accidentally left it running when I went away for a weekend Somehow my 360 Ive had since 2008 still runs fine but the disc tray motor died and I have to use a paper clip to change discs,m8sxug4,6.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pxytg,RitchieRitch62,,75,2025-01-23 13:32:29,,,,I see no reason to buy the 5 I bought Ragnarok to be forward compatible assuming Id have a reason to buy the ps5 at some point but there are no games I couldnt just buy for PC or PS4 I feel like PlayStation and Xbox are reaching the end of their rope Theres really not that much need or reason for a game to look better than a PS4 game all it does is make the games development longer and more expensive Even Nintendo has struggled to release any real titles for switch in the last few years Hopefully because theyre moving to switch 2 But it does feel like consoles are being phased out,m8punhe,4.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qb28n,docbauies,,65,2025-01-23 14:46:00,,,,Nintendo maxed out switch capabilities Its just underpowered at this point for a lot of stuff If I can play a game on steamdeck I will If its Nintendo its switch But a more powerful switch will definitely help,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qx2f1,Valance23322,,26,2025-01-23 16:33:05,,,,Frankly it was an underpowered piece of crap the day it released Even launch titles like BOTW struggled to run on switch Xenoblade 1 remake ran at sub 360p sub 30fps,m8qb28n,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r1ahd,docbauies,,19,2025-01-23 16:52:12,,,,Right So the devs did what they could with it is my point It can only take them so far But its a handheld that you can easily put on a TV Its not a powerful console that you can also take on the go Priority is handheld and for that for when it was released it was pretty good,m8qx2f1,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8vfu7h,Massive-Exercise4474,,1,2025-01-24 07:03:06,,,,After getting a steamdeck if the switch is as powerful or better it would be huge,m8r1ahd,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8wslsi,docbauies,,1,2025-01-24 14:00:10,,,,Based on the battery size and the anticipated battery life and the physics of power consumption and electronics I have heard that it will not be which is disappointing The switch 2 will still sell massive numbers It is a mass market device and the handheld PCs are much more niche right now People will buy it to play the new Mario and the new Zelda and the new Mario Kart and Animal Crossing and etc etc,m8vfu7h,9.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rlc07,alidan,,-11,2025-01-23 18:23:17,,,,devs decided that they needed to make graphicly impressive games for screenshots that run like hell in practice switch isnt underpowered devs just refuse to work within its limits,m8r1ahd,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rxzuh,will19,,10,2025-01-23 19:21:00,,,,I think there was a reason devs all over reacted the way they did to TotK The big question they all had to the Zelda devs was How It is a seriously impressive feat that game ran as well as it did with the physics of ultrahand alone on a damn switch,m8rlc07,9.0,1i8122n
comment,m8s9hm2,alidan,,0,2025-01-23 20:13:14,,,,in all honesty watching the kind of hate that threat interactive gets from developers who work on graphics engines I would believe developers were more mad that nintendo showed them how to do it right,m8rxzuh,10.0,1i8122n
comment,m8s67mt,ACcbe1986,,2,2025-01-23 19:58:04,,,,When was the last time Nintendo released a co se that wasnt underpowered From my recollection they stopped trying to compete with the powerhouse consoles from Sony and Microsoft a long time ago They focused on being different rather than powerful I havent thought long enough about this so please correct me if I am wrong,m8qx2f1,7.0,1i8122n

comment,m8u79yy,Valance23322,,0,2025-01-24 01:59:06,,,,That doesnt change the performance of the game If it didnt interfere with your enjoyment of the game then good for you but its a fact that it doesnt run well on Switch hardware,m8s90mw,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rbwqc,minkdraggingonfloor,,1,2025-01-23 17:40:58,,,,Still having the equivalent of a slightly more powerful PS3 you can take on the go with 46 hour battery life is extremely impressive especially for 2016,m8qx2f1,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r1r8i,stellvia2016,,8,2025-01-23 16:54:19,,,,I feel like covid stuff set them back because its crazy they squeezed 8 years out of the Switch by the time the 2 comes out Normally a console gen is 7 years,m8qb28n,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8s6y2d,BorKon,,2,2025-01-23 20:01:26,,,,Considering that graphical improvements arent visually groundbreaking anymore for a decade now They can wait with ps6 until ps5 is 10 years old,m8r1r8i,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8sc8ic,stellvia2016,,1,2025-01-23 20:25:54,,,,Considering PS5 sales were better than any previous gen other than PS2 I dont think theyre going to learn that lesson yet Especially if theyre finalizing the chip design right now Expect it right around the 7 year mark,m8s6y2d,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rinzl,None,,1,2025-01-23 18:11:20,,,,steam deck is just better easy to pirate whatever nintendo slop,m8qb28n,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qds9e,RitchieRitch62,,-9,2025-01-23 15:00:01,,,,Massively disagree Nintendo didnt design for switch at all Joycons had motion control and depth detection and that was never used Sure there are some games that couldnt port to the switch but thats not going to be what sells your console games already available to buy on other platforms When you look at how impressive BotW is its clear they could have put other big games on the system It doesnt seem like its actually that valuable to design exclusives for your console anymore its too risky I think A AAA game design in general has become too risky Beyond BotWTotK they really didnt do anything that massive And Id guess TotK took half the team BotW did I think or maybe just hope were going to see a refocusing around game mechanics and gameplay as opposed to graphics and load speeds Especially with games like Balatro being as popular as they are It shouldnt take 3000 people to make a profitable video game,m8qb28n,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qen30,Positive_Parking_954,,4,2025-01-23 15:04:22,,,,I skipped the 4 so between 2 3 and 5 if you have a physical copy of a Playstation game you can play it,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rzqzo,patricksaccount,,3,2025-01-23 19:28:52,,,,As a very casual gamer I wouldnt buy a gaming pc until I can hook it up to my non top of the line tv and not experience any lag The PC itself is already more expensive but now I need a quality monitor desk chair and space to accommodate all of this Theres space in the market for consoles until a PC costs as little as a console does and doesnt occupy any additional space,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8shm0n,RitchieRitch62,,1,2025-01-23 20:50:35,,,,I see this argument a lot from my friends with Xboxes My PC has lasted me almost three console generations and for less than the price of a PS5 I can upgrade it to last another Ive spent less over all than someone whos bought two generations of Xbox and Ive also been able to do 100 times more with my device,m8rzqzo,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8t4m9p,patricksaccount,,2,2025-01-23 22:36:25,,,,Thats a good point When the TV lag isnt a thing I would consider it Currently I cannot justify dropping a ton of money getting a high end tv,m8shm0n,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rjx80,lazerblam,,2,2025-01-23 18:16:58,,,,I bought ps5 and honestly apart from quick loading times and Helldivers 2 its been pretty meh And higher framerate is always nice tbf but hardly any games to justify it gta 6 will deliver though i think,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8ut3jh,lowtoiletsitter,,1,2025-01-24 04:11:49,,,,PS 7 will be out before GTA 6,m8rjx80,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qpmuz,stillaras,,4,2025-01-23 15:58:15,,,,No reason for a game to look better than a ps4 gameHave you even played lets say spiderman remastered vs the ps4 version OR TLOU part1 remake You dont go back from that,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8rrfrh,Roboculon,,2,2025-01-23 18:51:19,,,,As a person with neither pc nor ps Im just shocked how expensive pc components are these days I want to play dragon age and it seems like my options are a 500 PlayStation or a 1000 gaming pc,m8rcv75,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rvjge,ItsdatboyACE,,1,2025-01-23 19:09:50,,,,Agree they do seem to be outrageous expensive Im not extremely into PC hardware and stuff right now there might be some cost effective options but from the outside looking in it seems really expensive to me too Im actually cloud gaming at the moment Using the service Boosteroid 799 a month and Im playing any game in my Steam library max settings yes including PlayStation games,m8rrfrh,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rq98u,stillaras,,3,2025-01-23 18:45:59,,,,Nothing against pc On the contrary I just dont understand the statement about ps4 looking games being enough nowdays,m8rcv75,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rt286,ItsdatboyACE,,2,2025-01-23 18:58:36,,,,Oh yea I agree completely,m8rq98u,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rtltw,ItsdatboyACE,,1,2025-01-23 19:01:01,,,,I guess I was also trying to say though that at a point there is this feeling like owning a particular brand of console isnt necessary because Xbox and PlayStation are both releasing all of their best games everywhere else Xbox games are legitimately everywhere and promoted heavily for cloud gamingand Sony games are available on PCs now and available to cloud if you have the right seevie,m8rq98u,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r0t74,RitchieRitch62,,1,2025-01-23 16:50:02,,,,Ive seen my friends play on ps5 and Im positive I wouldnt notice after an hour of gameplay Maybe my vision isnt great but I think its mostly I dont care Im not examining every texture constantly The only difference Ive noticed between the two is loading screens Not even to mention they butchered Peter in the remake wtf,m8qpmuz,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qe7fx,ExeTcutHiveE,,1,2025-01-23 15:02:09,,,,I bought a steam deck and sealed the deal on the rest of this generation If PS and XBox continue to release PC ports of their games I think a PCSteam Deck combo is the best move going forward,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rlfla,Dick_Lazer,,1,2025-01-23 18:23:44,,,,Yeah if software exclusivity is the only thing consoles have left to offer then it seems the hardware is mostly redundant at this point Ill probably pick up a Switch 2 eventually but PlayStationXbox have pretty much zero appeal to me at this point Tbf I also dont play as many games as I used to,m8qe7fx,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qnvmz,Dapper_Use6099,,1,2025-01-23 15:49:55,,,,Baldurs gate 3 and more importantly especially FF7 Rebirth justify a purchase,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8qr971,orsikbattlehammer,,1,2025-01-23 16:05:58,,,,Back before the series XS released I speculated with my friend we may only get one more gen of Xbox after the series X and they might be able to just completely shift to PCstreaming With hints at an Xbox handheld on the rise I am feeling more and more like this next one could be the last big box But well see in 10 years if Im right,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rf2w5,MrDownhillRacer,,1,2025-01-23 17:55:09,,,,I feel like PlayStation and Xbox are reaching the end of their rope There are rumours that Microsoft wants to get out of the console business and turn Xbox into a gaming service instead of a console Like idk I guess youd boot up the Xbox app on your PC mobile or other console devices and access games that way Whereas Sony is making deals with game studios to get exclusive games some say Microsoft is buying studios with the intention of keeping those games crossplatform because they figure they can make more money selling games for every platform instead of continuing to fight the console war and losing to Sony I think internet connections are going to have to get better for say steaming games to any device to replace consoles I tried Google Stadia when that was a thing and games on that were almost impossible to play due to the lag and freezing And I live in a city There are many many places across North America that have less reliable internet than I do Theyre going to have to run games locally until the infrastructure improves,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8riq51,Hopeful_Chair_7129,,1,2025-01-23 18:11:36,,,,Not gonna lie I bought a ps5 specifically for ff16 and ragnarok and I hated both of them I know they are popular but my fav part of a PlayStation was ps Good variety and it gave me indie games to try and some solid titles,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rkqwd,TheOtherWhiteCastle,,1,2025-01-23 18:20:40,,,,Even Nintendo has struggled to release any real titles for the switch the last few years My brother in Christ Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Wonder were released less than two years ago Not to mention the new Mario Party last October sold like gangbusters They may be slowing down in preparation for Switch 2 but they are by no means struggling to release games,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rv2z5,Vinny933PC,,1,2025-01-23 19:07:46,,,,I wonder how many times its been said theres not really any reason for games to look better than they do today Im sure it was even said about 8 bit arcade games in the 70s and 80s Also a simple 300 console Xbox Series S that can run games like a 1200 PC will always have a market Not to mention their power efficiency and simplicity Sure the OS cant do all the same things a PC can do but it doesnt need to,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8rzq2c,JonTargaryen55,,1,2025-01-23 19:28:45,,,,To each their own but gaming on a 4 sounds horrible This is coming from someone who recently turned their 4 on after having the 5 for 4 years Theres a huge jump from the 4 to the 5 but I dont expect it be that big 56 Enjoy your gaming but just thinking about it hurts me inside,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8tuge0,SwiggyMaster123,,1,2025-01-24 00:49:28,,,,switch had a dull 2024 and that was it and thats arguably because they wanted Switch 2 out the door for 2024 but something came up what that was god and shigeru only knows,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8u5tqt,peppersge,,1,2025-01-24 01:50:48,,,,Game developmental time might shorten if they can change the minimum standard I suspect that things such as dropping raster lighting and forcing ray tracing will be the norm The next generation console might end being marketed more to the developers than the consumers Eventually there might be some evolution of game play maybe advanced AI modeling bullets bouncing more accurate enemy line of sight etc but that is probably going to occur with some pain of raising the minimum specs Consoles also occupy a niche for people for people who just want a device to play battle royale games such as Fortnite Apex Overwatch etc There isnt any online subscription fee for those games Consoles are decently competitive pricewise early on consoles are sold at losseconomy of scale early on and not everyone is going to buy enough games to offset the PC discount In addition not everyone needs to buy a PC the average person probably benefits more from a laptop docking station,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8vfpin,Massive-Exercise4474,,1,2025-01-24 07:01:56,,,,The switch lasted way too long Nintendo saw what happened to Sony and wants to be prepared so theyve taken essentially an extra year or two to have everything ready Unfortunately Donald trump will tariff the switch which will hurt sales,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qyl1x,youzongliu,,-1,2025-01-23 16:40:04,,,,Really But the PS4 graphics are quite outdated though If you play on PC then the graphics should already be better than even the PS6 With the advancements of Unreal Engine and other stuff I dont think itll take much longer to make a goodlooking game nowadays,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r0g2k,RitchieRitch62,,2,2025-01-23 16:48:25,,,,I play on PC and tbh PS4 games look better than a lot of the other games on PC Uncharted 4 is still top of my list I really think the difference between PS4 and current gen graphics is extremely diminishing returns I dont care if its super high res or photorealistic I want it to look good I cant imagine god of war being in 8k would affect my enjoyment of it,m8qyl1x,6.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r3iyc,youzongliu,,2,2025-01-23 17:02:20,,,,I mean whether it affects enjoyment or not its a different discussion but the graphical difference is huge between PC and console Like you said PC is already close to photorealistic Of course it depends on the game but for a game like GTA my enjoyment would be much much higher if its photorealistic,m8r0g2k,7.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r5q89,RitchieRitch62,,1,2025-01-23 17:12:30,,,,It just seems to me like if Im a game development company the effort I put into graphical improvements are going to have less impact on game success than people like to believe I think if you released God of War today it would still be very popular even if people are commenting on it having outdated graphics,m8r3iyc,8.0,1i8122n
comment,m8raiw6,youzongliu,,1,2025-01-23 17:34:40,,,,Well game substance will most likely be more important than graphics But I think the point is to always improve whether its game mechanics story or graphics At least with better technology the graphics should always be getting better Of course God of War would still be a good game today but if today they released both the first God of War and a new God of War game with photorealistic graphics with just as good gameplay then I think the latter would sell way more,m8r5q89,9.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r07sf,blazelet,,0,2025-01-23 16:47:23,,,,We bought a PS5 close to when they came out It has mostly sat there collecting dust Thats with a 12 15 and 22 year old They just have other interests than consoles From my perspective as a parent it has been a nightmare The account security on it constantly locks my daughter out of the one game she sometimes plays Somehow two factor authentication is all the sudden on the master account mine which I didnt set up so Im locked out Things that used to be incredibly basic like online multiplayer increasingly now needs a subscription Its too much of a headache,m8pxytg,5.0,1i8122n

comment,m8q59ue,stormblaz,,31,2025-01-23 14:14:37,,,,Ps5 has like 5 exclusives not on pc if not less I dont see a point when game dev time are 5 years and system lifes are 78 at MOST There is only a limited handful of studios willing to do exclusives not on PC Itsnot looking so hot but I do admit console has a place sure a 400 console is hard to match with a 400 new pc of similar quality but Intel Arc changed that heavily so now its not really that bad Consoles are going to struggle gaining capital if the dev times keep piling We need to find ways of reducing dev times Nintendo doesnt capitalize on ultra HD assets and full fledged movies in games so their dev time is very quick and efficient which ensures switches sell due to large selection of games and practically non on PC its a very smart move Make a modular ps6 let me swap the cpu gpu and upgrade as I go honestly,m8pofoc,2.0,1i8122n

comment,m8qw7er,unskilledplay,,1,2025-01-23 16:29:06,,,,I think this gen will have a surprisingly short lead time The dominant engine used to make games Unreal Engine is now at version 5 While the prior generation consoles were well optimized for Unreal Engine 4 current consoles are struggling with Unreal Engine 5 It doesnt scale down to current hardware well Hundreds of games are being developed on UE5 today Many of the ones already released are scaled back so much that they dont look any better than UE4 but run slower Consoles struggle so much with UE5 you can think of them as next gen games that are released on current gen with severely compromised performance When the next console comes out it will be able to run current gen games properly and I think that will be a big selling point,m8pzgvx,3.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pyd4r,VanillaSoftArtist,,4,2025-01-23 13:34:52,,,,The PS3 got some crossplatform titles until 2017 maybe outside of the odd sports entry The only exclusive off the top of my head to release that late in the west was Persona 5 2016 JP 2017 elsewhere GTA Online also got its last major update around 2015 or 2016 when the PC version launched Early 2017 is just over ten years after the PS3 launched PS4 is now just over eleven years old We must keep in mind that its easier to make crosscompatible titles now No longer is there a need to code for the complicated and unrewarding in most cases CELL architecture Every console has the same x86 basis and with games being so expensive publishers would prefer to squeeze money from the larger eighth generation crowd,m8ps246,2.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qy8ig,Willlll,,2,2025-01-23 16:38:30,,,,Yeah I get that To me it feels like this generation started late because so many games were clearly PS4 games with frills added instead of PS5 games that were nerfed for the PS4 version,m8pyd4r,3.0,1i8122n
comment,m8r202u,VanillaSoftArtist,,2,2025-01-23 16:55:25,,,,It feels like it started late but it feels like production began too early Nobody was ready for the absolute scalping that would happen in 2020 and there were few games that couldnt have been done decently on the previous generation Whereas with PS3 and PS4 the jump is there Most PS3 software runs at 720p and much of it runs even less around 560p And still has the nerve to lag like Sonic Unleashed Many PS4 games can at least hit 30 consistently around 720p or higher I feel PS5 and Series X shouldve been delayed to early 2022 Probably not the smartest move Im sure it wouldve been a lot of money to swallow but more people wouldve had the chance of getting them Especially since 2020 and 2021 were already suffering with chip shortages It was the perfect storm,m8qy8ig,4.0,1i8122n
comment,m8s2b54,hans_l,,3,2025-01-23 19:40:23,,,,PS4 wasnt fully backward compatible If a game doesnt need the capabilities of a PS5 I dont see why they should be exclusive I would expect the same if the PS6 is backward compatible with PS4 well see PS4 releases into PS6 life cycle and thats fine There are still PC games releasing whose minimum requirements are 10 years old Nothing wrong with that,m8ps246,2.0,1i8122n

comment,m8q4n6s,JordanDoesTV,,1,2025-01-23 14:11:06,,,,Honestly this generation has kinda sucked as a whole On Sonys side with almost all of PlayStations 13 live service games announced for the future being bad or cancelled I dont really know what their future looks like at all besides Wolverine and that new Naughty Dog game which has to be like 23 years out As for Xbox theyll literally never be able to catch Sony unless they majorly fuck up on price again Even then with their digital library ecosystem it would be hard But theyre trying to play a whole different game now with their exclusives coming to other consoles I think the Activision Blizzard deal hurt the brand but will see the money flow in Nintendo Switch 2 will be old hardware and will still sell regardless I have used my own Switch since like 2021 because Im tired of how ugly most games look so Ill still probably get one and finally play Years of the Kingdom I hope that the next Steam Deck has a really good dock to tv because personally I dont like handheld gaming but I want those Steam deals,m8pkj5o,1.0,1i8122n

comment,m8szbnp,Fredasa,,1,2025-01-23 22:10:52,,,,I was 5050 on whether the next Playstation would be a Steamdeck clone or theyd give it one last hurrah Nvidia dropping the GPU ball and essentially stifling PC gaming growth for the foreseeable future is really all the green light Sony needs I basically see it this way Core consoles were on the way out due to the steadily encroaching embarrassment of being the 30fps andor 1440p platform which PC would then serve up in proper 4K60 One look at Capcoms salesperplatform pie chart is all the evidence one needs for that But AI providing fake details especially now in the interpolation department has shifted that reality The new reality is that PS6 will probably give the same performance as what you can get on PC and the new downside is that you get the added latency and shitty artifacts of framegen which are not merely more subtle than a lower resolution or halved framerate but literally below the threshold of identification for the typical console user Anyone can design a 4K120 game if the entire dev landscape is going to be leaning on framegen And console users are sure not going to be the first ones to gripe about AI artifacts or latency I really hate the direction this is all going But it does mean the likes of Playstation gets to stick around a while longer before going portable and making their own PCcompatible Gamepass clone,m8pkj5o,1.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pob35,dertechie,,20,2025-01-23 12:28:31,,,,The Series S was supposed to be that price pressure but the monkeys paw curled with the requirement for feature parity on a console with much worse specs Im not expecting PS5 Pro pricing here Im expecting 500600 650 if we have a bunch of tariffs running around when it launches Depends on how hard they go on the specs Unfortunately Microsoft doesnt have great options for price pressure They arent Nintendo they cant roll with a cheaper console with lower specs and lean on the best exclusive IP lineup in the industry Honestly of the big three MS have the worst lineup of exclusives Their core audience expects them to meet the PS6 head on They expect the new Xbox to at least roughly match the PS6 in hardware specs so games are of similar quality across the flagship versions of the two consoles It could go with less powerful hardware for a cheaper console as it did with the S but I wonder how much of a reputation hit it would take for falling behind on specs The other option is running the console as a loss leader and making it up in software Companies are a lot more hesitant to do this now for multiple reasons,m8pi7er,2.0,1i8122n

comment,m8prl43,noeagle77,,310,2025-01-23 12:51:46,,,,This generation ps5 seems very different than the rest The unavailability of the console for the first year or so combined with the lack of any new games that were exclusively made for the new generation make this console feel like its still in its infancy and that it has yet to really realize its full potential Previous console generations came out big with generational leaps in terms of graphics or game size and many other features that made it THE system to have while the previous generation would have had a slowdown of games made for it until it was obsolete fairly quickly This generation the previous generation consoles got the exact same games with the same features except for one or two things to separate them from current gen console versions,,0.0,1i8122n
comment,m8qo16p,code____sloth,,53,2025-01-23 15:50:40,,,,covid i think kicked a lot of stuff that was already happening into high gear the corporatization of gaming has been well underway but ever since the covidinduced spike in supply chain costs everyone is just taking the mask off and turning gaming into a financefirst industry just like everything else is now Diablo 4 is indistinguishable from any of those mobile slop shovelware games where you buy gems with real money and then there was that article from the other day discussing industry rumblings that publishers are hoping GTA 6 launches at 80 100 so they can break the seal for everyone else to raise their prices again stinky,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m8vvzr3,Waffleskater8,,1,2025-01-24 09:45:01,,,,Do they not realize GTA 6 is probably the only game most people would spend 100 on at launch day to buy its the exception not the standard Most games arent worth it at launch anymore and a lot of people have a backlog or patience to wait for the price to drop on games just an opinion of an idiot myself though,m8qo16p,2.0,1i8122n
comment,m8wygpw,code____sloth,,1,2025-01-24 14:32:25,,,,yep same were never going to see the true math of how much game development costs because they never factor in digital sales and how much money that saves them in manufacturing and shipping costs over physical copies and how much money most publishers save by selling through their own storefronts and not having to give retailers a cut I have a feeling that for most publishers gaming is more profitable now than at any point in history barring a few exceptions for overfunded flops like concord So I think its nothing more than price gouging and i refuse to participate,m8vvzr3,3.0,1i8122n

comment,m8rxvy9,MrWaffler,,1,2025-01-23 19:20:31,,,,Chip design is a starting point for the product You cant begin any other considerations except mayyyyybe some concept design shells until then The components determine power budgets and cooling solutions which in turn determine physical characteristics for thermals and layout So this is still years out but Im not sure many who arent big in the PC space realize the insane power of AMDs 3D V Cache tech Intel cant come close and AMD does it cheaper AND with a lower power draw For modern games you hit one of two walls of performance usually VRAM limits or RAM limits for VRAM its more about capacity and for RAM its more about access speed that is the fact your CPU needs to do work to read from RAM and that work can reduce the available power for other computation aka your game AMD did some clever fuckery and stapled a HUGE fast access cache buffer onto their gaming focused chips as a result they are worse performing in multi threaded high impact workloads however almost nobody does that kind of workload especially gamers So at the cost of slower workloads like CPU rendering or nonGPU calculations you receive a large amount of extremely fast access memory for the CPU and since thats the bit games struggle with games almost by their nature cannot take good advantage of multithreading it results in by far the best gaming CPU on the market Its so good that the number one top performer by a mile is the 9800X3D their most recent The SECOND best performer still comfortably ahead of other options The 7800X3D the old model lol 3D Vcache is a huge plus to the console gaming community because unlike ray tracing or frame generation gimmicks its a tangible and direct massive benefit for many games natively If you want to see how wild it is look up some comparison videos of Escape from Tarkov a famously unoptimized CPU bound mess of a game Before the recent wipe which fucked everything super hard my wife got a 7800X3D and I trialed tarkov on it with my GPU and I more than doubled my FPS even on the biggest most difficult to run map And her CPU cost LESS than the 13900k And it uses less power and thus runs cooler Im glad theyre expanding their tech and dominance in gaming I just hope it means Intel follows suit,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m8smkxz,noother10,,1,2025-01-23 21:12:57,,,,It didnt help that a lot of Sony published games have flopped hard they missed with almost everything and even when they didnt miss they still screwed up The suits have been ruining gaming for quite some time now trying to minmax getting money out of a game whether its MTX passes putting hard limits on devs timeresources wise etc They also try to minmax the audience size for a game which ends up making it generic slop that no one is interested in Its why Im still a PC gamer AAAAA games are mostly crap but the insane amount of great indie games is where gaming is at now You have teams of 110 people putting out awesome titles that are worth the time and money games made by people who play games games made by people whore passionate games made for fun rather than minmaxing money,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m8swfbz,oandakid718,,1,2025-01-23 21:57:24,,,,I think this generation has been a mix of perfect timing between Covid and inflation a lot of people taking up PC gaming for the first time and the lack of hype for any console exclusives since the consoles release In the past the great debate was always PC vs console but now that more people have seen the light now that 144 hz monitors exist and are more common and the general popularity of PC games among the youth has risen the great debate has finally been solved and now people are adopting PC gaming in droves,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m8vl40j,Loldimorti,,1,2025-01-24 07:53:20,,,,Honestly I think one factor is that people somehow still expect to get PS2 era leaps in graphics and game design when in reality 3D gaming has matured quite a bit We wont get another Halo or Goldeneye that completely revolutionizes how shooters on console work for example Devs have figured out what works well while ago They have figured out 3D graphics as well Visual uplifts are minor at this point Gotta get an RTX 4090 or 50 series GPU for games to actually look noticably better for the average person Thats something that wont be feasable on console until PS6 And will it be enough for people to consider it a generational leap Idk Sony tried to create new avenues with VR twice but it didnt take off and thus for them isnt worth dumping AAA budgets into Nintendo took a super safe bet with Switch 2 first time I believe they actually just slapped a 2 on a successor console but at least on the handheld market there is still room for growth as the base visual experience is still one or two generations behind So going from slightly PS3 to PS4 level graphics still is a fairly decent leap,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m91arjf,Rockthe99,,1,2025-01-25 03:40:52,,,,Whos to say the new generation will have a bunch of exclusives I think the issue is most of the games COULD run on the old systems so whats the point to buy a new system Older generations the games would not work in older systems and so they would force gamers to buy the new system to play the new games For like the 1st 2 years of this generation it seemed all games would work on ps4 and ps5 So there was no need to upgrade if you didnt want to,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n
comment,m967xil,Crater_Animator,,1,2025-01-25 23:00:56,,,,The performance leaps between the base PS5 and PS4 pro are still very big I dont know where it goes from here tho personally I consider PS5 peak performance above that its incremental change unless we can get top tech for super cheap,m8prl43,1.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pt9he,xcassets,,1,2025-01-23 13:02:59,,,,Not necessarily Astro Bot was 3 years allin Before you say it was built off of Astros Playroom that took less than 2 years to make And that was built off of Astro Bot Rescue Mission which also took less than 2 years to make My point is yes a specific type of AAA game takes 5 years to make But not every game has to be a sprawling open world RPG with 200 hours of content A humble platformer won GOTY because it was fun Nintendo knows this which is how they are able to churn out so many firstpartyexlusive titles in a single generation,m8ppc6r,4.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pmtq5,NuPNua,,-6,2025-01-23 12:17:28,,,,I mean I dont have a PS5 so I am speaking from the Series X experience and the last several games I completed were all current gen exclusives and they looked the part too I do agree theres less than there were on prior gens but thats the nature of the market and economy these days due to Dev time and costs We need to start thinking of consoles like other tech where theyre upgrades which let you run software better each time rather than a whole new platform,m8pmezz,3.0,1i8122n

comment,m8pogov,TotoCocoAndBeaks,,22,2025-01-23 12:29:41,,,,Its just a bit strange as the PS5 is relatively speaking much better than previous generations It still holds up as a very good device Games run smoothly you never get the old PC feel and bare in mind I have a top end gaming PC also At this stage on the PS4 performance was absolutely miserable with poor frame rates on all releases and even the UI often getting lagging and requiring one to rebuild database from time to time just so the whole thing wouldnt feel sluggish,m8ph1nr,2.0,1i8122n

comment,m8przh5,OsmeOxys,,6,2025-01-23 12:54:26,,,,Used to be that the hardware developers would need years to tweak their custom silicon and boards Game developers would need to learn and write a lot of code unique for each system and couldnt really even start to develop much until after dev kits were released Thats what takes time and it was an art all of its own The move to x86 changed the formula a lot Consoles now are more of a PC form factor with a TV friendly interface Everything is streamlined and the complexity in putting together a console has never been lower The guts are essentially reworked offtheshelf computers and the custom silicon is instead a built to order SKU of the same CPU you have in your desktop Plop er in and theyre done Game developers can develop the games on PC make since relatively minor tweaks for APIs and such and if theyre feeling generous optimize a few things to take advantage of more CPU cache or an extra core Theres no need for years of lag time anymore If they really wanted to I cant think of any technical reason they couldnt release the PS6 this year Though if I had to guess Id think more like mid2026 to 2027 for the sake of having exclusive release titles and building up hype Or I could be totally off and itll be 202829 but my point is that its a business decision rather than a technical one at this point,m8ph8vc,2.0,1i8122n
comment,m8psy15,demonsta500,,4,2025-01-23 13:00:52,,,,You forget that Sony does its own customizations on top of the existing AMD tech Like the storage controller on the PS5 that allows them to have super fast IO along with on the fly compressiondecompression for cheap So its not just pick up AMD processor from Newegg and plop it onto a motherboard PSSR is gonna be one of the main focuses so 100 Sony will have some custom hardware for it in PS6 And then theres the controller and the console box design itself None of that is so trivial that they can just shit one out in under a year,m8przh5,3.0,1i8122n
comment,m8pzpxg,OsmeOxys,,1,2025-01-23 13:42:50,,,,Thats all mundane hardware though Not that it isnt great or to belittledownplay the genuine engineering that goes into it just that the tedious parts have been streamlined out with existing off the shelf circuits and tweaked custom variations of existing components can be made to order 10 or even 5 years ago would have been a lot more limiting in tippy top performing yet affordable ICs but its wild what even us peasants can just order off mouser And it would be wild to me if something like PSSR isnt just integrated into the CPU Its something that needs to be working in unison with whats pumping out the frames and anything else would likely be a very expensive and pointless move if theyre already using customized AMD SKUs Especially given that effectively identical tech is already integrated straight from AMD regardless I wouldnt be surprised if theres some actual custom silicon somewhere doing something but nothing wild or that wouldnt be figured out before the CPU is finalized That said Id be curious in hearing an explanation of why they would roll their own silicon rather than integrating it I do love me some custom silicon tales but I just dont see where the benefit would be And then theres the controller and the console box design itself I mean Thats just aesthetics though 90 of the design time is bouncing between middle managers wanting a slightly different shade of black or a 495 degree bevel instead of a 512 degree one Controllers are pretty much perfected as it is so theyll play with aestheticsfeel a bit and maybe theyll add in a gimmick or two but they know they already have exactly what players want Plus its not like theyre going to wait until the hardware is done before they start sketching up ideas These have probably been waiting at 95 for a good while already,m8psy15,4.0,1i8122n

comment,m8u7ij4,OsmeOxys,,1,2025-01-24 02:00:31,,,,PS5 still has a fair bit of custom silicon to get high performance at a low price like the ssd controller that the other person who responded mentioned If you were into tech at the time think back on SSDs in 2015 Beat the hell out of harddrives sure but decent control ICs were still pretty damn expensive and an absolute joke compared to today 10 years later its largely the NAND itself that costs money and a cheap ssd will shoot out 6gbs of data like its nothing 10gbs for a decent but still shockingly inexpensive drive Cost and performance has already been optimized to hell and back The same applies to tons of inexpensive offtheshelf components now and aside from raw processing power are generally more capable than the average person can even notice let alone appreciate Its also pretty fair to call a tweaked CPU design custom silicon and yeah thatll still take a good amount of time to work with AMD for But if the PS6s CPU is already being finalized they clearly didnt just start working on it so why would anyone expect it to be 4 more years TLDR I guess Im really really over complicating this by gabbing on about how mind blowing tech is right now Like the headline says the processor is being finalized and thats kind of the whole thing All the supporting components are laid out well beforehand and tweaked as needed,m8tzml1,4.0,1i8122n

comment,m8poz8j,Shinagami091,,2,2025-01-23 12:33:26,,,,One thing you probably dont understand about console design is that theres a ton of RD involved Once you get the chipset designed then you have to develop the software to run it Then you create dev models which you then provide to software developers so they can begin making games for it which can take years All of this is to say we are a long ways off before we will see the launch of the next PlayStation Late 2027 would likely be the soonest,m8pfvle,1.0,1i8122n

comment,m8ssy7j,Remic75,,9,2025-01-23 21:41:47,,,,Most of the PS5 catalog of games are the yearly sport games Call of Duty and PS4 games PS5 still feels like next gen than it does current gen simply because 1 the PS4 is still being produced and sold Its been 12 years now and Sony STILL produces the PS4 and PS4 Pro which is crazy For perspective the PS3 had 10 years 2 AAA games are still being made for the PS4 with only a little bit of games being exclusively made on PS5 3 PS5 still has good hardware for the money You can certainly build PCs that run better but it definitely doesnt have underpowered hardware like the PS4 when it first released 4 Most games require you to pay the extra 10 if you owned it on PS4 just so you can get slightly better fidelity 5 Pandemic and scalping made it super hard to get it for the first 23 years It wasnt until the last year or two that Ive seen the list of my PS friends go from 4 to 5 It feels like Ive had my PS5 for only two years when I actually had it for four Weve had a handful of titles that are pretty damn good on PS5 but were already almost halfway through the console cycle and already have a PS5 Pro yet a PS6 set to be discussed in a few years Lmao whats the rush Most games feel like the 500 I paid for was to play the PS4 games I had in 60fps,,0.0,1i8122n

comment,m8s5fli,action_turtle,,2,2025-01-23 19:54:30,,,,I think this is my jumping off point Consoles since the master system basically owned all of them and at this point my sim rig runs a 4090 so I may as well just figure out some optical cable set up and run it to my TV Upgrade that to a 6090 when the time comes and just draw a line under it Sony games will come to PC just have to wait a while which doesnt bother me,,0.0,1i8122n

comment,m8wjxgm,IamtheMooseKing,,1,2025-01-24 13:08:29,,,,Im a console gamer Also a pc gamer This current generation of consoles is my last Spending likely upwards of 700 for whatever MS or Sony develops feels absurd to me If you can spend 700 lets say on a console you can save the additional 300500 and build a pc that is a more future proofed piece of tech Upgrading incrementally over time Not bashing consoles in the least I play my Series X and Switch often My point is that the gap in cost from a console to pc gaming is very small PC gaming mind you at a respectable level where you arent downgrading in performance from either an XBOX or PS Im not a PC specialist either but currently have a rig that feels and performs great first build Really just a dude sharing his first hand experience and thoughts during a Teams meeting Have a great weekend everyone EDIT shared this thought as I read a few other comments talking about console prices alone during this current gen and what the future likely brings,,0.0,1i8122n

comment,m93pi0w,Noeyiax,,1,2025-01-25 15:32:05,,,,PlayStation is cooked they dont understand they lost the gaming market to SteamValve PC They should just make a PSN launcher and app store exclusive for PC They can continue to sell peripherals for PC Making a console was novel but literally it was only marginal gains since PS3 compared to PCmobile little games no developers high fees for entry SDK bad deals and just really stubborn pride PSN could be a reason for amazing connections of an actual gaming social platform if they transform it the right way let gamers be gamers Imagine if PSN has a social media app connected with the PC client they could rival SteamValve but choose not to and stay on closed market share of console Most people I know already sold the PS5 because barely any good games PlayStation should hire me D if AMD stifles performance of nextgen architecture because of console exclusives that would be dumb to sink with Sony lol If that also happens I hope a new competitor for CPU not Intel emerges,,0.0,1i8122n

comment,mdfwkpx,ooombasa,,1,2025-02-18 15:24:16,,,,Cache is the most expensive thing on a chip and its one of those things that once locked in on a console you can never back out of else you can kiss BC goodbye especially how BC is handled on PS A lot of 3D cache is going to be stupidly expensive and it means whatever number they settle on all future hardware will need to include at least that much to ensure BC doesnt fuck up As such the costs and future considerations makes a 3D cache decision a very tricky one However Cerny some months back talked about how he was surprised by the number of 60FPS titles this gen and that focus by developers may influence where they go next Thats perhaps a hint that next time theyll focus more on CPU given how its usually the GPU that is always given the main focus which may include giving the CPU a healthy amount of cache this time so it can reach its full potential current console use an extremely stripped back Zen 2 removing most of its cache All depends on what is afforded by the silicon budget Raster is no longer gonna be the focus so if the GPU gets bigger itll be to accomodate ML upscaling and ray tracing That may leave the CPU with more wiggle room to include more cache than usual for a console design,,0.0,1i8122n
