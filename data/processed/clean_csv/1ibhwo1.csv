comment,m9jjv22,gimmiesnacks,,80,2025-01-27 23:24:52,,,,The Quality Control department was probably laid off due to not being a revenue generating team This is 2025 America where we prioritize stock buybacks over quality products,m9j8xp3,1.0,1ibhwo1

comment,m9rvm2d,Fat_cat_syndicate,,2,2025-01-29 05:05:17,,,,Agreed I have consistently had pixel phones since the pixel 1 Im sick of feeling like buying a pixel I keep needing to name compromises on either hardware or software My Bluetooth is bugged and consistently crashes audio connections Dealing with warranty on this has been not encouraging to say the least,m9j9icl,2.0,1ibhwo1

comment,m9mv2q6,471b32,,2,2025-01-28 13:48:09,,,,Yeah from what I found Goggle actually makes the highest rated phones on a number of factors The person above you having 4 bad phones out of the 40 million sold is fine for them making a buying decision but isnt exactly a robust study of Googles QA The article is also talking about 2 phones out of how ever many are sold is just click bait at this point,m9mbl17,2.0,1ibhwo1

comment,m9ztffv,jherrm17,,1,2025-01-30 11:43:42,,,,With the exception of the OG Pixel and Pixel 2 Im pretty sure every other pixel had quality control issues Just hand over the hardware to Samsung and provide a clean Pixel UI,,0.0,1ibhwo1

comment,m9nwgls,JimmyScriggs,,0,2025-01-28 16:57:12,,,,The 7 broke me Android auto would not stay connected and had to be reset over and over That was the fin straw I had hoped the 8 would fix that but it was identical and out the window Pixel went,m9lxs7x,2.0,1ibhwo1

comment,m9lid9a,TooStrangeForWeird,,0,2025-01-28 06:32:44,,,,This is why I just went with Motorola Solid build quality not nearly as expensive as a bloatware filled Samsung that barely performs better in real world usage either Which is disappointing I loved my OG Pixel XL,,0.0,1ibhwo1
comment,m9nc2f6,IamChwisss,,0,2025-01-28 15:20:28,,,,The pixel pro is on the lower end of premium phones You get what you pay for I have a 9 pro but only because they offered me 550 for my 7 pro on a trade in On top of the 150 sale they already had on the 9pro So I got my new phone for about 300 Im playing the hardware lottery sure But I pay insurance on the phone for a reason and Im not coughing up half a mortgage for an iPhone,,0.0,1ibhwo1
