comment,n6hbwmw,BottAndPaid,,6,2025-08-02 05:29:12,,,,Ya the debris ending up in the fold or dust slowly causing the factory screen protector to raise off the screen are the pain points I had a galaxy fold gen2 and I absolutely loved it but it only lasted about a year before the screen started getting all the usual problems The tech is very cool but massive increases on quality control need to be addressed,n6h3yr8,4.0,1mcqhxy

comment,n5vuawg,Cheesemasterer,,18,2025-07-29 23:16:08,,,,Actually as someone with a foldable phone i gotta say theyre really nice They fit in your pocket a lot better and im less worried about breaking the screen since my phone is folded in half a lot of the time so if it falls it will only fall on the case I bought it because i thought it was a fun gimmick but ive come to really love it,n5vsynj,1.0,1mcqhxy

comment,n6htldt,Combat_Armor_Dougram,,3,2025-08-02 08:14:14,,,,Personally I feel like a foldable is either an awkward phone or an awkward tablet I cant see any form factor that can combine a decentsized phone with a decentsized tablet without some sort of drawback,n6hjzk0,2.0,1mcqhxy

comment,n6i3sde,SUPRVLLAN,,4,2025-08-02 09:58:04,,,,Folding is how you turn a smartphone into a tablet People like both those things but dont like carrying two separate devices Theres absolutely nothing gimmicky about it if you think about it for more than 5 seconds or those who use iPads more than phones Sounds like it has a point then right Do you remember when people mocked the iPad because it was just a big iPod Touch AirPods Why would I need an Apple Watch when I have a phone in my pocket You guys are wrong about this new stuff over and over it all goes on to be wildly successful Except AVP lol,n6i28z4,3.0,1mcqhxy

comment,n6ow5c4,Pkittens,,1,2025-08-03 13:26:20,,,,You think the experience of looking at foldable dinged up plastic display thats got scratches everywhere youve touched it looks great You reckon the average Apple user would be satisfied with a display that looks bad at all times and increasingly worse over time because their phone can fold awkwardly The tech required to make a foldable phone that isnt dogshit does not exist and will not exist next year either,n6ovacp,4.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6owg7s,Flipslips,,1,2025-08-03 13:28:06,,,,Ive had a foldable for a year now and I only have super minor dings Like I cant even see them unless Im looking My old iPhone had more scratches lol The crease is a non issue as well Regardless people will pay money to have a tablet that will fit in their pocket,n6ow5c4,5.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oxadp,Pkittens,,1,2025-08-03 13:33:01,,,,Yes your eyes have learnt to ignore all the scratches in your shitty plastic display Out of the 12 billion phones sold 2024 17 million of them were foldable Thats a whopping 15 of people who want to pay money for a bad phone that folds,n6owg7s,6.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oxy5r,Flipslips,,1,2025-08-03 13:36:54,,,,What a shortsighted comment lmfao Just like any phone there are trade offs My iPhone cant do any multi tasking My pixel fold can I value that over some plastic dings that you cant even see unless the light hits it right Dont forget that Samsung does free screen protector replacements For the first year and then 20 after that Compared to hundreds of dollars to replace an iPhone screen,n6oxadp,7.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oy6w2,Pkittens,,1,2025-08-03 13:38:21,,,,Yeah I wonder why they feel the need to offer free screen replacements Since its dingy bullshit almost immediately And multitasking has nothing to do with your phone being foldable,n6oxy5r,8.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oycvq,Flipslips,,1,2025-08-03 13:39:18,,,,It doesnt Why doesnt multitasking have anything to do with it A tablet doesnt have anything to do with multitasking Its only the screen protector that gets dinged not the screen itself,n6oy6w2,9.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oz7b2,Pkittens,,1,2025-08-03 13:44:09,,,,You answered your own question there buddy Nonfoldable android devices can multitask whereby the foldable aspect of your phone has nothing to do with multitasking Yes a protector that gets dinged up and scratched to shit so much so that you get a free replacement once When in reality you should be owed a free replacement 20 times,n6oycvq,10.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6ozvsz,Flipslips,,1,2025-08-03 13:47:57,,,,Dynamic island is a worse screen disruption than any dings on my foldable lmfao What an ignorant person You really dont think 2 full size phone screens is any good for multi tasking Youve got to be trolling lol,n6oz7b2,11.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6p0n3u,Pkittens,,1,2025-08-03 13:52:13,,,,Of course it helps Im not saying it doesnt Youre trying to posit that only foldable devices can multitask Which is obviously not true Any modern tablet can So the foldable feature has nothing to do with the multitasking capability If youre trying to say that its easier to multitask with a big screen then youre saying something that doesnt need to be said Oh really Having a big screen makes it easier to see more things at once What an insightful take thanks for sharing it,n6ozvsz,12.0,1mcqhxy

comment,n6hqe5i,AncestralSpirit,,-6,2025-08-02 07:43:08,,,,I say this every time the date of 2026 is mentioned Why on earth would they release a brand new flagship only 9 years after iPhone X came out In 2027 it will be iPhone 20 anniversary Wouldnt it make more sense to release it in 2027 as opposed to 2026 Not to mention they just changed a bit the form factor of iPhone 17 Pro and new iPhone 17 Air will technically not yet released but still 2027 sounds more logical for new flashship exactly 10 years after iPhone X and 20 years after original iPhone,,0.0,1mcqhxy
comment,n6oufvf,Flipslips,,1,2025-08-03 13:16:06,,,,Because they are already 6 years behind the foldable trend and they are getting much more popular I waited to see if an Apple fold would come out this year but they are not so they lost me to the Pixel fold,n6hqe5i,1.0,1mcqhxy
