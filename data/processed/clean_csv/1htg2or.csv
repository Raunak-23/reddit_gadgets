comment,m5ezpef,a_guy_named_max,,27,2025-01-04 21:24:57,,,,I recall watching a video the other day and there are some chip manufacturers that make x86 chips for commercial and industrial devices but they are based on older ones like 486 So not high power ones but still x86 based,m5ep9dg,4.0,1htg2or
comment,m5f02pg,NorysStorys,,26,2025-01-04 21:26:56,,,,A big part of that is because x86 licensing is a mess Base x86 is intels but if you want 64bit x86 then you also have to pay AMD because they made the 64bit instruction set for x86 Very late edit the x86_64 patents only expired in 2021 so its mostly due to the fact that for 20 years nobody has been able to easily license the platform and by now ARM and RISC have so much more investment from parties that are not AMD and Intel that it does not make sense to switch now,m5ezpef,5.0,1htg2or

comment,m5t5og3,mauricioszabo,,1,2025-01-07 02:45:17,,,,Also if I might add theres the official instruction set for x86 and amd64 and theres the undocumented X86 instruction set I remember I once read an article about a CPU manufacturer that tried to build an inhouse version of a x86 CPU and the article complained about how these undocumented instructions were actually used in lots of places especially on Microsoft products Which basically means even if someone would make a x86 compatible CPU said CPU would need to implement the unknown opcodes exactly the same as Intel,m5f02pg,6.0,1htg2or

comment,m5oca7m,cafk,,1,2025-01-06 10:02:05,,,,Theyre licensed from Via no new extension or IP is owned by the Chinese subsidiary especially after Via sold their x86 design subsidiary Centaur Technologies to Intel Its identical with Hygon with design happening by AMD tailored for the Chinese market and manufactured by Global Foundries Zhaoxin is 49 owned by AMD and they have no IP to x86_64,m5fwesq,5.0,1htg2or

comment,m5e78xh,ThinkExtension2328,,18,2025-01-04 18:53:32,,,,Yea it will just the manufacturer gets to keep the cut your not getting any discounts lad,m5dhpj5,1.0,1htg2or
comment,m5fezx8,RetailBuck,,5,2025-01-04 22:48:38,,,,This is a common misconception The manufacturer usually doesnt take ALL the cut Theyll take most but there will be a new lower balance point to make it more attractive than ARM to consumers Pricing is really complicated I worked for a company where it fluctuated a lot We usually didnt take all the savings because we wanted sales Side note this is kinda the justification of Trump tariffs Short term there will be a split Manufacturers wont pass it all on and consumers wont take it all so theyll be a balance that is worse for everybody except Uncle Sam who gets the full amount We dont know where that is but its not 0 like conservatives think and not 15 like liberals think,m5e78xh,2.0,1htg2or
comment,m5gpxua,Schnort,,5,2025-01-05 03:19:00,,,,while it doesnt require the ARM tax itll require a licensing fee to whomever developed the processor implementation SiFive for example is taking their cut And even then the ARM tax is only 13 of the price of the SoC which a couple of dollars of the cost of the laptop,m5dhpj5,1.0,1htg2or

comment,m5gzoa5,xSmallDeadGuyx,,3,2025-01-05 04:20:22,,,,From what I read Arm gives discounts on architecture licenses to smaller firms to get them into the Arm ecosystem Qualcomm bought one of these smaller firms to try and get a cheapo architecture license instead of paying full price but the discounted license is specifically not transferable Qualcomm were being the sneaky ones not Arm,m5f7sn7,2.0,1htg2or

comment,m5iphnr,adzy2k6,,3,2025-01-05 13:40:07,,,,Not for the processor itself RISCV just defines an instruction set The idea is that companies develop their own implementations of the ISA but they should be compatible with each other assuming the same extensions etc The same compilers should work for them all etc ARM is similar but they also license processor designs as well as licensing the instruction set,m5g9kmc,3.0,1htg2or
comment,m5jhkv5,pak9rabid,,2,2025-01-05 16:28:03,,,,Internally most modern x86 implementations are RISC with an x86compatible interface that decodes and transforms x86 instructions via microcode to RISC code at execution time,m5dbmfr,2.0,1htg2or

comment,m5dngfk,Riversntallbuildings,,13,2025-01-04 17:11:07,,,,Call me when RISCV can run Windows or MacOS Or at least Android or iOS Ubuntu is never going to replace the consumer OSs At least not for computers It might be interesting for Appliance Style computing Items that are specifically designed for specific functions like streaming devices DVRs or kids toys I would love to see someone resurrect the idea of a mediaPC that was both a streaming box like a fire stick AppleTV and also a full internet browser In the US I believe copyright and media distribution laws prevent that Not the hardwaretechnology Edit replaced supports to can run,,0.0,1htg2or
comment,m5e4rgl,pemb,,14,2025-01-04 18:40:53,,,,Apple has little reason to switch to RISCV since they hold a very powerful ARM architectural license allowing them to design their own chips which just happen to be some of the best in the world Theyve never supported any of their OSes on anything other than Apple hardware Some Android support already exists Chrome OS will come sooner or later since both these systems use the Linux kernel Windows might happen if theres demand from a hardware partner but I wont hold my breath most of the RISCV appeal is at the bottom of the market where ARM licensing costs are probably more significant,m5dngfk,1.0,1htg2or

comment,m5emj41,Riversntallbuildings,,0,2025-01-04 20:13:16,,,,Correct I was referencing my youth and the short period of time when there were Mac clones and Apple was attempting to license its OS Those days are long gone Im in favor of more competition but only if that means data portability and interoperability Cloud computing and SaaS can address some of this but not all of it I personally look at technology a lot more like markets and I believe in transparent open markets Somehow the US needs modern AntiTrust laws that prevent these closed markets from continuing to grow and stifle innovation Something to the extent that if a company creates an OS its not allowed to prevent buyers from installing other software or restricting its controls to other services and devices The fact that AppleAmazon restrict me from buying Kindle books on my iPhoneiPad is absolutely anticonsumer behavior Similarly if a company is a Marketplace like Amazon or Uber then it shouldnt be allowed to manufacturer its own products and undercut existing ones Unfortunately this is incredibly hard to define in the shifting world of hardware software worst of all content Well see if the younger generations can figure it out God knows the older ones cant or wont,m5e4rgl,2.0,1htg2or

comment,m5fcx0q,ThePowerOfStories,,5,2025-01-04 22:36:59,,,,RISC is a chip design philosophy RISCV is a specific architecture PowerPC was RISC ARM is RISC its what the R in ARM stands for Basically everything produced this century other than x86 is RISC and even x86 has been a CISC front end with a hidden RISC core for decades at this point,m5f0ov6,2.0,1htg2or

comment,m5jre1j,Kevin_Jim,,0,2025-01-05 17:18:10,,,,RISCV is still quite a long way off for midtopend laptops They are great as accelerators and IoT staff that need a tiny MCU But getting close to the performance of an M1 or better its going to require a massive investment and development And RISCV is still going to involve licensing Its just wont be licensing like ARMs More like an adhoc licensing of bits and pieces for what you need for your use case,,0.0,1htg2or
