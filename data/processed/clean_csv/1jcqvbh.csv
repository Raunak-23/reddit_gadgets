comment,mi4gkun,HiddenoO,,338,2025-03-16 17:57:26,,,,The problem is that crypto mining and now AI data centres are more profitable so Nvidia has no reason to saturate the market when they can inflate prices instead,mi4crau,1.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi4qe2t,baobabKoodaa,,160,2025-03-16 18:45:31,,,,Inflate prices of what Of the 4 units of GPUs that hit Finlands biggest store this week Wow good job must have made a lot of money on those 4 units,mi4gkun,2.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi4tvlr,HiddenoO,,101,2025-03-16 19:02:43,,,,All their GPUs for the past five years or so They couldve probably sold twice as many but if its at a 20 lower price that might halve their profit margin so they wouldve ended up with the same consumer GPU profit but fewer wafers allocated to data centres where they have even larger profit margins Pretty much the only reason theyre releasing consumer GPUs at the moment at all is to stay relevant in the consumer GPU market If it were purely about immediate profits theyd either dedicate all their wafers to data centres or only sell consumer GPUs at even higher prices to match data centre margins,mi4qe2t,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6z9re,Vokasak,,-4,2025-03-17 02:02:26,,,,They couldve probably sold twice as many Theyve already sold all the ones they make How could they have sold twice as many as they made,mi4tvlr,4.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi7xrab,RadicalMeowslim,,23,2025-03-17 06:34:13,,,,Because it all comes from the same silicon Making more cheaper consumer GPUs means they cant make as many expensive enterprise GPUs So they make fewer consumer GPUs charge a higher price for those since demand will be higher and people will still pay They can then make more enterprise GPUs generating much more profit,mi7tufz,7.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi749n1,HiddenoO,,5,2025-03-17 02:34:05,,,,I never wrote they couldve sold twice as many as they made They couldve sold twice as many as they sold by simply producing more consumer GPUs instead of using those same wafers for data centre compute units,mi6z9re,5.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi4ud46,baobabKoodaa,,-34,2025-03-16 19:05:07,,,,3090s and 4090s were available on store shelves for a long period of time The situation today with 5090s is completely different and NVIDIA is not doing that voluntarily Im sure they would prefer to sell more than 4 GPUs per week but for whatever reason supply is constrained right now,mi4tvlr,4.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi4wfex,HiddenoO,,60,2025-03-16 19:15:27,,,,Are you living in a different reality 3090s and 4090s also had massive shortages on launch and 4090s were practically never available at MSRP throughout their whole life cycle The reason its worse now is that AI hype has completely taken off between the 4090 launch and now the 5090 launch Have you even looked at Nvidias revenue statistics In million US dollars 2024 13517 graphics 47405 compute networking 2022 15868 graphics 11046 compute networking 2020 7639 graphics 3279 compute networking The supply isnt constrained any more than it was previously you can clearly see where its going and its not GPUs,mi4ud46,5.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6aane,sigmoid10,,-2,2025-03-16 23:34:28,,,,The entire 30 series was hit on both fronts because of covid Tons of supply chain issues and drastically increased demand The 4090 was actually pretty easy to get for the most part of its lifecycle and only had issues at the beginning when things were still recovering from covid and at the end when production was ramped down to make room for the 50 series and it became clear that the next gen would cost a lot more but only deliver very little extra performance once you disregard DLSS 4,mi4wfex,6.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6e9af,HiddenoO,,8,2025-03-16 23:57:02,,,,The 4090 wasnt pretty easy to get at the beginning where we are in 50 series right now and at least here you could practically never get it at MSRP Also the 30 series was also largely affected by crypto buying up all consumer cards,mi6aane,7.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi84ixg,sigmoid10,,-4,2025-03-17 07:47:02,,,,The 4090 wasnt pretty easy to get at the beginning Literally what was said above But you could get one at MSRP just a few months after release and it remained available at that price until the 50 series dawned on the horizon Mining on the 3090 was never cost effective that only affected some particular models that happened to have a good performancepriceenergy usage ratio And even that was made less attractive with Nvidias hardware locks for mining,mi6e9af,8.0,1jcqvbh
comment,miaxf1k,HiddenoO,,1,2025-03-17 18:35:00,,,,Once again where I live that wasnt the case regarding 4090 MSRP and my market is very similar to the one of the person I was responding to As for the 3090 it doesnt matter whether the 3090 itself was bought for crypto when consumers were pushed into buying it because other cards were unavailable because of crypto In either case you get a much higher demand than without the crypto bubble Obviously this only holds true to an extent For example the 4080 was so expensive and lowvalue that it didnt sell out even when the rest of the market was sold out,mi84ixg,9.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mjnj7lz,sigmoid10,,0,2025-03-25 13:47:50,,,,MSI 4090 was around MSRP for most of its life until a few months before the 50 series announcement See here for example Same for most other manufacturers Youll see a similar graph for the 3090 but with a high start in early 2022 due to the remaining supply chain issues But they sorted this out quickly and the price came down very fast afterwards,miaxf1k,10.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mjqce44,HiddenoO,,0,2025-03-25 21:54:55,,,,First off the initial comment was about shortly after release for comparison against the 5090 now Your chart literally only starts months after release Secondly the guy was talking about a European market and I specifically mentioned that Im talking about a similar European market and you think linking a site tracking US prices makes any sort of sense Can you at least read before responding,mjnj7lz,11.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi7qa14,xsilas43,,3,2025-03-17 05:20:39,,,,The 4090 was never readily available here in Canada definitely not anywhere close to msrp,mi6aane,7.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi537u6,baobabKoodaa,,-13,2025-03-16 19:49:15,,,,Youre arguing that were getting 4 GPUs per week because that maximizes Nvidias revenue Even if you want to assume that Nvidia is creating artificial scarcity to boost revenue surely you would agree that the optimal point is higher than 4 GPUs per week,mi4wfex,6.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi572xr,Maragii,,26,2025-03-16 20:08:26,,,,Optimal would be 0 consumer gpus any consumer gpus is taking away limited wafer capacity from data center gpus which sell for way higher margins When data center gpus stop selling theyll get repurposed to consumer gpus and supply will increase What were getting are essentially the leftovers,mi537u6,7.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi57dpl,HiddenoO,,11,2025-03-16 20:09:54,,,,Youre arguing that were getting 4 GPUs per week because that maximizes Nvidias revenue Yes if they get higher profit margins for the same wafers by selling data centre cards thats how it works Even if you want to assume that Nvidia is creating artificial scarcity to boost revenue surely you would agree that the optimal point is higher than 4 GPUs per week Your 4 cards figure is obviously made up but leaving that aside no it doesnt have to be Once again youre not taking into account that youre only looking at consumer GPUs They cannot produce unlimited amounts of wafers at TSMC so it makes sense for them as a forprofit company to prioritize assigning those wafers to data centres where they have larger profit margins If you were able to produce the besttasting apples in the world but only in limited quantities would you prioritize selling them in supermarkets for 1 each or would you prioritize selling them to luxury hotels for 5 each while also raising supermarket prices to 2 each because of limited supply,mi537u6,7.0,1jcqvbh
comment,miebo3k,prudentWindBag,,-1,2025-03-18 06:43:32,,,,For the last time Nvidia is not selling GPUs in good faith This is clearly a strategic play to push demand to new heights Were being toyed with to accept a new pricing tier Edit The comment I replied to is either deleted or I have been blocked Lol,mi537u6,7.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6j3fm,seamus_quigley,,19,2025-03-17 00:24:48,,,,The problem is every gaming GPU produced is money left on the table They have a limited wafer allocation from TSMC Each wafer costs them a certain amount of money Whether they use the wafer to produce gaming graphic cards or to produce the professional cards that cost 10k plus their costs are more or less the same Its honestly surprising they bother to produce any gaming GPUs,mi4qe2t,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6yru5,CheesyRamen66,,7,2025-03-17 01:59:17,,,,Remaining the consumer name brand not only helps make them the default for future enterprise procurement but more importantly makes sure developers are starting out with CUDA,mi6j3fm,4.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi6xjg4,CheesyRamen66,,2,2025-03-17 01:51:35,,,,If you can raise your profit margin from 50 to 200 then you only need to sell 14 as many units to achieve the same profits By reducing supply like that youre almost guaranteeing prices will go up a lot TSMC can only allocate so many wafers to Nvidia so even if they make a little less from GeForce they can take all those saved wafers and make way more money from datacenter Customers accept this is the new normal and whenever datacenter demands dip they can always turn around and flood the consumer market for a few months without dropping prices below their old margins,mi4qe2t,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi9ipbx,NsRhea,,1,2025-03-17 14:28:11,,,,They dont give a fuck about 4 gpus because before they hit the streets theyve sold 20000 to Microsoft 30000 to tesla 40000 to Facebook etc etc etc,mi4qe2t,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi9zjq7,baobabKoodaa,,1,2025-03-17 15:53:08,,,,My point is that they wouldnt artificially constrict the supply to 4 GPUs just to inflate the prices of those 4 GPUs Because 4 GPUs is a really small amount of GPUs The fact that we dont see more GPUs indicates that there are some real supply constraints as opposed to artificial constraints,mi9ipbx,4.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mia19su,NsRhea,,0,2025-03-17 16:01:24,,,,I would assume theyve run the numbers and look at average buys for areas Then they throw them in the trash and sell 200000 units to companies first before spreading around the stock they do have 4 units is a shortage in your area it would appear so its working as intended for them,mi9zjq7,5.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6gsdl,j0s3f,,0,2025-03-17 00:11:36,,,,The chips are all in expensive AI cards,mi4qe2t,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi5l38v,sargonas,,23,2025-03-16 21:18:48,,,,Its not about inflating prices its about not even manufacturing the cards Why would they manufacture 50 series cards for consumers to pay a few hundred bucks to 1000 for when they can use the same limited supply of silicon to manufacturer multi thousand dollar car that they can sell 10 times more of that volume to AI corporations There is a finite amount of silicon that can be made within a certain time frame and every chip they slap onto a card for dedicated AI use has 10 times the market value of a consumer gaming card Gaming market segments is now an annoying baggage piece for Nvidia they have to maintain and a fractional percentage of their overall market dominance these days Making these chips is an inconvenience and theyre only doing the bare minimum necessary,mi4gkun,2.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi5pr32,HiddenoO,,6,2025-03-16 21:42:41,,,,Its about both If they didnt give a shit about the consumer GPU market at all they wouldnt be releasing any more cards The way theyre acting now they can simultaneously stay relevant on the consumer GPU market and normalize inflated consumer GPU prices for whenif the AI bubble bursts while also raking in the big data centre money right now,mi5l38v,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6ngxb,firedrakes,,-4,2025-03-17 00:50:08,,,,no its not am sorry but gamers wont fund the cost to research and dev the hardware anymore with the real price of the card look how console starting at 360 era and pc following suite a year or two later where stuff has to be uspcale due to hardware is under power but but pc game is still under power ask yourself why we need fake framesfake rezfake rtpt etc consumer will not pay the real cost of the hardware needed for it,mi5pr32,4.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi78eim,HiddenoO,,3,2025-03-17 03:01:33,,,,Did not bother to check which sector mafe the profit Server hpc networking Nice bs try thru I never claimed it was consumer GPUs The point is that theyre having insane profit margins on server compute so those are clearly not real prices whatever thats even supposed to mean My og point stands So much legacy support and half ass standards We gotten to the point now Industry is regression backwards Thats not a point thats just rambling about things that have little to do with the topic,mi77wi2,7.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi605b6,midnitefox,,-2,2025-03-16 22:37:57,,,,So then they need to invest in expanding manufacturing to meet demand Welp nevermind Learned a lot tonight,mi5l38v,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6gqmk,soulsoda,,8,2025-03-17 00:11:19,,,,Chip fabs do not scale up The investment required is on the scale of 10s of billions 4 years before you even start making anything Not to mention these facilities are designed byrun by highly specialized professionals you cant just grab these people off the street Theres a reason one company in the world dominates the world when it comes to chip fabrication,mi605b6,4.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6i3no,j0s3f,,3,2025-03-17 00:19:09,,,,They dont have the knowledge and skills to manufacture those chips Thats why they pay TSMC to do it Building a fab takes TSMC around a year in Taiwan and 24 years somewhere else The costs are about 20 billion per fab Thats not something where Nvidia can throw in a few millions and double their output,mi605b6,4.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6n23z,sargonas,,2,2025-03-17 00:47:42,,,,Thats not the answer The problem is there is a finite amount of chips that TSMC can make for them per year They then divide those chips up into AI cards other highenterprise chips like selfdriving automation processors and then gaming gpus The first two can be sold for 10x the price per chip than the gaming gpus There is simply no motivation for them to allocate more than they absolutely feel they must to gaming gpus because they are literally losing money when they do so,mi605b6,4.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6gm0z,ArseBurner,,-1,2025-03-17 00:10:33,,,,I was gonna say this is down to TSMC then I remembered that Apple is actually investing in them which is why they have super preferred status,mi605b6,4.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi7s6oo,EmmEnnEff,,3,2025-03-17 05:38:32,,,,They could shut down their entire gaming card division and their stock price wouldnt notice They make way more money per card they sell to Google than per card they sell to you Literally the only reason they still make gaming cards is so they can starve AMD,mi5ku37,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi4zn7x,BarfHurricane,,5,2025-03-16 19:31:29,,,,But all I hear from the supply and demand folks is that corporations will just build more and prices will go down Just like with the housing market,mi4gkun,2.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi5a4nj,Hopnivarance,,5,2025-03-16 20:23:36,,,,They are building more but it takes many billions of dollars and years to get new production on line for high end chips which gpus are,mi4zn7x,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi5d3qf,AuryGlenz,,-1,2025-03-16 20:38:32,,,,In this case theyre almost a monopoly when it comes to chips used for AI due to their efforts on the software side Theyd still love to make more but they cant just flip a switch and have that happen As far as housing goes do you think thats somehow insulated from supply and demand Anyone mentioning this in regards to the US as opposed to say Canada gets downvoted but the mass immigration weve had in our country means we simply couldnt build houses fast enough If youre only making enough homes 1 million new people per year but your population is growing at 15 million per year of course thats going to put pressure on housing prices Again you cant exactly flip a switch and its the land thats the more expensive part not the actual homes meaning there isnt a huge economic incentive to get more people into home building However theres still some incentive and weve absolutely seen more housing units being made in recent years I guarantee you if COVID 2027 comes around and it kills half the population home prices will indeed drop Probably GPUs too for that matter,mi4zn7x,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi7vw0j,Perfect_Cost_8847,,2,2025-03-17 06:14:58,,,,I worry about what this means for chip designs Its clear theyre now optimising for AI workflows instead of graphics Raster performance improvements are quite poor because theyre dedicating more and more die space to AI Theyre trying to make this useful for gaming with DLSS but it really is a case of backfilling the value instead of being gaming led Wed have much better GPUs right now if not for the AI craze Theyd also be much better value,mi4gkun,2.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi68n2l,HiddenoO,,2,2025-03-16 23:25:05,,,,They wouldnt be able to compete with AMD then Looking at their generational improvements you will see those primarily came from node shrinks This generation there was no node shrink and cards are getting practically the same performance per core as last gen,mi5uuwt,3.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi6kfe9,ArseBurner,,2,2025-03-17 00:32:25,,,,Thats what Nvidia tried to do with 30 series Geforce cards were fabbed on Samsung so they could focus all of their TSMC allocation on A100 Sadly Samsung screwed up their 5 and 4nm nodes something about executives faking yields and the money meant for improving those yields mysteriously disappearing so 40 series had to return to TSMC,mi5uuwt,3.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi8102h,Fredasa,,2,2025-03-17 07:08:20,,,,And Nvidia knows this The exact reason why they artificially constrained VRAMbecause it would end up becoming the reason people upgrade Not because they depended on improved performance but because they literally could not play the fn games without more VRAM,mi7tbln,6.0,1jcqvbh
comment,mi9adhi,RevolvinOcelot,,2,2025-03-17 13:43:01,,,,Person below also pointed out the VRAM problem and youre absolutely right Veilguard and MHW ran like dogwater because they immediately slam the VRAM when I open them If I tinker and turn off all the weird nonsense settings theyll play fine without almost everything else at highest settings I play Cyberpunk on the highest settings and it doesnt even sneeze which is wild to me considering how much more visually busy it is than either of those two titles Newer games just feel wildly unoptimized and bloated with settings I never used in the first place,mi4z9ln,5.0,1jcqvbh
comment,miauikd,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-17 18:21:07,,,,On my 3080 Cyberpunk ran without issue on launch day When I returned to the game in 2024 the game had gotten an overhaul and it now demanded more VRAM than the 3080 could muster even with every scrap of it devoted to the game I could play the game fine as long a I didnt open the main map which is of course a bonkers thing to do without in that game Playing in 4K DLSS Quality,mi9adhi,6.0,1jcqvbh

comment,mi8hu37,-Aeryn-,,1,2025-03-17 10:11:17,,,,It wouldnt really because for example some major retailers took 5000 orders on day 1 from real people and recieved only 20 cards per day since then Some SKUs have not shipped even a single unit to major retailers since January You cannot split 500 cards between 5000 real people The supply just does not exist Nobody wants to spend the fab time wafers to produce these products in volume because theyre making much more money for the same production resources with other products such as zen 5 and blackwell server GPUs There isnt enough eg TSMC N4 to produce all of that stuff and have leftover capacity for less profitable products,mi8eqbu,1.0,1jcqvbh
