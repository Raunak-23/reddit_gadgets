comment,mzp7kmq,g-nice4liief,,3,2025-06-25 14:09:22,,,,IMHO starting with ads is different than adding ads after the fact and bombard people with it Flappy bird was an app full with apps but it was accepted because the app did what it needed to do and the ads where just there But alot of services nowadays introduce ads while eroding away what their service stood for or how it worked Which is different But you do have a good point to be honest,mzp6kp0,2.0,1lk661r

comment,mzqpswg,francis2559,,0,2025-06-25 18:20:53,,,,Id be curious to simply require all companies to offer a paid option with no ads that does not allow your information to be sold It doesnt even have to have price controls as I think they would use scary pricing initially but that sends the message our data has a lot of worry on the individual level Anyway even without that last bit if this really is about money simply give people choice,mzp4qe9,1.0,1lk661r
comment,mzsvmg2,double-you,,1,2025-06-26 00:58:07,,,,Messages dont work People just dont care enough or long enough The law should also prevent situations like providing several tiers like a free tier with ads and paid with no ads but where you get several years of adfree tier with 100 discount Or having a thousand free tiers each with more and more ada and then pushing people onto those tiers by raising the prices of tiers with fewer ads Yes there are issues like legit price increases but getting the business off the ground with enshittification is not our problem,mzqpswg,2.0,1lk661r

comment,mzy949s,Sonikado,,1,2025-06-26 20:53:22,,,,Ford vs Dodge set the precedent that any company should have its shareholders served first before the company itself andor its customers It is not that extreme nowadays however this became a goal for big investors Multiply money first everything else after This includes a company cutting their own meat to generate as big profits as possible many times costing the company their brand name trust and sometimes its own existence This appears in very different patterns sometimes a board of shareholders will point a CEO that specializes in extracting every possible penny and then leave the ashes behind sometimes the board wants the company to look good as a result every decision is made to make a short time profit so it can look good on the public report every X amount of time To know more just google Ford vs Dodge First result wikipedia Regarding the laws i might have gotten way too much happy on the wording Sorry for that No law itself will say clearly u must enshitiffy That makes no sense things at this scale are made as confusing and hidden as possible SEC regulates companies such that if a company doesnt focus on its big shareholders they might get sued Blackrock sueing United is one example where they took a somewhat innocent regulation one that says they must disclose their goals and strategy and went full blast on the lawsuit just because United started treating their customers a little tiny bit better In the end this very much can be summarized on big shareholder has priority over anyone else including the company and its customers The pain starts when this or those big shareholders dont really care as is what happens on most investment companies,mzstnzh,3.0,1lk661r
