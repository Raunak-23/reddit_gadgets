comment,m6ykdt2,dr_magic_fingers,,43,2025-01-13 18:25:22,,,,From the link The Biden administration has unveiled its AI diffusion rule which aims to restrict the export of GPUs that are most coveted for AI applications Although it does not mention the nation by name its broadly viewed as a means to prevent China from outpacing the US in AI development The rule proposes three licensing tiers The first tier is unrestricted and includes the domestic market as well as 18 strategic allies The majority of countries fall into a second tier which will have caps on how much compute power they can import via top GPUs from the US The third tier includes China Russia Iran and North Korea and effectively bars US companies from selling their most powerful GPUs there USbased companies would also be prevented from sharing many details of their AI software models with countries outside that first tier and would need to ask permission from the federal government before building large data centers in any tier two nation,,0.0,1i0fwa0

comment,m70vlvz,Reddit_Censorshipped,,22,2025-01-14 01:31:20,,,,Remember when Trumps edu pick was a paytoplay scandal and was included in several books from people who left his own cabinet talking about how much of a threat he was to the country while refusing to testify to congress because telling them the contents of their books would hurt sales of said books No Too much shit to remember each and every scandal Thats his plan,m702ghs,2.0,1i0fwa0

comment,m70pje5,thefpspower,,11,2025-01-14 00:58:06,,,,This will backfire hard in the long run Chinas SMIC used to suck balls at semiconductors now they are getting heavy investment and getting closer much faster Just like China mastered making cars and batteries after everyone sent manufacturing there they will master semiconductors and become independent of the US,m6ykdt2,1.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m72t550,yuje,,12,2025-01-14 10:34:49,,,,Because China sees falling behind in technology as an existential threat The last time they fell behind resulted in the Opium Wars and the Century of Humiliation China is treating their domestic semiconductor industry as their Manhattan Project and throwing correspondingly vast resources and sums of money at it,m70pje5,2.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m72r8eh,HawkinsT,,8,2025-01-14 10:14:43,,,,Leadingedge logic chip manufacturing is far too specialised and globalised for China to be able to compete in any sort of near term No country can manufacture these chips completely inhouse including the US and what US sanctions do more than preventing direct sales is freeze China out of the global supply chain Even with China pouring the required billions into this annually at a time where the Chinese economy is slowing they still cant produce the ultrapure silicone EUV lithography machines EDA tools or numerous other critical components Each one of these might take a decade of investment to get to where we are now by which point their global rivals have a decade more experience working with these chips no longer have the overheads associated with a newly refitted fab and will already be rolling out their newer faster nodes Chip War by Chris Miller is a good well researched book on this,m70pje5,2.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m70djxk,adt,,16,2025-01-13 23:51:26,,,,Really poor reporting Engadet said USbased companies would also be prevented from sharing many details of their AI software models with countries outside that first tier US Gov actually said Restricting the transfer to nontrusted actors of the model weights for advanced closedweight models Summary AI labs can still publish papers with many details all details Microsoft just cant deploy GPT5 servers in China,,0.0,1i0fwa0

comment,m6znvvv,Useful44723,,8,2025-01-13 21:36:43,,,,Nvidias official statement here That global progress is now in jeopardy The Biden Administration now seeks to restrict access to mainstream computing applications with its unprecedented and misguided AI Diffusion rule which threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide In its last days in office the Biden Administration seeks to undermine Americas leadership with a 200 page regulatory morass drafted in secret and without proper legislative review This sweeping overreach would impose bureaucratic control over how Americas leading semiconductors computers systems and even software are designed and marketed globally,,0.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m6zoumx,hardy_83,,41,2025-01-13 21:41:26,,,,When a giant company says something is on jeopardy whatever it is they said they really mean their profits and control They dont actually care if the consumer suffers I mean its Nvidia they clearly dont already with their pricing models,m6znvvv,1.0,1i0fwa0

comment,m72bin6,MommersHeart,,13,2025-01-14 07:24:35,,,,China hasnt threatened to annex Canada or Greenland or Panama It hasnt threatened to cripple Canada and Mexico with 25 acrosstheboard tariffs Why should the US continue to enjoy the goodwill support of the western world to control those chips when it is showing itself to be a bad faith actor,,0.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m73h6ym,None,,-6,2025-01-14 13:47:35,,,,Didnt China just take over Hong Kong against their will Dont they want to annex Taiwan also against their will Lets not talk like the US is the devil and everyone else in the world is all sunshine and rainbows,m72bin6,1.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m73k6te,MommersHeart,,7,2025-01-14 14:06:07,,,,Im Canadian so until China threatens to annex my country Im no longer willing to look at the US as preferable The US is now just as nefarious as China and is the more imminent threat to my country Also Hong King was always agreed to revert back to Chinese control British leased Hong King for 99 years in 1898 Last time I checked Canada wasnt leased from the US and China has not yet declared it will annex Taiwan So lets not pretend the US is not acting as a dangerous belligerent just because China is also a bad actor,m73h6ym,2.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m73re3d,None,,-9,2025-01-14 14:48:26,,,,Im disregarding your first part because your feelings are irrelevant While Hong Kong was a lease China agreed to uphold a guarantee of one country two systems meaning that Hong Kong would retain its freedoms and the right to self govern Spoiler Alert China hasnt upheld that guarantee plenty of articles for you research on this topic on the whats happening right now in Hong Kong Maybe a few minutes of googling will also help you understand how much danger Taiwan is right now Your overly simple statement of China not declaring Taiwan annexed yet reveals to me how you are missing the forest for the trees Equating the US to China is equally ignorant even though both of them have faults only one of them has an active concentration camp China Uyghur muslims being the target of their reeducation centers So lets not pretend that China with its active on going atrocities is equivalent morally to the US in anyway,m73k6te,3.0,1i0fwa0
comment,m74fsrb,MommersHeart,,3,2025-01-14 16:53:33,,,,You are making the argument China bad therefore America good America is threatening to use military force on allies and annex its neighbours Pointing to Chinas use of prison camps is especially rich given America has the 13th amendment legalizing slavery with an incarceration rate many times higher than even China America once was a force for relative good in the world Today you wear the shame of rogue nations threatening to invade and annex your peaceful neighbours and allies,m73re3d,4.0,1i0fwa0

comment,m79hlep,timeforknowledge,,0,2025-01-15 12:44:32,,,,Its a short term solution that hits China in the shortterm but forces them to adapt to increase their RD and production of their own In the future theyll just dominate that market,,0.0,1i0fwa0
