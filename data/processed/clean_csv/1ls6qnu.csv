comment,n1g8nby,gchaudh2,,196,2025-07-05 10:44:25,,,,Amazon has a worse privacy language than even some Chinese manufacturers like tplink Thats why no matter how good these routers are I always try to avoid them,,0.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1ibjrc,Newwavecybertiger,,25,2025-07-05 18:19:18,,,,can someone explain the theoretical andor actual privacy concerns from Eero Everything Ive seen sounds like what literally every tech giant is doing to the extent you cant actually avoid it just potentially choose which giant gets your info,n1g8nby,1.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1ozh57,OnlyTilt,,4,2025-07-06 20:27:33,,,,You literally asked for theoretical also all routers with deep packet inspection logs that traffic data its whether you trust amazon enough that they wont take a peek at it for themselves,n1oyblu,4.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1p05ur,Newwavecybertiger,,4,2025-07-06 20:31:04,,,,Pardon was just asking for clarity Im moderately familiar with the theoretical but much less on what is standard practice vs bad actor,n1ozh57,5.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1p1zb2,OnlyTilt,,3,2025-07-06 20:40:15,,,,So Deep Packet Inspection DPI does exactly that it logs all traffic going across your network its available on some premium routers and all enterprise routers I dont know if eero offers it but if it does all Amazon has to do is peak at it and im sure they would encrypt the traffic so you cant tell what theyre actually looking at and what they arent,n1p05ur,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n23kt3l,min0nim,,1,2025-07-09 01:50:24,,,,Not Apple and not Unify and not DIY with a NIX of your choice You can choose better privacy but it costs more in money or time For some of us thats a pretty straightforward decision,n1ibjrc,2.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1if394,DragonSlayerC,,2,2025-07-05 18:38:35,,,,Yeah I currently have a Unifi based setup and have been looking to change to Firewalla Its much more expensive but seems worth it I have a coworker using a Firewalla as a router and he loves it,n1gqcl5,3.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1hleul,Aaronspark777,,17,2025-07-05 16:02:36,,,,Idk a unifi mesh setup even wired is around the same price as a triple router mesh setup Plus comes with all the advanced features that these mesh routers charge a subscription to access,n1hiasd,4.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1hvw7v,Aaronspark777,,24,2025-07-05 16:58:55,,,,It would be multiple products and its very customizable based on your needs Going to be comparing to the Pro Deployment which is 699 No Wiring but only need WiFi Dream Router 7 279 2x U7 Pro 2 POE injectors 408 Total 687 Need at least 1 ethernet ports near the mesh AP Dream Router 7 279 2x Unifi Express 7 398 Total 677 Have at least 1 ethernet port wired and need both multiple ethernet and wifi Dream Router 7 279 Unifi Express 7 199 U7 InWall 149 Total 628 Its a whole ecosystem of devices meant to work together and you can continually expand or replace as units get old Eeros and Orbis would require replacing the entire stack when it comes to upgrading With a Unifi setup you can pick and choose which components you want to replace usually you keep the gatewayrouter and swap out the Wireless Access Points,n1honkz,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1i9hsa,BWCDD4,,6,2025-07-05 18:08:22,,,,They dont have one that compares to any other home networking brand that isnt their forte They provide some WiFi meshing but its significantly worse than other brands and they expect you to run wiring for the backhaul if you want performance,n1honkz,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1jqspl,None,,0,2025-07-05 23:09:13,,,,Orbi which go from 10002000 They are excellent but get some Ethernet cabling put in and wire in some UniFi APs etc,n1honkz,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1k1rl7,BWCDD4,,3,2025-07-06 00:16:49,,,,Netgear isnt who Id recommend Not only are they expensive but they need a specific base station router rather than all the satellites being capable of running the whole thing ASUS with AImesh is the most versatile as it will work with any of their own products even older ones and you can mix and match freely I dont think you can mix and match TP link but at least they dont require a specific base station so you can use the routers in any locationconfiguration and extendreplace as needed without a worry that its not compatible because its only a satellitebase station TPLinkNetgear software and features are worse than ASUS and far more basiclimited Eero requires a subscription for stuff you get for freedefault on ASUS also MerlinWRT is a god send,n1jqspl,7.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1i98uy,BWCDD4,,7,2025-07-05 18:07:04,,,,Unifi has nothing that compares to actual wireless mesh by the home router competitors Their accessible products like the DR7 and UE7 dont use 4x4 antennas 6ghz or MLO for backhaul which significantly decreases bandwidth They also dont have any products with a band for dedicated backhaul they have absolutely nothing that can compare to a full WiFi mesh from competitors like ASUS Tplink Eero or netgear,n1hleul,5.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1iuyyt,semibiquitous,,8,2025-07-05 20:06:47,,,,This Omg this I found this out the hard way I got U6 and it has an awful signal transmission that feels like cant even penetrate paper Too late to return it for me I had to plug my old Netgear nighthawk router to use as AP for the unifi router which has 4x4 and has probably x3 performance of the U6 I ended up using the U6 for the IoT devices and my nighthawk as AP for everything else Now I am looking into wifi 7 access pointmesh network to compliment my unifi router,n1i98uy,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1iyi9j,Aaronspark777,,2,2025-07-05 20:26:03,,,,Gotcha wasnt aware the 4x4 antennas was that important I knew they were capable of meshing though Ive had not needed to mess with it My setup all the APs are wired,n1i98uy,6.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1i8clw,BWCDD4,,14,2025-07-05 18:02:27,,,,Unifi is not the way for WiFI mesh and even if you dont need mesh its not for the average joe either They are expensive but the easiest setup and most feature rich for the average consumer is ASUS,n1gn9lm,3.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1iytjm,Silpher9,,1,2025-07-05 20:27:46,,,,Yes I have a 200 main router and a mesh with an additional 6 50 euro routers Dont know which models exactly but it works like a charm for 2 years straight now Really happy with Asus,n1i8clw,4.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1iqcqk,adilly,,1,2025-07-05 19:41:00,,,,Unifi is the way to an empty wallet,n1i8clw,4.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1ieaeq,DragonSlayerC,,3,2025-07-05 18:34:13,,,,Or Firewalla More expensive but much better for home use IMO Also great if you want higher performance as most Unifi hardware is underpowered I say that as someone who has a Unifi based network but has been considering Firewallas 10G gateway and AP7,n1gn9lm,3.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1kip4s,Phiosiden,,0,2025-07-06 02:10:49,,,,Unifi mesh is garbage Unifi wifi is also pretty terrible as a baseline they have some of the words handoffs Ive seen in an enterprise level product,n1gn9lm,3.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1l3an9,kimster7,,6,2025-07-06 04:43:05,,,,Cal you elaborate on the worse privacy language Or is this just trust me bro and vibes Other comments Comparing to UniFi is a total straw man because UniFi is an enterprise solution that is much much more expensive than eero Not a fair comparison at all,n1g8nby,1.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1j7lzp,shpwrck,,11,2025-07-05 21:15:50,,,,Eero was great when they first hit the market Kickstarter But once they started hiding features behind subscriptions and then got swallowed by Bezos that was it for me They might be more expensive but I would recommend Firewalla over eero hands down,,0.0,1ls6qnu

comment,n1kiskh,u0126,,3,2025-07-06 02:11:28,,,,When I first went with eero it was amazing Worked right out of the box Ive upgraded 1 or 2 times since then For me it still works fine but I swear the signal strength has reduced some If you have Ring they have a cool integration if you use Eero as a router that will provide you a few gigs of cellular backup if your primary WAN goes offline as part of the ring subscription I no longer use it as a router though just APs but disappointed sometimes at the speeds or signal strength I have 3 units around my house Eero pro 6e and have been thinking of trying to improve the placement or go elsewhere for WiFi signal,,0.0,1ls6qnu
comment,n1jbxy0,Spanky2k,,3,2025-07-05 21:40:38,,,,Dont make the same mistake as I made and buy one of these prepackaged mesh systems They do work great but if you decide you need an extra satellite a year later for more coverage for whatever reason chances are the model you need is no longer manufactured and the new current model isnt backwards compatible with your setup Instead buy a long term modular system There may be others but Ive been using UniFis for a while now and Ive expanded and updated different bits a few times over the years I had to learn the hard way after buying two different complete mesh systems before one for home and one for work neither of which could be upgraded in practice a little while later,,0.0,1ls6qnu
