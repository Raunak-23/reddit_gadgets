comment,mj85vi3,None,,7,2025-03-22 23:26:00,,,,I bought a 32 inch Samsung TV in 2013 back when that got you a solid base Made in Mexico not China weighed 25 lbs rather than 10 worked fine for years gave it my grandmother a few years back it works for less than a year then dies She bought new base model Samsung 32 inch with Smart TV and flimsy build After needing reboots and such occasionaly it also lasted a year before dying altogether That was replaced with a fake Toshiba FireTV While you have to access a burried setting to disable the TV from defaulting to Amazon Prime at startup rather than your last input and that setting reset itself once its been reliable Moms new condo came with 10 year old but high end Samsung front loader set After a while one throws an error about the water level Tech comes out offers to fix it for many hundreds of dollars but advises that its easy to fix and you can get the sensor on Amazon So she does but doesnt fix it Figures out it works fine in a specific mode just not others then it dies more got replaced with a cheap top loader Dryer holding out Sadly my own set is also a Samsung front loader set because they were bought during Covid and pickings were slim but even they show shines of quality that is cut out of the latest years like the glass door I hated many things about my Galaxy S9 despite my best attempts to like it didnt deliver on any of its selling points wont go further into that Roommate bought a 600 gaming monitor with HDR It needs a power replug every couple of days I think it coincides with brownouts which happens often around here but no other screen around here does that They no longer are involved with making RenaultNissan cars for the local Korean market eliminating another interesting footnote They have made decent laptops and Chromebooks in the past but they dont try hard enough and never nail the market The only thing they still do right is SSDs,mj7d4xr,3.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj8zeu4,OneBigBug,,3,2025-03-23 02:28:28,,,,I was only speaking objectively Youre not speaking objectively if you use the words best TV You cant even do that with explicitly numerical values because the amount of weight each person assigns to those values differs and Samsung doesnt occupy every space along that frontier Speaking objectively you could say hypothetically I suspect these are not actually true examples that Samsung makesthe brightest TV or the highest contrast TV or the TV with the highest resolution But best is an inherently subjective quality For someone who wants to play retro games the best TV might be an old CRT This should be relatively obvious being that you linked something where Best TV is separate from Best Home Theater TV Bafflingly even amongst these highly subjective evaluations the best home theater TV has a higher score for mixed usage than the best TV Not really sure what makes a TV better than a home theater TV if its worse for mixed usage,mj872xz,5.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mj9bfwo,Fredasa,,-5,2025-03-23 03:52:42,,,,the brightest TV or the highest contrast TV or the TV with the highest resolution The reason I can say what I say comes down to a few things There is zero controversy in stating that OLED technology is better than any LCD technology If you need the modest brightness advantage of QLED for a room with glare and whatnot all that means you are trading out image quality and viewing angles for brightness and unsolicited dithering since there are almost no LCD TVs that dont use it WOLED is right out because luminance overshoot is a dealbreaker and after half a decade they still havent eliminated it so its evidently not going away Quite bluntly theres an alternative panel type which just so happens to not have that issue while also being brighter as a nice bonus Sony are the only real contenders here with their A95 series which are effectively just Sonys branded iteration of Samsungs display But for whatever reason Samsung consistently edges Sony out on color reproductionaccuracy HDR gradients and probably the most obvious gray uniformity which actually translates to how much array artifacting you can see in sub5 nits scenariosprobably the only meaningful artifact QDOLED has Sony also _never supports Freesync_ like WTF You pay a premium for the Sony tax but then have to put up with missing conveniences like that because one supposes Sonys engineering team lives by the philosophy that a minority utility means it can be excluded outright But I will give the A95 series the one W in that it at least supports Dolby Vision As for the question of because the amount of weight each person assigns to those values differs thats why Rtings provides categories They know it you know it I know it They also unambiguously provide the category of best TV meaning in broad strokes that if your use case is broad ie all else being equal here is your TV that wins the most points in each If theres an argument to be made against Rtings judgment then Id be wanting to see another grading resource that does at least as comprehensive a job of detailing the ins and outs of every meaningful model on the market as they do Its not impossiblethere have certainly been facets of consideration that Ive felt they could do better on,mj8zeu4,6.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mja3q55,OneBigBug,,0,2025-03-23 08:20:52,,,,What Im not arguing is that Rtings is a bad source for figuring out if TVs are good Im not even particularly arguing that they shouldnt have a ranking where they decide Best TV What Im saying is that Rtings having a category for Best TV and using some objective measures doesnt mean that they are providing you with an answer for what is objectively the best TV As far as I know they dont claim that Youre just literally not talking about a subject which is objective Thats all Im saying youve admitted you understand that by acknowledging categories So we agree You were not speaking objectively when saying Samsung makes the best TV,mj9bfwo,7.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjc51ya,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-23 17:03:03,,,,Nope I exhaustively elaborated the points that establish the Samsung as the best TV which you are free to argue against or continue ignoring at your convenience Rtings is handy in concretely backing up my observations on point 3 Its honestly almost _too_ convenient how Samsungs QDOLEDs stand out as the obvious winner as speaking as somebody who has used TVs as monitors since 2010 the only other time I can point to when there was no real controversy in propping up a best display might be when LG sheepishly sorted out the latency issues they couldnt firmware patch the previous year and became the first maker to realistically compete with PC monitors on that front forcing the entire industry to do the same You are attempting to claim there can be no objectivity because some people may specifically desire this or that feature which no TV on the market covers in its entirety What you are instead pointing out is that an assessment can possess a trace of subjectivity But when one TV wins in 95 of categories or even just in the majority of categories you dont get to pretend that it isnt objectively the better TV The most subjective point of consideration when it comes to best TV is probably the A95xs Dolby Vision vs Samsungs HDR10 ie if you want dynamic metadata for Netflix or for Amazon Prime AppleTV Sony could have easily won this item by including the _royalty free_ HDR10 support alongside DV but I already noted earlier that they seem to prefer to lock in to their own tune But theyd still have a somewhat worse display either way,mja3q55,8.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjg405d,OneBigBug,,1,2025-03-24 08:23:54,,,,But when one TV wins in 95 of categories or even just in the majority of categories you dont get to pretend that it isnt objectively the better TV Can you give me what you think an exhaustive list of metrics that people might care about when buying a TV I think youre living in some sort of weird obsessed with tech specs of consumer TV land where you forget that for 999 of people couldnt differentiate between OLED panel technologies if you paid them and that the only differentiating factors that matter to people are actually just subjective They include the interface which you specifically eliminated but also everything else about the TV Nope I exhaustively elaborated the points that establish the Samsung as the best TV which you are free to argue against or continue ignoring at your convenience Putting aside for a moment the fact that I disagree that you can have a best TV when consumers mostly care about highly subjective differences by TV nerd tech spec standards this one is better,mjc51ya,9.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjgbkqb,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-24 09:48:43,,,,Can you give me what you think an exhaustive list of metrics that people might care about when buying a TV Why make a patently unreasonable demand when your very next sentence belies its pure rhetoric Rtings should have you covered anyway for 999 of people couldnt differentiate between OLED panel technologies if you paid them Completely irrelevant The topic is best TV and the only people who are even paying attention anymore are the ones who care about the topic of best TV and possibly have an opinion on it by TV nerd tech spec standards this one is better And you can fork over 150000 for a MicroLED that almost certainly beats even that But in a thread of ostensible interest to consumers of garden variety electronics Samsung still makes the best TV is a sensible topic while prosumer reference monitors are available if you ever decide to give up on buying a car isnt Its the same logic that Rtings applies when determining the price bracket for their reviews,mjg405d,10.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjgg3wi,OneBigBug,,2,2025-03-24 10:34:12,,,,I want to repeat that the thing I replied to was not Samsung makes the best TV it was I was only speaking objectively when referring to Samsung as making the best TV My whole objection here is that you cant say a TV is objectively the best because thats not how objectivity works Is it the best Or is it the best for the money Well how much money If youve got 200 dont buy a Samsung If youve got 2000 maybe buy a Samsung If youve got 20000 dont buy a Samsung Given that how can you say Samsung makes the best TV If you can spend 10x less why cant you spend 10x more Bringing price into the equation massively changes the scope of your claim Isnt that an important caveat Really my whole point is that what youre claiming as important objective qualities are an infinitesimal subset of things people actually care about when buying a TV So how can you possibly claim one TV is best Youre automatically rejecting all the things that most people who buy TVs think are important differences between TVs so Ill be really specific using the kind of thing youre talking about The LG C4 has greater colour accuracy than the S90D What if colour accuracy is really important to me Can you tell me objectively how much it should matter that the Samsung is worse given it is better on other metrics Theres no 95 of categories or majority of categories because not all categories are equal the amount each one matters differs by the individual and there are a virtually infinite number of them Like do you think theres an objectively best car An objectively best house An objectively best plane You cant have things that vary on a million different qualities have an objective best,mjgbkqb,11.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjgoi3d,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-24 11:46:56,,,,Really my whole point is that what youre claiming as important objective qualities are an infinitesimal subset of things people actually care about when buying a TV So how can you possibly claim one TV is best Because 1 when you find a consumer who _does_ understand what theyre buying and wants to get their hands on the best your concern here is invalidated and 2 if your minority was truly of little consequence then the likes of Rtings would be out of jobsinstead a million people have depended on them to sort out the good from the bad The LG C4 has greater colour accuracy than the S90D What if colour accuracy is really important to me Then as long as you actually _do_ care about color accuracy youd still get the S90D because The vast majority of the minor difference in raw color accuracy can be almost completely sorted out via the TVs comprehensive nonservice menu color tweaks A professional calibration is _not_ necessary for that Its actually a near certainty that most of it is solved simply by setting the TVs color scheme to Warm 2 which is a Samsung user tradition Like Rtings noted if you simply measure the TV out of the box its going to be a little too blue All Samsungs do this including QLEDs Again _provided you care about color like you say_ the difference in color gamut representation between the two models is vastly more important Do you want HDR or not Im honestly surprised you brought up color at all Incidentally if this is a sincere concern of yours I strongly recommend an AB at a brick and mortar so you can see for yourself Like do you think theres an objectively best car An objectively best house An objectively best plane Strawmen And maybe thats been your issue all along You have possibly internalized a false equivalency There can be and have been objectively best cameras best CPUs best GPUs etc Maybe I can even help you with this If you cant find a website whose goal is to compare competing products in a category and figure out which ones do their jobs better whereupon they determine specimens that stand out as being head and shoulders above their competition then consider it disqualified Cars for example is too broad and youd never find an absolute winneralthough you perhaps could have in the early 20th century EVs on the other hand could definitely someday find a clear winner,mjgg3wi,12.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mjkmmbm,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-25 00:04:17,,,,I sure hope you arent paying 2000 for a TV Your problem is that you refused to argue against my points Thats not really a conversation of merit I cant help but imagine you find it _inconvenient_ that a site like Rtings quantifies the actual differences between TVs Please dont be surprised if they stubbornly continue to find the Samsung flagship QDOLED to be the cream of the crop Though since Sony buys their panels from Samsung its not beyond conception that they could drop in all the QOL features theyve been leaving out narrow the gaps in WYSIWYG and justify their Sony tax premium by actually edging out the Samsung for once,mjh72wx,14.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mjkzc9z,Fredasa,,1,2025-03-25 01:17:59,,,,Respond to that point directly But in a thread of ostensible interest to consumers of garden variety electronics Samsung still makes the best TV is a sensible topic while prosumer reference monitors are available if you ever decide to give up on buying a car isnt Its the same logic that Rtings applies when determining the price bracket for their reviews If that is too ambiguous what I am saying is that there is a blatant bracket for this kind of thing something that you understand perfectly well and Rtings obviously does and trying to shoehorn in 10xpriced specialty electronics in service of a hill to die on is a shit argument that I really wish youd drop,mjkul1x,16.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mjluo6s,OneBigBug,,1,2025-03-25 04:48:57,,,,This is my whole point Youre asking me to drop the whole essence of my point The ridiculousness with which you regard me including a reference display in the running for best is specifically the ridiculousness Im trying to point out Youre talking about best Unspecified and unqualified If what youre talking about is best for the money then Hisense or whatever Im not actually trying to work out optimal value per dollar TV manufacturers makes the best TV If youre not talking about best for the money then the answer isnt Samsung Maybe its the Flanders Scientific maybe its some miniLED maybe its something in a lab somewhere But there is no such thing as an unqualified best Its always including a bunch of things that you assume are the only important criteria but which other people dont necessarily agree are the important criteria The fact that you want to dismiss other things because you think they dont count without rational justification is precisely what makes your commentary on best nonobjective,mjkzc9z,17.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj6wm94,Y34rZer0,,5,2025-03-22 19:14:48,,,,This reminds me of something off topic that happened very recently My father purchased a 600 Sonus sound bar I think its quite simple only one or two inputs I think However you couldnt do a thing with it until you downloaded the app to your phone and went through all the set up process I understand they do that so that people dont skip the set up and become disappointed with their product but its a high end speaker nobody is purchasing this who isnt the type of person to dig right into the AV settings But the actual problem was that the app didnt work particularly well you had to first connect to it with the phone and then configure it to connect to your local WiFi network so it had Internet access also control from anywhere within range of your network Without this step the thing literally does not work It just ignores whatever audio input you plug into it After literally four hours trying to set it up and getting in contact with their customer support required us to put a bunch of pointless settings into our router it still wasnt working I remember my dad just sitting there looking at the thing lol Eventually great working and to be perfectly honest Not that impressed Especially for AU600,mj67815,2.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj6fpsi,qa3rfqwef,,12,2025-03-22 17:45:17,,,,Counter andecdotal experience Own a Samsung 4K OLED S95B Firmware for it has been honestly a nightmare with each update fucking with the image quality settings and I have to calibrate it with different settings to compensate every update The onboard smart stuff is beyond unusable and the number of hoops I need to jump through to use certain display settings in combination with each other is infuriating The fact I need to pretend to my TV that my PC is a bluray player to unlock certain features is asinine I just want to have my TV act as basically a giant monitor I watch media on and yet it fights me on anything I want to do,mj6d0mi,1.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj6mrbu,qa3rfqwef,,2,2025-03-22 18:21:56,,,,Depending on the refresh rate certain firmware versions would change which display modes were available I avoided Game Mode entirelyit was too confusing It completely overhauled the UI and altered how HDR worked I also had to unlock the service menu which they tried to lock down further in a firmware update using thirdparty software just to disable the broken autodimming features Otherwise the display would randomly start dimming for no reason,mj6lllj,3.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mj7cvj3,jspurlin03,,2,2025-03-22 20:41:52,,,,We had a Samsung washer that rusted completely to shit in less than five years and that could have been prevented with correct galvanizing or better paint _That_ Samsung washer was purchased with Samsung recall money from a washer that also was less than five years old and could literally shake itself to pieces using standard settings available from the factory we did not have that happen but customers did Samsungs first shot at a fix was a sticker that just overlaid the highvibration setting in hopes customers would forget to use it Our Samsung fridge isnt _terrible_ but the icemaker kind of sucks Not buying Samsung stuff in the future,mj6d0mi,1.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj7e14l,mdonaberger,,1,2025-03-22 20:48:04,,,,Man I remember when this happened with my Wink hub which was an early attempt at making a modern IoT smart hub It just had radios for different wireless standards a wifi chip and some tooling that made it possible to control your lights while you were away One evening Wink issued a standard routine firmware update but only realized when it had completed that they shipped a firmware update with an expired SSH certificate meaning they couldnt even SSH into the hubs to fix the problem and issue a new cert They sent out emails to their entire customer base saying we fucked up bad and need you to ship your hub to us so we can manually reflash the chip in our offices They were covering the postage but if you had smart lights that was sort of the only way most folks had on hand to control them beyond just switching them on and off via the lamp By some miracle I guess they discovered a zero day exploit and were able to get into the hubs and revive them remotely Like three months later they started charging a subscription fee to use your existing setup I eWasted it and moved to Phillips Hue which was spensie but has yet to let me down,,0.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj6a3bu,Laucien,,3,2025-03-22 17:16:27,,,,It can fail so badly that it doesnt even boot to a point in which you can put it into any sort of recovery mode At that point your only solution is flashing the firmware again throuhg a direct connecton to he board as in soldering some leads and connecting that to a computer Or replacing the chip that stores the initial part of the bootloader One example can be that youre updating the biosfirmware on your compuers motherboard and the power fails right at the same time You can end up in a situation in which it cant boot and you cant continue the process or flash another version because it cant even get to the part where you can select that option Granted most modern hardware has failsafes for that but yeah,mj69cem,1.0,1jhcmdz
comment,mj6ce1x,ABetterKamahl1234,,3,2025-03-22 17:28:19,,,,Firmware is near hardware level software it basically tells hardware how to be hardware A bad firmware can cause this to not function properly to such a degree you cant get it into the mode for updating firmware or a recovery mode in which you can do so This is called Bricking as it turns whatever technology into a paperweight that isnt functional These devices dont have operating systems like a phone or PC those devices do have firmware but that firmware is basically translating between the software and hardware It rarely gets updated as well,mj69cem,1.0,1jhcmdz

comment,mj6s4lz,Techline420,,2,2025-03-22 18:50:42,,,,Same way as when your firmware update goes wrong and there is no backup You turn on your device processor tries to fetch the first instructions from memory but there is only garbage or nothing So nothing happens Only way is to swap out the memory chip with one where the correct firmware is installed or if there is a connector inside you can use a programmer the device not the person to write a working firmware to it Thats the more likely version Either way someone with the correct tools needs to have physical access to the device But it is a huge oversight and should not happen in this day and age,mj6o91u,1.0,1jhcmdz
