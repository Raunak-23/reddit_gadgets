comment,n6nyylb,hosky2111,,27,2025-08-03 08:56:29,,,,They shipped surface Duo 1 and 2 which both ran Android People have just found some prototype devices on a Chinese site Surface duo 2 lite which was a cancelled cheaper version of Duo 2 Surface Andromeda which was a prototype from before Duo that ran Microsofts own Andromeda OS instead of Android Surface Duo 1 prototypes with rear facing cameras which wasnt implemented until Duo 2 and arguably in a less elegant way Surface Neo which was a dual screen tablet meant to run Windows X cancelled OS which basically became Windows 11 None of these appear to be working None of these are new discoveries and all have been seen in some manner before like the Duo 1 prototype was shown to MKBHD in a video visiting Microsoft I believe Its more just interesting that people are getting their hands on these weird devices which were never meant to see the light of day,n6nxnn5,1.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6okh9s,Dio44,,3,2025-08-03 12:09:55,,,,The windows version was awful as the UI was not adjusted to the small screen successfully It was a nightmare to use and clunky as hell The innovation came with how thin it was which was pretty cutting edge for the time but when you realize its because so much hardware was sacrificed it becomes clear while nobody else makes a phone this thin The black matte finish was much nicer in my opinion than the white that they went with with the newer devices Cool little piece of trivia These devices though not successful were heavily pushed for a product placement in Hollywood Even the larger tablet that was never released is in a Netflix movie,n6nyylb,2.0,1mgebkg

comment,n6okmpa,Javamac8,,3,2025-08-03 12:10:59,,,,As I recall a big point of failure for Windows Phone was compatibility with x86 platforms With WindowsonARM seemingly solved would now be a good time for another attempt at this,,0.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6oynki,persiyan,,1,2025-08-03 13:41:00,,,,You must be thinking of windows rt not windows phone windows phone was for phones which do not run on x86,n6okmpa,1.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6p0j3x,Javamac8,,1,2025-08-03 13:51:35,,,,I get that but I thought part of the strategy was to have the mobile editions of Office products work with their desktop counterparts but they couldnt make it work at the time Now with these Snapdragon laptops as a working product it seems like Windows Phone may be a viable path again,n6oynki,2.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6p11h9,persiyan,,1,2025-08-03 13:54:29,,,,Idk about that but I doubt ppl were buying phones to use ms office Im just saying x86 wasnt why windows phone failed,n6p0j3x,3.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6p358y,Javamac8,,1,2025-08-03 14:06:15,,,,lol I think were misunderstanding each other a bit x86 will be around for a while But when MS was trying to make Windows Phone a thing they were trying to make both platforms work together Having access to Office while on the go would be hugely useful Its a big part of why O365 got pushed so hard other than SaaS being a moneyprinting machine I am curious what the next ten years will look like for ARMbased computing Will they slowly take over the desktop market Will it be relegated to mobile only or will chip development focus on highperformance options for office use,n6p11h9,4.0,1mgebkg
comment,n6osa3o,Teknizion,,1,2025-08-03 13:02:49,,,,Owned the duo 1 and hardware wise it felt insane Incredible thin and the hinge was amazing Software was bad and you couldnt really use it as a phone,,0.0,1mgebkg
