post,1kak3id,diacewrb,GPUs are so bulky now that Asus is using gyroscopes to detect sagging,2836,2025-04-29 09:52:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1kak3id/gpus_are_so_bulky_now_that_asus_is_using/,375.0,gadgets,,,,
comment,mpmtg9l,joestaff,,1382,2025-04-29 09:59:07,,,,Why not provide some adjustable stick pillar or mounting bracket Seems like itd be cheaper than using up space to add a gyroscope,,0.0,1kak3id
comment,mpmtzz7,TheRageDragon,,1080,2025-04-29 10:04:36,,,,Whoa whoa we dont use such primitive means to fix complex issues This is not just a gyroscope its AI poweredTM and it will only increase the cost by just 199 Youre spending 1200 already on our mid range cards anyway so youre good for it right champ GPU company probably,mpmtg9l,1.0,1kak3id

comment,mpok952,AlwaysRushesIn,,10,2025-04-29 16:16:35,,,,Thats just another layer for them to extract dollars from the consumer Why ship the product with a physical support that both fixes and prevents the problem when you could add expensive tech that tells you if you need to buy the physical support that is sold separately Are we seeing why unregulated capitalism is a bad thing yet,mpo27t0,4.0,1kak3id
comment,mppmsso,nukem996,,1,2025-04-29 19:20:26,,,,Its not just to inform you its to inform them when you make an RMA This gives them another reason to deny your claim,mpo27t0,4.0,1kak3id

comment,mpnyq6t,funguyshroom,,4,2025-04-29 14:31:30,,,,My Gigabyte came with an Lshaped bracket which screws directly on top of the mobos bottom right two mounting holes So it is more versatile height wise but I could see it being too long for shorter cases,mpmvhqo,2.0,1kak3id

comment,mpocfwv,CatWeekends,,1,2025-04-29 15:38:11,,,,Miniscule definitely helps when youre shipping cards and components all over the world Id also have to imagine that SMD gyroscopes are way cheaper to make and easier to integrate than an adjustable GPU bracket,mpmvi3d,2.0,1kak3id
comment,mpshqn8,APJustAGamer,,1,2025-04-30 05:02:54,,,,Yup just a quick search in a component store they have it at 204 Although you gotta add it to the hardware design and validate the design which also would include a new process in the manufacturing that includes stock and assembly process process means time time equals money also process has to be validated Adding one more point it was hard to find a source for ASUS or an specific GPU but lets say that during the first half of 2024 182M graphics cards were sold for fun lets say 30 will have the gyro that is 546M GPUs 546Mx204 1082M And that is just afun 30 in 12 of the year This usually takes a year or 2 in planning Because it could be more than a 30M investment for the year Also include the SW development for the accelerometer validation We could do the same for the bracket But they surely analyze this options and many more and thinking in good faith the gyro is the cheaper option lol Potentially because they can use the SW for warranty claims,mpocfwv,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mppk1kt,Flipdip3,,1,2025-04-29 19:07:01,,,,They are making the silicon already they could literally just build a MEMS gyroscope into the die,mpocfwv,3.0,1kak3id

comment,mpobme7,RampantAI,,1,2025-04-29 15:34:16,,,,Asus can probably source them for 1 each and they are quite tiny Still feels like a gimmick though as it doesnt actually solve the problem,mpmvi3d,2.0,1kak3id

comment,mpofxo2,narwhal_breeder,,5,2025-04-29 15:54:43,,,,adding one reel to a PNP like 7 of labor GPU BOMs are huge as is Drop in the bucket Even the cost of firmware development for a gyro driver amortized over all of the cards is probably in single digit cents,mpnke1j,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mpopbid,censored_username,,2,2025-04-29 16:41:14,,,,Like 5 cents It takes like an hour maybe to add it to the pcb design Its one extra reel for the pick and place machine which might take like one second extra to place it Its just another device on a shared I2C bus shouldnt take more than a few days of programmer time to actually implement the features,mpnke1j,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mpnv4hl,Emmystra,,1,2025-04-29 14:13:24,,,,I cant really answer that as Im not in that industry but I would guess very little as their entire pipeline is already set up to attach similar small electronic components I dont see why this would be any different from say a capacitor,mpnke1j,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mpsi2od,APJustAGamer,,1,2025-04-30 05:05:36,,,,The chip they are using found it at 204 the cheapest Although you gotta add it to the hardware design and validate the design which also would include a new process in the manufacturing that includes stock and assembly process process means time time equals money also process has to be validated Adding one more point it was hard to find a source for ASUS or an specific GPU but lets say that during the first half of 2024 182M graphics cards were sold for fun lets say 30 will have the gyro that is 546M GPUs 546Mx204 1082M And that is just afun 30 in 12 of the year This usually takes a year or 2 in planning Because it could be more than a 30M investment for the year Also include the SW development for the accelerometer validation We could do the same for the bracket But they surely analyze this options and many more and thinking in good faith the gyro is the cheaper option lol Just because they can use the SW for warranty claims,mpnke1j,3.0,1kak3id

comment,mpod01i,Madpup70,,1,2025-04-29 15:40:50,,,,An adjustable pillar would actually be my most preferred option The brackets they have started shipping with cards are really hit or miss on whether or not they will work with whatever motherboard you end up using When I got my 4080 super I actually had to take a file to it the bracket to get it to fit around the front panel USB wiring on my board But that still felt like a better option than using a stack of quarters to prop up my card,mpmtg9l,1.0,1kak3id

comment,mppm59h,tastyratz,,2,2025-04-29 19:17:15,,,,Thunderbolt cables can support PCIE lanes They arent electrically PCIE lanes but its not impossible for them to be I would FAR rather see the x16 slot disappear and be replaced with a BLOCK of thunderbolt ports which I can connect to my graphics card Hell do away with ALL pcie slots going forward and have a row of Thunderbolt connectors like we have a row of sata connectors We could easily have TINY motherboards that way and just bolt the GPU vertically to the bottom tray ATX risers This would solve packaging stress and weight issues while also getting rid of the segmenting wall creating heat issues We are also not limited by PCIE lane speeds here for GPUs like we used to be its just cheaper to have and use less of them Modern graphics cards are not really hurting on pcie 5 x8 thats for sure Thunderbolt 4 is 4x pcie lanes per cable 2 data cables and a power cable and we can completely decouple the GPU from the motherboard This can even be explicitly designed in the next standard Its not unachievable and not nearly the compromise its viewed as EGPU could also easily adapt to this by means of a short bracket to the thunderbolt ports think the old sata to esata slot adapters We wouldnt have to move entirely to egpu but it would be more easily supported with that design,mpnuhu1,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mpnwo7x,gt24,,3,2025-04-29 14:21:12,,,,Early computers ex Amiga had a sidecar which would be an expansion box which would plug into the side of the computer into an exposed connector I would imagine that a modern computer redesign would be a similar sort of thing where another PCIE connector would be facing to the sidewall of the case to the side bottom or top with the intention of plugging in a sidecar case to that which has the GPU and GPU power supply You could also decide to use the internal PCIE connector if you dont want to do the whole sidecar thing Im not saying that idea is a good idea at all Im just saying that there are more options for an external GPU than just using Thunderbolt,mpnuhu1,3.0,1kak3id

comment,mpnxdgi,w1n5t0nM1k3y,,1,2025-04-29 14:24:44,,,,Theres also cost consideration with having to buy a 1000W power supply for your PC as well Smaller power supplies are much simpler Using a 400w or less power supply for the main that requires fewer cables because it doesnt have to power a GPU would make it cheaper The GPU power supply would also be simpler because it could be optimized to only power the single device There are options other than thunderbolt that provide more throughput These cables go up to 200 gigabitsec Obviously they are expensive now but in the future if costs come down it could be a valid option A lot of things might actually be simpler if the GPU was in a different box Your PC case could be much smaller because you dont need to dissipate as much heat and it would have better airflow because you only have to deal with heat output from one source the CPU THen the GPU could be its own box thats optimized to just work properly power itself cool itself You would know that everything works the way its supposed to and not have to worry about something catching on fire because you connected a power cable incorrectly,mpnuhu1,3.0,1kak3id

comment,mprdvfo,Malawi_no,,1,2025-04-30 00:48:32,,,,Yeah or at least have a seperate compartment for the GPU Could be something like a seperate tunnel inside the case with the GPU mounted vertically that could likely be solved by a simple extender cable Alternatively it could go on top below or backside but then you likely need to move the connector on the motherboard altogether Thinking a little more about it I guess the solution with the MB turned 90 and all connectors on top might be the simplest solution Add in a schroud for the GPU and it should be possible to have three dedicated airstreams for PSU GPU and CPU,mpnloyb,2.0,1kak3id

comment,mpq1fzx,Gnash_,,5,2025-04-29 20:30:08,,,,An accelerometer measures proper acceleration which is acceleration relative to freefall Gravity exerts a constant force on an accelerometer that stands still this is how an accelerometer is able to precisely determine tilt without drifting in time Think of how the Wii Wheel was suprisingly precise for Mario Kart Wii and it only used an accelerometer there was no gyroscope This is also how phones are able to tell their orientation they are using the accelerometer not the gyroscope,mppsu1l,2.0,1kak3id

comment,mpq8o3a,NotAHost,,4,2025-04-29 21:04:31,,,,You have acceleration even if youre standing still gravity Accelerometer lose their sense of direction during movement because of movement acceleration as well which is why the gyroscope can compensate for acceleration during movement However once resting a gyroscope can drift and the accelerometer essentially lets you home which way is down Add a magnometer to it and you can home which way is leftright based off the earths magnetic fieldcompass Toss the three together and you have the homing of the accelerometer and magnometer and the amazing accuracy of orientation with the gyroscope,mppsu1l,2.0,1kak3id
comment,mprfsfg,elton_john_lennon,,1,2025-04-30 00:59:10,,,,You have acceleration even if youre standing still gravity Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time When you are standing still or moving with a constant speed rate of change of velocity is zero regardless if in space or in gravitational field In other words acceleration requires change in movement if there is no movement to begin with there is no acceleration or am I missing something Your explanation about a bundle of sensors makes sense but I still dont understand why would OP replace gyro with accelerator and claim that gyro isnt the one telling about the orientation in space edit other post just cleared out what you wrote that accelerometer will also register orientation when static So that basically means that you can stitch together 3 accelerometers for x y and z and have some rudimentary positioning sensor right,mpq8o3a,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mprz7tr,NotAHost,,3,2025-04-30 02:51:57,,,,Easiest way to describe it is that an accelerometer really just measures acceleration forces This means gravity as well as fmass x acceleration If you look up the units for gravitational constant youll see they are the same as acceleration An accelerometer cant distinguish between the two as far as I knowseen However if an object is resting you can make a safe assumption which way is down Yes you can replace a gyro with accelerometers but the issue with accelerometers is that they are susceptible to forces This means if you put a 3axis accelerometer in a car and slam the gasbreaks the sensed orientation will change On the other hand a gyroscope is not susceptible to the forces it only senses when there are changes in orientation It doesnt know which way is down only if its changed direction If you had a perfect gyroscope sensor and calibrated it you could definitely use it for orientation alone However sensors are never perfect and they will drift which is why you need an accelerometermagnetometer to do occasional homing For more on gravitational acceleration,mprfsfg,4.0,1kak3id

comment,mprdsku,elton_john_lennon,,1,2025-04-30 00:48:06,,,,If we didnt have GPUs that consume up to 600w then something like that wouldnt be needed But we do and that cooling is needed and it is a part of the card Absolutely crucial one at that That card wont operate without that cooling so you cant really say it is the card plus the cooling the whole deal is a packet and it wont work any other way You can even put that PCB and GPU chip into the ice cold lake and now you have cooling as big as a lake it doesnt really matter what you use to cool it that cooling mechanism will always have some volume Alternatively if I liquid cool my GPU I can cut the size and weight down dramatically No you cant All you do here is move radiator and fans slightly away from the card but they are still a part of the whole packet and are frankly almost as big as heatpipeaircolled ones sometimes even bigger My point was more that the PCB doesnt go all the way to the end of the heatsink anymore That is correct for some time manufacturers started to extend the cooler beyond PCB which is the best thing that happened to gpu cooling noisewise since deshrouding and noctua fans We should do the exact opposite of ISA because that short PCB and extended cooling allows the air to travel freely through that radiator doesnt require that much static pressure from the fan and makes it easier to point that exhaust out of the PC case,mpqcaj6,3.0,1kak3id
comment,mpngwd2,suicidaleggroll,,13,2025-04-29 12:55:01,,,,No they arent A gyro measures rotation once the computer is set up the bending is done and theres no more rotation a gyro wouldnt measure anything Theyre using an accelerometer to measure what angle the card is sitting at but thats still a shitty solution since they have no way of knowing whether its the card that isnt level or the entire computer case Better option would be a strain gage that detects bending in the PCB,,0.0,1kak3id

comment,mpn52v9,Liroku,,3,2025-04-29 11:37:30,,,,You could also add a cross piece that transfers the weight of the card to the slot bracket on the rear of the case Would work even better if you made the card take up an extra slot to put the support further down at the IO side of the card but even as is it should work,mpmz2cs,1.0,1kak3id

comment,mppv1ui,elton_john_lennon,,4,2025-04-29 19:59:52,,,,and that you can do both But you dont need to that is the point Manufacturer can detect it once in their lab and guesstimate that with that weight this particular card will sag in 99 of vertical cases and just include 1 support beam or bracket in the box,mpn25tz,1.0,1kak3id

comment,mpq72br,squidvett,,1,2025-04-29 20:56:47,,,,I know Tandys IBMs and Commodores all used to sit relatively flat sometimes with their CRT monitor set on top of them But I have not seen any recommended modern selfbuild cases designed for air flow in 20 years when I started building my own Possibly because you need to specifically seek a case configured that way But the fact that GPUs are sold with extra infrastructure indicates a heavier demand for cases that stand vertically like the one I just bought for my new build I didnt see a single horizontalflat case option at excellent tier or above on logical increments and there were no alternatives for the standard vertical cases offered on Amazon or Newegg Hell its more expensive to buy a boring case without flashy RGB coolest rig at the lan party shit in it but thats a tangent Ive thought for over a decade that its weird that PCMR innards keep getting bigger and cases stay the same relative shape Companies are now focused on hiding cables and maximizing airflow which is fine but the source article alone here indicates theres a new problem and GPU scaffolding is only addressing a symptom GPUs are gonna keep growing,mpoyqet,2.0,1kak3id
comment,mppckdq,zekromNLR,,3,2025-04-29 18:30:53,,,,Why not just return to having the motherboard mounted horizontally with the PCIE slots pointed up so that the weight of the card is pushing down into the slot rather than being cantilevered off of it,,0.0,1kak3id
