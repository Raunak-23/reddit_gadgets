comment,lwwtg5b,MCManiac52,,3,2024-11-13 13:09:56,,,,They dont strictly have to but from a logistics and manufacturing point of view it does often make sense to do it that way But its not always the case Usually the Titan90 and 80 series will be using the highest binned chip with the more capable ones going to Titans and 90s and the lesser to the 80 series The 70 and 60 series generally use a slightly different design to the chip due to the size constraints of the smaller cards Based on the same architecture still but the components on the silicon may be in different places to better make use of the smaller die area Those differences will determine how easily a higher sku chip can be used on a lower tier cards though often this is what leads to the 70Ti and super cards they use a cut down 80 series chip which will be slightly better still than the full fat 70 series and makes use of the excess they cant package into a 90 or 80 series say if some of the cuda cores are defective or the interconnects for a memory module they can simply work around it because the silicon already supports more than they need The same is true for the high end cards those themselves are just cut down enterpriseprofessional GPUs The 4090 is actually just the lower binned chips from the RTX6000 which supports double the memory and about 1500 more cuda cores but will run you 510x the price because it supports professional workloads Its becoming less relevant as more architectures move to a chiplet style design like AMD and Intel have been doing with CPUs and to an extent Apple with their silicon That way you simplify the manufacturing to just the individual components for instance cude modules rt modules memory cache and combine them into the final GPU,lwszua0,3.0,1gpj3la

comment,lwus52g,gfewfewc,,1,2024-11-13 02:30:47,,,,They use silicon that is designed to be smaller it not only means they can get more chips from each wafer smaller size for each but the wafers are also circular so you can get more of the edge area to be usable but also higher percentage of usable chips since a larger size means more area that can be defective sometimes it is in a section that can be cut down as you mention for a different SKU but certain areas are critical to the function of the overall chip The 40 series for example had five different chips ranging from 159 to 609 square millimeters in size,lwszua0,3.0,1gpj3la

comment,lwsn0hx,MCManiac52,,3,2024-11-12 19:21:08,,,,Pretty much yeah gaming GPUs are already a tiny fraction of Nvidias business they barely care about the high end cards so they hype them up and get their sales metrics then when the sales start to die down they know to release the lower tier models Its a bit more involved but thats the summary lol Makes me think of that time with the pascal series where they released a Titan for everyone who wanted the fastest card Then release the Ti of the 80 series which completely destroyed the titan making those who brought it very unhappy so what did nvidia do Follow it up with another Titan They got the whale money 3 times that generation,lws6f05,3.0,1gpj3la

comment,lwrtal7,ICC-u,,7,2024-11-12 16:49:35,,,,It seems a smart move Companies mainly make games for consoles and PC gets a similar game with higher FPS or a few extra graphics options Owning a 5090 wont change gameplay much for 23 years Sure some people will say they need to play 4k 120hz with RT but theyre literally the 1 AMD can then focus on the 95 of the gaming market who dont buy 80 and 90 series cards,lwr83mv,3.0,1gpj3la

comment,lwr5xux,pay_student_loan,,2,2024-11-12 14:43:52,,,,New titles at 4K and 60 fps with all the ray tracing bells and whistles will still bring a 4090 to its knees but if youre a 1440p gamer then not really Going to be rocking my 3090 for several more years easily But some people just want the latest like the folks who are buying the 9800X3D My 5800X3D is probably going to last me a freaking long time before I personally feel the need to upgrade,lwqylat,2.0,1gpj3la
comment,lwsliib,oxpoleon,,1,2024-11-12 19:13:31,,,,But titles at 4K60 with all the bells and whistles also bring a 2080Ti 3070 and 4060 to their knees and those are all much cheaper cards to get the same unplayable experience on,lwr5xux,3.0,1gpj3la
