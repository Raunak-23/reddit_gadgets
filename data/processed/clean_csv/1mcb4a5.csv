comment,n5tr4r4,TheNewTonyBennett,,2,2025-07-29 17:14:10,,,,Fascinating how a law makes it so with Death Stranding the one thing you cant do before a certain age is connect with others to help them tackle the game easier reminding them that they arent alone and them you Which is one of the major themes that the game insists correctly upon that those connections are necessary for humanity period Theres a really weird type of fully juxtaposed rhyme in all of that,,0.0,1mcb4a5

comment,n5tmibd,SnakesFan98,,3,2025-07-29 16:53:14,,,,Sony rolled out the age verification process as a pilot program in the UK and Ireland last year This pilot program is at the moment only targeting people trying to create new PSN accounts in either the UK or Ireland region The reason that I say this is because I too have a PSN account based in the UK and created it almost 10 years ago Yet Sony hasnt asked me to verify my age so far So apparently this pilot program is for people in the UK and Ireland who are trying to set up a new PSN account,n5sfp0c,4.0,1mcb4a5
