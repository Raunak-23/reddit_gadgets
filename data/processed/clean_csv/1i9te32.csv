comment,m956k0c,StressfulRiceball,,8,2025-01-25 19:47:40,,,,The degree of hardware optimization they do is insane Im an Android user but games always run about 2x faster on equal gen iPhones despite having MUCH lower hardware spec Enough to get me to switch to iPhones for a generation just for gaming performance alone I mean I still went back to Android for UI and everything else but man the gaming was great,m94trp0,1.0,1i9te32
comment,m95xexw,andynormancx,,26,2025-01-25 22:04:18,,,,Equal gen iPhones are not lower hardware spec than the Android phones Yes they have less RAM in some years a lot less But Apples CPUs and GPUs are still way ahead of the ones the Android manufacturers have available to them,m956k0c,2.0,1i9te32

comment,m99emqy,andynormancx,,3,2025-01-26 13:18:45,,,,It is true that they are catching up and last year on multicore they were getting pretty close But that is by throwing extra cores at the problem and there arent many workloads that max out all those 8 cores and still plenty of workloads that barely touch two cores We all know benchmarks arent a perfect comparison but it is the best we have to go on for a quick comparison On Geekbench 6 multicore weve got the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 devices at around 6700 The iPhone 16 is at around 8500 So Apple are still 27 ahead there even with two fewer cores If you look at single core you have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 devices around 2100 and the iPhone 16 at 3300 So on single core Apple is still 57 faster And theyll also be around the same amount faster on 2 3 4 5 and 6 cores Single core is still the more important metric to compare to see how fast devices will actually be to use However I note the Oppo Find X8 Pro with its MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chipset The iPhone is only 26 ahead of it in single core and it is pretty much level on multicore with 8 cores And it does look like the Qualcomm side is going to make a bigger leap in 2025 than normal with a single core score of around 3100 That would be very nearly caught up with last years iPhone so things definitely have changed from two or three years ago Will be interesting to see how much of a leap Apple makes in 2025 I suspect not as much as QualcommMediaTek have in the last couple of years And yes a significant part of those leaps on both sides are down to TSMCs manufacturing tiers rather than AppleQualcommMediaTeks CPU designs I probably overplayed my hand with still way ahead lets pretend I said still ahead However the claim I was countering was iPhones have MUCH lower hardware spec with the implication that over multiple generations games were only faster on iPhones because on Android the arent optimised enough or they are being held back by having to run on low end Android devices as well When the truth is if games were running faster on iPhones over the years it was mainly because the iPhone hardware was much faster than the Android side,m97vtbm,4.0,1i9te32
comment,m95xgau,MultiMarcus,,12,2025-01-25 22:04:30,,,,Well no that is not really true Apple has best in class chips didnt they win the performance race of all the phones last year They skimp out on RAM but a lot of ram on phones has always felt like a way for Android makers to mitigate software inefficiencies Also it is kind of the video game console thing of the largest console sales wise being the focus iPhones are the most popular single brand of phone and Apple users notoriously are worth more as they spend more money,m956k0c,2.0,1i9te32
comment,m957295,_RADIANTSUN_,,6,2025-01-25 19:50:11,,,,This is more due to Android developers targeting lower end phones than any special optimization on the part of Apple,m956k0c,2.0,1i9te32
comment,m9579l9,StressfulRiceball,,9,2025-01-25 19:51:12,,,,I mean my iPhone 6S ran games better than my Galaxy Note 8 lmfao much higher FPS and instant loading Edit nvm I misunderstood your point youre saying the FPS difference is from app optimization I would assume its very easy for devs to optimize for Apple devices since theyre heavily standardized as well,m957295,3.0,1i9te32
comment,m958hf3,_RADIANTSUN_,,-6,2025-01-25 19:57:19,,,,Yea because they probably targeted the 6S whereas the Note 8 was a high end premium device that was still a relatively small slice of the Android market so nobody specifically targets it unless Samsung explicitly collabed with them like Fortnite Specially if you had an Exynos model,m9579l9,4.0,1i9te32
comment,m95cj8b,oriolid,,10,2025-01-25 20:17:54,,,,Samsung is almost half of Android market so I think it would make sense to optimize for them But if Galaxy Note is a high end phone shouldnt games made for slower phones just run faster on it,m958hf3,5.0,1i9te32
comment,m96bret,_RADIANTSUN_,,0,2025-01-25 23:22:05,,,,Samsung isnt one flagship Galaxy S phone they have a much more fragmented phone lineup than Apple the best selling Android phone last year was Samsung Galaxy A15 4G ie not one of the flagship Galaxy S lineup comes with a considerably shittier MediaTek chipset,m95cj8b,6.0,1i9te32
comment,m98s246,oriolid,,2,2025-01-26 09:53:31,,,,Youre absolutely right And for example Galaxy A15 is actually 19 slightly different models SMA155F SMA155FDSN SMA155M SMA155MDS SMA155P SMA155R and SMA156B SMA156BDS SMA156P SMA156PDS SMA156U SMA156U1 SMA156U1DS SMA156W SMA156PN SMA156PDSN SMS156VL SMA156M SMA156E SMA156EDSN for 5G I understood the discussion was about why the flagship models are so underperforming though The 2 brand is by the way Xiaomi and everyone knows they are crap but they are cheap so who cares,m96bret,7.0,1i9te32
comment,m95xviu,andynormancx,,6,2025-01-25 22:06:44,,,,If they Android developers had targeted the low end phones then it would have run even faster on the much faster CPUGPU on the Note 8 The Note 8 ran several times faster than the low end phones of that year,m958hf3,5.0,1i9te32
comment,m96b6wz,_RADIANTSUN_,,2,2025-01-25 23:18:56,,,,Games are limited in resolution and fps on phones for performance reasons its not like on PC where better hardware higher FPS for example Eg Doesnt matter if you have a 144Hz 1440p display many games will just be locked to 60FPS 720p or 1080p Maybe the 6S was targeted so they could push better graphics etc on that specific device I guess it depends on the specific game I really havent run into any games that the top Samsung of the year doesnt run basically perfectly,m95xviu,6.0,1i9te32
comment,m95km9m,Fit_Specific8276,,2,2025-01-25 20:58:58,,,,that makes no sense its not gonna run worse on better hardware just because it wasnt the target,m958hf3,5.0,1i9te32
comment,m96beil,_RADIANTSUN_,,3,2025-01-25 23:20:06,,,,Theyre not specific about what they mean by performing worse eg Many games are locked to lower res and framerate,m95km9m,6.0,1i9te32

comment,m9580tx,PancAshAsh,,5,2025-01-25 19:54:59,,,,Bigger batteries faster charging Phones are already extremely optimized for SWAP and the only way to get a bigger battery at this point is to sacrifice size and weight Faster charging is also not likely to be a priority simply due to the fact that faster charging of bigger batteries requires higher and higher C values which beyond a certain point becomes infeasible,m94yhye,1.0,1i9te32
comment,m95jqhs,lowcrawler,,8,2025-01-25 20:54:31,,,,then give me a phone thats a mm thicker and double my battery size and improve the telephoto zoom Everyone puts huge cases on them anyway at least make the phone big for a reason,m9580tx,2.0,1i9te32
comment,m95zhi7,andynormancx,,-3,2025-01-25 22:15:17,,,,That doesnt work The phones are already not much thicker than the battery So you are adding 1mm to a battery that is already around 5mm thick So you just cant get double the battery size youll get more like 20 more To double the battery size you need to be adding more like 5mm to the thickness of the phone Making the phone not far off twice as thick,m95jqhs,3.0,1i9te32
comment,m96mu1f,Atlonix,,6,2025-01-26 00:24:15,,,,They sure didnt care about adding more mm for the camera bumps Phones these days are so big anyway there should be enough space for a battery that lasts a full day of intensive use I think in general for manufacturers theres no incentive to change usually the main reason people buy new phones is because of the battery life,m95zhi7,4.0,1i9te32
comment,m96p0vd,Firestone140,,1,2025-01-26 00:36:25,,,,Yeah I really dislike the making my iPhone16 wobbly Its just wasted space which even my case doesnt entirely make up for Why not make it a thicker phone and fill it up with battery I dont really care about the weight but say 50 more battery time Count me in,m96mu1f,5.0,1i9te32
comment,m99gpj9,andynormancx,,1,2025-01-26 13:32:48,,,,Because they dont think enough people would want a much bigger and heavier phone If they thought lots of people would buy it theyd make it There are phones like you are describing on the Android side But they a pretty niche and you dont see many people using them even though they are available most of the people I see with them are tradespeople because the phones tend to also be designed to cope with abuse So the truth is the market for big arse heavy phones just isnt big enough for companies like Apple to target,m96p0vd,6.0,1i9te32
comment,m99iuv1,Firestone140,,1,2025-01-26 13:46:53,,,,It begs the question if thats really a thing Do people ACTUALLY want thinner phones or do phone companies just assume we do Same goes for the weight At first when mobile phones started emerging they were huge so making them smaller of course was a thing But later on Ive never asked for it and dont care if its a few millimeters thicker making the camera bump stick out less,m99gpj9,7.0,1i9te32

comment,m94vpso,audigex,,2,2025-01-25 18:55:09,,,,Yeah exactly I do use GPT and Claude etc a little theyre a little faster than Googling for some things eg earlier I asked GPT what colour shirt buttons were for a formal tuxedo and what colour for a more general suit and it saved me a minute of reading but thats about the level I find value with it Or find me a waterproof zigbee sensor that works with home assistant again saving me doing some trawling by giving me a few suggestions to look into To be clear I can definitely see potential value in AI if I could have my noisecancelling AirPods in and have the AI selectively block out the speech around me and translate it to English while leaving other sounds intact for example then that would be HUGE when travelling And some of the photo stuff is cool and has real value combining photos where people are looking away or removing someones plusone ex partner from a wedding photo etc theres some cool stuff going on there and with upscaling I like being able to take 12 megapixel photos on my oldass camera and upscale it to look better when printed at 30x20 But what Apple is doing right now really adds very little value for me beyond night mode photos which is probably the only thing they do right now that I actually really use,m94rsoy,3.0,1i9te32
comment,m94xeod,Calvykins,,1,2025-01-25 19:03:10,,,,Yeah at best it will save graphic designers and copy writers from having to deal with the lowest quality customers who dont want to pay them anyway The amount of training and money needed to make robots valuable workers could also just be spent on actual workers Also paying attention to CEOs talking about AI versus the reality of AI is so funny Its so obvious AI has no practical day to day impact but theyre sure selling it like it does,m94vpso,4.0,1i9te32
