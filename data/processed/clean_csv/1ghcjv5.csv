comment,luwfb08,wicktus,,293,2024-11-01 18:48:37,,,,When Nvidia release their new Blackwell gaming GPU next year they would have already developed extensively the architecture after it Those things take a lot of time errors trials tests engineering samples etc Its not different for Playstation The PS6 is already in development for sure,,0.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luwtpkb,AuroraFinem,,40,2024-11-01 20:04:36,,,,A lot of the stuff here is mostly design goals than actual design Generally theyre waiting on the parts to either become cheap enough or become available at all They design around unreleased expected processors and graphics cards once those upgraded chips are actually either released or become cheap enough they have the design ready to go and just need to initiate orders for manufacturing,luwfb08,1.0,1ghcjv5

comment,luwvtj5,JukePlz,,39,2024-11-01 20:15:52,,,,Because they hire the cheapest writers that probably dont even enjoy playing videogames and tell them to make clickbait headlines to sub500 words articles and to pump out as many as possible If youre lucky you get some barely related stock image inserted into it along their shitty autoplaying videos massive advertisements and newsletter subscription banners They have zero inventive make zero effort and dont even remotely put the time to make an interesting read Gaming journalism is just regurgitated trash you could find in a better format from news aggregators social media and youtubers,luwgkgw,2.0,1ghcjv5

comment,luxo9qq,m_bob01,,0,2024-11-01 22:56:42,,,,I feel like its easier to dumb a carproduct down once you know the best it can be rather than start out with something on the lower end and try to think of ways to improve it IMO its what apple did with the iPhone 5c almost a decade back and what they do now with old chipsets to refresh older tech,luwdyyd,1.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luwe6up,klonkrieger43,,118,2024-11-01 18:42:51,,,,who is suprised by this Do you think the design and concept teams work fully on one product to the day it is launched A concept team creates concept and when that is done they move on to the next Even then having a lineup where you know you will get out an improved version later youd be an idiot not to design them together How is this news,,0.0,1ghcjv5

comment,luww0xn,Fredasa,,-29,2024-11-01 20:16:58,,,,What Im mostly surprised by is the fact that even though consoles have been low to midrange PCs for the last two gens it still makes sense to at least some people to refer to the process of cobbling a midrange PC as working on the design,luwe6up,1.0,1ghcjv5
comment,lux16ch,YouLostTheGame,,24,2024-11-01 20:44:36,,,,Yeah Did they just pick up the PS5 case off of a shelf Are they just buying the parts off Amazon and putting them together in their living rooms Dont be so fucking stupid,luww0xn,2.0,1ghcjv5
comment,lux9aky,Fredasa,,-26,2024-11-01 21:28:54,,,,Keep firmly in mind that right up until approximately the advent of the PS3 consoles were what a gamer had to buy if they wanted the absolute best gaming experience they could get In order to achieve this console designers had to be innovative and push boundaries Todays consoles are about 90 aligned with PC architecture Nobody is pretending anymore Working on the design in this context means very little more than sussing out with AMD what minor tweaks to implement for what is fundamentally yesteryear PC hardwarewhereas it used to literally mean design in the exact sense that you I and the casual reader understand the word Im not saying you have to be comfortable with this reality but it is what it is And the trajectory of this trend hasnt settled either dont be surprised if the PS6 ends up being a Steamdeck knockoff launched alongside Sonys own PCcompatible Gamepass knockoff,lux16ch,3.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxkmyw,YouLostTheGame,,22,2024-11-01 22:34:46,,,,You are an absolute buffoon Open up a PS5 and youre not going to find a GPU that you can just swap for a new one are you Sure maybe some of the circuitry is similar to what youd find in the components of a PC but you cannot go out there any buy those components yourself Theyre not working away on PC partpicker All of those components are custom Its a zen 2 processor but its one thats unique to the PS5 Those components need to be designed They need to fit the form factor theyre going for They need to fit their cooling requirements They need to be easy to manufacture at scale and at reasonable cost Thats what designers do they work all that out Have a fun thought for you if so little design goes into a PS5 or any modern console presumably youd be able to produce one very easily Youd make a shit load of money Take your cretinous thoughts elsewhere,lux9aky,4.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxn9x2,None,,10,2024-11-01 22:50:45,,,,Keep firmly in mind that right up until approximately the advent of the PS3 consoles were what a gamer had to buy if they wanted the absolute best gaming experience they could get Ive been playing games for 42 of my 45 years and thats simply not true PCs have pretty much always been ahead of consoles Where consoles shine is ease of use and setup and price And those basic advantages have basically never changed And for the record I have built my own PCs AND owned game consoles starting with the Atari back then And I love PCs and consoles Im not biased here,lux9aky,4.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxoaq1,Fredasa,,-7,2024-11-01 22:56:52,,,,Ive been playing games for 42 of my 45 years and thats simply not true PCs have pretty much always been ahead of consoles Dont misunderstand what I said If you wanted hardware that was theoretically the most capable fine you could probably get it with a PC But if you actually take a look at the top 50 games for any given year until basically the end of the Xbox 360 era 9 out of 10 times it was console exclusive And its not as though it was on console but would have been way better on PC either As a quick and succinct example when the Jak Daxter series came out theres absolutely zero way I would have expected a PC to be able to reproduce that kind of game Its 2001 and theres a game that runs at a rock solid 60fps and still looks as good as that NoPC had nothing to compare Thats the phenomenon Im referring to,luxn9x2,5.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luyhl2v,None,,1,2024-11-02 02:01:12,,,,Oh sure if youre talking about sales power consoles have pretty much always been in the lead and yeah the PS3 era is where that really ended My biggest PC gaming time era was then so I know how big a change it was,luxoaq1,6.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxs6mg,One_Minute_Reviews,,-8,2024-11-01 23:20:07,,,,Im sorry you are being downvoted and called an idiot so aggressively by some toxic users here Reading a thread like this makes me not ever want to visit places like rgadgets if this is what counts as people having a discussion Some of your points are valid a cel processor was custom silicon as was everything ps3 and prior Sony even wanted to design their own gpu for the ps3 had to turn to nvidia at the last minute Nowadays its all light customization by comparison and people who say otherwise probably havent read up enough but for some reason have very strong opinions on your intellect and moral fibre Shame on them for addressing you so rudely,luxoaq1,6.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxsxt6,Fredasa,,3,2024-11-01 23:24:39,,,,Sonys hardware division adamantly wanted to make the PS3 as custom as they possibly could Its a rather infamous story Sony let them have at it and unfortunately what they came up with was so hard to develop for that it took quite a long time for multiplatform Xbox 360 PS3 games to start reaching parity rather than simply being better on Xbox 360 And in many cases like Bethesda games and others of that type that never actually happened due to an unfortunate design choice regarding the PS3s RAM I think the shell shock of that episode is what led to Sony finally deciding that simpler PC architecture would be the way forward,luxs6mg,7.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxlgsj,TheNorthComesWithMe,,4,2024-11-01 22:39:46,,,,Keep firmly in mind that right up until approximately the advent of the PS3 consoles were what a gamer had to buy if they wanted the absolute best gaming experience they could get Consoles were competitive with PCs until around the PS1 not the PS3 Even then it was more of a genre split with consoles having dedicated graphics processing to handle sprites while PCs had more CPU power and memory,lux9aky,4.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luxnj2d,Fredasa,,-6,2024-11-01 22:52:17,,,,Consoles were competitive with PCs until around the PS1 not the PS3 I said precisely what I meant The best games were almost entirely exclusive to consoles _plus_ those consoles almost invariably provided the best gaming experience Im not arguing pure theoretical powerIm talking about the reality that single platforms retained an undeniable advantage for a good couple of generations It took the advent of the PS3 for most devs in the West to finally start paying attention to their multiplatform options A phenomenon which finally seems to be catching up to Japanese devs 15 years later,luxlgsj,5.0,1ghcjv5

comment,luwpgy4,CatProgrammer,,0,2024-11-01 19:42:15,,,,But are there enough people who would actually buy the drive specifically because of that Like Id love for them to support it too but its clearly not a priority for them,luwoqev,3.0,1ghcjv5
comment,lux3jbw,_RADIANTSUN_,,5,2024-11-01 20:57:13,,,,Why does it matter if a lot of people are buying the drive SPECIFICALLY because of that Its a drive They should make it a really good BD drive PlayStation has always benefitted from being an exceptional value as a home entertainment center It would be a really nice bonus if it played 4K DV supported 71 surround including Atmos etc I mean that would def be a selling point for SOME people,luwpgy4,4.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luz8jiz,regenerated-hymen,,0,2024-11-02 05:39:07,,,,Yes there is market for that its what helped the PS3 sell more units How old are you,luwpgy4,4.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luz8vjh,CatProgrammer,,3,2024-11-02 05:42:35,,,,There was a market for that when the PS3 came out I already covered how the current market is different in rgadgetscomments1ghcjv5sony_was_working_on_the_ps5_pro_before_the_ps5luwp0hw Plus a PS5 will still play 4K UHD discs just fine it just wont use the Dolby Vision dynamic metadata layer So youll still get HDR but not as good as it could be People who care specifically about DV support are likely to look into dedicated players too due to the issues many lowerend ones have with threelayer discs PS5 included,luz8jiz,5.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luwmn30,BluePeriod_,,7,2024-11-01 19:27:12,,,,Yeah Im sure Sony cant afford it It must be incredibly out of their grasp It must be so incredibly unobtainable to them that it would completely shift the way the company operates,luwlte1,2.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luwp0hw,CatProgrammer,,2,2024-11-01 19:39:51,,,,No its because the cost of including it would not provide any significant benefit to Sony as unlike in the PS3 era with BD there are a lot of cheaper 4K players with DV support Hell Sony TVs didnt even have full DV support until 2021,luwmn30,3.0,1ghcjv5

comment,luwzqdy,Heliosvector,,2,2024-11-01 20:36:51,,,,I know right Sony and Microsoft must be struggling soooooo hard now in this economy of monthly subscription fees Gone are the days of making money from disc sales only and people vying games secondhand that Microsoft and Sony would make no money on Poor Sony and Microsoft,luwlh9w,2.0,1ghcjv5
comment,lv2fzbm,Dairunt,,1,2024-11-02 19:50:27,,,,I understood the sarcasm Im not saying they didnt ask for it the fact that Sony is releasing a console at 700 with LESS features is more of a symptom of the way they do business rather than the harsh economies of video games One of the few things I like about the Series S is that while it is mostly subscriptiondependent the competitive price and the pricetoperformance is spot on Sony is trying to be the new Apple by dividing their user base into people who look for value the majority and the ones that want the premium the ones that spend the most If they want to make more profit while user base is not growing is charging more to the people that will spend I also think the price raise from 400 to 450 has something to do with it Once you make more and more predatory monetization schemes there will be a ceiling to how much you can pocket out of your user base theyve already raised the prices to 70 theyve limited their working IPs they slashed backwards compatibility for their first three consoles theyre doing remakes and remasters of games that run perfectly fine on new hardware and charging a premium for it theyre making log ins with PlayStation accounts mandatory even for singleplayer games theyre shoving every game with DLCs and micro transactions it was a matter of time they charge a premium for their Pro models If this continues on I can bet the Base PS6 will have ads while installing games and you have to buy the PS6 Pro for 999 to get rid of any ads The only way they coursecorrect is by simply shutting down their influx of money Dont give in to Pro models dont buy DLCs that dont give games any value dont preorder cancel any subscription you dont use and spread your opinion on the internet if they go too far It worked with the Xbox One,luwzqdy,3.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luwlrjg,Abba_Fiskbullar,,4,2024-11-01 19:22:32,,,,From what I understand the Pro was designed to be profitable at a 600 price point to compete with the cancelled Xbox Elite The increase in BoM over the base PS5 is marginal so I wouldnt be surprised by a price drop within a year,luwf1lw,1.0,1ghcjv5
comment,luypaw0,SomeBoxofSpoons,,1,2024-11-02 02:55:00,,,,I have a feeling that they counted on component costs dropping more than they have considering this generation has been an outlier in that regard Even since the reveal though I cant help but think that if the console they designed could only profitably be sold at 700 then maybe the console they designed just isnt the best idea,luwf1lw,1.0,1ghcjv5
