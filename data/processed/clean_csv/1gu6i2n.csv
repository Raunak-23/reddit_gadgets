comment,lxwpp21,an0maly33,,8,2024-11-19 10:54:05,,,,Story time back in the late 90s I helped a friend build a PC The case he got was cheap but had a turbo button with 3digit LED that was configured with jumpers We set turbo mode to display 666 Didnt do anything but we liked to joke that Satan made games run better,lxvf3u0,2.0,1gu6i2n
comment,lxx7lyp,Iloveherthismuch,,4,2024-11-19 13:20:01,,,,They missed out some crucial design aspects maybe a chassis lock but disguised as a USB C port etc,lxvf3u0,2.0,1gu6i2n

comment,lxtb5jr,fullload93,,11,2024-11-18 20:32:36,,,,Yes it does The power button uses a green LED instead of a blue one Next to it is a red LED that indicates storage access,lxs4inc,1.0,1gu6i2n
comment,lxumgra,The_Marine_Biologist,,11,2024-11-19 00:48:55,,,,They should have done it without the fake 525 floppy sections Its cool and I want it but I feel like those fake covers let it down and would look better if they just blended in with the overall aesthetic Oh and a programmable turbo button,,0.0,1gu6i2n
comment,m7ip49s,Campervanfox,,5,2025-01-16 21:17:39,,,,the top is a fake panel that can be replaced with a drive i wish they would omit the bottom one and all the front connectors and give us some standard 35 external bays so we can customize our own front ports,lxumgra,1.0,1gu6i2n
comment,lxrq7mm,zoiks66,,26,2024-11-18 15:43:24,,,,I would rather use that case than have one shred of RGB crap in my desktop PC Hopefully the case makes the crunching noise every time there is disk activity,,0.0,1gu6i2n
comment,lxt5q5y,PetroMan43,,7,2024-11-18 20:04:45,,,,Damn right I wish it had a lock and key on the front turbo button and maybe a giant power switch like my ancient IBM,lxrq7mm,1.0,1gu6i2n

comment,lxxim7b,NeverLookBothWays,,3,2024-11-19 14:27:58,,,,The sequence of sounds I miss the most are the ones at startup The hard drive spinning up with the whine of a small fighter jet and then some read actions like its brewing a cup of coffee The sequence of reads from the floppy drives 525 and 35 then the beep as it finishes its POST,lxrq7mm,1.0,1gu6i2n
comment,ly0hrc8,zombienerd1,,2,2024-11-19 23:36:40,,,,There are a few products out there that replicate that sound generally used for vintage machines that have had solid state storage adapted to them Connects in line with the LED and any time it blinks you get the noises,lxrq7mm,1.0,1gu6i2n
comment,lxrxm5b,trainbrain27,,2,2024-11-18 16:22:34,,,,That was the spinning drives which weve nearly eliminated There are both hardware and software solutions I cant recommend any because I havent tried them,lxrq7mm,1.0,1gu6i2n

comment,lxsrtl6,trainbrain27,,2,2024-11-18 18:54:48,,,,Ive got one that meows Ive put it in an external enclosure with a timer to freak people out Be careful plugging them in to data lines even if theyre clean they can drag down performance A customer did everything from a new SSD and never intentionally accessed the old hard drive but the computer was nearly unusable because the OS was trying to maintain the failing drive,lxsfslf,3.0,1gu6i2n
comment,mcljf59,KodakGuy,,2,2025-02-13 19:05:28,,,,cheap old hard drives from pre2010 made that crunching noise that paired with the diskread LED modern HDDs have dampers and more delicate parts that make them practically silent I prefer the crunchy drives,lxrxm5b,2.0,1gu6i2n
comment,mclnwfg,trainbrain27,,3,2025-02-13 19:26:08,,,,When I work on hardware with a crunchy drive my first impression is that this thing is going to fail because louder than normal noises are a BAD THING I have one old one that meows so well my mom thought there was a cat in the house It still works but I only use it for sound effects,mcljf59,3.0,1gu6i2n
comment,mf2hkxl,AbridgedKirito,,1,2025-02-27 13:48:14,,,,nearly eliminated maybe for those of you living in the future already but for us mortals HDDs are still a thing we rely on,lxrxm5b,2.0,1gu6i2n

comment,lxtau4y,fullload93,,6,2024-11-18 20:30:59,,,,Actually looks like it had a DVD drive on top and the bottom fake floppy is for USB drives Looks like a USBC 2x As and maybe a 35mm headphone port,lxsij1q,2.0,1gu6i2n

comment,lxubrcg,BauTek_MN,,3,2024-11-18 23:46:50,,,,Agreed at least make them removable 5 14 blanks and include the fake floppy faces in the box If I did a build in this I would legit love to install a real set of floppy drive,lxsd651,2.0,1gu6i2n
