comment,mozp1ma,Key_Amazed,,11,2025-04-25 16:06:39,,,,Its cute observing the people who want it to fail Theyre going to be severely disappointed To think its going to sell Wii U numbers shows a serious lack of brain cells Wii U failed because of shit marketing The casual audience that makes up Nintendos majority especially after the Wii didnt know it was a new console They thought it was an addon Switch 2 leaves no room for confusion The price of the console itself isnt even that bad and DK Bananza will be the usual 6999 so Im not concerned The price for the Zelda upgrades is awfulif you either dont own them already or dont have NSO in which case its either free or 20 I think which is the exact same price for certain PS4 to PS5 upgrade games like Ghost of Tsushima The discourse is wild Without ragebaiting twitch streamers or YouTubers who are going to buy it anyway on the excuse of it being their job their job should be to avoid the Switch 2 and find other avenues to make money I dont think there would be that much negativity Influencers truly run the online discourse now So few people are able to form their own opinions,,0.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozty91,Jindujun,,2,2025-04-25 16:30:44,,,,Yeah I dont get the whole comparison to WiiU least off all because the Wii U was a great machine but suffered from what you said shit marketing There are a whole bunch of awesome games for the Wii U,mozp1ma,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp02ii6,weegee19,,2,2025-04-25 17:11:36,,,,Zelda upgrades are actually 10 apiece which isnt terrible,mozp1ma,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozxfxq,realKevinNash,,-4,2025-04-25 16:47:35,,,,Its foolish just because the majority never truly does the right thing in terms of gaming Any win is temporary That said i get it because I want that to change I want it to fail because maybe then well start to see some change on pricing in the future even if i know that is the least likely outcome I dont think thats a bad position to hold,mozp1ma,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozlvvb,Ultiman100,,13,2025-04-25 15:51:10,,,,Well see Its the most expensive Nintendo console ever with the highest gaming prices in the industry at a time where international trade is in the direct crosshairs of geopolitics,,0.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozm6fu,None,,6,2025-04-25 15:52:35,,,,Absolutely Probably not the best time to buy for most But on the other hand new Mario Kart,mozlvvb,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,moznlsh,FernandoRocker,,17,2025-04-25 15:59:29,,,,The price of the hardware is extremely competitive Most of the complaints are about the software not the hardware Whats the cheapest Steam Deck price 400 For 450 you get a more powerful Nintendo Switch 2 Better screen HDR VRR 120 Hz an NVIDIA SoC with DLSS and ray tracing silicon more storage removable controllers with builtin mouse sensors a 4K dock The hardware price is perfectly fine,mozlvvb,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozot0r,TheBoBiZzLe,,-9,2025-04-25 16:05:28,,,,And with very very talented people out there I betcha a switch 2 emulator with roms will be running on a steamdeck within a year,moznlsh,2.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozp6d8,FernandoRocker,,5,2025-04-25 16:07:17,,,,You cant emulate a more powerful system on a weaker system Thats not how it works,mozot0r,3.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp05tg7,TheBoBiZzLe,,-3,2025-04-25 17:27:15,,,,Frame skips Performance hacks Custom drivers DS 3DS gamecube Wii wiiu and yes switch Have all been able to run on very low end devices for years Cranking the resolution down to 75 removing a few graphics extras turning off extras They didnt just happen to go full force against emulators months before their announcements Even buying out some of them So yes you can Maybe not 100 as intended But yeah Id bet money switch2 titles will be playable on a steamdeck within a year of launch But consumerism So shrug We dont even really know the chip inside the switch Just rumors Rumors that are saying its power might be around a 2050 Steamdeck is about a 1050ti Thats like a 15 power difference If those rumors are true Only thing Nintendo has started is their AI enhancement swill create graphics similar to 10times the power of the switch Not a huge power increase and if they are relying on AI not power that can all be emulated Or not shrug,mozp6d8,4.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0bfej,nonitoni,,5,2025-04-25 17:53:48,,,,Is that relevant in regards to sales though Most people dont want to go through the setup of emulating modern games 50 more gets you a game with console and full settings without having to constantly toy with it Its not like emulation has ever made a significant dent in console sales in the past,mp05tg7,5.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0bb53,weegee19,,2,2025-04-25 17:53:15,,,,Maybe the early Switch 2 titles Highly doubtful for the later ones,mp05tg7,5.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp02s2w,weegee19,,2,2025-04-25 17:12:53,,,,Steamdeck 2 might be powerful enough able to run a Switch 2 emulator fat chance for the current Steamdeck however,mozot0r,3.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0btpz,TheBoBiZzLe,,-2,2025-04-25 17:55:41,,,,Am I missing something Do we actually know the hardware I went to preorder and checked out the specs and there was absolutely nothing concrete about the actual power HDR10 support up to 120hz maximum of 60fps at 4k supports 120fps at lower supports HDR10 AGAIN Nothing says Mario Kart will run at 120fps 120hz Just says the system supports it shrug Im totally going to buy a year or so down the road Just could personally imagine dumping money into a piece of hardware now without actually knowing whats in it Even more making claims about the actual power without even knowing But guess Nintendo already told us that it will be the biggest launch in gaming history guess we gotta make it happen,mp02s2w,4.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0ezbl,weegee19,,4,2025-04-25 18:10:55,,,,Probably because we have multiple corroborating leaks of the hardware the confirmation of DLSS tells us that its very much based on the Ampere architecture same as the RTX 30x0 series The leaks pointing to a reported performance of 17TFLOPs in handheld mode and 31 TFLOPs in docked mode which line up closely enough with what Nvidia said about the Switch 2 being 10x more powerful as well as a display thats a lot more capable than the Steamdecks The evidence based on some 3rdparty ports builds that are as old as two months old now only point to that direction As much as I criticise Nintendo a lot in recent years this is one of the only instances where they might have done something right,mp0btpz,5.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0oxva,TheBoBiZzLe,,1,2025-04-25 19:00:06,,,,Hope so Picked my laptop up for about 600 and its a 3060 That could crank out some great performance in a handheld Its just hot And the cpu is hot Things just dont seem to be lining up and the one deciding factor of that equation is still unknown,mp0ezbl,6.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0t6kr,weegee19,,1,2025-04-25 19:21:35,,,,A 3060 laptop on battery maxes out at like 8TFLOPs so the Switch 2 being reportedly less than half of that in docked mode means its hardly farfetched Not to mention theres years of customisation put into this too,mp0oxva,7.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp3xtyv,StrombergsWetUtopia,,2,2025-04-26 07:07:58,,,,Thats the difference between yourself and the market they have Theyre not buying it based on hardware specs theyre buying it because of the games Most people dont know or care about any of that stuff,mp0btpz,5.0,1k7o7kv
comment,moznfnr,None,,2,2025-04-25 15:58:39,,,,Would love to buy one Where are they,,0.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mozq3p8,VapidRapidRabbit,,1,2025-04-25 16:11:50,,,,I wouldnt be surprised The Switch was a genius concept Every website crashed immediately Target kept emptying peoples carts Best Buy didnt even open preorders until half past midnight Walmarts site wouldnt load properly GameStop had a lot of their stock scalped by bots,,0.0,1k7o7kv

comment,mp030i7,weegee19,,1,2025-04-25 17:13:59,,,,The hardware isnt the issue a couple of overpriced games are,mozwlfs,1.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp05j9e,realKevinNash,,-1,2025-04-25 17:25:54,,,,I feel I disagree My initial issue was the console And I felt it still is Charging the same amount as a ps5 or XBsX seems insane for a system that apparently will be lesser across the board,mp030i7,2.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp08iju,weegee19,,8,2025-04-25 17:40:03,,,,The Steamdeck is at a comparable price range yet its worseperforming and lacks detachable controllers and a dock Its a handheld lmao its na√Øve of you if you somehow think a handheld thats about over half as powerful as a Series S packed with a 1080p120 HDR display and controller with mouse functions should be a lot cheaper Mobile technology is naturally pricier simply due to how complex and difficult it is to cram powerful enough tech into a much smaller form factor Even if the Switch 2 is selling at a profit it wont be by a decent margin at all,mp05j9e,3.0,1k7o7kv
comment,mp0iu2c,FernandoRocker,,5,2025-04-25 18:29:55,,,,Its a portable The full system is literally the size of a PS5XSX game case and thats including a battery and a screen a VRR HDR 120 Hz screen There is only too much you can do in a portable system Try to run a PS5 with a battery it would last you 5 minutes and be absurdly big and expensive The Switch 2 is an amazing piece of hardware specially for 450 You cant find any other hardware with those specs at that price You just cant,mp05j9e,3.0,1k7o7kv

comment,moznoz6,objecter12,,3,2025-04-25 15:59:55,,,,and went on to sell 35 million in its first quarter on the market Switch 2 has more hype behind it Ill give it that but Nintendo consoles usually sell well at launch,mozn0vw,2.0,1k7o7kv
