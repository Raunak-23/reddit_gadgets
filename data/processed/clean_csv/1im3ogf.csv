comment,mc13ctl,FireVanGorder,,542,2025-02-10 15:44:39,,,,Moral of the story is as always just use the cables your PSU came with Edit better way to phrase my point just do whatever your manuals tell you to do If you do anything other than that you need to be prepared to deal with the consequences Edit 2 hand up on this one looks like nvidia managed to completely fuck the 5090 Not the cables fault at all Ill take that L But still read your manuals,mbzyin8,1.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc5zc8g,alidan,,4,2025-02-11 11:21:04,,,,transorptation gets my ass to work the 5090 makes sure I live to see work joke aside im one of the people who runs a gpu into the ground before upgrading went from a 1060 6gb to 7900 xt and the way gpu prices are going if buildable pcs are still a thing by the time I upgrade I will probably just go integrated because by then anything that integrated gpu cant play will be cloud streamable anyway or I can watch a full play though of it,mc3apqi,6.0,1im3ogf

comment,mcdtj96,alidan,,3,2025-02-12 15:59:41,,,,personally I could CURRENTLY see me wantingneeding more than that however 67 years from now vr looks to be going more in headset than pc based then there are render methods that could make vr VERY doable on lower end hardware if anyone ever implements or optimizes it probably the only reason I would need dedicated gpu is if we dont get ram latency down but imagine if we got dedicated ram for igpu slots,mc8b93f,8.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc3aquc,GolotasDisciple,,1,2025-02-10 23:28:30,,,,I mean youre not wrong Financial literacy has been declining massively especially in the EU and NA The other issue is that peoples understanding of the equipment they buy is often misguided by clever marketing I never thought wed get to this stage with GPUs but its starting to look a lot like the new iPhone cycle Were reaching a point of diminishing returns where the products are already extremely good and other companies are making sure that the specifications and marketing are designed to capture as much of the market as possible 8GB GDDR6 is still the industry standard and the 3060 Ti still works great Honestly I was recently thinking about upgrading my GPU but first I had to upgrade my motherboard and CPU Then I needed a new PSUbecause new GPU requires more power and now I still need to get a better screen before I even think about the GPU These upgrades are like an avalanche It starts off chill but then you keep adding extra components that suddenly feel essential Before you know it the upgrade ends up costing as much as a car,mc37ffh,5.0,1im3ogf

comment,mcw1aeq,Aapje58,,1,2025-02-15 12:06:11,,,,That debacle turned out to be people spending thousands not having 2 seconds to properly push a cable fully in The tolerances of the connectors were not defined properly resulting in it sometimes requiring an unreasonable amount of force to plug in the connector fully And there was no safety that prevented the card from turning on with improperly plugged in cables and that safety was added to later cards Theyve also been gradually removing the safety feature of having isolated power rails so any issue that causes power to flow in an unbalanced way will not just cause a shutdown of the card but will cause things to melt Imagine that a car manufacturer suddenly stops adding ABS and seat belts to their cars Is it then the fault of the drivers if the number of serious accidents suddenly increases,mc5dx3k,4.0,1im3ogf
comment,mcaxcmf,NervousSWE,,-1,2025-02-12 02:56:23,,,,Not pushing cables in all the way is a common mistake If that starts a fire in your computer its the manufacturers fault Imagine your phone starting on fire if the charger wasnt plugged in securely Wed blame the manufacturer No different here,mc5dx3k,4.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc2j45h,FireVanGorder,,0,2025-02-10 19:58:32,,,,Its usually less of an issue on the gpu side and a massive issue on the PSU side which can cause problems on both sides of the connection Using cable extenders is very different than plugging a third party cable into your PSU Granted 12vhpwr may have standardized pinouts given some comments in here Though it doesnt look like anyones actually confirmed 100 that thats true and Im not willing to test that theory myself Its also hard to know whats quality without testing it yourself which is a potentially expensive endeavor,mc22bfu,3.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc3018m,FireVanGorder,,0,2025-02-10 22:00:39,,,,Because they dont plug into your PSU The problem isnt with the gpu connection its that different PSUs may have different pin layouts So a cable not specifically made for that PSU may not be compatible on that end,mc2zqrw,5.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc34r39,SpeedflyChris,,1,2025-02-10 22:38:17,,,,The problem isnt with the gpu connection its that different PSUs may have different pin layouts Im pretty sure thats not the case with 12vhpwr,mc3018m,6.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc32agk,kalirion,,1,2025-02-10 22:18:22,,,,In this specific case the user claims they had no issues when theyd used the same cable for their 4090 though no mention was made whether or not they swapped in a new PSU along with the 5090,mc3018m,6.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc30d05,FireVanGorder,,1,2025-02-10 22:03:11,,,,So youre taking an extremely niche situation and trying to apply it to general pc building advice Ever heard the term the exception that proves the rule Even in your link the PSU manufacturer specifically recommends cablemod lol Every PSU will tell you what should be plugged into it Going outside of those recommendations is a terrible idea unless youre very sure of what youre doing and willing to accept the consequences if you fuck it up,mc2vulr,5.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc32pup,pmjm,,-2,2025-02-10 22:21:48,,,,The OP of this story is an extremely niche situation They have a SFF build and the OEM cable does not fit so they had a custom one made Thats the nature of the beast You also used the extreme phrase absolutely always and then try to dunk on me when I give you a case that breaks your rule so I really dont know what more we have to talk about,mc30d05,6.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc33dp2,FireVanGorder,,1,2025-02-10 22:27:11,,,,And my point is that was a terrible decision regardless of the reason Getting a different case so you dont risk your 2000 gpu would have been much smarter and what anyone on any pc building sub would have recommended rather than getting a third party 12vhpwr cable of all things lmao,mc32pup,7.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc61z28,pmjm,,1,2025-02-11 11:44:08,,,,An update in der8auers latest video he basically clears the thirdparty Moddiy cable of responsibility and speculates that its actually higher quality than the OEM cable he had the opportunity to examine the damaged items from the OP Seems as if there may be some issues in the 5090 itself that can cause this kind of superheating of any cable He has thermal imaging to show how after 1 minute of load on his own 5090 two individual cables reached 120 degrees celsius while the GPU was only pulling 575W In his test a single wire of the cable was drawing 23 amps which obviously will fail if left to continue OEM or thirdparty cable Its a great video and worth a watch and while it doesnt validate all thirdparty cables he even calls for a reexamination of the Cablemod 12vhpwr debacle and whether or not the blame was wrongly placed on them,mc33dp2,8.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc33soh,pmjm,,0,2025-02-10 22:30:30,,,,Then why even build if you dont have the freedom to use the case you want Might as well buy a prebuilt There are hundreds of thousands of third party 12vhpwr cables in use and 999 of the time theyre fine Once in a while theres a problem with one just as there will be a certain defect rate even in recommended cables And they make headlines because theyre sensational and garner clicks They do not represent the majority of the user experience,mc33dp2,8.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc2a4xi,TumblrInGarbage,,15,2025-02-10 19:10:35,,,,MODDIY owned it and is working with OP to get him financially sorted and also has newer cables that they started selling this year that are higher quality than the older 12VHPWR cables that OP had While I still recommend never ever using 3rd party cables MODDIY in this case is being responsible,mc1up4b,7.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc2okzy,GearsFC3S,,1,2025-02-10 20:36:01,,,,Im putting together my first SFF build so while Id love to use the stock PSU cables most likely Ill go with at least some custom cables And while theyre being responsible it seems like MODDIY has a bit of a reputation for questionable cables So if I manage to get my hands on a 5080 big if right now it might just be safer to go with someone else and not have to hunt down a second 5080 to replace one that gets burned,mc2a4xi,8.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc2zw7v,kalirion,,1,2025-02-10 21:59:35,,,,MODDIY owned it and is working with OP to get him financially sorted Will the financial sorting be using 5090 scalper pricing or will they just send him a 5090 of their own,mc2a4xi,8.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc33hi7,Zerot7,,1,2025-02-10 22:28:02,,,,I wonder what each pin can draw Like a single cable capable of the current we are talking about is pretty big But on a 12 pin connector is it like 100w across half the pins Judging from the size of wire it is maybe 18 or 16 gage and if its 16 gage thats good for 13A free air at 30 degrees C so by the time its derated probably 10A which is 120w at 12v Like you I dont think I would want to put that much current constantly though a cable like that because at 600w its basically maxed out for continuous draw the heat could loosen pins over time and just create more heat and melt like we see it Im not a big electronics guy tho so I dont know if its 6 pins and 6 pins with each pin carrying 100 watts I think PCI slot can output some small amount of wattage also,mc2jf3f,6.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc4x4ia,Mirar,,1,2025-02-11 05:17:04,,,,Spark distance is around 1000000V per meter so for a spark of 1mm you need 1000V For cables boards etc not much difference between 200V and 12V The change you see in isolation is because of possible tear and bad handling and the risk for humans between the voltages not because it makes an electric difference Only current and to some degree frequency matters for connection surfaces For the same power usage current goes up with lower voltage If the computer was a 400V system it could still use tiny cables for the 2A needed for 800W graphics,mc3ff8l,6.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc4yagl,Mirar,,2,2025-02-11 05:25:50,,,,This is correct its 772A on 110V But you dont have 110V inside the case you have 12V 57512 47A 70A is from that someone said they could draw 800W 48V DC inside the case for power hungry stuff like the graphics card would start to make a lot more sense though AC doesnt make much sense I think,mc4qbki,10.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc4yk72,Goocheyy,,2,2025-02-11 05:27:54,,,,Youre misunderstanding electricity The plug at the wall is generally 120 Volts AC which is why I commented that earlier Per your calculations you are correct that it would draw 75 amps due to efficiency loss Your GPU does not run on an AC circuit Your power supply converts it to DC There is no way your GPU is taking 120 Volts Most electronics are going to run between 3312 Volts A 5090 uses 12V pins Do the ratio and to hit 800W youre looking at 70A,mc4qbki,10.0,1im3ogf

comment,mbzzg4m,LBXZero,,123,2025-02-10 11:21:42,,,,Define compliant The cable may be 3rd party but that is a legitimate part of the free market It may go to show that the cables need more specific standards to be called compliant The key problem with the 124 pin connector specs is the cable is permitting a total of 50 amps over all the wires but each wire has an individual limit of 9 to 10 amps and there is nothing to ensure load balancing Without load balancing the 6 12v and 6 ground wires require a very tight tolerance on conductivity so the 675 Watts 12 volts 5626 amps is split so one wire is not conducting over 10 amps That amp restriction is based on how much heat radiates from the wires and connectors for conducting that much power and you are looking at 9375 amps per 12v wire when perfectly divided the imaginary ideal world If the cable compliance does not require tight resistance tolerances between each wire the specifications are not safe and that really is not the 3rd party cable makers fault,,0.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc0jcnj,zero_z77,,36,2025-02-10 13:52:27,,,,On top of that what you laid out is also the upper limit of the specification The fact that they are trying to push the spec to its maximum limit is also a big problem here If youve only got 6 connections rated for 910A each thats a max throughput of 5460A under ideal circumstances Which doesnt leave a lot of room for error when youre playing with 5626A It really should be a 128 or 122x4 connection so you can spread that load accross 8 lines instead of 6 That way you dont risk a fire if theres a slightly loose connection or if one of the 12V lines fails outright After all 10A is the theoretical maximum actual max is going to be somewhere between 9A and 10A so good design would be to stay well below 9A per line But oh no that would cost a whole 050 more for an extra connector and we cant have that s But you are correct that proper load balancing fault detection also need to be present and it is definately not the 3rd party cable manufacturers fault,mbzzg4m,1.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc0mt8y,LBXZero,,8,2025-02-10 14:13:48,,,,Technically there is no maximum It is just as more amps flow the higher resistance areas like connectors radiate more heat and start to glow like a light bulb Those safety specs are a point where the heat radiated is still tolerable As for 128 the 4 are sense pins meant to communicate to an end device what the power supply offers Only 2 pins are used to inform max amps I am assuming the other 2 are reserved for voltage expecting that in later generations we will have power supplies supporting higher voltage to deliver more watts safer than pumping amps The problem with using higher voltage right now is adapting multiple 12v connectors to higher voltage is more costly and complicated than just combining multiple 12v lines to provide more amps We need PSU manufacturers to agree to and start releasing higher voltage power supplies Really I think the connectors should just change out differently like utilize 10 gauge wire and connectors instead of stacking more 18 gauge wires Making the 124 connector smaller to fit the profile of an PCIe 8pin connector was very incompetent There should be a landscape penalty per watt either way,mc0jcnj,2.0,1im3ogf
comment,mc0z0mn,zero_z77,,2,2025-02-10 15:22:14,,,,I thought the 8pin had 3x 12V lines vdd gnd and 2x sense lines and the 4 pin is just 2 straight 12V lines There is also an 8pin that does have 4x 12V lines but theres usually only one of those and its specifically for the CPU i think But i do agree if power requirements are going up then the hardware needs to reflect that Otherwise the only safesensible thing to do will be to either bolt a dedicated PSU directly onto the GPU or ship a proprietary PSU thats got a dedicated cable for the GPU,mc0mt8y,3.0,1im3ogf

comment,mc0ln0q,iksbob,,12,2025-02-10 14:06:38,,,,Its entirely possible that loadbalancing actually is happening such as by the GPU PCB sending each power connector wire to 1 or 2 VRM units out of the many on the board The issue then is the terminal resistance is far enough out of spec that the 9A load is enough to cause thermal runaway That resistance could be a manufacturing defect in the terminal thin base material wrong alloy used with higher resistance or inadequate spring tension improper material shaping wrong plating etc or the cable manufacturers terminal crimping process could be the problem resulting in inadequate clamping force between the wire and terminal Barring the effects of contaminates in the joint a good mechanical connection is a good electrical connection Load balancing individual current sources terminal resistance could explain why theres two burnt terminals on the PSU but only one on the GPU,mbzzg4m,1.0,1im3ogf
