comment,mkmkes1,c0smicrenegade,,28,2025-03-31 02:58:08,,,,Since nobody provided an actual link yet you can find it here and its 359 Theres better photos and more specs as well EDIT this is the older model and they seem to be one of those indiegogo companies that overpromises and under delivers on customer service more often than not Seems cool for the retro look and novelty if you have the money to drop but you could also just get a steam deck Not trying to shit on them but their wordvomit jargon reeks of GPTisms Theyre not saying anything Its strange,,0.0,1jnpdwc
comment,mkmn47r,RoadkillVenison,,15,2025-03-31 03:17:35,,,,Thats the old model they havent announced pricing or added a store page for the 370 version yet Its release date is the classic soonTM,mkmkes1,1.0,1jnpdwc

comment,mkndir5,milo325,,2,2025-03-31 07:12:11,,,,It doesnt appear to actually have a working monitor built into it I think thats just a design element None of the pictures on the website show it being used to display anything live,mkmkes1,1.0,1jnpdwc

comment,mko3n0y,CyEriton,,1,2025-03-31 11:36:58,,,,Its a small form factor PC in a retro case with a flip up screen I like the retro aesthetic and I think the flip up display is useful for setup troubleshooting servers but mostly think it just looks cool The small form factor is nice for having this alongside consoles on a TV stand I think it looks fun and I appreciate having some more creative options to PCs,,0.0,1jnpdwc

comment,mkm0duk,CO_PC_Parts,,8,2025-03-31 00:48:28,,,,Quite a few people take small form factor pc building insanely serious and its always measured in liters for the case,mkltku3,1.0,1jnpdwc
comment,mkmt40z,HalobenderFWT,,-3,2025-03-31 04:02:43,,,,Wouldnt the actual dimensions be more helpful A 1L case could be a whole bunch of different nonuseful shapes Guess maybe I dont take form factor PC building insanely serious enough,mkm0duk,2.0,1jnpdwc
comment,mkn6e7a,Swallagoon,,3,2025-03-31 05:59:20,,,,Its not a weird shape its a box You know what shape a box is right,mkmt40z,3.0,1jnpdwc
comment,mknak8w,HalobenderFWT,,0,2025-03-31 06:41:10,,,,It could be tall and skinny or short and wide or a whole bunch of different variations Its just seems like a very ambiguous method of measurement for something where internal measurements are kind of important I guess if I know the case is a perfect cube I can figure out the dimensions well enough Imagine having to return your 13L motherboard because its actually too long to fit in your 1L case,mkn6e7a,4.0,1jnpdwc
comment,mknnmoz,Swallagoon,,2,2025-03-31 09:04:47,,,,Yeah but you can see the picture You know what it looks like Its a box Its also one of the standard ways to denote volume but of course you knew that because you finished school I guess you must also struggle when purchasing backpacks May god have mercy on your soul,mknak8w,5.0,1jnpdwc
