comment,ms9cccj,chrisdh79,,20,2025-05-14 12:29:51,,,,From the article Sony has sold 778 million PlayStation 5s since the console first went on sale in 2020 after shipping 28 million units in its latest quarter the company announced That figure lines up remarkably well with PlayStation 4 sales which hit 791 million units in approximately the same amount of time However Sonys full year fiscal 2024 PS5 sales of 185 million were down compared to the 208 million it sold in 2023 Game sales more than made up for that though rising nine percent and helping push the divisions operating income up 43 percent year over year That was largely due to thirdparty sales as firstparty sales actually fell a bit Sony has only released one firstparty game so far this year with key titles like Death Stranding 2 On the Beach and Ghost of Y≈çtei still to come Sony doesnt expect this growth to continue though The company is predicting a 100 billion 700 million hit to sales next year due to tariffs given that most of its sales occur in the US and the company had already forecast flat revenue for 2025 Another key blow was the delay of Rockstars Grand Theft Auto VI launch that was just pushed back to May 2026 During its earnings call Sony said that it was considering passing on tariff hikes to consumers though it didnt mention the PS5 or US specifically The company has already raised the price of the console in other territories including Europe but US increases are extremely rare Sony CEO HIroki Totoki also brought up the possibility of building the PlayStation 5 in the US saying its something that has to be considered going forward,,0.0,1kmdx56
comment,msa0yga,Ahindre,,13,2025-05-14 14:44:49,,,,However Sonys full year fiscal 2024 PS5 sales of 185 million were down compared to the 208 million it sold in 2023 I think there was some pent up demand in 2023 due to how limited the availability was for so long,ms9cccj,1.0,1kmdx56
comment,mse3qz7,blueblurz94,,6,2025-05-15 03:40:43,,,,The fact that it took 2 years for the inventory issues to be resolved from the pandemic is the primary reason 2023 saw such a high number of units sold Its likely going to remain the consoles peak year in hardware sales if the tariffs dont go away and if Sony finally implements a price hike in the United Stateswhich they will its only a matter of time,msa0yga,2.0,1kmdx56
comment,mscz5u9,goldaxis,,6,2025-05-14 23:35:48,,,,Thats a lot more than I thought to be honest Considering you couldnt find one for a year it was always expensive and is now nearing EoL those numbers arent bad The question for all game hardware manufacturers going forward of course is how much good will they squandered this generation I cant see Sony Microsoft or Nintendo pulling the same numbers next time Big shift to PC gaming especially as steam deck and clones get better and cheaper,,0.0,1kmdx56
comment,ms9ft16,TheBoBiZzLe,,45,2025-05-14 12:51:07,,,,Monster Hunter wilds lags on my ps5 Ive owned it for 3 years and the only monster hunter game to launch on its lifespan lags My PlayStation live increased and I haven used enjoyed or wanted any of the free psn games Just like everything else Reduce upkeep cost reduce quality drive up prices make the people still willing to buy it make up the costs,,0.0,1kmdx56
comment,msbjgtg,Realistic_Condition7,,20,2025-05-14 19:05:12,,,,It was universally agreed upon by virtually all tech reviewers that the PC port had worse optimization than the PS5,ms9ft16,1.0,1kmdx56

comment,mschgok,TheBoBiZzLe,,-6,2025-05-14 21:55:56,,,,Yeah Im seeing limitations on my ps5 mainly focused on AI upscaling and what really looks like laziness on developers But who cares System has hit its end faster than anything before Im waiting now to see if a game runs in it or not Completely destroying the point of getting a PlayStation,msbjgtg,2.0,1kmdx56
comment,msci4r5,Realistic_Condition7,,11,2025-05-14 21:59:33,,,,Not really sure what youre saying PS5 is still consistently outputting very playable performance for modern games often times more optimized than PC counterparts and at a fraction of the cost,mschgok,3.0,1kmdx56

comment,mssstfy,harkat82,,1,2025-05-17 14:40:44,,,,I mean monster hunter wilds is just an incredibly poorly running game I dont think you can blame that on the PS5 As far as fps goes the PS5 has the best performing games since the PS2 The fact that 60fps performance modes are the norm is a huge upgrade over the two previous generations so Im not sure how you can claim quality has gone down,ms9ft16,1.0,1kmdx56

comment,msdeh3n,BbyJ39,,3,2025-05-15 01:04:00,,,,Im not forgetting Nintendo The switch is not in competition with the PS5 And the Xbox series X is a better console than the base PS5 so no it has nothing to do with sucking at hardware Its everything to do with consumer perception marketing and game exclusivity Idk why Im even replying to this comment its clear you dont get it,msdctd1,2.0,1kmdx56

comment,msdfqkm,Kosmos992k,,1,2025-05-15 01:11:18,,,,I get it very much MS made several missteps since Xbox One Kinect always online no used games game pass eroding new game sales putting Xbox everywhere eroding the need for an Xbox in the first place etc etc For their part Sony has had weird marketing questionable support for mobile platforms of the past and lackluster PS Plus Consumer perception is a curious beast and depends on how the actions of a platform holder hit customers As for game exclusivity MS has spent literal billions to achieve exclusivity before realizing that selling games to customers is more lucrative than Game pass and noticing a ready made consumer base who own PlayStation 5 The Switch 2 is costly enough that Nintendo may actually threaten their perception as a game console for everyone and depending on games releases could be a competition with PlayStation,msdeh3n,3.0,1kmdx56

comment,msolxgr,Josejacobuk,,1,2025-05-16 20:04:46,,,,Well perhaps if you didnt raise prices in regions where there are no tariffs between you and the customer you wouldnt see as big a downturn,,0.0,1kmdx56
