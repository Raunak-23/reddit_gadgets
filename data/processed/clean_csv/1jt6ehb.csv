comment,mlsgxaf,Emu1981,,787,2025-04-07 00:56:04,,,,I like how the article assumes that it will be the monitor providing the 480W of power delivery rather than the computer providing the 480W of power for the monitor Being able to power the monitor and provide the display data via a single cable would be a game changer for reducing cable clutter for your desk I have a 48 4K120 OLED and 480W would be way more than enough power for it,,0.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mlsplu2,Trekintosh,,314,2025-04-07 01:53:20,,,,Apple tried many times to do this before giving up Most recently was ADC which carried power video and USB on one connector and cable It was a big DVIlike connector and worked reasonably well but if you used an ADC equipped monitor with a nonADC computer you needed a comical adapter box that was bigger than a preM4 Mac Mini that then had its own external power supply box It also meant you effectively couldnt upgrade your graphics card unless it was to another ADCcapable card of which there werent many because Apple,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mm0c6xg,SolidOshawott,,2,2025-04-08 09:56:56,,,,Yet with TB is still the display powering the computer I think it makes more sense since the display is more likely to be stationary and less likely to have its own battery Maybe what would be neat is if we could power a Mac Mini or even a Studio off the same cable that plugs to the display,mlvsund,4.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlw3iu4,swolfington,,2,2025-04-07 17:01:58,,,,the DVI to ADC box was pretty chonky but it was definitely not bigger than an old Mac Mini though it probably was bigger than the new one And for what its worth if you did have the box you could upgrade your graphics card since only the monitor really cared ADC monitors biggest issue is they had no other way to be powered and you could run a standard DVI monitor on an ADC card with a much more simple conversion cable since the video signal on ADC was just DVI using an ADC monitor also also put a huge strain on the computers power supply especially if you had that one ADC CRT and is probably responsible for killing a pretty large percentage of various G4 tower power supplies,mlsplu2,2.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mlxvj6z,Trekintosh,,2,2025-04-07 22:36:53,,,,Also an ADC CRT doesnt work with the converter box because Its only for the LCDs,mlw3iu4,3.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mlxy3ej,swolfington,,1,2025-04-07 22:51:36,,,,That one always seemed a little lame even by apples standards Maybe the current draw was too much for the power supply they wanted to use or maybe it was because the CRT needed to be woken up in a nonstandard way and apple just didnt want to deal with the supportsoftware hassle I think the only technical thing keeping CRTs from working with the box is it doesnt pass through the analog video signal pins which seems like it would both be a very easy thing to fix and probably something they would have to do deliberately in the first place either way it was a pretty lame thing for apple to do to its customers who bought the CRT,mlxvj6z,4.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mltx2b1,pmoO0,,1,2025-04-07 07:59:40,,,,Apple will charge you for using premium products with their premium ideas but if China can establish it for cheap it will get traction Its unfortunate that margin is the number one concern while profit can also be achieved by other means,mlsplu2,2.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mlt94nw,OrSomeSuch,,91,2025-04-07 04:11:59,,,,The monitor presumably stays in one spot while your laptop moves around with you It makes sense to treat the monitor as a docking station that powers your laptop rather than having to plug in your laptop charger and monitor every time,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlt1zn0,Jess_S13,,18,2025-04-07 03:17:24,,,,Im assuming this is basically a dock replacement Instead of a dock that has the monitor connected and whatever peripherals you need connected to it with the dock powering the laptop and the other peripherals getting their own power unless USB powered the monitor would be the dock and the power to the laptop so that the only power input is the monitor and all IO goes down that path Given how many all in ones just end up being monitors for newer better computers Im not sure I would actually want to invest into that ecosystem instead of the convenience of an inexpensive dock I buy whenever I get a new laptop with a higher thundbolt version but who knows maybe it will catch on,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mluo7et,raptir1,,6,2025-04-07 12:18:31,,,,I like how the article assumes that it will be the monitor providing the 480W of power delivery rather than the computer providing the 480W of power for the monitor The monitor providing the power makes far more sense While I work remote now my office has docking stations setup with one USBC cable That cable provides power for your laptop and connects your monitor and keyboard If the laptop provided power to the monitor you would need a second cable plugged into your laptop for power,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mlttsf2,5c044,,5,2025-04-07 07:23:45,,,,USBC monitors already can do that to a degree not the same power or data bandwidth but enough I got an MSI monitor for my new laptop a few months ago it provides up to 65W to the laptop and has a built in kvm and audio out so if I am using wifi I have a single cable,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mm281dq,teh_mICON,,0,2025-04-08 16:49:35,,,,Elaborate The designation C refers only to the connectors physical configuration or form factor not to be confused with the connectors specific capabilities and performance such as Thunderbolt 3 DisplayPort 20 USB 32 Gen 22 So USBC supports DisplayPort 20 and also power delivery so in theory it should be possible to connect a display without an additional power connector on the display,mm1zlr6,3.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mltmi0d,TJonesyNinja,,4,2025-04-07 06:12:20,,,,Treating the monitor like a dock and having it power a laptop or mini computer is not that out there Plenty of computers also use less than 480W of power if you arent taking about a high performance computer,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlvxw8u,TJonesyNinja,,1,2025-04-07 16:33:07,,,,Ive found USB 20 works great for permanent things like keyboard mouse speakers even printers only really need 30 for high speed things like external storage and such which can be plugged in directly when needed There is probably a few things you would want to plug in to the dock with high speed but that tends to be more the exception than the rule in my experience USB 20 despite being slower holds up really well for most use cases,mlvlv9d,3.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlwuscz,TJonesyNinja,,1,2025-04-07 19:19:52,,,,I mount my monitors and all my cables run neatly in a bundle to the post where they spread out when they hit the desk Theres convenient usb ports on the side for flash drives security keys or other short term usage but everything long term plugs in the cable cubby on the back with the power and video If thats not enough a simple usb hub andor extension moves them wherever they need to be with a single cord Theres no reason a decent monitor would have them hanging off the side Many smaller computers even mount to the back of the monitor so in that case the cables would be running up there anyway My laptop plugs in to two monitors and all peripherals including power with one usb c cable Higher bandwidth and power on a single cable could support things like external pci ports for external graphics cards higher resolution displays or high bandwidth networking among other things,mlw5lnu,5.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mm992t4,BlinksTale,,1,2025-04-09 18:36:52,,,,Correct And I change monitors about every 612mo at my desk a strange amount of luck with friends donating monitors with monitor arms that allow for cable hiding Currently that means swapping both out with each change and worrying about whether I have enough power slots under my desk from my surge protector While its not a game changer for me directly on any given day I would say its a game changer for the general UX and use over time and how many people will be impacted by this It would certainly help clean my desk up to have half as many cables for the 23 monitors I keep with this and my other desk setup,mm93f4l,6.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlu1k8f,alockbox,,1,2025-04-07 08:50:45,,,,Well to me that makes better sense Unless its a portable monitor it is stationary Whereas most computers are portable So the monitor should be plugged into the wall and the computer can be placed down plugged in and immediately have power coming in and data throughput The monitor really should be more like a monitor hubdock This is my current setup on a USBC PD monitor and its fantastic All accessories stay connected to the screen Including a keyboard and mouse dongle ethernet NVME backup drive etc Bring in the laptop plug in one cable and its charging plus display plus all accessories This is even more handy in environments like conference rooms or flex offices With this kind of power delivery standard practically any computer becomes a portable ie the new Mac mini an Intel NUC mini PC,mlsgxaf,1.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mlsbfsd,likewut,,13,2025-04-07 00:21:16,,,,A lot of people in here hate the idea I think it could be a great addition The physical size of USB connectors limits the amps it can transfer Having a USBC for small stuff and GPMI for big stuff would be awesome Power your TV charge your power tools connect your storage array etc with more power and more bandwidth than USBC can provide Remember the 240 watt limit on USBC is only for 48v output I believe if youre sending 12v its limited to 60 watts To go above that your device probably needs a DCtoDC converter which is adds costs and reduces efficiency Id like it to be a bigger more robust connector ideally with an optional locking mechanism That would be huge in the commercial AV space,,0.0,1jt6ehb

comment,mls5m0d,no6969el,,5,2025-04-06 23:44:29,,,,Then how does it have more power and throughput USBC is just a connector if theyre using any form of normal conductor its going to also be a USBC cable But often high throughput power charging USBC cables dont work with every single phone because they dont require as much throughput So just because the connector connects doesnt mean that its always going to be compatible Thats my point However they organize the cables inside of that USBC Is different than another cable that charges your phone Im more knowledgeable about this than normal because I recently got a whole bunch of different USBC cables and tested them out with all my different devices so that I wasnt wasting any port that could do either faster or higher volume charging,mls5ajb,3.0,1jt6ehb
comment,mls7g9c,Magnusg,,1,2025-04-06 23:55:55,,,,ok a PD cable will work with all phones it wont give rapid charging to a phone which cant communicate with the PD device at the other end Thats not a function of the cable thats a function of the device at either side of the cable What im saying is that the cable is probably not remarkable they probably added more connection points but didnt change the communication standards at all didnt route anything in a new way otherwise it shouldnt work seemlessly with USB standards off the rip In essence the best way to describe it is now a USB cable that supports GPMI not a GPMI Type C cable The same as there are USB cables with PD a standard of USB 4 is to by default support PD so likely a standard of USB 5 is going to by default support GPMI I just think its pretty much silly to say oh heres brand new tech,mls5m0d,4.0,1jt6ehb
