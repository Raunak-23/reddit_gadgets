PSU, Motherboard, CPU, Graphics, RAM.. all dead because the power cable company made some faulty cables.  Would you expect AMD/Intel/Nvidia/Corsair etc to accept back that kit under RMA and send you a new one?  Of course you fucking wouldn't, that's ludicrous.  You'd want appropriate compensation from the power cable company.\n\nAsrock need to own it.",

You really think if AMD or Intel were building boards they'd give you more than 4 USB ports?  The current state is bad because despite many brands there's still amd/intel pulling strings to keep things simple and consistent but this would be cranked to 11 with only 1 house brand option.\n\n3dfx tried to fuck over all their board partners by integrating one of them and in a few years they were history.",

      "body": ">Essentially, it was an amperage problem in the Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO) settings.\n\nThat.. might sound reasonable to some. But there is no way to push the resulting effect of a pbo-\"overclock\" past some kind of limit that will fry the cpu by itself. What you have to do to accomplish something that draws a very high effect is to force a minimum clock up to a very high level, and then adjust the curves so that a modest (say, the first part of the curve) PBO2 increase in clock frequency drags everything along with it on a \"long boost\". \n\nAnd while that's possible (in the same way that you could, in theory, make pl2 on Intel a pl1 boost, and burn way too high - or put every core at the same max frequency and wonder why a cpu that's scaled for very short boosts to that frequency fails) -- it's not trivial to accomplish it by just changing the bios settings.\n\nNote that Asus also \"took the blame\" on a similar thing with the raptor lake disaster -- what's really going on is that people are buying the largest and most power-hungry of the processors, putting them to insane overclocks that make no sense. And that in a way the manufacturer has approved of in marketing, because they want to sell bigger numbers and so on. \n\nBut which is just not how the cpu is set up: it is designed to rest on fairly low clocks, and then boost cores on demand. Which works great, because the memory bus is nowhere near as fast as the cpu-governor on any of these systems. In 2002 an overclock on demand from a software-governor might not have been quick enough to avoid pauses on a very targeted workload. And because of direct driver architectures that rely on bus-speeds for maintaining input latency, and so on, this has been a problem for \"system response\" way past the expiry date of very old computer problems. That's all true.\n\nBut with wdm-drivers and internal on-demand cpu-governors, this is not an issue - at all. Even with servers, this is not an issue - the boost-schema, that Intel has made it's entire line-up on, does work.\n\nStill -- some people just need to put the processor on max clocks, somehow (through raising the minimum clocks here, no doubt), in the belief that it increases performance. And then are surprised and angry when it blows up.\n\nThe result of that is the following: mainboard-manufacturers and laptop-makers, among others, end up clocking their products to a target that will be extremely low, just in case they will end up with people blowing their computer up. Or just lock down all the settings to whatever a support \"technician\" with no understanding of the system will decide on by their reading of the manual and the \"recommendations\" from the cpu-manufacturer.\n\nTo the point where we really are right now: laptops come with default cpu setups that throttle it from the first second after boot, and that starve the gpu of power. Or desktops that end up with ambient watt-drain on idle in the range of 50W extra on a 12 core setup.\n\nThe world's most ridiculous industry just keeps rolling. And Tech1 and GamerNexus really are enabling it as well, suggesting very strongly here that it's the mainboard-manufacturer's fault for not locking down the cpu sufficiently on beforehand. Or that it's AMD and Intel's for not technically forcing settings that are \"safe\".",
