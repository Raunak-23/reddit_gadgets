Calculating things like fastener quantity or grout usage based on tile size and joint spacing would be amazing too.  \nWhile we're at it I'd also like suspensors I could slap on heavy items and float them to where I need them.",

I say they are better. \n\nalot of innovation is stunted by patents, take a look at uclogic digitizers and wacom for a great example of this, it took a hell of alot of innovation for china to be able to side step wacoms patent's for releasing tablets in the west, the result of that was 60$ tablets that were feature for feature as good as 350$ wacom tablets, and in more recent years penable displays that just kicked wacoms teeth in for form factor (wacom was 3-4 inches thich at a point where monitors were fat at 1 inch, and needed active cooling, china monitors came out in normal monitor form factors) \n\nmost innovation doesn't come from desperation anymore, it comes from a race to the bottom while not sacrificing needed features, and quite alot of our current 'needs' are at the point where hundreds of millions of dollars are needed to improve something where as in the past there was quite alot of low hanging fruit, for an example of this look at american trucks, they aren't huge because we want huge, they are huge because of emission standards, its far FAR easier to make a truck larger to be able to pass emissions than it is to make small truck pass emissions  because the smaller a car is the more strict emissions standards are. \n\nas for a cancer cure, the reason its so hard to get one isn't because there is more money in treatment (though I do know for a fact major investors openly asked a drug research lab why in the fuck are they researching cures instead of treatments) its because cancer specifically is tied to dna, any treatment would need to be made specifically for that person's dna. all we can really do is get better generalized treatments. \n\nas for cancer cures, look into research on them, almost every time the problem is side effects or the treatment does not pan out",

It's all in your use-case, with that one you *need* a laser or physical measuring device to get even close to that kind of accuracy. Stuff like AR will give you within an inch or two at 20 foot distances.\n\nUse the proper tool for the job.",

All you need for those is an estimate of overall size of the project to the inch level. You wouldn't be able to use it to precisely place individual fasteners or anything but you could say that a space so wide and so tall would take this many studs and about this many fasteners.",

Meta, Halliday, other companies are showing that there are multiple designs you can do, but most all of them most likely have some type of data collection keeping the price relatively low under 1k USD. Apple doesn't have that same crutch, and considering that they make devices that are additive to the ecosystem rather than replacements for existing products (they wouldn't want the glasses to replace the Apple watch for example), they would need to find a way to make the device unique from the rest of their product portfolio while still providing a valuable cohesive experience with the rest of their products. And considering how Apple prices things usually, those glasses would cost 1k minimum, which I s way more costly than anything else on the market. Especially with how lackluster the AVP sold, it's likely they're just going to wait until they absolutely have to (ie when the shareholders want them to) to create a pair of smart glasses. The tech is here already, but the market for these glasses is still too niche, it needs to mature a bit more to justify the effort and investment, otherwise they might have another AVP on their hands",

The whole demo, while the technology is certainly amazing, mostly made me realize how little value such glasses would provide compared to the smart phones we already have today, but at probably far higher cost.  \n\n70 degree FOV is extremely limiting, the content is transparent, so videos will be see through, and the other apps were an incredibly boring looking pong game, and AI vision to make a smoothie.  Why do I want this over my smartphone which today already offers a beautiful full color high res OLED display and is or will be capable of all the same things?\n\nI still feel like the conceptual ideal of true AR glasses is so far away from technologically possible, and even then it's not obvious why I'd rather wear a HUD than just look at my phone.  \n\nStill feel immersive VR is the better technology as at least its immersive qualities offer truly unique experiences.",

Besides mentioning it would depend on a Mac, it makes no attempt to distinguish between the subject of the article and the Vision Pro \u2013 it doesn\u2019t even mention Apple\u2019s Vision Pro, at least not at the time I\u2019d read it.\n\nThere are a ton of clicks to be captured from the Vision Pro haters, who would delight for days over the news and forward it to their friends. Given not just the low context in the article but the deliberate lack of any reference to its most obvious and only comparison, this is a clickbait article deliberately designed to confuse readers generally and to satiate Vision Pro haters specifically.",

This aligns with industry reports of the first factory to be able to produce such materials at scale is still three years from production.\n\nWhich of course also means that any distinction between goggles versus glasses versus headset is absurd in the meantime. Call them what you will, they will be opaque screens over your eyes for the time being. Making it a Mac accessory will only get the price down so much, and likely only serve to confuse the market. \n\nAdd in that the number of those they could sell would be a rounding error relative to Apple\u2019s other product categories, and that an always-tethered headset would actually reduce the perception of the product at large, and it\u2019s way better for Apple to spend its calories on the product they\u2019ll ship in 2-3 years.",

Li Auto and Nio were founded by guys who started out running auto enthusiast websites. He Xiaopeng, who founded Xpeng, started out by creating a mobile internet browser before selling it to Alibaba and taking his money to found an EV company. The founder of Leapmotor first founded another company called Dahua, a video surveillance/security camera company.\n\nDid these people have the expertise of someone like Lucid founder Peter Rawlinson, who was literally the chief engineer behind the Tesla Model S before forming his own EV company? Of course not, yet all their startups rapidly scaled production past the US EV startups because unlike Rivian and Lucid, all those Chinese startups had access to that critical mass of EV supply chain and expertise which only exists in China, so they could get their companies off the ground far quicker.\n\nThen later one when the big boys like Huawei and Xiaomi came along and also wanted to enter the game, well they've got even deeper pockets and could scale even faster than those earlier startups, with Xiaomi being the fastest of them all.",

The comment I replied to argued that Chinese advances in EVs is a result of big conglomerates getting into the game. \n\nMy argument is that it was Chinese government support over many years to build out the most advanced and comprehensive EV value chain that is most responsible for how they got ahead on EVs. Because that value chain allows anyone to potentially quickly build an EV startup. Yes it is easier for a conglomerate like Xiaomi, but pure startups like Li Auto or Xpeng have also succeeded. \n\nThe corollary to my argument is also that it isn't a single company that can allow the west to catch back up to the Chinese in the EV sector,  because that is not the main reason they are ahead. To catch up,  you'd have recreate a comparable EV value chain outside of China, one which China had spent the better part of 2 decades building up,  which is nigh impossible at this point.",

                      "body": "I don't know what China being a totalitarian state have to do with building EVs, but you are correct that things are different there. The difference is that the center of EV technology, manufacturing, and adoption lies squarely in China, which is why Tesla aside (and Tesla really only hit their stride after opening up their massive Chinese factory which builds almost half of all EVs they make), American EV startups are either struggling while burning cash (Rivian, Lucid) or are just DOA (Canoo, Aptera, Nicola etc).\n\nApple is too busy making money hand over fist so they don't have to worry about what their competitors are doing? I seem to remember a little company called Intel that DOMINATED its field for DECADES making money hand over fist, safe in the knowledge that upstarts like nVidia, TSMC, or even AMD would never catch up. And look at them now.\n\nBut I will agree that Apple is not a stupid company, and there is a good damn reason they gave up on their EV project, even if the TEN BILLION bucks they put into it represented a tremendous \"sunk  cost\". The reason itself is quite simple, really. Apple eventually realized that they simply do not have access to the designers, supply chain, and manufacturing expertise to build something as complicated as a car (even if EVs are relatively simpler to produce than ICE cars) in any sort of volume that will allow them to make a profit. Because they are in Cupertino, and thousands of miles away from the expertise needed to build electric cars. They the billions of Saudi cash Lucid has been burning for 15 years trying to keep their car business afloat in the US, and realized the odds are against them.\n\nXiaomi, on the other hand, is located in Beijing, and could just walk out their front door, put up an ad, and instantly be able to hire whoever they wanted to design their car, source parts and batteries for their car, build and manage a new factory to manufacture that car, and then just throw some of their own software engineers on the project to put their HyperOS software on it, and bam there's a car they can instantly scale into mass production.\n\nThe gulf between how quickly (and how costly) you can get an EV company off the ground in the US versus China is ridiculously wide. Rivian was founded in 2009, and Lucid even earlier in 2007, and now in 2025, I'm not certain that both of these companies COMBINED have managed to produce 200,000 cars in all these year so of operation. \n\nXiaomi started their car project in 2021, reputedly spent 3 years and 1 billion USD on it, launched their first car the SU7 in March 2024, and as of January 2025 have already built and sold 150,000 cars. [Goldman Sachs](https://cnevpost.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-sales-forecast-xiaomi-ev/) is projecting that Xiaomi will raise their production to 350,000 in 2025, and as many as 650,000 in 2026, allowing Xiaomi's EV unit to possibly turn a profit by 2026.\n\nRivian and Lucid cannot hope to compete with that, and neither could Apple. And since cars are not Apple's core business anyway, they got the hell out there despite dropping 10 billion on the project. Apple understood that more likely than not, the EV race has already been won by the Chinese.",
