          "body": "Many of the marketplace driven websites that source products from other vendors are susceptible to scammed products. \n\nMost of these websites have a sold/shipped by \"company name\" to verify the product is being sold from them and is therefore more reputable, as opposed to the company simply acting as the intermediary for another company and collecting a transition fee.\n\nTo be specific, Newegg has a slider/button to only show products sold by Newegg. \n\nAs you've already purchased your CPU, you should be able to check your order history to verify who sold you the bundle. \n\nOf course, if the processor is already installed you can check the BIOS or use software like HWinfo to verify the cpu model. \n\nI hope this helps.",
