Curious\n\nIf they can figure out how to increase supply, they will only use that to scale up, keeping the same profit margin until, and only if, demand drops. Is how I read their theory.

They do raise prices, but imo not enough if the 145% tariff is here to stay. There were reports of Xbox being out of stock across alot of retailers and Microsoft probably caught in bad timing to replenish them compared to Sony that probably produces more because it is still selling regardless. If the tariff stays for longer, I think Microsoft will pull from some markets and Sony will need to raise prices too.... But we'll see.",

You know that the US industry has been going downhill for decades with so much manufacturing going to china, because of that US doesn't have the manufacturing capabilities that companies need. If a company uses some or all Chinese parts then they are gonna struggle hard. \n\nThe electronics industry is literally all china, they have entire supermarkets literally just for components, something which is never seen anywhere else, they have entire sections of the cities just for manufacturing, so everything these companies source from are within 10 minutes drive, the US and Europe as well have zoning laws where this literally cannot happen, instead of a 10 minutes instead it's hours. To get to that stage would literally take decades of very specific planning. Companies may have 10-30 different suppliers all of which are close by, which makes everything very efficient. \n\nThis goes for many other industries too, china is incredibly laid out for manufacturing while the west doesn't have anything like this.\n\nBesides, why would these companies move to the US when they could move to other SEA countries or Mexico where labour costs are way down? \n\nI do agree that people need to be less consumerist, but these tariffs don't just hurt unneeded stuff, they affect absolutely everything, what you eat, drink, protective layers for food, clothes, cooking supplies etc, basic stuff.",

What mechanism are you talking about that would push the cost onto the corporations without impacting consumers? Because just asking nicely for a corporation to eat the cost of a tariff is pretty much the dumbest take you could potentially have when talking about this whole situation.\n\nThe mechanism is not having corporation under cut everyone by having unethical labor practices that normal companies can\u2019t compete with. They can\u2019t just endless raise prices because people will just stop buying stuff. We saw this as inflation was used as an excuse to raise prices above the actual inflation rate.\n\n>Companies charge based on what they pay for goods, they don't eat the cost and look at it as just paying their fair share, that would destroy a company how would you expect that to work? Do you believe that companies have endless  resources?\n\nDo you think companies don\u2019t have a profit margin? I don\u2019t understand this paragraph at all it makes zero sense. You have to balance you profit margins with what people are willing to pay you cant just increase you prices as much as you want and expect people to keep buying stuff that\u2019s not how it works. You demand will absolutely be destroyed if you try to pass off all of the cost onto consumers or they will find an alternative. This is the basis of capitalism.\n\n>That's why you absolutely have to tax them with actual taxes because that's not something that just gets pushed off as easily on consumers, It also allows for you to completely avoid companies that do pass off their higher tax burden onto customers because usually  we have an alternate to choose from, but with tariffs you're forcing people to pay the company at whatever rate they ask because there is no alternative.\n\nThis paragraph makes zero sense and it\u2019s almost like your logic is opposite. First of all you aren\u2019t explaining why a universal tax wouldn\u2019t cause them to pass the cost onto consumers. Also why would there be companies that don\u2019t pass the cost onto consumers? This contradicts what you just said above. Are we just hoping companies will eat a tax increase out of the goodness of their heart? Why would there not be an alternative in the tariff case then? Not only could companies just eat the cost increase like they would with a tax increase but they can also use American based companies that wouldn\u2019t be affected by tariffs. Your argument assumes everything is made outside of America which is not correct.\n\n>If you increase the price for American companies to produce a product and make it punitive to choose any non American company but somehow expect the prices not to go up?  Like you're just expecting companies to operate at a loss because of \"reasons\" until the company would most certainly have to close. So in the long run you want to damage all American companies and destroy more jobs while simultaneously costing American consumers more money everyday, seems like a super smart winning strategy.\n\nThe first sentence is literally the opposite of what tariffs are supposed to do and that literally describes what a flat tax increase would do to companies. I\u2019m so confused. Companies would not operate at a loss their profits would not just be increased. Meanwhile American based companies that don\u2019t use unethical labor would actually be able to compete generating tons of jobs that are not only protected by workers right laws but also environmental jobs and the money would actually stay in our local economy rather then stimulating Chinas. Not only will you have jobs that don\u2019t require a college degree, but you will have tons of engineering, environmental, health and safety jobs as well.",

You think because an American corporation is in America that they're making every part of their product. It's like you don't actually know what a supply chain is or how that affects manufacturing and how it affects the cost for the actual company. Most American companies don't actually produce anything in the country, And when they do they mostly source their materials from out of the country, we don't have infrastructure to replace that. That's the biggest part of this whole conversation, we don't have the factories or the infrastructure in place for any of the stuff we're putting tariffs on, not to mention some of the actual resources we need can't be produced here, there are rare earth minerals required for a lot of electronics that we just can't produce. I would really like to see you find a company that makes a product that solely only sources its materials within America.",
