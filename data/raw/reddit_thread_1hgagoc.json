      "body": "I work in public safety and this looming threat of banning Chinese made drones is something that would seriously affect us more than people know. The fact of the matter is, there's not a single decent US made drone that we can use as a viable replacement. \n\nWe currently have a Matrice 300, two Matrice 30T's, two Mavic 3 Enterprises and an Avata. We have at least 2-3 wins a month with these things, whether it's finding a missing person in the woods, finding a boater overboard, or sending the drones in ahead of police for emergency situations. \n\nWe have a Skydio that's so horribly bad that it never leaves its case. There's a company that takes Mavic's, guts them and adds in US made components but the interface is horrible, the latency is a disaster and its not reliable at all. Other than that, everything else is extremely overpriced and significantly outdated technology.",

Smartphones are a case in point, since the baseband processor typically runs its own OS and has unsupervised access to RAM and other resources.\n\nIs the fear warranted? Absolutely. Is the policy worth the negative impacts? I don't know. I do know there's nothing magic about building a drone. The market can fill this gap with a little bit of time. The hardest part is the chips (which admittedly are a bit magical because of their complex international supply chains), but this hurdle is minimal compared to the much larger problem we need to solve with respect to our smartphones, PC's, cars, etc., relying on Chinese semiconductors.\n\nOne last thing: if Washington is hand-wringing about a potential digital threat from China, it's probably already a reality. The CCP can make stuff happen. (And we've probably been doing something similar to them.)",

Look at what happened to GoPro when they tried to compete. \n\nI\u2019m no expert, but I\u2019ve read that DJI is a decade ahead of rivals and it has all the advantages of scale now. They are just superior drones, in every way. \n\nAre we going to nationally subsidize a U.S.-built alternative now? Because if the private sector tries it, they\u2019re going to get murdered like GoPro. \n\nThe requirement to build and crew ships used for domestic transport in the United States has NOT worked out particularly well and now this is basically proposing to do the same thing. Yes if your only option is an American-made drone with 60% of the performance at 200% of the cost, some industries will just be forced to eat that cost. But that isn\u2019t going to magically incubate a DJI-worthy U.S. drone-maker; it will result in lazy, expensive manufacturing just like we see with domestic shipping and transportation builds via the Jones Act.",

But generally speaking not to the extent that the CCP does. You are underestimating the extent of government subsidy the CCP puts toward these initiatives. Rare earth metals for example are an area where the CCP has explicitly dumped on the market in order to put competitors out of business. Hell, they explicitly crashed REE markets when the US was reopening a mine a decade ago and immediately increased prices after that mine went out of business.\n\nTo say that the US is anything like the Russian situation is seriously insane. To draw any comparison to the Russian oligarchs and the amount of power they have over the government is nuts. You're either dramatically underestimating the amount of corruption the Russian government has or severely overestimating how rife it is in the US. The US by no means is a paragon of non-corruption, but Russia is quite literally a kleptocratic state built on a foundation of state owned enterprises sold to specific individuals.",

That's something that both Biden and Trump agree upon, at least in principle.\n\nIt's not to say we really have any moral high ground on how we conduct our business, or that we should hate the Chinese for doing the same things that we'd probably do in their situation, but it's a simple matter of protecting our own interests.",

And if anything I think most of this brute-force crap is really just set to fail and allow certain people to benefit from kickbacks for exemptions, among other things. Most of these companies which will be effected aren't going to invest in shifting to US manufacturing, they will simply raise their prices as necessary and keep it off shore. I don't see it changing without significant investment and incentives from the government to actually do it. Hell, in some cases I think there are certain things we simply can't make here. Things like certain agricultural products, if I remember right. And to add to that, we still have to source the materials for it all, which if we have them here is even more time to spin up mines and such for. And that's all besides the labor and brain drain issues you've mentioned.\n\nIt's definitely more complex of an issue than \"lol tariffs and ban foreign products\" will solve.\n\n> Food manufacturing, for example, has the lowest profit margin I've personally seen.

For example, you can keep your facility filthy until your audit window of 90 days and then go back to business as usual after the audit. You can hand select documentation to the auditor. The audit industry has also lowered its standards to require only 2 years of industry experience instead of being an industry comprised of a more seasoned workforce. This is because the company being audited pays for the audit and can refuse to have the same auditor for the following audit if they don't like the result. \n\nSo yeah regulations at this time will just exasperate the growing problems.",

Physically attack the US? That's never going to happen. They can cause much more mayhem by hacking the grid, banking systems, traffic lights.... \n\nThis is not about national security. It's about fucking with the Chinese. Tiktok is way more of a security threat honestly, because it has full access to your phone.",

Second, they don't subsidize it for a few reasons, one is because Americans (especially one political party) is ideologically opposed to government subsidies, and the other side really is ideologically opposed to subsidies for companies, especially anything having to do with military. Getting both sides to agree on something like this is f'ing impossible. If the Dem's came out supporting subsidies for drone manufacturers, republicans would oppose it instinctively because Dem's want it, and the GOP just kneejerk opposes anything the Dem's want, whether they would normally agree w/ it or not. If the GOP supported it, Dem's MIGHT support it, but now with the current administration there would be a lot of concerns about conflicts of interest and double dipping and blah blah blah. Basically the short answer is, politics. CCP doesn't have that problem because they aren't a democracy.",
