          "body": "I don\u2019t think power is too much of an issue with most chips, most Sony chips pull around 7watts, the power draw issues come from accessories. The movie cameras (ARRI Alexa\u2019s)run on 12v batteries where the chips pull around 10 watts but when you start rolling and with a viewfinder on and are outputting video you start to touch around 80watts. So they become pretty power hungry. The Sony movie cameras (the Venice) is considered efficient at around 60watts with a much larger sensor.",

I think if this tech ends up in say a consumer camera they will neuter it to keep the power in check for the application and the power draw will increase for professional applications",

It's unclear how this improves the image quality but my guess is some sort of extra signal processing before analog-to-digital conversion.",
