It needs to have different temperatures based on activity. \n\nHue bulbs solved both issues. The lamp is now great for any occasion, be it reading, crafts, cooking, movie night...you name it. That's super convenient in a small apartment where space is a limited resource. I bought mine on a sale, the round glass orb ones, and it ended up costing about the same as the normal bulbs I replaced.",

They'll care that the lights dim to a nice warm color that makes their home feel cozy in the evenings and works with their phone app. They're not using them for filmmaking.",
