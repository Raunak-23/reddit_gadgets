The number of truck horns titled \u201c600db\u201d, where 600-DB is the model number is hilarious. 600 decibels would be enough to collapse the known universe into a black hole. \n\nThe loudest recorded sound in history was the Krakatoa Volcano eruption in 1863 at 180db. The sound wave caused tsunamis and earthquakes halfway around the world. Decibels are logarithmic, 600db would be 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (or approximately 10^40) times louder.

I use a 55 inch 4K TV as my monitor not only because gaming is uniquely visceral but also because the landscape of all that FOV makes day to day apps just an absolute joy to use.  I'll never go back.  I also won't drop down from 120Hz because I'm too used to the responsiveness and other conveniences tied to that refresh rate.  It's really kind of gobsmacking that HDMI's as-yet-unreleased standard can't give me the only step up from what I'm currently using that makes any sense.\n\nI feel like the folks behind display formats are leaning on compression the same way GPU makers (and thus game designers) are beginning to lean on frame generation and such.  Halfway measures whose artifacts 95% of folks are incapable of noticing, leaving us 5% out to dry.",
