              "body": "It\u2019s rare that any early test devices are directly given by the manufacturers other than specific circumstances. Nintendo likely provided spec sheets so that developers and 3rd party accessory providers can begin design around the performance and form factor. It\u2019s not like they hand them an actual prototype, those are usually made in-house.\n\nMost of this is speculation, but the chances of anyone having an actual official pre-release version of the switch 2, outside a very select few instances, is very slim. This is pretty standard for devices in general unless they\u2019re a brand new line of devices where there\u2019s no previous context to go off of. Like the original switch probably had more prototype devices because it was a completely new device with new form factor and new internals, everything. The switch 2 is a modular update with better specs, modified form factor but that\u2019s about it.",

When writing that statement, there should be a question mark at the end.\n\nThe question in that situation must be derived from context. Asking a question in this way is often more efficient as it is open ended.\n\nIn this particular case, it was faster and more efficient than trying to make assumptions by asking a series of follow up questions.\n\nIf someone says they had to \"go feed the dog.\" I might respond:\n\n\"You have a dog?\"\n\nThis both shows that I didn't know that they had a dog and also asks for some context.  \"You have a dog\" is a statement, not a question.   Writing it without a question mark would be grammatically incorrect.\n\nYou properly inferred that I was asking a question, perhaps only because you saw my question mark.  The question mark was clearly important.  \n\nI hope that this exchange helps you figure out if uncertain declarations are a question in future conversations.\n\nBest of luck!",
