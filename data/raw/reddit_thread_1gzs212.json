Took a while to get some half decent ones that only do charging for controllers and I keep spare heads on the cables to keep them working.\n\nThe 2010 magsafe was a good implementation though you are less likely to throw your mbp into your lint pocket. It worked because it was recessed and small so it\u2019s hard for stuff to fall in the port. The cable also had the contacts on the inside protected from damage.\n\nI hate the Surface Pro (4ish) version with a fin that slides in. It comes out too easily and it\u2019s so big you need to fold the cable just right so it fits and stays in. Charges so slow that I can\u2019t plug it in and turn on the PC without it turning off. It can\u2019t charge the battery from empty and power the surface at the same time, got to let it charge to 10% in it so when it boosts, it doesn\u2019t shut off.",

It's why companies like Dell and Lenovo make those little compact desktop PC's. It's their exact use case, except you don't end up replacing your monitor and keyboard each time and you don't have to pay extra for the extra miniaturization and custom hardware that laptops use. You benefit from not replacing a bunch of stuff you don't need to replace as well as getting the benefit of better economy of scale.\n\nWhile it's true that companies are generally going to toss the whole desktop rather than upgrade the CPU, it still saves a ton of money to use the mini desktop PC's rather than laptops.",

Do you know how much that would cost to implement across all devices? All companies would need to have a work together to make this happen. Then I can't imagine how long it would take to move to USB-D when USB-C becomes obsolete. \n\nBasically you either don't work in the IT world, have no clue how it works, or have very little interaction with people in general to think this is going to happen even in the next 30 years. The fact you own a macbook speaks volumes about your level of ignorance towards to rest of the population. Mac users are always living in a massive bubble.",

The problem is that a lot of them don\u2019t support it yet, for no real reason whatsoever. \n\n\nWe already have USB over Ethernet. We already have PoE.
