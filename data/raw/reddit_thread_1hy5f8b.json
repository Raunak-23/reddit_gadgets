It\u2019s already illegal to fly them during a wildfire, and during a TFR - so this was illegal for at least two reasons. It was also probably beyond visual line of sight, and probably flying above 400 feet, and probably with visibility less than the required amount. So probably even more reasons.\n\nIdiots are going to do stupid things, even if drones are banned - plenty of them exist.\n\nEven if geofencing is enforced more on DJI, people will DIY things that don\u2019t have geofencing, etc. \n\nIMHO - the news media and all emergency management notices should all be clear that it is a no fly zone for drones and for most other flights as well. People may simply just not know what the rules are, and it\u2019s a good time to remind people in a timely manner.",

Are you incapable of bantering?\n\nI know we aren't going to give you any of our states and we are not going to invade you. You can pull that stick out of your ass and attempt to laugh along with us trying to deal with where our country is heading. As I said, at the moment all we can do is try and laugh about it while we figure out just how to limit the damage done over the next 4+ years and hopefully get the adults back in charge of things.\n\nMy wife and I are seriously considering places to move out of this country. We are lucky that her job can possibly let us move to a few places that would be decent places, especially for expats.",

An active wildfire area would most definitely be considered restricted airspace. \n\nBy law, operators have to: not fly 400' above ground elevation, not fly above people/crowds, not fly over occupied vehicles, and maintain visual LoS (line of sight) with the drone. FPV pilots like myself (wearing goggles) have to have a spotter with us to maintain LoS while we fly. \n\nPart-107 FAA-licensed operators may bypass some of these rules (not elevation and airspace rules) with permission of all people involved. \n\nLots of regulations already exist, idiots like this though are ruining things for the actual hobbyists.",
