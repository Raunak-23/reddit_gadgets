There are many different systems in use and they're all essentially tarted up linear algebra with statistical data-sets.

Like, you don't even have dark mode but you have an AI chat bot? Or Google with Gemini that's still less useful than Google Assistant. I'd use it if I could say \"open YouTube and find a video on this topic, over an hour long that I can listen to on my drive, make sure it's got a positive reception.\" But it can't do stuff like that.\n\nThe funny thing is, I use AI all the time, Claude is fantastic. I use it as a kind of Google on steroids. It does amazing at helping to direct me when I research something, but I never trust information it gives me, I'll ask it \"what should I research if I'm interested in X\", and go from there. It's also pretty ridiculously good at coding, or at least at giving me a start from which I can go on by myself.
