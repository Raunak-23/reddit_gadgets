It could carry batteries and sensors, but that would shorten the lifespan. The material science and precision engineering is still incredible, it's very cool. \n\nHowever, bees can fly for a few hours a day for 5-6 weeks with a full suite of sensors tuned for pollination, can self-replicate, are biodegradable, don't have to be plugged in or carry batteries, and create useful by-products such as honey and wax. They only need plants and clean water to function.\n\nThis bot is a big leap in material engineering and micro robotics, but a serious bee replacement is over the horizon, and the vertical farming model it's supposedly intended for has yet to become worth the energy costs (forgetting the fact that bees can work in vertical farms anyway because they can fly *up*).",

                      "body": "This is true, but these are meant to be used in large vertical multi-floor climate-controlled indoor farms that can grow things year-round under very specific conditions. I think most people would agree that vertical farms are a potential solution to our overuse of arable land and the issue of deforestation to create more farmland.\n\nSo moving onto bees, wouldn't there be quite a few issues with maintaining a colony of living bees in a vertical farm?\n\n* The one that comes to mind first would simply be that a vertical farm would need to somehow train bees to fly up and down the farm through specific channels to consistently reach pollen. I say \"train\" because this does not seem like natural behavior\u2014most trees are far shorter than such a building and I'm not sure how well bees communicate verticality with their \"[dances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waggle_dance)\".\n\n* Also, they'd need to rotate crops to always have flowering crops so that the bees are fed.\n\n* Then they'd need a supply chain to feed bees when there aren't any flowers, unless you want the bees to die and require replacing. Saying \"They only need plants and clean water to function.\" seems extremely reductive for the amount of effort beekeeping requires.\n\n* Bees might also get into equipment and other spaces, requiring more maintenance. It would be difficult to get them all out so they didn't interfere with harvesting equipment.\n\nI'm sure people more experienced in beekeeping and engineering would have a far larger list of issues that would arise in using bees instead of robots, this is just what came to mind quickly.\n\nNow, just to clarify, I'm all for sustainable solutions and I do agree that we should use sustainable solutions instead of trying to supplant everything with (speculative) technology. But I also don't think it's a good idea to blindly ignore the potential downsides or even benefits of new technology simply because it seems like a waste instinctively.",
