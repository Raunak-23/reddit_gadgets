This is simply using the limited rear IO space on a small device to its fullest and moving something most users will touch maybe a couple of times a year to the bottom. \n\nSure, they could have used the side or something but it\u2019s really not the same school of thought IMO. One is intentionally nerfing a device in order to fit the visual the designer had, the other is maximizing limited space for useful things instead of a button that will often never be pressed. It\u2019s not the smartest decision on the planet but it doesn\u2019t affect the usability of the device at all.",
