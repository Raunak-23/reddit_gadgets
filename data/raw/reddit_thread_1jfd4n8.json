It also won\u2019t pay any monetary relief to customers impacted by the November 2020 firmware update.\n\nHowever, HP agreed to pay $5,000 each to Mobile Emergency Housing Corp., Performance Automotive & Tire Center, and David Justin Lynch, who was eventually added to the complaint, \u201cto compensate them for the services they performed on behalf of the classes,\u201d HP said. It will also pay $725,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses.\n\nA win for HP users comes from the company's legal commitment to allow users of specific printers to decline firmware updates that would push Dynamic Security.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nWow the lead plaintiffs got $5k and everyone else got a \"commitment\". Lawyers got $725k.",

But it\u2019s sure as shit better than nothing. \n\nIf you think companies are shit with the existence of class actions, imagine how much exponentially shittier they would be without any means of mass accountability. \n\nAnd that\u2019s saying nothing about the injunctive forms of class action relief.",

Thus, the two sides negotiate over settlements and then at the very end, the judge holds a hearing to determine whether to approve the settlement. But the judge can\u2019t just magically supersede their negotiations and demand the company pay more. He can deny the settlement if he thinks it\u2019s in the class\u2019 best interest, but there are several factors the judge considers to make this judgement. And he doesn\u2019t get to then demand more money from the company.\n\nYou\u2019re suggesting that single judges should have power that they just don\u2019t. If you want actual penalties to be imposed, I\u2019m with you 10,000%. But this is something that CONGRESS must enact.\n\nAnd just FYI, even extremely high punitive damages can be predicted and factored into the cost of doing business. If it\u2019s predictable, it\u2019s factored. Thus, when a company chooses not to take some shitty action, they\u2019ve determined the cost of litigation/penalties is too high to be worth it. And when they choose to take an action, they\u2019ve made the other calculation. The only way to counteract this analysis would be through introduction of unpredictability and uncapped punitive damage awards. And I hate to break it to you, but most states have passed legislation preventing those. And the Supreme Court has also held that they should be calculable.",

I do! I was at least *attempting* it in print before the internet! If the information wasn't a simple query from whatever search engine you have set for whatever your browser of choice is away from you then MAYBE? But these same people are sharing Trumpanzee memes from their phones in the middle of Walmart. \n\nIf they can *spread* bullshit but not make the most basic query to identify it... I'm not *completely* without sympathy. But I've got a lot more worthy candidates ahead of them in line.",
