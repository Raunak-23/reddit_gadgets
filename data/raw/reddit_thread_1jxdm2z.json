Although how bad it was depended on the game. \n\nI've only recently gotten my hands on a GPU that can do DLSS and have been using the overwrite tool in the Nvidia app to force games to use the more recent versions of the model wherever possible. The newest model (4.0 or preset K) is absolutely incredible at maintaining detail and image stability though. You can use the app to force whatever model you like, so maybe I'll knock it down to preset A just to see how far things have come.",

And frankly people should be a bit careful claiming it, it has been wrongly claimed for decades now. People said it with 1080p with 4k and with above 60hz, it was even claimed with above 24 fps.",

And that was why upscaling was design to do anyways. \n\nUpscaling was done on consoles before DLSS or FSR was around for upscaling. Just those techniques didn't have as good of quality, so the ratio between render resolution to render output wouldn't be as huge as DLSS or FSR's ratios.\n\nFor example, checkerboarding upscaling was used in BF1 on consoles for 4k. I believe the input render resolution was 1900p upscaled to 2160p.",

That'd be 220 PPI and around 120 PPD at ~28 inches away from the display. For Windows probably a bit overkill since it does scaling more sensibly but for MacOS you'd want to hit that 220ppi to avoid fractional scaling.\n\nFor context, I use a 4k 42 inch OLED TV as a display currently. That's 105PPI and 58PPD at ~28 inches away and I view it from as close as 24 inches. At Native resolution, the UI looks alright, but pixels are very plainly visible. I actually scale it to around 3200x1800 which allows for HiDPI mode to be active on MacOS with BetterDisplay, which renders it at double the resolution and scales down to fit 4k. It's sharper, but not as sharp as it could be if it were a 2x scaling.\n\nOther advantages it has over 6k or 5k displays made for MacOS is that it 4k and 1080p content have integer scaling when viewed at full screen.\n\nI also kind of wonder if an 8k 77 inch display viewed from normal tv viewing distances would make for a good display?\n\nIn any case, 4k is certainly large enough for most content people are consuming like video games and tv shows and the 160ish PPI of some of these 27 inch displays is more than sharp enough with Windows' scaling modes, but that doesn't suit my wants and/or needs.",

Then when I had a little more money I paid hundreds for a Sony Trinitron that could do 1600x1200 back when 800x600 was the norm. When 1080p was the standard I paid I about $1200 for a Dell UltraSharp U3011 that could do 2560x1600.\n\nWhen I went 4k I did a quadruple setup with three 26\" monitors with g-sync and a 65\" TV, it took a triple Titan X setup and a custom water cooling loop to drive it without sound like a plane was taking off (that system drew enough power that it could trip my circuit breaker).\n\nI'm saying all this to prove I've always chased resolution and I've been willing to spend a ton of money on it.\n\nI've never once put any serious thoughts into an 8k setup. I just see no realistic gains over 4k. Sure if I'm really close to a 65\" 4k TV and I look really close at a still image I can see pixels. But in practice that never matters. I can read small text off 4k monitors and 8k monitors don't really look better to my eye.\n\nThe only practical thing I can see for 8k monitors is if you need to work with a lot of 4k streams all the time. It lets you view multiple on one screen without shrinking them. But aside from that I can hardly think of a use case.",

The limitations of the resolution are more noticeable as the screen size increases.  These things were 75 and 85 inches.  I'm willing to bet 4K still looks really good at that size, but the bigger you make the screens, the more noticeable a bump in resolution like that becomes.  For people with the space and a real desire to have a huge home theater setup... I can see it, but that strikes me as being too niche of a market to get the entire entertainment industry to shift to making content in 8K.  This was pure cart-before-horse.",

It's more about graininess/blurryness/noisiness/artifacting in the image. Like the 60fps is obviously good but it does nothing for the actual frame quality, it's still horrible on 720p scaled.

Yes pixels don\u2019t solely determine this and that\u2019s why the leading cinema camera brand (ARRi) still has only made 4.5k cameras at its max. That being said though, 12k is great for VFX and reframing. But it my opinion and why it\u2019s great for the lower end prosumer cameras is that it\u2019s so much \u201ccrispers\u201d with less equipment, meaning smaller productions can make them work for them. As well as when you downscale for let\u2019s say social medial the equality still retains it self very well vs I\u2019ve seen some 4k camera get a bit muddy when being down graded especially if not having been lit and color graded correctly.",

If I compress it down to something that my relatives can stream over their shitty wifi and rural Internet, then the exact same footage starts looking like it was made with a potato.\n\nThat got me thinking, and recently I tried the Blackmagic Camera app with my iPhone 16. It can record with a bit rate over 1 Gbps. The quality difference is incredible, despite being the exact same tiny phone camera as before.\n\nThe lesson is that bitrate and OLED make a far bigger difference than the number of pixels.",

Until it's entirely reasonable for a person to be pulling down 4K content at a bitrate equal to one full-quality 4K image per frame with only lossless compression used, you're still going to get more out of investing into network architecture and compression than buying a display with four times more pixels than you can drive.\n\nIt's like buying a $100,000 muscle car with 800 HP so that you can drive to work and back at 35 MPH.

There also isn't any 8k streaming content.\n\nThen you have the quality improvement issue. Most people have 55\" or 65\" TVs for a main TV. 4K already hits 100 pixels per degree (ppd) at 6 feet away and 65\" TVs are 100 ppd at 7 feet away. Apple Retina aims for being over 60 ppd to make sure you can't see any pixel artifacts. Vision experts don't 100% agree most of of them say between 60 and 100 pixels per degree you aren't seeing the pixels. The 100 pixel per degree argument is also more of a young person with better than 20/20 vision. So in usage situations a lot of people won't see the content quality difference.",

      "body": "There is an argument that at smaller sizes 4K TV sets already don\u2019t make sense for the average use case. Admittedly now that 65\u201d has become the de facto standard TV size and larger 70-80\u201d TVs aren\u2019t as unattainable the argument is kind of outdated, but for a TV of like 50-55\u201d at a viewing distance of 10 feet or more it\u2019s not just overkill, the human retina isn\u2019t capable of resolving that much detail.\n\nHonestly I think the only reason 4K became as ubiquitous as it is was because of marketing and buzzwords, along with the fact that at the electronics store you tend to get much closer to the TVs than you would at home, so the difference between the two would have been much more impressive and impactful than it would in a mundane home setting. It\u2019s not like the average person had a *need* for a 4KTV, and in many normal use cases it would be downright impossible for them to really see a difference.\n\n8K therefore only makes sense for supersized TVs or home theater systems. At sizes of like 120\u201d (depending of course on viewing distance) then yes, 8K would be a visible improvement, there is still room to push sharpness further. But how many of us have that setup, or even have room for that kind of setup if the TVs didn\u2019t cost as much as a used car? It\u2019s an extremely niche thing that will likely remain that way for a long time.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say 8K will never see widespread use, for example when it comes to computer monitors since we sit so close to them 8K would be a noticeable improvement over 4K for very large monitors (larger than the average person uses but the size s enthusiasts and professionals often use). And for that reason I don\u2019t really have a problem with 8K *content* existing, though there\u2019s really no market for it yet and it doesn\u2019t make sense to try and rush it. But for normal sized home setups, outside of some niche cases, 8K doesn\u2019t really offer any advantage and the increase in resolution over 4K is largely wasted.",
