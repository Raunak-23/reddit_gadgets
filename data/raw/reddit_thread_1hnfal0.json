On the same desk are my lightning iPad Air (2015) and my old Airpods (2018) which I used until last week\n\nUSB-C is way better. They can charge faster, and the devices can charge each other which is SO useful. Eg I forgot to charge my Airpods but could just charge them from my phone. I can charge my fiancee's phone from my phone when she had signal and I didn't, but she had no battery left\n\nI love my iPhone, I love my Airpods, I love my iPad. I love my MacBook and my Mac Mini. So I sure as shit don't hate Apple... but I still think USB-C is better",
