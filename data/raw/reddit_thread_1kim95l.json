But also, of course I haven't played the game yet and sometimes you need to get hands on before you get a feel for things. \n\nIt is what it is performance wise, but it looks like even top end systems will be using upscaling and frame gen to achieve any kind of high refresh experience. A lot of the market still uses non-raytracing hardware, so they cant play the game at all, and anyone on 1st generation raytracing cards is going to have poor performance.",
