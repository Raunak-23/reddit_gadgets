I've even used it to access files on a SATA SSD drive (by daisy chaining with a SATA III to USB adapter), although I had to plug in the power adapter because the Lightning port didn't provide enough power by itself.\n\nVery useful for me years ago, when I spent a lot of time flying, so I loaded up an SSD with movies and TV shows and just plugged that in, without using up storage on my iPhone and having to use a laptop in economy class trays.",
