Why? They own the patent so they're not paying royalties to themselves, and the laser can't be *that* expensive.  It's basically just making an inferior product for the sake of making it",

I don't think I've ever even seen a burned Blu-ray.\n\nAt this point, if most people want to transfer like 100GB of information in a compact package, they'll get a $20 microSD card. Even if you're just using it once, it's probably more economical (and greener, honestly) than buying the burner and a stack of discs.\n\nThe only way the Blu-ray writer makes sense is if you this a ***ton*** and don't want to ferry media back and forth or if you have a client who you need to transfer big data sets to who also demands deliveries on write-once, then read-only media. Though I can think of one pretty big customer who does demand the latter in specific situations.",

And Sony could quite possibly get away with it coz who else are console players going to turn to? It always fella to early till the jump is made. I genuinely believe next could literally be it. And if video game companies also just stop with the physicals, what are the customers actually going to do? Not play them?

So from a business standpoint it makes sense. Sony offers customers something which other top brands do not. So let's also apply the business standpoint for the disc drive. Every game that is sold, sony gets a cut of it. If we have disc drive, they sell it to a customer once, and they get the profit of that one sale. But they can lose out on profit from game sales if people go second hand which is a key selling point of physical games. If i was sony, and game devs, i'd try and go fully digital as it means no second hand sales, so every person that plays it, would have to buy their own individual copy. They can also just pass it off as this is the way that technology is going and leave it at that. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, Sony is a business. They are not your friend.

Heck their next Xbox might just be a streaming stick and a controller. And even if Xbox did push out an actual console. And \u201ckept\u201d the disc drive. Means nothing coz they literally have no games, that\u2019s an actual Xbox exclusive. If Sony keeps pushing out their console sellers, it ain\u2019t gonna mean much. Especially since the majority of video game sales are digital now and that\u2019s just gonna increase. \n\nMy argument is that Xbox ain\u2019t even worth looking at as completion anymore. Not only coz they ain\u2019t focusing on the same thing, but also coz well, they just really ain\u2019t. The only reason to pick up the series x is so I could play games from the 360/ps3 era on a modern console.",

Whoever stops offering physical first risks losing customers to the other platform that still offers it. I suspect it will take more time for them to normalize digital purchases before they feel comfortable risking losing the folks who demand physical to their competitor. \n\nNot that it applies to a discussion about bluray, but for what its worth, nintendo has already confirmed backwards compatibility for switch games on their next console which means there will be a cartridge slot which probably means their next system will also distribute games that way.",

For the loud parts of the movie to be actually loud, they have to be substantially louder than the dialog which means anyone adjusting the volume for the loud parts to be comfortable will think the quiet parts are too quiet. The intent is generally to set the volume so the dialog sounds natural and the loud parts blow you away but the loud parts being that loud is uncomfortable for a lot of folks. \n\nIts sort of like how a lot of classical music requires really turning up the volume because most of the recording will be too quiet otherwise and the high volume is reserved for a few notable highs while most modern popular music is basically loud the whole time.",

With UHD, game consoles didn't support all the hdr formats via bluray (especially not the most popular one which is dolby vision).\n\nSo I had to buy a standalone, but finding a standalone that supported all the different HDR formats wasn't easy.  I ended buying a panasonic for a considerable amount of money.  Not like the old days where people could pick up a player for a hundred bucks.\n\nI think it's evolved out of the common persons realm, and into the realm of enthusiasts.\n\nI also find myself, who is physical media enthusiast, buying less and less UHD blurays due to the cost.   Especially here in Canada where sales and good prices are few and far between.",

I think that most likely means they don't pay the license unless someone's actually using it.\n\nEven if Sony charged $5 or $10 for an app in their online store, to cover the cost of a Dolby Vision license, I'd pay it.
