In order to achieve this, console designers had to be innovative and push boundaries.\n\nToday's consoles are about 90% aligned with PC architecture.  Nobody is pretending anymore.  \"Working on the design\" in this context means very little more than sussing out with AMD what minor tweaks to implement for what is fundamentally yesteryear PC hardware\u2014whereas it used to literally mean \"design\" in the exact sense that you, I and the casual reader understand the word.\n\nI'm not saying you have to be comfortable with this reality but it is what it is.  And the trajectory of this trend hasn't settled, either; don't be surprised if the PS6 ends up being a Steamdeck knockoff launched alongside Sony's own PC-compatible Gamepass knockoff.",

They're not working away on PC partpicker. \n\nAll of those components are custom. It's a zen 2 processor but it's one that's unique to the PS5. \n\nThose components need to be designed.

And it's not as though it was \"on console but would have been way better on PC\", either.  As a quick and succinct example, when the Jak & Daxter series came out, there's absolutely zero way I would have expected a PC to be able to reproduce that kind of game.  It's 2001 and there's a game that runs at a rock solid 60fps and still looks as good as that.  No\u2014PC had nothing to compare.  That's the phenomenon I'm referring to.",

And in many cases (like Bethesda games and others of that type) that never actually happened, due to an unfortunate design choice regarding the PS3's RAM.\n\nI think the shell shock of that episode is what led to Sony finally deciding that simpler PC architecture would be the way forward.",

                  "body": "I understood the sarcasm. I'm not saying they didn't ask for it, the fact that Sony is releasing a console at $700 with LESS features is more of a symptom of the way they do business rather than the harsh economies of video games.\n\nOne of the few things I like about the Series S is that, while it is mostly subscription-dependent, the competitive price and the price-to-performance is spot on. Sony is trying to be the new Apple by dividing their user base into people who look for value (the majority) and the ones that want the premium (the ones that spend the most). If they want to make more profit while user base is not growing is charging more to the people that will spend. I also think the price raise from $400 to $450 has something to do with it. \n\nOnce you make more and more predatory monetization schemes there will be a ceiling to how much you can pocket out of your user base, they've already raised the prices to $70, they've limited their working IPs, they slashed backwards compatibility for their first three consoles, they're doing remakes and remasters of games that run perfectly fine on new hardware (and charging a premium for it), they're making log ins with PlayStation accounts mandatory even for single-player games, they're shoving every game with DLCs and micro transactions, it was a matter of time they charge a premium for their Pro models. If this continues on I can bet the Base PS6 will have ads while installing games and you have to buy the PS6 Pro for $999 to get rid of any ads.\n\nThe only way they course-correct is by simply shutting down their influx of money. Don't give in to Pro models, don't buy DLCs that don't give games any value, don't preorder, cancel any subscription you don't use and spread your opinion on the internet if they go too far. It worked with the Xbox One.",
