Theres nothing stopping MS from saying \"we're going to stop signing driver bundles that dont include an ARM binary\", but they havent. \n\nSo no anti-cheat, most antivirus doesnt work, a lot of incompatibilities around anything that needs specialized hardware features (NPU/GPU/Rendering/Ect). VPN clients can have issues. \n\nLack of NPU support kills a lot of number-crunchy applications as well.",

But it idles at super low power and isn't a slouch for what it is, which would make for a great little Nas or mini server. But again it's knee capped by software.\n\nThat and I have to use a pre built image for arm SBCs. You don't Install like you do via x86 based stuff. You build or get an image and write it to the devices storage medium. I'm sure that puts off a lot of people too.",
