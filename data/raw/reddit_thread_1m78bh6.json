I think thats great if you're going for pixel perfect led displays, it looks great, I'm sure would put out a fine signal considering how many ports it has from the beginning, but yeah its not a crt replacement if you have a crt. I am lucky enough to have kept an older tv from my parents house. A newer sony, cant remember the model but it has scart, s-video, component and coax so I can hook moat things up to it natively. So its not like I'm dying for a crt over here, they're also cheap if you know where to look. I would love even something as small as 12in thats done without being terrible and bad for the enviornment I'd easily pay $300 for it if not more depending on form factor, weight, and inputs. Bonus points for usb and digital inputs as well, but obviously harder to get digital to analog without issues.",

I think it\u2019s the Silverstone case badged up and pre-built.\u00a0\n\nI think the real difficulty is that all of these are previewed with a CRT which isn\u2019t what people have. With some tweaking and a pair of case feet, I\u2019d bet Silverstone could have a 90 rotation where the case can either be a mid-tower or desktop.\n\nOr pair it with some crazy all in one with an LCD built out like a chunky CRT and has all sorts of extras to fill out the case volune.",
