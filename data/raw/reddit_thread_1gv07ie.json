I had spent my entire life using Android products, which fucking suck and don\u2019t just work. That is, however, my experience with every single software I use, so I assumed that was the norm. \n\nSome way or another, I got my hands on a fully new iPhone 12, back when that was the latest product. \n\nExcited to finally have an expensive device that doesn\u2019t require tinkering, I booted it and it showed a menu for first setup. It had a curious feature for moving from an Android to a iPhone called Move to iOS. Excellent! Except, it didn\u2019t work. The Android side of this (downloading the app on the Play Store) worked correctly (as in, it loaded) but the iOS side was stuck on a loop. \n\nNever mind then, I\u2019ll just do it later!\u2026 except three days later, when I thought maybe the bug was fixed, I discovered that that process can only be done *on first boot*, for some godforsaken reason, so I had to factory reset my device. \n\nAfter this, I wanted to download the App Store, specifically to download Whatsapp. The App Store kept itself on a reboot cycle, closing and opening again and again until I created an entirely new account.\n\nThough I have never had anymore problems with my Apple phones (I\u2019ve had 3 iPhones since then and NEVER has the Move to iOS option worked though), those shocked me when the expectation was \u201cIt just works\u201d.",

          "body": "I definitely think they're trying to make a play at Android's desktop mode to flesh it out. Personally, as a professional Android engineer, I don't like this approach. Not because it's not a good idea, I actually think having one unified OS and potentially even one device that handles all computing needs for the typical user is the mobile future both Google and Apple are moving toward - just have a phone that you plug into a desktop setup, or a laptop, or just use as a phone and it can handle all three use cases (for the average user, not necessarily power users). Android though has too much fragmentation of OS adoption, too many apps running on legacy code, too many companies that only develop for portrait slab phone use cases, too much SoC diversity, etc. If they go this direction, I imagine users will officially be limited to specific apps that meet whatever desktop mode standards they put in place (probably with some way to enable all apps via the dev menu or something else) and will probably only be limited to Pixels, which introduces its own issues since Tensor lags behind Apple's M chips and Qualcomm chips in performance, battery, and heat management. So end of the day, I don't see Android desktop mode being really usable in the short term, maybe even relatively long term, unless you want to hard commit to Google's software ecosystem and a few close partners.\n\nIn the short term, I do think Google needs a full blown desktop OS - ChromeOS is not viable for most professional settings that require more than just email and basic computing and their penchant for making high end devices will always fail because someone who wants to buy a high end laptop likely doesn't want such a stripped back OS. I just think they need to mirror Apple's approach of just running on ARM processors and making Android apps usable on the device (maybe through some kind of sandbox or something) but not actually running Android as the main OS (would likely be best to opt for some kind of heavily customized version of Linux the way Valve has had some success with SteamOS as a faux console experience).",
