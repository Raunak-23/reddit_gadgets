They brought two plants (one of which was itself a human made hybrid) together and they either cross pollinated themselves or humans did it intentionally but that resulting plant gave the world lemons.  They were rightfully rejected at first because sour but some weird people out there likes sours stuff and started using it.  So no, life never gave us lemons.  We\u2019re fucked.",

At best they might load up previous images of a specific target and instruct it to go to that location and find that target in a set radius and return if unsuccessful. Drones don't have the ammo capacity to \"just start killing\", that's just wasting bombs.

The so-called \"Bochum system\" of face detection was sold commercially on the market as ZN-Face to operators of airports and other busy locations. The software was \"robust enough to make identifications from less-than-perfect face views. It can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches, beards, changed hairstyles and glasses\u2014even sunglasses\".",

Hardly surprising that OpenAI cut ties given the point being being made.\n\nAlthough the ML based targeting systems we're seeing used in makeshift drones in Ukraine are probably a better example of how ML is actually being used for this (none of which involves LLMs either given that they're basically completely irrelevant so far as this problem is concerned). Those are mostly using the aforementioned CNNs and, more recently, vision transformers. The latter being especially useful in detecting and targeting other drones.",

This is why it is not enabled when there are friendly forces nearby.",

      "body": "Not sure if this is a hot take but: what he did is both completely impractical and easy to accomplish. It's just a pan-tilt mechanism that uses ChatGPT to translate human-described patterns into machine patterns. Human describes pattern, it gives pattern output in a GCODE-like format.\n\nChatGPT can't see anything. Even if it was getting passed frames from the camera, ChatGPT is not yet able to determine specific coordinates in an image for targeting. Even if we were able to get specific coordinates from the image, latency would be way too high to control the platform directly.\n\nThe reason it's so popular is because a layperson doesn't understand that this provides literally zero utility as a defensive or offensive platform.\n\nAnother way to put it is: if you wanted to make this a practical autonomous gun system, the first step you'd take is to **remove ChatGPT**. The mode where it follows the balloons is already not controlled by ChatGPT; it's a computer vision model running locally.\n\n### Here's how what you see in the video works:\n\n**What ChatGPT sees as instructions:**\n\n```\nYou are ChatGPT. Here are the GCODE-like commands you are allowed to generate and what they do:\nG1 X[value] Y[value]: Move the pan-tilt mechanism to the specified coordinates.\n  X (Pan): Range is -90 to 90 degrees (0 is the midpoint).\n  Y (Tilt): Range is -45 to 45 degrees (0 is the midpoint).\nG4 P[time]: Pause for the specified time in milliseconds.\nM1: Activate the trigger mechanism.\nG0: Return to the home position (X=0, Y=0).\nWhen provided with a human command describing a desired motion or action, generate the appropriate sequence of GCODE commands.\n```\n\n**What the user gives as input:**\n\n```\nCan you move to -25 degrees, then sweep across the field of fire stopping every 5 degrees to fire one round, you should also have some variation in the pitch.\n```\n\n**What ChatGPT gives as output:**\n\n```\nG1 X-25 Y0\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X-20 Y5\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X-15 Y-5\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X-10 Y10\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X-5 Y-10\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X0 Y5\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X5 Y-5\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X10 Y10\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X15 Y-10\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X20 Y5\nG4 P100\nM1\nG1 X25 Y-5\nG4 P100\nM1\n```\n\n### The result:\n\n- The turret starts at `X=-25`, `Y=0` (pan -25\u00b0 with neutral tilt).\n- It sweeps across the field of fire, stopping every 5 degrees in the pan direction.\n- Each stop introduces some variation in pitch (tilt), alternating between values within the defined range (-45 to 45 degrees).\n- At each stop, it pauses briefly (100 ms) and fires one round.\n\n---\n\n- **Transformer models like ChatGPT could potentially be used in target identification**, giving a go/no-go to an actual real-time model that controls the position and firing. That is **not happening here.**\n- Here, the model is being used to directly output the fire solution, which accomplishes none of what the public is concerned about this for: AI-controlled guns.\n- OpenAI took action not because they believe this is a real concern, but because laypeople can't tell the difference, and it reflects poorly on them.",
