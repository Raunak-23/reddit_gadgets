That means without a light source you have to get all your work done between 6 am and 6 pm. So you can't study after you have had dinner, and you have to have dinner done right after you get home from school. \n\nEven simple electrical lanterns (lamp oil is an ongoing expense, and not cheap) can make a massive difference under these circumstances. Plus, the batteries can also charge cell phones, which are becoming the internet for many people in the global South. \n\nWhite LEDs with their high efficiency have become a massive help for these reasons, and I am sure that this is why the guy who developed the blue LED (a 10 cent part) got the Nobel in physics the year after the Large hadron collider (multi billion $ and an army of scientists) got it for the Higgs boson.",
