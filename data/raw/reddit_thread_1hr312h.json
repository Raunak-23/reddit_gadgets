Apple seemed to be positioning it as a next-gen content consumption device, something that might replace the iPad for some folks.",

They wanted this to be different. People have such weird perspectives about this device that it was never intended to be.\n\nI absolutely agree it lacks content or a killer app, because it is a very convincing demo at an Apple Store, but they're building the technology first and hoping they can figure out what more they can do it with it from there.\n\n224,000 estimated Vision Pros sold at $3500 is three-quarters of a billion dollars in revenue.

              "body": "> I remember so many comments from people saying how excited they were to use this for work, as if this was somehow exponentially better than two physical monitors that you didn\u2019t have to strap to your head.\n\nSounds cool at first but having a full VR headset literally strapped to your face all day while working would be terrible, especially in hot weather so your face would get sweaty. They look very dorky to use which alone will put lots off. It also restricts your vision, like you cant see stuff to the side of you. I think it's field of view is around 95 degrees instead of probably 160 degrees+ with your normal vision so thats another reason why it would feel bad to wear long. Would close yourself off from people around you too much and thats even ignoring the fact that they can't see your face, just weird digital eyes. The pass through quality is decent but not close to as good as real life. \n\nOn the other hand AR glasses exist for just $399. Just glasses which are almost the same size as normal glasses but have a screen built into them. You don't need something strapped to your face so they're comfortable to wear for longer and you can look reletively normal using them. They fit in your pocket. Can be taken off and on easy like normal glasses, helpful if you're talking to people. You can see through them like normal glasses so you have your full real world field of view visible. They now also have all the 3dof features built in like other VR headsets so you can place a virtual screen in front of you and it'll stay in place like a normal monitor when you turn your head away(optional of course). The main downside is that the screens have a 50 degrees field of view, but thats not a huge deal since you have your full natural field of view. This years versions are already 60 degrees anyway. The main drawback is that they're 1080p. As soon as they're 1600p then they're perfect.\n\nBut yeah glasses are the future for work. Not even the far future either so it's weird Apple chose to make the vision pro as a work device, normally they're forward thinking. Someone in a cafe wearing a full vision pro for work will look dumb compared to someone next to them using glasses even if the vision pro does more.",

There's nothing yet that seems to just hack into user's brains like a top-end VR set, at least until VR brain implants become a thing. It just seems too powerful and useful and versatile to throw away. And remember when the first iPhone was introduced, it seemed amazingly groundbreaking, and then look at how it advanced in utility in a handful of years, once market acceptance and developer interest snowballed. VR will eventually reach a similar status and market reach, once someone figures out how to make it more easily integrated into daily life and specific work/creative uses. What that evolution will be, I have no idea, but someone will figure it out and create an entirely new market.",

There's alternatives but no 1:1 competing products, but it's also a bit too heavy for 8hrs of work. But ime, even for casual VR uOLED is great and brings out a ton of low-light details that get nuked on LCDs, and it avoids all the OLED smear that full size OLED monitors have.\n\nFor consumers, it and Android XR are the only headsets with Widevine DRM ready to go, so they don't have to beg every streaming service to make an exception to get 1080p and 4K video.

The iPad versions provide a preview of what is possible, but again, not practical for an AR application.\n\nI\u2019m happy go into more detail about what gets me personally excited about something like this in my field, but I also recently visited a museum and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how amazing a robust AR experience would be.",

This version of the Vision Pro may be phased out sooner than expected, but only to make room for whatever they have planned next. I don\u2019t believe Apple would dare enter a product space that they can\u2019t do well in. The high price tag definitely coincides with the R&D and the premium build, but it isn\u2019t sustainable even for Apple\u2019s most loyal consumer base. The fact Vision Pro exists is amazing and should be celebrated while it\u2019s relevant but I think it is only a glimpse at what will be possible. Meta definitely has the right idea with the Orion AR Glasses by offloading the processing power of the headset to an external device and I hope that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re headed.",

The market for visionOS is currently at the start of the adoption curve. AVP is not going anywhere but into further development. \n\nI\u2019ve at least demoed every popular headset design (open/closed, wave guide/displays) and model, and AVP delivers the best user experience (if not your perfect feature set), hands down. Visual and spatial fidelity, UI, input, image and audio quality, platform security, it stands far beyond any similarly priced solution (what are you plugging that affordable Meta headset into?). \n\nApple will spend at least the next 10 years (of continuous visionOS support, production and development) in this pursuit. The devices will get smaller, more minimal, and the OS capabilities will slowly expand. Eventually, a more affordable model will arrive on a more mature platform, where more developers/researchers are engaged. \n\nYou may recall iPhone 1 being lambasted as expensive and pointless, indeed it didn\u2019t have a copy/paste, or App Store, or any other dozen \u201cmissing\u201d features (physical keyboard, for those who really missed the point). Apple added new things to iOS very slowly, and did so with a fundamental obsession over the security, and \u201cwhy\u201d of every single feature/service/program/change. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been around the block of AR/VR/XR, you will recognize the visionOS user experience as the platform/model that will lead all XR product development in the world, just like iPhone did for mobile phones.",

VR is awesome, but unnecessary and the market isn\u2019t looking to replace phones with something more cumbersome, intrusive and that provides little actual utility for the mass market. We\u2019ve had a decade of VR/AR headsets and excited developers looking for the \u201ckiller app\u201d, again in a post-iPhone world. VR can certainly grow hugely as a market but it really isn\u2019t the \u201cnext thing\u201d.\n\nI think Apple actually knows this but feeling the squeeze from the rapidly saturating smartphone market and pushing for a new category I don\u2019t think they were entirely sure needed to exist.",
