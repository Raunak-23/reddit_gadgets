But the biggest issue was that it couldn\u2019t integrate into iOS at the level I really wanted. So the basic functionality it offered didn\u2019t really meet my needs, but it was the best there was at the time.\n\nAnd then Apple came out with the Apple Watch and allowed the deeper integration. Then they added health and fitness tracking. And while I hate the battery life on my Apple Watch, I\u2019m not willing to give up the functionality and go back to something like Pebble.",
