No problems right? Until you look again towards the center, being out of focus again. The near constant refocusing is what causes nausea and headaches in my experience.\n\nTwo things I found to nearly completely eliminate the nausea: \n\n1. Buy an aftermarket head strap because the stock one is trash and cuts off blood flow to the brain (in my experience). This noticeably helps during long play sessions if you're a person who wears the strap really snug. \n2. Train yourself to turn your head with your eyes looking straight ahead or close to it, not looking off to the side, turning your head, then returning your eyes back to the center (your eyes just adjusted focus twice doing this)\n\nMainly after doing #2 I can play more than 15min in VR without nausea or headaches. The longest session I've been in VR is around 3 hours.",

The guy wondering if an apple pro and sending everyone to work from home would help the company is who they were selling to. telling that guy \"hey if you buy this they'll totally be able to play games while at work\", it would immediately be a no.\n\nI do get why they would not allow games, and certainly porn, based on who this was aimed at.\n\nif they sold a apple home version that was $700 and they marketed with no porn and no games, it would be insane.

You'd think an FPS game would be an ideal fit for the format - then you actually play them and it feels horrible and cumbersome to play outside of slow single player titles like Alyx.  Being physically embodied in a virtual character is incredibly limiting, and while it's undoubtedly cool to be *in* the game, the number of genres where this novelty offsets all of the downsides is small.  A mechanic as basic as jumping is difficult to implement.\n\nOne of the best things I played in VR was Vader Immortal, which was less a game than an immersive narrative experience with light gameplay/interactive elements.  Seated experiences with little to no artificial movement also work very well, including cockpit games.  But again, limiting.",

Someone who's just getting into PCVR or even standalone VR are going to go for the cheaper, more accessible options like the Quest 3 or Pico 4 and not the expensive unicorns like Bigscreen Beyond.

Having something in the foreground that doesn't move, something that your mind tells you is moving with you, the player - that can help with the motion sickness. \n\nFor some people, they can actually tolerate it if they also take Dramamine while playing. In my case, I can play VR racing games for literal hours before I start to need to take Dramamine for the motion sickness. \n\nWith a normal 3d VR game, and without dramamine, I get motion sick within 5 minutes.

I responded to someone who said a 55\" screen can be a big screen experience by sitting closer to it. That is a ridiculous statement. So I provided an even more ridiculous example to make my point. Sitting close to a screen so that it takes up more of your field of vision does not actually give you the same experience as your eyes seeing a bigger screen in the distance. That is the illusion VR can give you because your two eyes see two different images that give you a depth of field and hence creates a sense of scale.",

You have obviously not used any of Apple's products that have been released in the past 5 years, because you would otherwise know just how ridiculous this statement is.\n\nMacs are an excellent example of this.

It's like they saw techmo mumbo jumbo AI in movies like Jarvis and they wanted to do that IRL with the mime controls, not really realizing that it only looks cool *because it's a fucking movie*. \n\nThere is a HUGE gap between \"eyes + mime controls\" and \"eye controls\".",

There will be a next get that is cheaper, which will likely sell more.\n\nFWIW, I get a ton of use out of mine and find it to be invaluable. I have an eye condition that makes viewing a laptop or monitor difficult.  The giant virtual monitor I can create in the AVP doesn\u2019t have the same glare effects for me, and allows me to use my computer more effectively. So for me, this headset is an accessibility device. \n\nI know people love shitting on things they don\u2019t like, but of the people I know who have one of these, both in person and online, none have expressed regret. \n\nIt\u2019s a good device. But yes, it\u2019s expensive, so you might not be able to afford it. And yes, it takes some getting used to, but we live in a world where people walk while staring at pocket computers. That was unimaginable 20 years ago.\n\nBut hey\u2026 Click bait has to bait clicks, right?",

The process of grabbing grenades mid-air and chucking them back towards enemies, scrambling for ammo in the middle of a firefight, smacking a headcrab out of the way with a chair as it lunges at you, the embodied gravity gloves mechanics, and the Jeff chapter where you have to be careful handling things so you don't draw his attention.\n\nI personally find the overall experience of Alyx to be the best given Valve's mastery of game design and the story moments and sense of presence, but there are other games that go even further beyond in how much they push VR gameplay forward in ways that can't be replicated outside of VR, such as these:\n\n\nLone Echo / Echo VR utilizes a unique zero gravity movement system to provide entirely new forms of gameplay and a level of 6DoF movement never seen before in gaming.\n\nThe Under Presents is a new game genre spawned from VR, providing a form of virtual immersive theater.\n\nWolves in the Walls is a great short story showcasing interesting NPC interactions that are built upon the inputs of VR.\n\nAstro Bot is a hybrid 1st/3rd person hybrid platformer where you are an entity in the world alongside your platforming mascot, and can influence the world, playing two perspectives at once.\n\nSprint Vector utilizes a unique form of movement to create a parkour-based Mario kart kind of game. \n\nThe Last Clockwinder is a game all about performing recorded actions using your hands to enable an army of clones to work together, but all using VR gestures.\n\nGorilla Tag is a physics-based game of tag with a movement system and playstyle only possible in VR.\n\nNock is a game inspired by Rocket League, but instead of cars, each player has gliding and jumping movement abilities using VR gestures as well as a bow-and-arrow used to shoot the ball into the goal.\n\nMaestro is an interactive experience where you stand in a concert hall and guide an orchestra as its conductor using hand-tracking, pointing and moving your hands to different sections of the orchestra creating gameplay and a feeling/experience only possible with VR.\n\nStride is inspired by Mirror's Edge and shows that traditional parkour systems can work in VR, but because there are no animations and it's all gesture-based, it has a new level of flow and is otherwise not possible to get gameplay systems like this without VR.\n\nBoneworks/Bonelab is a typical FPS except that it uses the strengths of VR's emergent capabilities that arise when you can manipulate physics much more directly. In gaming, the idea of \"If you think you can do it, you probably can\" has only really been achieved in DnD, text-games, or the rare game like Dwarf Fortress and Scribblenauts. Boneworks/Bonelab shows that VR is able to uniquely achieve this in 3D.\n\nBlade and Sorcery is a typical action/fantasy sandbox game with near infinite permutations in how combat works, creating what can only be described as the most open-ended combat system in the history of videogames. There is no set amount of actions or moves, and there are no animations. You can deal intricate moves like pulling an enemy shield away from their body by hooking your axe head onto it or sweep their legs, and it's just all emergent because these aren't scripted actions set by the developers.\n\nI'd also add on every multiplayer title by default, because multiplayer in VR feels fundamentally different when everyone has an avatar driven by their body language. Not only for the social side, but also for team tactics and cooperation.",

The Occulus Rift, the start of modern consumer-grade VR headsets launched in 2012, 13 years ago. 13 years after the first GSM network went live commercially we had phones like the Nokia RAZR. 13 years after the IBM PC first went on sale we were looking at the imminent release of Windows 95. 13 years after Tim Berners Lee invented the concept of the world wide web, we had Facebook and Twitter. It only took 15 years from the first commercially manufactured automobile in the US to the launch of the Model T Ford.\n\nFor a technology that actually makes a difference in the consumer space, that is more than enough time to make it out of the clunky immature hardware and early adopter phase. The fact that VR has not made it past that raises serious questions. If not now, then when?",
