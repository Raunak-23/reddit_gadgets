      "body": "From the article: For over a decade, you couldn\u2019t easily fly a DJI drone over restricted areas in the United States. DJI\u2019s software would automatically stop you from flying over runways, power plants, public emergencies like wildfires, and the White House.\n\nBut confusingly, amidst the greatest US outpouring of drone distrust in years, and an incident of a DJI drone operator hindering LA wildfire fighting efforts, DJI is getting rid of its strong geofence. DJI will no longer enforce \u201cNo-Fly Zones,\u201d instead only offering a dismissible warning \u2014 meaning only common sense, empathy, and the fear of getting caught by authorities will prevent people from flying where they shouldn\u2019t.\n\nIn a blog post, DJI characterizes this as \u201cplacing control back in the hands of the drone operators.\u201d DJI suggests that technologies like Remote ID, which publicly broadcasts the location of a drone and their operator during flight, are \u201cproviding authorities with the tools needed to enforce existing rules,\u201d DJI global policy head Adam Welsh tells The Verge.\n\nBut it turns out the DJI drone that damaged a Super Scooper airplane fighting the Los Angeles wildfires was a sub-250-gram model that may not require Remote ID to operate, and the FBI expects it will have to \u201cwork backwards through investigative means\u201d to figure out who flew it there.\n\n**Edit: Some are skeptical because it's from The Verge.** \n\nDJI's statement if [interested](https://viewpoints.dji.com/blog/geo-system-update).\n\nFor many years, DJI has led the drone industry in safety, making several unprecedented commitments to integrating advanced safety systems into its drones, including:\n\n* First to install altitude limits & GPS-based geofencing to guide drone pilots away from unsafe locations\n* First to deploy autonomous return-to-home technology if drones lose connection to their controllers or have critically low batteries\n* First to integrate sensors for nearby obstacles and approaching aircraft\n* First to operate Remote Identification technology to help authorities identify and monitor airborne drones.\n\nSince then, global regulations and user awareness have evolved significantly, with a greater focus on geo-awareness and Remote ID solutions which makes detection and enforcement much easier. National aviation authorities, including the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) in the EU, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the FAA in the U.S., have established comprehensive geographical zones for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and enforce drone regulations.\n\nThis GEO update has been active in the UK and several EU countries since January 2024, starting with European countries that have implemented geographical maps compliant with existing technical standards, such as Belgium, Germany, and France. In June, it expanded to Estonia, Finland, and Luxembourg. The remaining EU countries under EASA jurisdiction will also receive the update this month.\n\nDJI reminds pilots to always ensure flights are conducted safely and in accordance with all local laws and regulations. For flights conducted in Enhanced Warning Zones, drone operators must obtain airspace authorization directly from the FAA and consult the FAA\u2019s No Drone Zone resource for further information.",

And even further, have a spotter with line of sight because the FPV goggles of the device itself isn\u2019t sufficient. To do that you need closer to a real pilot\u2019s qualifications and flight approval and logging.\n\nI don\u2019t have a good policy solution that doesn\u2019t single out DJI because of its \u201cease of use\u201d that attracts people who can\u2019t be bothered to respect the rules.",

All these zones will be marked as warning zones, telling you that you need a waiver to fly there. This is a good thing because more users will be aware of actual zones and DJI had no business in ensuring someone had a waiver or not.\n\nThis is essentially DJI saying they updated their maps with accurate speed limits but they will not ban you going faster.

One of the problems with broad enforcement via a technical control is that such things tend to behave very poorly in situations they don't anticipate.\n\nEven with a perfect implementation, there are cases where exceeding a limit can be the safest or most sensible option. I know that I've had to do things like rush someone to a hospital from a rural area where no EMS was available in a reasonable time.\n\nBut the implementation is likely to be extremely fraught with problems. My car is set to warn me if I exceed the speed limit by more than 2mph, and that warning is sometimes triggered when I'm on the freeway but the car's GPS thinks I'm on a frontage road.\n\nIf the car actually slowed down in those cases, it would be extremely unsafe and actually below the minimum speed for the highway.",

Unfortunately because of my crapy small city and the laws your not allowed to fly a drone in most of the city because of airport nearby as well as helipads etc. So when looking into drones and seeing DJI had firmware that made it so it wouldn't fly in no fly zones meant I would have to drive out into the country side to fly it. Thus pointless because all I would see is fields as far as the eye can see with some trees, maybe some livestock.\n\nMeanwhile I would see kids flying other drones around in town and nothing happened to them. I wanted to be able to get a birds eye view of my house, as well as for cool shots for making films etc. But DJI was one of the major brands out there and I didn't have the time or patience to build my own and deal with all that. So I basically lost interest in it. \n\nEven now with this change, I have no plans to invest money into a DJI, they could easily reverse this at any time with a firmware update or something and screw people over who can't fly in their own back yard. Before anyone even comments, yes I checked out multiple websites that showed maps where you live and where you can fly drones and where you can't and there was no places around without heading outside of the city.\n\nTo many limitations and to expensive of a hobby to waste on it.",

National aviation authorities, including the European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) in the EU, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the FAA in the U.S., have established comprehensive geographical zones for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and enforce drone regulations.\n\nThis GEO update has been active in the UK and several EU countries since January 2024, starting with European countries that have implemented geographical maps compliant with existing technical standards, such as Belgium, Germany, and France. In June, it expanded to Estonia, Finland, and Luxembourg. The remaining EU countries under EASA jurisdiction will also receive the update this month.\n\nDJI reminds pilots to always ensure flights are conducted safely and in accordance with all local laws and regulations. For flights conducted in Enhanced Warning Zones, drone operators must obtain airspace authorization directly from the FAA and consult the FAA\u2019s No Drone Zone resource for further information.",
