      "body": "I think this thing rubbed people the wrong way initially because workstation class PC's and MAC's before this were all about onboard expansion and ease of part replacement over form factor. That resulted in cavernous cases with tons of internal slots for RAM, PCI-Express cards, and SATA connectors/bays. But things changed between the G5 and this MAC Pro.  Efficiency started to outweigh old school brute force. No more dual CPU's. You no longer needed a spindle drive RAID array, and RAM density improved to a point you didn't require 8 ram slots to hit 16-32gigs. Also port/connector bandwidth had reached a point where workflow bottleneck was hardly an issue for many people (not all, but many). So having the older full size case might not have been as important moving forward. Really depended on the use/industry, but many working professionals were fine with this as-is. \n\nI think it was a mistake for Apple to pull back from dictating hardware relevance here and going back to a conventional PC case (well, as conventional as Apple does one). They have a history of telling consumers the correct path, and are mostly right about it. Ditching floppy discs, Flash, CD/DVD's, as a few examples of when they made the right calls, even if the general public didn't initially like it. Here, they developed an innovative quiet cooling solution with the main downside being lack of internal modularity, but that might not have even mattered to a lot of working professionals as the machine could have been configured quite powerful out of the box. The path ahead might make more sense to just replace the entire PC a few years down the line if it ends up being a company expense anyway, instead of just upgrading things piecemeal.",

              "body": "What I would recommend is get yourself some good quality thermal paste like artic mx6 and replace all the thermal paste on the cpu and the GPUs also take your time. There are loads of videos on YouTube showing how to update the cpu and thermal paste have a watch to see if you feel like you can do it. Also list of tools can be seen on the ifixit website for taking the Mac to bits. It\u2019s a big job and few little connectors etc. the macOS and the device saw the new chip right away as it part of the list of ones it can take. So I upgraded the cpu, cleaned off all the old thermal paste of the GPUs and replaced it with good quality paste. The reason being the old paste would have been on from beginning so things move on and better paste comes out. I also replaced the battery for vram/bios br2032 you can get a cr2032 same size but they don\u2019t last as long as the BR2032 which is in the device. I also gave it a good clean. It\u2019s now running cooler. Things to watch out for are thermal pads coming off or sticking to heatsink you can put them back on not a problem, the bolts that hold the cpu can take the fixing with them not a problem they can go back in see videos on YouTube. As for the ssd I used an original ssd 1tb from an MacBook Pro it\u2019s gives me about 1258.7mbps write and 1376.5mbps read the model: MZ-KPV1T00/0A4, 1TB SSUBX.\nI used an original because some people found you couldn\u2019t use recover disk etc if you used a none apple one, (something like that) plus the machine see it. If you go for a non-apple you need an adapter and maybe a heatsink with the ssd, the apple one comes with heatsink on.  You can up the ram above the apple specs of 64GB to 128GB but that seems to slow the machine ram from 1866 to 1066 some people have notice that difference.\n\nAlso see links below. These should help you.\n\nhttps://blog.greggant.com/posts/2019/05/07/the-definitive-mac-pro-2013-trashcan-guide.html\n\nhttps://youtu.be/M3qeiA0MYl8?si=8pj2FFMXHEpyWkQl\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_XaZ2z7FEfA",
