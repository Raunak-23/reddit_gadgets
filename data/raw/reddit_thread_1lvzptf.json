Samsung generally had the compliment it gave users options and features.\n\nUSB-c headphone jacks are just wear and tear on the port that will cause an expensive repair quicker down the road later.\n\nMy six year old s10e hasn't needed a single repair, and there's never been any storage limit problems, nothin. My s23 I've had under a year now has me carrying around wireless headphones that are annoying, don't pause/start as quickly as wired headphones, need to be charged, and I have to manage my storage about three times as often.\n\nSamsung and phones in general aren't getting better for consumers, they're getting better at copying the subscription style capitalism payment trap and trying to lock people into \"ecosystems\" which, sucks.",

But again Samsung is just one brand making foldables and if you dont like their approach, you have options for at least 7 other phones which may or may not have the features you desire. The oppo foldable has a pen support, for example. Nobody said that if you want a foldable then it should only be Samsung.\n\nI also don\u2019t get your point about headphones where if you\u2019re carrying wired then wireless only occupies a little bit more space than them? Like you have to carry both anyways lol. Also charging port has almost never failed me on any phone ever. Maybe it\u2019s just anecdotal but I have a iPhone 4, 7, XR and oneplus nord, fold 2 and others and there are bunch of problems with different parts but almost never the charging port lol\n\nStorage I kinda agree with but don\u2019t really get bc in last 3 years, I haven\u2019t even come close to filling my 512 gb of storage",
