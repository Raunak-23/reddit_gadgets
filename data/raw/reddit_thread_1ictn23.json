It's amazing it still works well, XP used 250MB out of 756MB installed, but had trouble with expired root certificates, had to install a different browser to use the internet.\n\nMeanwhile, WD 1TB Blue hdd from 2018 had 6 weak sectors recently, after just one year since a similar problem that forced me to backup all data, format it and copy back.\nAfter format the weak sectors get considered good so no bad sectors increase. But I don't trust it. What happens is signal degrades after one or two years and it can't read properly the data in some sectors. So I made a partition in that area and labeled it WEAK to avoid placing important data there.\n\nAnother funny story - Seagate Barracuda 320GB from 2007 had some strange chirping sounds from time to time. After I bought it, I went back to store and tell the seller it makes strange noises. He said, if you have any trouble with the data, just bring it back and we exchange it on warranty.\nAfter 17 years, the hdd still works and chirps from time to time, the shop I bought it from is no more...",

Wholesalers and importers are often involved. A german one could have been compromised.\n\nI would honestly be very surprised if Seagate itself was involved in that. I don't see them buying back old drives to sell them back as new. Hard disk manufacturers already have a legit refurbished disks sale channel. Lots of good deals to be made there actually. \n\nSketchy chinese wholesalers though ? That's very much their alley. There is a whole industry of counterfeit components out there.",

The only problem is that those TVs were intended for another market and had different software versions. With a bunch of customers then coming pissed to complain to the manufacturer. Using the grey market is a good way to get scammed tbh.",

Not how any of this works. \nA brand doesn't have control over what a resseller do. \nI mean they can punish them after the fact and depending on the contract maybe sue them but you vastly overestimate how much a manufacturer has control over what sellers do. \n\nHell the vast majority of ressellers never even interact with the manufacturer in the first place. They get their products through distributors or wholesalers.\n\nEdit : just digged into it because I was curious. Authorised ressellers in the program don't buy directly with Seagate but are supposed to go through autorised distributors. So it would point to a tainted distributor since so many shops are affected. \nIt's in the realm of possibility that Seagate themselves sold some old drives as new but the odds are low tbh, this would be a suicidal move on so many levels ...",

They were sold to a chinese company and apparently they resold them to other sellers, even official partners from Seagate.

Some of the listed shops are known for refurbished drives, e.g. JB which hints at an issue with their listing where they either purposefully or accidentally forgot to add that they sell refurbished drives but these drives had the correct label on them. Other shops like Boettcher add to their listing that they sell OEM drives, Mindfactory is no official partner, so it's expected that they get their drives from non official sources. However official partners like Reichelt, Alternate, etc... are apparently selling drives from non Seagate sources which is a huge no go, especially as non of them list these drives as OEM drives which lets you expect to receive retail (bulk for Exos but with 5 years of warranty) drives",

So generally you buy 20 drives at a time, and one by one, each of them fails. But you replace them with drives out of different batches and they last years. This is a pretty common occurrence in the data center world.\n\nRefurb drives are 1) all from different batches, and 2) have been refurbed after whatever manufacturing error they might have had has been discovered and corrected. Officially refurbed drives are very reliable. You wouldn't buy them for a Data Center, but they are an excellent avenue for a home user with their own mass storage system (IMO the only reason to buy HDDs these days, SSDs are so cheap now there is no reason your primary and secondary storage devices in your computers and external storage devices should be an HDD).",

No amount of \"Curse you Brand A who was highly rated when I bought this drive that just died, in hindsight I should have bought Brand B!\" can bring back data - backups can.",
