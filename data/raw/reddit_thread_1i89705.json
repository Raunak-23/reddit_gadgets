However, in order to allow the GPU to get as many frames as it can, the CPU has to process its work fast enough to keep up. It isn't always the case that the fastest gaming CPU can keep up with the fastest gaming GPU at low resolution and usually it ends up being the CPU that slows things down. But apparently not with this generation.",
