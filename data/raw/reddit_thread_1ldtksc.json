A long time ago when I was dirt poor a friend of mine sold me his previous rig for $50 so that I could keep playing WoW with him, I've been sorta paying that forward every time I get an upgrade since.\n\nI had a b350 AM4 proxmox node cobbled together from eBay parts that was ready to decommission from my homelab rack. I updated the bios and gave it to him with a temporary R7 2700 and I told him that if he got a cheap 5700x3d it would last him for years to come. He was able to get it out of his next paycheck and it was basically like it's a brand new platform, especially when he was eventually able to get a new GPU to balance it out. \n\nBeing a tech packrat is really satisfying when companies make a long lived platform like AM4. Of course you can't trust them to do that every time, they only made it to 2 years with the TR4 socket for the first threadripper.\n\nLong live AM4.",
