      "body": "From the article: How do you fit 32 terabytes of storage into a hard drive? With a HAMR.\n\nSeagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, since at least 2002. The firm has occasionally popped up to offer a demonstration or make yet another \"around the corner\" pronouncement. The press has enjoyed myriad chances to celebrate the wordplay of Stanley Kirk Burrell, but new qualification from large-scale customers might mean HAMR drives will be actually available, to buy, as physical objects, for anyone who can afford the most magnetic space possible. Third decade's the charm, perhaps.\n\nHAMR works on the principle that, when heated, a disk's magnetic materials can hold more data in smaller spaces, such that you can fit more overall data on the drive. It's not just putting a tiny hot plate inside an HDD chassis; as Seagate explains in its technical paper, \"the entire process\u2014heating, writing, and cooling\u2014takes less than 1 nanosecond.\" Getting from a physics concept to an actual drive involved adding a laser diode to the drive head, optical steering, firmware alterations, and \"a million other little things that engineers spent countless hours developing.\" Seagate has a lot more about Mozaic 3+ on its site.\n\nDrives based on Seagate's Mozaic 3+ platform, in standard drive sizes, will soon arrive with wider availability than its initial test batches. The driver maker put in a financial filing earlier this month (PDF) that it had completed qualification testing with several large-volume customers, including \"a leading cloud service provider,\" akin to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or the like. Volume shipments are likely soon to follow.",

Because they are known for large storage arrays that are built in climate controlled data centers, massive airflow, regulated power, with a distributed file system that spans multiple drives and arrays for redundancy.  If a drive inevitably fails, they replace it and nothing is lost.  No catastrophe, no crying you lost the only digital copies of personal documents and pictures you scanned before you lost them in a fire\u2026 none of that.  \n\nSo I ask again. Does the backing of a major cloud provider, who already buys their hardware on the cheap from what others don\u2019t want - to put into their cloud matter to me if they\u2019ve tested or certified it?  Not even in the slightest.  The reason is their use case and serviceability is VERY different than me as a consumer who relies on things to be VERY reliable and trustworthy as I\u2019m not charging someone else thru the teeth for hosting their data.",

The trade offs just made the juice not worth the squeeze.\nOf course I wouldn't go putting these in your desktop just yet (even if for no reason other than Seagate holding up the rear on most all Backblaze reliability reports as a brand). \n\nI'd say this is a start in the right direction though.",

SSDs (not NVMe - that's different) are a GREAT example of this... the first ones of these were seen in laptops and desktops because they were a solid state technology with non-moving parts.   That meant no moving parts, a more \"drop proof\" device that wouldn't crash due to moving a laptop around, and was FAR faster than even 7200 RPM drives back in the early 2010's.  I know as I had a 2012 MPB that went from slug to lightning speed simply by increasing the IO from a HDD to a SSD (thank you OWC!)\n\nIt took a few more years until closer to the mid-2010's for enterprises to FINALLY start trusting them, but even then, if those systems weren't redundant file systems behind them (even RAID 1 - mirroring) - no one trusted them by themselves.  Most were used initially as boot drives with a SLOW adoption rate for a few reasons.  They were expensive for larger drives (beyond what consumers used), had a lifespan of only a few years depending on the application, and raised concerns that the tech was still not fully ready.  \n\nThis could be seen in a number of manufacturers that even up until 2021/2022 - would look at the life of SSDs and decided if they failed whether or not to RMA/warranty it or claim its \"end of life\" because its seen too much IO on it.  True statement - Dell and HP were NOTORIOUS for doing this with enterprises even with drives only 2-3 years old back then.\n\nSo net net - you have no idea what you are talking about - because \"most\" stuff doesn't start in the enterprises... its probably a good mix of both where things start and evolve to.",

Manufacturers routinely dump drives that fail qualification with big customers on consumers because they know consumers won't notice.\n\nConsumers barely use their gear in comparison to a data center. If the drive slows down after 1000 hours of constant IO, you'll never notice but a data center will. If you have to turn your computer off and on again every once in a while it's not annoying enough to even bother figuring out the problem is the drive. The rate of uncorrectable read errors might doom the data center's efficiency with constant rebuilds but doesn't affect you because you don't write enough data to hit it. And if the drive failure rate jumps to 50% after 5 years of power on time, it doesn't matter because consumers don't leave their drives on constantly and it's long after the warranty has expired anyway.\n\nThat said, I wouldn't be surprised if this never makes it to consumers. Consumers barely buy hard disks anymore. Flash is better overall, cheap enough already, and will only get cheaper. HDDs are becoming a niche product with declining sales which will drive a feedback loop of increasing prices.",
