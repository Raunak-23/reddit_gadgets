Users will be too busy playing the game and basking in the framerate ticker to notice any potential visual discrepancies when they\u2014inevitably\u2014appear. This takes time to parse out, something that can\u2019t be done even with a few hours of demos. We\u2019ll need to get our hands on these new cards to discover how this impacts our gaming experience.\n\nSo what's the point of the article then? Even the author says wait for benchmarks.",

Unless you think the soap opera effect involves artifacting and blurring which DOES exist with frame gen for games but is not what the soap opera effect is.\n\nThe reason it's called the soap opera effect is because the frame interpolation on tvs makes the source material look \"live on set like\" instead of movie film like since soap operas are shot that way. \n\nThere is no such thing as video game soap opera effect because games are commonly hyper smooth due to naturally running at frames above 60 on principle. Again artifacting and latency have nothing to do with the soap opera effect but also are effects of frame interpolation.",

Let's say you bought a 360hz monitor because you like playing competitive games and want the extra smoothness and faster response time. \n\nWell, what if you also like to play single player games too. You already have a high refresh rate display and you've gotten used to the smoothness, but with these types of games you can't reach those fps numbers when you turn on all the bells and whistles. Well, using MFG you can now take that game that runs at 90fps without it and boom, you have 360fps now. Since it's not a competitive title, the response time isn't as important, especially if you play it on a controller. And with a baseline 90fps, you already have a decent starting point. \n\nSo for most people, MFG will be niche and irrelevant, but as more people buy higher refresh rate displays it'll start to become more useful. The thing about frame gen is that it works better when you already have a high enough starting fps. It shouldn't be seen as a tool to bump a 30fps game to 60fps because that will look and feel like crap.",

If the latency is \"low enough\" and more consistent, it could be an overall win to perception. \"Low enough\" can vary a lot. Generally below 100ms is considered instant, but highly trained people or just naturally skilled can notice all the way to around 40ms. If I remember correctly.",

As previous DLSS, this one also comes with huge caveats, and the more aggresive setting you use the worse it will look, but that isn't the main problem and why you should care. \n\nnVidia wants those DLSS fake frames to be seen as equal to raw power frames, and advertises them as such, and in the end wants this to be the new normal when it comes to how we see generational jumps between GPU, where in reality like I said it isn't as good as raw power (even previous DLSS isn't and it was faking much less frames than this new gen) and what is more important - it is title based. So no dev DLSS implementation - no fake frame gains. \n\nAnd guess what, most of the world doesn't have 5000 series, so there isn't that much incentive for devs to spend money on this particular implementation where they could let's say make a paid DLC instead in that same time and potentially make money from every player that bought their game.

Render at 1080p -> upscale to 4k. The only thing involved is adding pixels to an image that already exists \n\nFrame gen in regards to the 50 series is literally generating pixels using a previous actually rendered frame as a map to where they most likely will be in the next frame. In the 50s case they are stating that it does 1:3(if I\u2019m remembering correctly) so for every rendered frame, it\u2019s guessing what the next 3 are. \n\nYou could kind of equate it to an artist looking at a movie frame and trying to draw the next 3 most likely frames of the movie, vs the upscaling being an artist looking at a lower quality version of a frame and trying to draw it bigger with more clarity and detail.",

FSR has come a very long way since version 1 and XESS is no slouch either from what I've seen. But they're both more prone to ghosting and blurring compared to DLSS. \n\nI've never messed around with Nvidia's frame gen, but AMD's is okay. I used it to smooth out the framerate when I played The Last of Us and it did a good job there. Wouldn't dare use it in something that requires more twitch input however. It worked well in a slower paced game and that's probably where it's best.",

DLSS samples multiple lower-resolution images and uses motion data and feedback from prior frames to construct high-quality images.\n\n> DLSS 3 uses its Super Resolution AI to recreate three-quarters of an initial frame, roping in Frame Generation to complete the second frame.\n\nAnd I have done research and I've written my own AI, used both generative and non-generative AI, worked with both kinds of upscalers, written my own games, etc.\n\nWhat's your experience? Where are your sources?",

Or that - in spite of their graphics cards having been at many points the best product - the main pitch never has been geared towards realtime contexts. \n\nWhich is curious when that's really what games are all about.

Developing better algorithms instead of brute force pathtracing is the only way to get pathtraced images at 200fps in 4k. \n\nComplaining about \"fake frames\" makes about as much sense as complaining about \"fake lighting\" or \"fake physics\". If you want realtime pathtraced fully interactive worlds you need to figure out a whole new way of doing things. I've worked as a 3D artist since 2004 and i've seen what it takes to get \"real\" frames. \n\nIt wasn't until 2006 that Pixar used widely used ray tracing in a movie (Cars) and it took 10 years later for them to use pathtracing (Finding Dory in 2016).  \n\nCars was rendered on a renderfarm with about 10\u201320 TFLOPs of compute. \n\nFinding Dory was rendered with about 1 PFLOP of compute. \n\nA direct CPU/GPU comparison isn't 1:1 comparable but just for reference:\n\nA single RTX 4090 can do \\~80+ TFLOPs in FP32. That's more compute than the entire Cars renderfarm. Ok, amazing. \n\nYou\u2019d need on the order of **12\u201315** RTX 4090 GPUs to match the *peak FLOP count* of that entire CPU farm for Finding Dory in 2016. Also amazing - millions of dollars worth of supercomputer renderfarm compute now achievable with $25k. \n\nThis is ignoring that path-tracing code would have to be re-optimized for GPUs, ignoring CPU vs. GPU memory architectures, network overhead, etc. It\u2019s just a rough FLOP-based ratio.\n\nThe compute power of top GPUs are INSANE, but they are still no where close to what is needed to render a full quality fully pathtraced scene in realtime, much less 200fps. Pixar's renders would take **10\u201317 hours** per frame on average for Cars and **30\u201350 hours** per frame for Finding Dory. \n\nWe're now asking for that level of quality in 200fps in 4k and complaining about the advanced AI algorithms that make it achievable. This is insanity.",

                                  "body": "At a really basic level, the difference is that simple code does exactly what it's supposed to, every time. It has an entirely predictable output that has been decided by a human and will do it every time, given the same inputs. \n\nAI is a nebulous term, but the key difference is that the computer is \"taught\" with examples, and \"trained\" by giving feedback on how close it got to the desired output, but the intermediate steps from input to output are a mystery that has been entirely designed by the computer - no one has intentionally created or coded for them. \n\nTo use an analogy, Imagine me giving you incredibly detailed instructions on how to cook a pavlova. Right down to how many strawberries you should place on top. This would be normal computer code, like vsync. It doesn't matter if the pavlova is super super fancy and complicated. It also doesn't matter if there's some \"unpredictability\" in there, like telling you to \"use between 10 and 14 strawberries\". The key is that every stage of the instructions was intentionally written by a human. \n\n\"AI\" is like me telling you to \"make a pavlova\" with no additional context. *Maybe* I give you some photos of a finished pavlova, or even let you taste some, but that's it. The only feedback you get is by attempting to make one and me saying \"better\" or \"worse\". \n\nEventually, given enough tries, you might reach a point where you can make a tasty pavlova 9 times out of 10. Great! Mission accomplished!\n\nBut the difference is that I have no idea *how* you made the pavlova, or what steps you took to get there. I'll also never entirely know whether it's gonna come with kiwis or strawberries. Occasionally you might deliver it with tomatoes, or even with no fruit at all. Or on a dustbin lid. No one said you couldn't!\n\nMaybe you experimented with using a vat of liquid nitrogen to keep it cool, rather than a fridge, and it seemed to work. Maybe you use a barbecue to toast the merangue. Maybe all your fruit is sourced from the leftovers of the fancy restaurant next door. I'll never know! As long as it tastes like a pavlova when it gets to me, I don't care. Whatever works I guess.\n\nAnd when I think about it, I also actually have no idea even what you think \"a pavlova\" is. Do you think it's a generic name for any dessert including meringue and fruit? Your Pavlovas are super tasty, but they're also always square. Is that just because you find them easier, or because somewhere along the road I gave great feedback to an attempt that just happened to be square, and you got in your head that square was a requirement? Do you think they *have* to be served on a plate? Or that they have to be whole? If I showed you a photo of a pavlova after it had been dropped on the floor and smashed up, would you still know it was a pavlova?\n\nDoes that help at all?\n\nEdit:\n\n(A, perhaps apocryphal, example of never knowing *how* an AI reaches a conclusion is the story of NATO teaching an AI to differentiate between Russian and NATO artillery. The expected outcome was that the AI learn would recognise the difference in shapes from the air, and very quickly tag satellite photos with any examples of probable Russian artillery movements. The AI reached near-perfect identification accuracy in tests, but failed miserably when deployed on the battlefield. No one could work out why identification was failing so often, when seemingly nothing had changed with the quality of input photographs.\n\nEventually, someone realised that the difference was that the AI's training data was almost exclusively on photos of artillery in fixed, defensive, positions, whereas its real data often included equipment on the move. The AI had sifted through all the training data and skipped the part where it learned the different shapes, and found a foolproof shortcut instead: \"Russian artillery has its guns pointed west\".)",

Frame gen IS different from traditional rendering because it is, in effect, a visual smoothing effect that isn't a 1 to 1 match to the underlying simulation. This can become a problem when the underlying latency is noticeably different from the visuals generated. Also graphical fidelity is affected in certain situations. If you don't care about these things thats fine, frame gen still has drawbacks and can be considered differently than traditional rendering.\n\nUpscaling too, can cause visual artifacts, and when used in marketing and benchmark shenanigans obfuscates relative performance of products.\n\nOf course this isn't black and white. Your example of AA is indeed a sort of post-processing that is applied to some reference image, if you will... but as a feature it is much more transparent. AA isn't used to imply that you can run a game at X fps while in fact parts of the game run much slower. It has a direct performance cost and a visual effect, so you more or less know what youre getting.\n\nVsync absolutely has problems and many avoid using it. In certain scenarios (like in situations where the hardware is generating frames just under the vsync rate) it introduces stuttering.\n\nMaybe the hyperbolic language (\"fake\") is a bit much, but it points to a real phenomenon. Not sure who the dumb one is for not being sensitive to this.",

Most games already use a system called triple buffered rendering, wherein they essentially store the last 3 frames rendered and show the oldest of those frames. This is done to avoid the major screen tearing that can come without at least double buffering. What this means for frame generation is that you already have multiple frames stored up before they're being rendered that you can use for interpolation.\n\nWith all that being said, frame generation _is_ still going to increase the input latency, but not for that reason. The real reason is far more simple (and usually less significant) - it's just more work for your GPU to do, so your un-boosted framerate will drop, and your latency will rise with that.\n\nFrom my own experience using frame generation, I feel like it really is nice at making things look super smooth when you have a higher refresh-rate monitor _and_ already have a decent base framerate of 60ish fps. If it's just boosting an already low framerate, you still really do feel that input latency, even if movement all looks fairly smooth.",

That's about the resolution of a VHS tape.\n\nThis is really bad for motion resolution and smooth scrolling images unless you have a very high brute force frame rate.\n\nThink of motion blur like the shutter on a camera.\n\nA frame rate of 240 Hz means that a single frame is visible to your eye for 4.16 ms. That translates to 4.16 pixels of motion blur per 1000 pixels per second of motion.\n\nI have a 1080P monitor that I have over clocked to 180 frames per second. \n\n180 frames per second is 5.5 ms of frame visibility time. This means that in a fast moving image my 1080P panel is actually only resolving 1200 pixels per second in fast motion if and only if I can maintain a refresh rate of 180 frames per second.\n\nIn Laymans terms that means my 1080 P display is only showing me 720 P resolution in fast motion. And that's only true if the frame rate stays locked at 180 frames per second and never drops even one frame.\n\nThese fake frames from Nvidia mean your display is actually going to get closer to actually being able to show you a high definition image when the picture is moving, which if you ask me the monitor should be able to do on its own.\n\nMonitors have not been able to show us high resolution images in motion since the days of analog tube displays.\n\nDon't think of this as fake frames think of it as a way to actually make your monitor show you the resolution that it is claiming it is capable of.",

But in reality, the features don\u2019t really do anything for picture quality unless you examine it with a microscope, all they do is tank the frame rate with questionable benefit.\n\nThen along comes the new cards with frame generation able to run these semi useless features at a higher frame rate while some people eat up the numbers like it\u2019s the most amazing thing. It\u2019s a pity there isn\u2019t really an accepted standard for picture quality settings so we could have a proper comparison with an apples to apples comparison, then compare with the old gen up scaling on both cards, then show how much benefit the new features give with realistic settings, not just throwing broken stuff at the card and letting the frame generation make the numbers bigger.",
