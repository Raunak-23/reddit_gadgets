It is effectively a giant excel, but managed by a third party (online its usually either a third party you integrate or managed by the store software like Shopify). So you can know it, but not until the last step of checkout process, so all prices are quoted before tax and most people have a general idea of their local tax rate (typically 8-10%).\n\nThere are unique situations where some states do not have any sales tax and people will use that to get cheaper prices by going to those states to shop, but technically all other states have \"use\" taxes that force people to pay the tax for all items they come back to the state with, so its not really a loophole.",

Without s pen and UDC its basically just an inferior Vivo X fold with a larger price tag. Only a fool would believe this is the best route for Samsung to go. At this point, Sammy has likely lost me as a customer because I would be stupid to choose the fold 7 over the pixel 10 pro fold's IP68. The only real trade off is the chip and camera but at the end of the day it still will have a great chip and camera with superior durability. \n\nMy guess is sammy is hoping casual users will become the core base for their foldable, but that isn't realistic with their pricing. If I want a thinner fold, I can get the Vivo X Fold that has a better camera, faster charging, bigger battery, and is thin with zero pen support and no UDC. Its basically a better version of fold 7, and the 1TB version is only $1599 compared to the 2k sammy wants. Sammy has lost the plot.",

      "body": "From the article: At 8.9mm thick when folded, it\u2019s up there with the likes of the Oppo Find N5 as far as thinness goes. Oppo\u2019s device is so slim that my colleague Dominic Preston dubbed it the \u201cfinal evolution of foldables.\u201d Open, the Z Fold 7 is just a hair thicker than the USB-C port on the bottom of the device. But there was one notable casualty in the quest to make it thinner: S Pen support. Samsung claims that omitting the screen layer that makes stylus support possible helped slim the phone down to its current proportions. I\u2019ll take a slimmer foldable over a stylus-compatible foldable, but let\u2019s observe a moment of silence for the S Pen Fold Edition.\n\nThe Fold\u2019s new, wider format is a welcome change. The cover panel now measures 6.5 inches with a 2520 x 1080p resolution compared to the Fold 6\u2019s 6.3-inch, 968 x 2376p screen. It finally feels like a normal phone when it\u2019s closed. The inner screen is now 8 inches, and Samsung finally gave up trying to hide the inner selfie camera under the display and just put a 10-megapixel sensor behind a little hole-punch cutout. Good riddance. The water and dust resistance remains the same, with an IP48 rating like the last two models.\n\nNow, the bad news: **two thousand US dollars. Or $1,999**, to be precise \u2014 that\u2019s what the Z Fold 7 costs. With the price of everything going up, the tariffs situation, and the R&D costs that went into this newer, thinner Fold, I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. At $1,899, the Fold 6 wasn\u2019t exactly cheap. But something about the words two thousand dollar smartphone just feels wrong, you know?\n\nBut back to the good news: the Flip is getting a proper edge-to-edge cover screen for the first time. It\u2019s the direction Motorola went when it relaunched the Razr a few years ago, and I think it\u2019s the right one. Samsung uses the extra screen real estate next to the camera cutouts for the time and date as you swipe through widget panels, or for navigation buttons in apps, which is cute. Sure, it\u2019s a little awkward working around them, but I\u2019d rather deal with this and reap the benefits of a bigger screen than be hemmed in by the file folder shape.",

The only advantage Samsung has, is a near universal monopoly in the US market. Oppo, isn't sold here, Honor, isn't sold here. OnePlus is and already there's rumors to axe even them from being sold here.\n\nIt's BS, and this is coming from a near quarter century Samsung user and owner of multiple fold phones including the fold 6 I'm typing from. The form factor they just announced should have been the standard two generations ago. What the 7 should have introduced was a camera array that isnt a massive tumor on the back it makes it impossible to lay it flat.\n\nAdd in the same li-ion battery in a sector moving towards Carbon-Silicon and no spen support AND $100 more, look, you only do this when you know you have no real competition anymore.\n\nIf OnePlus puts put their next foldable out next year as they said; I'll be moving to that. I'm consistently impressed with their devices and now's the time to make the switch. Samsung is now in their lazy couple of years of pointless features.",

There are some great grabs in the $600 price range from TCL or Hisense (I would not go major brands in that range, they often charge a premium for the same specs) if you are looking at a 55 inch, but you need to be okay with a backlit tv.\n\nBut once you get up to the LG B series OLEDs, it's very much diminishing returns when it comes to TVs. Heck if Sansui OLEDs keep showing up in the $700 price range, and if they upgrade their HDMI board to even the boards Hisense and TCL use on the LED TVs, then it will be a monster at that price range. Their picture quality was already great, but you were stuck with HDMI 2.0, so gaming wasn't great on them, and they only had ARC, not eARC, so 5.1 audio is compressed.",

What are you guys DOING on your phones that requires that much screen space and you don't get by turning a regular phone landscape? I just don't understand, and I'm certainly not paying two thousand dollars for the feature. The Z Flip 7 is only moderately better, and I've never held one of these but they just don't seem convenient to flip open and the phone itself isn't cool enough to justify the fold line IMO. I do like the idea of a smaller device that fits better in my pocket and lets me do quick actions without having to unfold the whole thing, but....eh. Modern day flip phones just make me miss actual oldschool flips.",
