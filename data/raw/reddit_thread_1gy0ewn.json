I'm generally consistent about it, but the problem is my style of hobby progression. \n\nI'll hyperfixate on researching, cobbling together recipes, and optimizing a single dish, and then randomly, without even realizing it, get bored and move on. And I never remember to write anything down (my auto response is I'll do it later ofc), so months later I'll be like oh fuck what were the exact steps to the sous vide duck thighs? And I'll piece it together but usually feel I've forgotten a proportion, step, or ingredient. \n\nSo essentially I master a recipe only to forget it ever happened.",

It actually has the same speaker as the Nest Mini, so that makes a lot of sense. Not even close to my other Google Home speakers. For \u00a3130 I was expecting it to sound like a Nest Hub at least. My other tablet's speakers sounds better than the Pixel Tablet's dock.\n\n3.

It would be one thing if they offered a compelling value but the entry-level iPad is pretty fantastic at the ~$300 price point ($250 on sale every holiday and various other times). \n\nIf you spend $300 or less on an Android tablet, you're getting a barely-usable piece of shit. Samsung makes the absolute best Android tablets and I've had (and enjoyed) several over the years but the cheap ones aren't good and the good ones aren't cheap. But even when the hardware and 1st-party software are good, Android doesn't scale up well and app developers don't give half a shit about Android tablets.",

That signaled to developers to stop supporting a tablet UI so they did. Then about a decade later Google tried to bring back a tablet UI.",

It's the software that matters in a tablet.  Android clearly isn't going anywhere, and your shit is tied to a Google account and not a physical device.  If what they've already built and released is going to get regular OS and security updates, then Google not making any more tablets is frankly meaningless.  If they're dropping OS/security update support early because they've dropped physical hardware support, then that's where this would be a bigger deal.\n\nI have an Android tablet and... I can't say it's completely useless, but it's little more than an alarm clock, a web browser, and a Discord screen for me.  A simple jailbroken/rooted Amazon Fire tablet can do that for me.  Pixel Tablet at regular price is $700 CDN for 128GB  of storage.  Are you **insane**?  But then again, I'm only looking at it for what I would use a tablet for.  It's on a Black Friday sale on Amazon for $500 CDN currently.  I can get an Amazon Fire HD 8 for $65 CDN for 32GB of storage on a Black Friday sale.  Fire HD 10 with 64GB is going for $170 CDN on sale.  You can get Samsung Android tablets for cheaper too.  Google has no chance trying to charge people that much money for a tablet.",

If you\u2019re buying it to be a home hub with the dock it\u2019s $500, which is kinda wild to me. I could buy several different combinations of the nest hub/nest hub max and have home control and media streaming for that much money. If I got all nest hubs (the smaller one) I could have one in almost every room in my house lol. On the tablet side, even $400 is a lot for a (based on audience probably a casually/seldom used) android tablet. iPad has just dominated that space for so long and you can get one for less than that now that does everything the average user would want and it\u2019s not a first gen product so there\u2019s more consumer confidence for an iPad over this I would think? Neat idea, but it doesn\u2019t seem to perform any better than the nest hub as a home control/hub device and based on market share, not many people seem to buy android tablets in general unless it\u2019s a cheap one for their kids because who cares if your 5 yr old drops the $60 Walmart special tablet versus a larger $400 tablet \ud83d\ude02\n\nOk rant over, fun idea, but meh, doesn\u2019t surprise me they may cancel it. And at least make the $129 speaker sound better than a nest mini \ud83d\ude44 rather buy two of those and set them up as a group/pair for less than the dock if music and sound quality was my main use case.",

The multimedia layers are lightyears ahead of android. I feel Android also has too many \"layers\" at work to be responsive enough for many applications. \n\n2: The locked down app installs suck. iOS is too locked down and money-grubbing overall. I am not crazy about the gestures. Android wins here. It is easier to use Android like a \"normal computer\" or a \"hacker's computer\" IMO.  The fact that you can make and sell products running Android is a *huge* advantage. Expect to have a rough time if you want to use it as a musical instrument, or media production tool, though.",
