And the few top tier third party apps they did have were seemingly several revisions behind Apple and Android or just glorified browser skins when they first launched Windows Phone. That lack of app support would end up being the OS killer. Killed Windows Phone. Also killed WebOS, which was another promising OS (although, still alive on some TV's).",

Consumers clearly didn't think the Zune did enough to make it worth getting instead of the ipod. Maybe if they had released it closer to the original ipod it might have been a competitor, but they were too little too late.\n\nBeyond that, Windows Phone had a huge market share in India, and relevant market share in other regions. They didn't make the choice to restrict it to the US markets until the  950 series with windows 10 mobile.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Zune wasn't a good device, or that windows phone wasn't. I was a diehard windows phone user until it was sunset, and I would absolutely use it again if it came back, but you can't just hand wave away the issues, blaming it on MS's marketing. Consumers didn't like the products, and MS wasn't ever able to shake it up enough to change that",
