I wouldn't mind that system here if I got the same benefits you did.\n\nNow America will have a 145% tax on imports, AND we don't have social services. The best of both worlds! 8)",

Even within a country that has zero in and out trade with minimum wage rules, individual areas will trade for what they need with others and some areas can have higher wages than others due to those areas producing goods or services that have increased training costs or just being of higher value to the market currently. \n\nThe US was on the cutting edge of technological progress, trusted with military production and distribution, had the whole world hedging their bets in favour of it by LITERALLY banking on the US dollar and hitching their economy to the wellbeing of yours, all the way from the richest economies, to the poorest, either via trade and the owning of debt or by the need of humanitarian aid. \n\nThe US could call itself the centre of the world, because it was, we relied on the US for sure, but that also meant we were willing to do just about anything to keep you guys going, it's why the US has been such a rich country this whole time with the most millionaires and billionaires worldwide. \n\nAll Trump's doing is ending that. You won't have the freedom to raise wages because you won't have the wealth. \n\nThe reason wages weren't being raised before was due to political decisions being made internally by your country to avoid taxing their wealth base in order to fund your country's own costs. Your country was still the richest in the world. You just distributed it unevenly. \n\nWhat Trump is doing is mixing up internal and external politics and acting like the rest of the world is to blame for your misfortune and you MAGA lot are all eating it up and all it's gonna do, is devalue your currency, lower your global purchasing power and your value to the global economy, it'll raise inflation and cause runaway debt costs and make everyone else try to hedge their bets elsewhere, taking away the support the US economy was built on. \n\nPeople are scrambling to try and re-establish the old ways right now, they will keep trying whilst they find other ways because they hope when Trump leaves sanity can be restored, but the longer this goes on, the worse it's gonna get for the US. It'll suck for everyone else sure, but we can always establish a new order around someone else and the US will have to either bend themselves around that new order or go down swinging out at everyone. I guess it'll be the latter, but that'll either end badly for the US or just for everyone in general. \n\nStill isn't gonna be good for the US in any scenario.",

      "body": "From the article: As I reported just last week, cheap-yet-awesome retro handhelds are being marched to the guillotine in the name of Trump tariffs. One of the first companies to have its head on the block is also one of the most prolific. Handheld maker Anbernic told customers Sunday that it would stop all direct shipments to U.S. customers, at least until President Donny finally offers any clarity on how much people will pay in import duties for products from China.\n\nAnbernic is known for its enormous library of handheld video game emulation hardware. These handhelds are able to use console emulators\u2014essentially full video game consoles translated into software\u2014to play new homebrew titles as well as digital copies of older games, known as ROMS. In a page describing the new shipping policy, Anbernic said \u201cdue to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse.\u201d\n\nUntil today Anbernic let customers ship products either directly from China or from it\u2019s U.S. warehouse, where supplies were more limited but products would ship out faster. It\u2019s unclear how long the current supply of consoles in the U.S. will last. I reached out to Anbernic for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The handheld maker said it would update customers when it received \u201cconfirmed updates regarding import duties.\u201d\n\nFortunately there\u2019s more than one way to get a console from Anbernic. You might still be able to find its products on Amazon, or AliExpress. The dropshipping site typically sells these handhelds for much cheaper than you could get elsewhere, too. The classic Anbernic RG35XX Plus Game Boy-like device goes for $48 on AliExpress, $50 on the Anbernic site, and a whopping $80 on Amazon. As American supplies dwindle we can assume those prices will increase.",

      "body": "\n\nSo I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew. This is my new hobby.. Watching depression era cooking on YouTube.\nAnyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew. It was called this because \n Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression. Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act. I didn't know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here. \nExcept in Hoover's case I don't think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros.. in trump's case he seems to be doing it to \"show\" he's protecting American interests but I'm reality it was already good and now it's garbage. Anyway.. Here is a brief summary of the act.\n\nThe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, officially the Tariff Act of 1930, was a U.S. law enacted on June 17, 1930, that significantly raised import duties on over 20,000 foreign goods. It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression.\nHere are the key facts about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act:\n * Protectionist Measure: Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive.\n * High Tariff Rates: The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in U.S. history, averaging around a 20% increase on dutiable imports. Some tariffs were raised as high as 50%.\n * Wide Scope: It applied to a vast range of goods, both agricultural and manufactured.\n * Triggered Retaliation: A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports.\n * Contributed to Trade Decline: This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade. U.S. exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts. Global trade decreased by an estimated 65% between 1929 and 1934.\n * Worsened the Great Depression: While the Act didn't cause the Great Depression, most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the U.S. and globally. It reduced demand for goods, led to business closures, and exacerbated unemployment.\n * Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists: Over 1,000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill, warning of its negative economic consequences.\n * Political Motivations: Despite the economic warnings, political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage.\n * A Symbol of Protectionism: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire.\n * Shift Towards Free Trade: In the years following the Great Depression, the U.S. shifted towards policies of trade liberalization, beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\nIn essence, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression.",

All of the above sounds like attractive reasons to send our children outside and take devices away.  -_- \n\nBut Foreal though, as a parent, I don\u2019t feel that comfortable letting my kid hang out with friends at parks, or the mall as it seems like a decent amount of people have problems with the idea of unsupervised teens existing while not in their house?! We got curfews at malls, the cinemas, the skate parks..and rules against everything. My grandparents have some WILD stories about shit kids did for \u201cfun\u201d in their day. Things that I\u2019d get shot for lol. (Ding dong ditch, egging things,lemonade stands, shooting BB guns in the driveway, cow tipping (I know. Don\u2019t ask.) Bon fires in the woods with beer, parties, Etc. \nI remember being able to play at the school playgrounds on weekends. Now? It\u2019s trespassing and kids have been arrested for this. \n\nwhen I was 16, I used to go to the mall, movies, or a library with friends. I used to bike across town to visit my boyfriend over summer break! At the mall I used to love getting chik fil a with my girls, check out guys, gossip, window shop, or try on shit we want our parents to buy later. Now? I\u2019ll take my kid to the mall but I will not drop him off at the mall. I\u2019ll drop him off at a restaurant but I don\u2019t want him leaving the table until I\u2019m already parked outside to pick him up. I warn him against loitering outside even if it\u2019s just to wait for a ride. I seriously worry someone will get ridiculous and I don\u2019t want to end up on the news with a dead child. I joke bout Nextdoor but I couldn\u2019t believe the hostility towards teens having the AUDACITY to go to the park, the mall, the icecream shop, the cinema, or riding the metro. Shit, in my experience It\u2019s always a grown ass man on the metro with his phone on speaker forcing us to listen to the convo he\u2019s having. The teens have AirPods and are quiet bc they\u2019re buried in their screen.",

      "body": "\n\nSo I was watching a depression food recipe YouTube and they were talking about Hoover stew. This is my new hobby.. Watching depression era cooking on YouTube.\nAnyway one of the featured recipes was called Hoover stew. It was called this because \n Hoover was widely blamed for the 1930s economic depression. Further research lead me to something called the smoot Hawley tariff act. I didn't know anything about this so it was interesting to learn about and it is easy to see how it is applicable here. \nExcept in Hoover's case I don't think he was trying to purposefully bankrupt the American people to hand over the country to the tech bros.. in trump's case he seems to be doing it to \"show\" he's protecting American interests but I'm reality it was already good and now it's garbage. Anyway.. Here is a brief summary of the act.\n\nThe Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, officially the Tariff Act of 1930, was a U.S. law enacted on June 17, 1930, that significantly raised import duties on over 20,000 foreign goods. It was championed by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, with the primary goal of protecting American farmers and industries from foreign competition during the onset of the Great Depression.\nHere are the key facts about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act:\n * Protectionist Measure: Its main aim was to shield domestic producers by making imported goods more expensive.\n * High Tariff Rates: The act increased tariffs to some of the highest levels in U.S. history, averaging around a 20% increase on dutiable imports. Some tariffs were raised as high as 50%.\n * Wide Scope: It applied to a vast range of goods, both agricultural and manufactured.\n * Triggered Retaliation: A major consequence was that many foreign countries retaliated by imposing their own tariffs on American exports.\n * Contributed to Trade Decline: This trade war led to a dramatic decline in international trade. U.S. exports and imports both plummeted by significant amounts. Global trade decreased by an estimated 65% between 1929 and 1934.\n * Worsened the Great Depression: While the Act didn't cause the Great Depression, most economists agree that it significantly worsened its severity and prolonged the economic downturn both in the U.S. and globally. It reduced demand for goods, led to business closures, and exacerbated unemployment.\n * Nearly Unanimous Opposition from Economists: Over 1,000 economists signed a petition urging President Hoover to veto the bill, warning of its negative economic consequences.\n * Political Motivations: Despite the economic warnings, political pressure from various domestic industries seeking protection led to its passage.\n * A Symbol of Protectionism: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act has become a lasting symbol of the dangers of protectionist trade policies and is often cited as an example of how tariffs can backfire.\n * Shift Towards Free Trade: In the years following the Great Depression, the U.S. shifted towards policies of trade liberalization, beginning with the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934.\nIn essence, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 was a protectionist measure intended to help American industries but ultimately contributed to a global trade war and deepened the economic crisis of the Great Depression.",
