If I change the screen size to include all screens above the size of 6.1\" I find that there are 490 phones that were released this year.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here is that based on screen size, the iPhone 16 is one of the smallest screened phones being sold in 2024, so the chances of a smaller phone being sold by Apple is basically zero.",
