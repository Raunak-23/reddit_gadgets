Maybe this gets built into your PC case.\n\nIn any case, lots of accessories are going to start coming when there's simply no more juice to pull.\n\nEven if things get, let's say, 50% more efficient yoy, historically as we get more power efficient we still use more power. An example would be lighting: we use far more electricity to light our homes with LED than we did with Incandescent. The lights themselves use less power, but we use more of them.\n\nI can't wait for all the shenanigans as people discover just how fucked the wiring in their walls has been this whole time.

I could see some new builds adding more lights than usual, but not like 5x as many. For regular homes with a bathroom vanity (like mine with 6 bulbs in it) I dropped from 240W to 30W.",

A standards shift is possible, but unlikely.\n\nYou are right - nVidia GPUs are running the CPU around 1.05~ volts and the memory around 1.35 volts if I recall correctly.  There is already power conditioning that happens on the board and there are a lot of implications if you change the input voltage from 12 to 36v.  If anything, 24v makes a lot of sense because many off-the-shelve components are available for this type of power.\n\nnVidia has had very little incentive to reduce power consumption, but a lot of incentive to increase performance.  Their design has focused on brute power instead of efficiency.  Question is, how far will they take it?",
