      "body": "Initially I thought that this used a laser or other optical mechanism to read the grooves.  There are cartridges that attach to traditional tonearms that do this, and which connect to an external box to convert the digital/optical signals to an analog signal.\n\nBut the [specs](https://www.waiting-for-ideas.com/projects/pp-1-by-waiting-for-ideas) state that this uses a 0.4 x 0.7 mil elliptical stylus.  A pretty basic elliptical stylus - that presumably lifts upwards from below the LP on a linear tonearm, playing the bottom side of the LP.\n\nThis may be interesting for $1000.  But not for $6000.",

              "body": "I suppose it is like that, yes.  Both use a \"sensor\" (laser, stylus) that moves along a linear track while playing the disc.\n\nAnd this turntable probably also has a laser or optical sensor.  Which would be used to detect the gaps between the tracks on the LP for the next track / previous track feature.  There were turntables in the '80s that did this and it worked fairly well iirc, but could glitch when playing clear (non-black) LPs.",

          "body": "> But not for $6000.\n\nThe audiophile world is just that way. \n\nYou get people to buy into the idea that a vinyl record is somehow better than a digital file. Then they need to get $3000 speakers, then they need $5000 in treatment for the room. Then they need $200 cables for reasons that defy physics. Then they need to upgrade the player since there's no sense in pairing $3000 speakers with an $80 player. Then for the $6000 player, no reason to cheap out on the amplifier... \n\nMeanwhile they'd have gotten better sound out of a file on their phone and $300 headphones. \n\nSound quality is inherently subjective and highly sensitive to placebo effect, so you can't use data to convince people who shelled out $14200 to listen to a scratched up 50 year old record that it doesn't sound that good. They know what they hear.",
