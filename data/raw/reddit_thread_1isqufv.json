Accordingly, there are no types of \u201cpersons\u201d who are excluded from being able to seek reexamination under 35 U.S.C. 302. Corporations and/or governmental entities are included within the scope of the term \u201cany person.\u201d The only \u201cperson\u201d who is barred from filing a request for ex parte reexamination of a patent under 35 U.S.C. 302 is one who is barred from doing so by the estoppel provisions of AIA 35 U.S.C. 315(e)(1) or 35 U.S.C. 325(e)(1) based on inter partes review and post grant review, respectively, once the estoppel attaches. The patent owner can ask for reexamination which will be limited to an ex parte consideration of prior art patents or printed publications. If the patent owner wishes to have a wider consideration of issues by the Office, including matters such as prior public use or on sale, the patent owner may file a reissue application (see, e.g., MPEP \u00a7 1401 - \u00a7 1403), or, where appropriate, a supplemental examination proceeding (see, e.g., MPEP \u00a7 2801 \u2013 \u00a7 2803). It is also possible for the Director of the Office to initiate reexamination on the Director\u2019s own initiative under 37 CFR 1.520. Some of the persons likely to use reexamination under 35 U.S.C. 302 are patentees, licensees, potential licensees, attorneys without identification of their real client in interest, infringers, potential exporters, patent litigants, interference applicants, and International Trade Commission respondents. The name of the person who files the request will not be maintained in confidence",

There is enough space for a screen to show text/images and scroll through lists. It's firmly attached to your wrist, you can get away with a bit more weight than something flapping around on your shirt. Since it has direct contact to skin, it can monitor biometrics such as heart rate. Watches are already normalised in society, so people don't really notice smartwatches.\n\nI guess there is nothing stopping you mounting a smart watch as a badge. \n\nIMO, the only advantage the badge form factor has over a watch form factor is that you can put a camera on it, and that camera will see roughly what you can see.   \n\nThough the general public seems to get really weirded out by people wearing cameras, it's continually killed any attempt at the smart glasses form factor.  I suspect humane went with the badge form factor as an attempted end-run around this general distrust, as people are much less likely to notice something chest mounted.\n\nFor your smart home usecase, there is also the option of buying several smart speakers and distributing them around the house. They are reasonably cheap, and have decent range for picking up your voice, and are designed for this usecase.",

It shows a complete disregard for early adopters who believed in the product. Even if Humane struggled financially, they could have at least offered some compensation or trade-in value rather than just turning their customers\u2019 devices into expensive e-waste.\n\nThis kind of move burns trust, and it\u2019s a reminder to be wary of hyped startups with unproven tech. Hopefully, HP does something better with the AI expertise they acquired, but it\u2019s hard to imagine people getting excited about Humane\u2019s tech again after this disaster.",
