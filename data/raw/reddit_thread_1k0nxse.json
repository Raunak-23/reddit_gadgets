Police will plug them in and put them in RF shielded environments to keep them on and avoid someone remote wiping them.

          "body": "In sorta eli5 way.. So when you turn your phone on after a restart, it's completely encrypted. The data on your phone is pretty much inaccessible, and the only eay to decrypt it is to put in your pin, which is the only decryption key. No face scan, no fingerprint - neither of those are the exact numbers your pin is, and phone doesn't store it to use. So no one can take your phone, point at you and unlock it, for example. Nor can they read the memory other ways to get to your files.\n\nWhen you do unlock the phone for the first time with your pin, that memory is decrypted until you restart the phone again. Thats why then you can use other ways to unlock phone - face id, fingerprints etc. The screen lock alone does not encrypt anything. This also means that someone can try and read the memory of your phone then and get to your files. It's not *simple* , but it's much simpler than trying to decrypt the memory on its own. \n\n\nGoogle could probably make a feature that would encrypt the phone without restarting.. But then the phone would end up in the same, pretty much unusable state (since everything is encrypted, including apps and data), so they might as well just leverage the restart feature that already does all that, on top of restarting apps, clearing memory etc. There's no incentive to try and get those benefits, when restarting already does all that and more.",

If anything it makes the device more reliable without excessive uptime.\nIt also is better for your company.

In other words, almost everything inside the iPhone remains encrypted until the user unlocks it with their passcode after the phone starts up. That state is called Before First Unlock.\n\nThe decryption key then is stored in RAM which can be soft-unlocked again with passcode or biometrics. That state is called After First Unlock. This state exists so your iPhone can actually do background stuff like getting your sms, getting your notifications etc\u2026\n\nWell, by rebooting quietly, it jumps back to Before First Unlock state.
