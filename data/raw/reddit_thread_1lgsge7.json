It\u2019s pretty niche though at this point. I was briefly running an audio interface that was FW400->FW800->Thunderbolt->USB-C.  It was cool that it worked but having that many dongles strung together was a pain the butt.  If the cable got bumped around too much it would drop the connection and reconnect.  I retired the interface pretty soon after.  At some point things become obsolete.  I was running that setup about a decade ago and FireWire was already pretty much dead. I haven\u2019t purchased a FireWire device in at least 15 years.  I wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to connect a 1980\u2019s dot matrix printer via a parallel port to a modern Mac without spending some cash on hardware/software from a 3rd party.",

I had the FW800 to Thunderbolt adapter and sold it in 2021 for like \u00a320, thinking I made a steal for some obsolete adapter.\n\nThen about a year ago I came across my dad's old camcorder and videotapes, and found out the only way to capture the footage properly is with FireWire, and the adapter I had now costs anywhere from \u00a3100 to \u00a3150 because of the camcorder hype.\n\nKicking myself for selling that adapter for beer money. But luckily you can get a 2012 Mac mini with a FW800 port on it for about \u00a350, so I did that, only captured one tape but it works great and nice to have a Mac dedicated to it. Then I came across the FW800/Thunderbolt adapter for \u00a310 on Vinted anyway lol, but reading this news I think I might sell it before it tanks in value again because I don't really need it.\n\nBut moral of the story is sometimes you're going to need some of these obsolete cables and adapters to revive old tech. And getting those old camcorder tapes captured is better done sooner than later because they're slowly degrading.",
