I know it had some success in music production (even into the era of dubstep!) because of the MIDI ports, but that was niche.\n\nPeople will also be looking at this as some sort of \"scam\" because of the monstrous extra hardware, but hey that's how the SNES did it and no-one gives that grief.",

Once PCs could support dedicated GPUs and sound cards, the Amiga line was too far behind to catch up. \n\nAs an owner of an A500 and A3000, and having written GUI programs for it, I feel sad because it's become a bit of a footnote in history. \n\nI also had multiple generation of palm pilot units, and those too are lost in history.
