CPU and mobo, if you buy right, will last 4-8 years before an upgrade becomes necessary.  Back in the day, generational leaps were massive, but that is no longer the case.  A 12700k is not that far off a 14700k or the AMD equivalent, skews.  The graphics card is pretty much the only 5-year upgrade that you HAVE to do, but that is only for Triple AAA high resolution, max quality with zero upscaling.  \n\nFor the price of a new PS5, you can upgrade the most important parts of the PC every 5 years.  The rest of it carries forward.  Sure, that one time, a 1500 to 2k drop is a big ask, but that is if you don't have a single part.  \n\nJust clarification to your point, not really a rebuttal.

          "body": "Or listen to digital foundry because that sounds exactly like something Rich would say.  I do think 8 GB is too little on a $300 product, especially when I think the logical progression would\u2019ve been 12, with 16 for the 5060 TI. 20 on the 5070, and 5070 TI with 24 on the 5080 and 32 on the 5090. Then the 5080 would be matching last generation\u2019s halo product in the 4090, we would finally be giving up 8 GB GPUs, and the 5070 and 5070 TI would be more appropriate for 1440- which has almost started pushing beyond 16 GB at least with frame generation turned on. \n\nI think VRAM is one of those things that really ages a card. Another example from this generation is the very poorly allotted 5060 TI 8 gig which seems like a much worse proposition than the 5060 TI 16 gig. I think one of the weirdest choices has to be the 5080 with only 16 GB of the RAM which is becoming an issue at 4K for a card that is theoretically at least meant to work for 4K gaming. Though I guess the 5070 takes the crown with having 12 gigs of VRAM while being meant for 1440p which would probably benefit for more VRAM. Especially since the 5060 TI which is a weaker card is being offered with 16 gigs.",
