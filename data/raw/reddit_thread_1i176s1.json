It had variataions of 256MB/512MB/1GB with different vram types and speeds like ddr/ddr2/lpddr and also was available for both AGP and PCI-EX slots. That card was around the limit of AGP slot bandwith. Because of all the variations some 256mb cards with fast vrams performed better in most games compared to 1gb but with low speed Vrams. Some AGP cards performed better than PCI-EX but some did not. Some high speed/high vram ones overperformed 1600xt(which was supposed to be the superior card). That was a short but messy period.",

The 8800gtx got released with iirc 700 something mb of vram and a 8800gts with 300 something. Cue the 8800gt that got released later with the refreshed g92 chip and 512mb, it cost half of what a gts went for and performed better. It even outperformed the gtx in some occasions.",

For example a laptop with a 3080M 8GB will perform pretty much the same ballpark (slightly faster but depending on resolution and specific game and feature, like raytracing -obviously no FLSS FG on 30 series, but Lossless Scaling app covers that for $10) as a 4060M 8GB (depending on what wattage either runs in that specific laptop model - devil is in the detail and with laptops always check for the potential gotchas of a candidate device in reviews, i.e. overheating/throttling or hinge/keyboard/screen quality), so it comes down to price and condition. When I was shopping around last autumn, I got a formerly $2500 MSRP laptop with a 3080 for $800 in *mint* condition and <500 hours (according to the stock SSDs SMART data) usage at $500 less than any of the used 4060 laptops in my region. Going for the older, but higher tier model also got me a much nicer screen and overall build quality.\n\nAlso watch out for used laptops with Intel 13/14th gen CPUs, you never know if they were affected by the Intel voltage flaw and are permanently unstable. It's a fault that won't be immediately obvious (vs broken screen, hinges or otherwise dead laptop) until some serious or application specific usage, so it can also be harder to get a refund for this.",

Indiana Jones won't even show you path tracing options on an 8GB card because the feature requires a lot of VRAM, no matter how fast the card is.\n\nIf your point is that you can always turn settings down to make the game fit your VRAM... well yeah, obviously. It's implied that they are talking about the requirements for max or near max settings. It's advice for buyers too, who wants to spend hundreds on a new card and then immediately turn down textures or whatever.",

If you've got too little vram, you're usually stuffed.\n\nThis is why Nvidia is stingy with vram.

No need to load a 4k texture if you drop the resolution to 1080p\u2026\n\nAdditionally DLSS etc can take lower res textures and interpolate higher resolution.\n\nSure, I agree there are limits and if you hit them without optimizing perf issues can be dramatic\u2026 but there are lots of techniques to reduce memory usage.",

Mobile VR graphics sucks with lower vram (batman arkam shadows is the best example at an attempt of a high end game on pure mobile VR) but integrated graphics have been gradually improving with slower DDR memory too.\n\nBut thats for low end. The issue with 8 GB comes down exclusively to nvidia keeping 8 GB vram from the 2070 to 3070. From my experience the 2070 is perfectly capable for 1440p or low 4k, except its 8 gb vram hindered its overall performance (creating crashes in UE editor in particular) and prompting me to find a better GPU, then the Rx 6700xt that I still use today. Nvidia learned their lesson with the 40 series after the naming scandal.\n\nOn a technical reason more vram means more quality models and textures with less development work to create lower detail optimized models. This is good for high end visuals but not low end, where actually direct storage tech (where pcie devices like the GPU can query storage directly instead of queuing into the slow CPU) would play a bigger role in allowing rapid streaming of additional info like more polygons as the player moves, bit it seems direct storage isnt at  the effectiveness it should be and its being subsistuted for ai models...",
