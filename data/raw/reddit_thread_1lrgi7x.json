OG Gameboy is late 80s tech and we saw a ton of miniaturizing of electronics in the 90s that meant they could shrink the Gameboy into the pocket's size and run it off 2 AAA batteries instead of the OG's 4 AAs, which they literally could not have done in the late 80s.\n\nThey technically could've done color with the OG Gameboy, but certainly not twice the clockspeed the GBC had and certainly not with the battery life that the original GB had. \n\nThat's not double (triple) dipping, that's the natural progression of technology during a rapidly changing decade. Whereas a non-OLED Switch is blatant attempt to double-dip because the technology for an OLD Switch 2 is here now, and has been for years.",

At least you could in the Gameboy & DS Versions, not sure if they have all continued to work that way on the Switch.",

Even if that is no longer the case and everyone just uses it handheld, they have already set the president that switches some with a dock, so it's too late to not include it on the switch 2 without outrage.",

This new restriction is Apple-esque, sure (if it's even significant, since there are already third-party docks that work fine), but the Switch is literally the only console of the past few generations to allow unlicensed third-party controllers. Sony and Microsoft do all sorts of encryption to prevent it but you can buy any random Chinese controller and it usually works perfectly with Switch 1 or 2. Some people even program their own microcontrollers to use for inputting art in games like Splatoon. AFAIK they all still work fine with Switch 2.\n\nI also have USB-C dongles for connecting my wireless headphones using AptX Adaptive and those work perfectly with the Switch/2 also.",

I know that since the GameCube they've lagged in specs and third-party support, and I also own other systems like a PS5 and Steam Deck. However, I play the Switch (and now Switch 2) the most because they have Pok\u00e9mon, Fire Emblem etc - the games that I personally want to play.\n\nSimilarly, Apple has a great ecosystem that works within itself, but doesn't play too well if you dare venture outside. I've typically zigzagged between iPhone and Android with subsequent upgrades, but my current job has allowed me to go deeper into the ecosystem with AirTags, a MacBook etc. They all work so well together that it would take a lot for an android phone to convince me to move again. At least I'm in the UK, and no-one cares about the blue bubbles here lol.\n\nIt is worth noting that this kind of behaviour isn't exclusive to Nintendo, though. For example, Sony doesn't allow bluetooth headphones to connect to PS5, and instead require you to buy their own ones.",

I have cloud saves that sync up to my main gaming desktop.\n\nAnd if the APU inside it becomes obsolete, it can still play older games and remote play bigger games from either my main desktop or a cloud service like GeForce Now.\n\nThe era of handheld PC gaming is here and it's going to take off once they get a little more affordable or peformant.

Still though The currently available 3rd party dock can update its firmware with a PC. so as long as that company keeps providing updates anytime nintendo might change it then it should still work.\n\nAlso, It would be tricky for Nintendo to change that key because you need the switch docked in order to update the dock firmware. and if its not outputting display you cant even select in the menu to update the dock since the dock itself covers the handheld screen. So they would have to continue supporting the old key until the dock has updated too but then that would open a world of issues with old unused docks that didn't update no longer working. Basically they need to continue supporting launch switch 2 dock keys. And changing key would break any dock that isnt updated. Not sure nintendo would open that can of worms unless there was some major third party dock issue like with the Nyko dock for switch 1.",

To quote somebody from the famiboards:\n\n\"The only 3rd party docks that exhibited problems were those that did not adhere to USB-C and PD specifications. It was not a Switch problem, per se -- these docks could fry any USB-C device (phone, etc.) that was connected. The Switch console itself followed the specification(s) correctly.\"\n\n\"That said, the official Switch dock has a USB-C connector that is slightly smaller than spec, making it easier to connect/disconnect. Third party manufacturers like Nyko attempted to do the same, but botched it by not properly spacing the pins and cutting corners with safety circuitry.\"\n\nBasically Nintendo had to make the pins a bit smaller than industry standard so that the switch could slide in and out of the dock easily. Third parties try to replicate with their docks that but fucked it up because they were basically taking shots in the dark. So ultimately it is on third parties for bricking the switch.",

      "body": "Reminder that Nintendo misimplemented the USB-C spec on the Switch 1 to the degree that third party docks that follow the spec would burn out your Switch, because it would essentially lie to the dock.\n\nThat was an intentional design decision. A company the size of Nintendo does not have an excuse to know about the USB-C spec, and the fact that their custom design requests higher power than the Switch can handle, because it lies to the dock, must be considered an intentional design. They clearly knew USB-C's capabilities, but they designed their console and dock to damage consoles if the spec was followed.\n\nYou are a sucker if you think \"nuh uh!\" is a valid argument. We have proof Nintendo is willing to do this and has done it, so someone has to bring the proof that they didn't do it again. Still trusting Nintendo to not fuck you over for doing something perfectly legal and moral (that is to say there is neither a legal or moral argument against third party docks -- sorry, fanboys) is to simply be gullible.",

To use a steam deck like a switch you'd need to buy a dock separately and buy 2 controllers.\n\nNot to mention that the switch 2 will actually be getting 1st party software support for the next 6-8 years while the steam deck won't.\n\nSteam deck is a better purchase for anyone with an established steam library that would like to play handheld. Outside of that, not so much\n\n\nEdit:\n\nOne other thing I'd add... A steam deck doesn't get improved performance when docked. When you dock your switch it changes its CPU and GPU output, and changes the performance profiles of all the games it's running. \n\nThat's why a switch 2 game like Mario kart world can run at 1080p 60fps when handheld, but then switches to 1440p 60fps when docked.\n\nThat's not just a video output tweak, that's the game itself being rendered at a higher resolution without any performance loss.",

Or the OS becoming super laggy, unresponsive randomly.\n\n\n(I still love PC gaming first and foremost. But yeah they're totaally different animals. It rears its ugly head if you ever want to play a basic multiplayer game with friends / family, impromptu. tl;dr the switch always gets picked.)",
