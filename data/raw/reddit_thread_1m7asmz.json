I have a (beefy)gaming laptop, I just can't get some of my favorite games like Red Dead 2 to run without weird issues. So I pretty much only play my consoles. Maybe it's just an issue with my system but man, PC gaming involves so many more individual updates like system, GPU, multiple launchers, having to reload shaders on game updates. And then certain games having to run on different APIs for better performance depending on what hardware you have and other random stuff like that. It's just a hassle lol I guess is my main complaint. I'd rather just press 2 buttons on my controller and be playing my game.",

Over the years I've slowly used my consoles less and less and as I've gotten older use my PC more and more. PC having such seamless controller support now was a huge part of this. That and moving away from TV DVR to online streaming really discouraged me from using my TV. I miss old-school DVR. \n\nSo now I'd rather watch at my PC and have adblock etc while not paying for the ad free tier.\n\nThe only thing I miss is not having a 4k Blu-ray player after selling the consoles. \n\nI still have my launch PS4 and it does 1080p fine. I kind of want to upgrade to a PS4 Pro just for media. A big drawback on the PS5 is the lack of DLNA/UPnP.\n\nPS4 isn't great at it either but it's better than the PS5 not having it at all. \n\nMeanwhile PS3 is the best for it but I want to be able to use Hulu.\n\nDon't really know what the answer is. PS4 Pro feels like the best option. My launch PS4 does have PT on it, though.",

If I want to play on the couch and not at a desk in my office, I just use Moonlight to stream to my living room which works pretty damn good.\n\nAs for the 4K blu-ray players, I just bought a Panasonic Blu-ray player that supports Dolby Atmos and Vision. I don't need to keep my large consoles in the living room anymore which is nice. Plus, last I remembered, my PS4 Pro didn't support 4K Blu-ray movies and my Xbox One X was subpar and didn't support things I wanted like Dolby Vision.\n\nFor the media sharing, I built a home server with spare PC parts that I had, loaded it up with 1000's of movies/TV shows, and set up Plex. Just about every device in our house can use Plex. It's great for the kids or wife that can't tell the difference between streaming something and playing an 4K movie off a Blu-ray haha!

But then Uncharted 2, Persona 5, and the Last of Us came out and all was forgiven \n\nPeople are more than willing to buy a console now to play games that will be released in the future.  And honestly, there are some dope looking games coming.  An exclusive Fromsoft game could be enough to buoy a console on its own, plus all the usual first party Nintendo IPs",

But you get far more than your money's worth. I think for many people buying it exclusively for Donkey Kong and the upcoming Switch 2 upgrade to BotW (since most people haven't experienced the emulated version) is well worth the investment; that's like a couple hundred hours worth of gameplay and tons of replayability. And unlike their competitors, we *know* that there will be a new flagship Mario game and a new flagship Zelda game eventually, which have never failed.",

                          "body": "Honestly, the issue here is that most of what you\u2019re criticizing isn\u2019t unique to Nintendo. It\u2019s industry standard across PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam. Nintendo is just now catching up with some of these modern DRM practices, and because it\u2019s new for them, they\u2019re taking way more flack than competitors who\u2019ve been doing it for years.\n\nFor example, the idea that you \u201cdon\u2019t actually own the console\u201d or your games, well, that\u2019s true across the board when it comes to digital purchases. You\u2019re not buying the game itself, you\u2019re buying a license to use it. Sony, Microsoft, Valve, they all reserve the right to revoke that license under certain circumstances. It\u2019s right there in their user agreements. This isn\u2019t a Nintendo-exclusive issue. In fact, all of Nintendo\u2019s first-party games are fully on the cartridge, which means you actually own them.\n\nThe \u201cbricking\u201d concern is also being misrepresented. Nintendo has the ability to revoke online access if you\u2019re found violating the terms (usually for modding, piracy, etc), but there\u2019s no evidence they\u2019re out here randomly bricking physical consoles. Every time a story surfaces, there\u2019s always more to it. Maybe someone bought a used game that had previously been banned due to that copy having been pirated. It\u2019s never just a clean, innocent user getting targeted out of nowhere. And even in those edge cases, people have appealed and gotten it resolved. In none of those cases has Nintendo ever fully bricked someone\u2019s console. You can still use it offline, just like how Sony and Microsoft handle bans for modding or other violations. They all block you from online services, not the console entirely.\n\nAnd yeah, to be clear, Nintendo does deserve criticism in certain areas. Charging $80 for Mario Kart World? Total BS. Ten bucks for Welcome Tour? Also BS. But you don\u2019t have to pay for it, and I\u2019m not. And even then, you can essentially get MKW for $50 when you grab the $500 bundle with the system. That\u2019s not a bad deal. It\u2019s just frustrating how much legit criticism gets wrapped in misinformation and outrage bait, and then reasonable people get misled into thinking Nintendo is uniquely evil when in reality they\u2019re doing what everyone else has been doing, just with more spotlight on them. If Nintendo\u2019s the villain here, then so is every other major gaming company.",

What's frustrating are the people yelling that it's a failure and deliberately lying about it in order to try and manifest it failing. It's mostly backfired and just made more people aware of it. \n\nThe only reason I ended up getting one is because on 4/20 week GameStop was offering $420.69 on Series X tradeins. \n\nIf you had the pro membership it upped the tradein to $455. \n\nI took that $455 without hesitation and put it right down on the Switch 2 preorder. I feel like I got a Switch 2 for $45. I never would have bought one at launch otherwise... I would have waited. \n\nI was already getting ready to sell my Series X. I never used it. I never could have sold it for that much anywhere else. The timing was brilliant. \n\nSimilarly I never used my PS5 and I sold that to buy guitar pedals.\n\nI'm currently on the PC+Switch 2 combo and I'm really happy with it. It covers everything for me.\n\nThe only thing that sucks is that I don't have a 4k Blu-ray player anymore. But my launch PS4 does 1080p fine, so eh. Maybe one day I'll get a PS4 pro for cheap.",

The issue comes down to things like decades of aggressive legal attacks on fans and heavy handed attitudes towards consumers that contradict the PR image of Nintendo being a children/family focused company. \n\n\nOn the aspects of how the company treats workers, sure, Nintendo seems to be doing well for the industry. They had limited layoffs in 2024 but have a large retention of staff overall. It is good to support companies that treats employees well and it is worth rewarding companies that value the people who make their company successful beyond just large payouts for their management.\n\n\nMost things are never black and white. It is why forums are worth using for discussion rather than purely tweeted rants. Here we can discuss how the hostile IP protection and years of attempting to end the secondhand market is likely *why* Nintendo can try to maintain staff at higher rates than the current standard. We can break down where we fall on the idea of this poisoned chalice and question if there's room for a better balance. \n\n\nThis shouldn't ever be a circle jerking echo chamber of Nintendo Bad or Hurr Reddit Wrong Again. There are legitimate arguments to be had for and against most aspects and the idea of a forum is to expose yourself to other opinions and new facts to help your own opinions to form and evolve.",

And of those 4 games, S/V got called out and butchered by reviews. They needed to put out downgrade patches to make it switch functional. And only now on the switch 2 is it running properly. Ppl were running it on emmulators on their PC fine to show how it wasnt running good on the switch. And fans were defending it left and right.  Same with the palworld issue, fans defend nintendo for the patent and suing.\n\nThe rest of their games are ports and remasters. Switch doesn't have its own Mario kart, luigis mansion or smash brothers game, for instance. And you could argue botw is switch exclusive, but it did come out for the wii u. \n\nAnd the switch is still one of the most successful consoles out there. Simply cuz its super versatile and its a great console for kids. Its a great console, and like I said, unless they muck it up hard, they won't end up dying out.",

And when you\u2019re actually playing the game, the amount of events and items and all the shenanigans going on doesn\u2019t make it feel boring in the slightest.\n\nIt\u2019s funny because I thought all the same things you\u2019re saying, then I actually played the game, and my feelings changed completely.

It's a little ironic in a way, where the PS5 was at the previous role of fastest selling console, but you had people on reddit still jumping on Sony for their actions on the anti-consumer stuff, yet the moment Switch 2 surpassed that, and suddenly a chunk of people flip on actions and ignore the anti-consumer actions they're doing too?\n\nThe point on that last statement is that people will find any way to have a \"win\" with grade-school mentality to feel right and console war antics. \n\nIf one enjoys the system is fine, but also don't ignore their bad practices and brush them off, cause it affects everyone.",

Happy I did. \n\n- Mario Kart World\n\n- Donkey Kong Banaza, and I admit that I initially was going to wait on buying this one but my wife forced me to just pay the money. I love just smashing shit after work. \n\nI though bought this not for the games but just to be able to finally play games on a big screen if I felt like it. The PS Portal is great and is the same size but it's a different use case (obviously). I anticipate I'm going to eventually get back to the regular Switch 1 games and again, I'm happy to do it on something I can easily see and hold. It feels STURDY. It looks vibrant. No, not as good as my OLEDs all around my house but I don't need it to be like that. I just need it to work. It works :)\n\nHope that answers your question. Have a great one",

It *can* be, and it\u2019s honestly a lot of fun to find a huge area on a stage, go Bananza, and just destroy things, it works best like a traditional 3D exploratory platformer. Nintendo excels in charm and DK nails it; every new level is gorgeous, there are a ton of fun ideas, and it slowly evolves in a way that organically lets you grow into the systems. It\u2019s Mario Odyssey level challenge, in that the challenge is what you make it, but it\u2019s exciting to just explore. There are soft \u201cdetermined paths\u201d towards some collectibles once you start noticing the signs, but other times you might just decide to start slamming your fists into the ground and accidentally uncover a banana or fossil.\n\nI said it in another post but I read an article about how DK feels like the culmination of Mario Odyssey\u2019s fluidity and collectathon joy mixed with Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom\u2019s ability to give you a goal, hand you the tools, and let you figure out the best way to do it\u2014it really does feel like that to me.",

The banana gems give you a skill point for every five you collect and the fossils can be turned in for apparel.

Or am I just unable to see these features through my \"hate\". I'm shocked they actually added an Ethernet port this time tbh.\n\nAgain if you're enjoying your Switch 2, enjoy it! I'm not telling you you can't enjoy it, I'm just saying why I refuse to. Nintendo is not a good company and I refuse to support them, it's that simple \ud83d\ude42",

Switch 2 launches with almost no new exclusives, same garbage joycons that still drift, worse battery life than the original, drops OLED for LCD, and still costs $450+. And it breaks sales records.\n\nNintendo sees this and decides there\u2019s no reason to fix anything. No need to bundle games, no need to improve build quality, no need to justify the price. People will line up regardless.\n\nSame story with Sony. PS5 launched with barely any true exclusives, jacked up prices, pushed expensive accessories, and is now locking more behind subscriptions. Still a best-seller.\n\nThis is what happens when gamers reward companies for giving less and charging more. They keep doing it because we keep letting them.",

Their quality first party titles are kind of sparse for launching a new console. It launched with the next 2 years having \\~5 major releases that are exclusive to the new console, and many of those releases are somewhat limited in their appeal. They all seem like great titles, but I don't think they have any of the \"woah, I should buy a switch so I can play this!\" In the same way BoTW, MK8D, Odyssey, Ultimate, ACNH, and others did. The NS2 roster kind of appeals to the Nintendo fanbase, but I don't think it appeals to the average consumer, especially again, because the buy-in price has been increased by 1.5x. Can you really convince someone who just wants to play Metroid Prime 4 to pay that price for it when the Switch 1 version will probably be fine? Can you convince a person who bought a Switch 1 to play Mario Kart with their friends maybe once a month to shell that money out to play World? I just think they're not setting themselves up for success here, even if the console and games are good.",

                          "body": "> The promise of multiple platforms.\n\nPromise fulfilled. I can play games across multiple Nintendo generations, multiple Sony generations, and multiple Microsoft generations. It's done. It's already happened.\n\n> Right now you have switch 1 and 2 games but do you really think that will last for 10-20 years from now? \n\nI don't need them to last 20 years. I will have other games 20 years from now.\n\n>  Short term gain while ignoring the long term one. \n\nIt isn't a long-term gain. No one is gaining anything significant in the long-term by keeping physical copies of their games. The best they can *possibly* hope for is that they don't misplace or damage their physical media in the intervening 20 years, and can then play a 20 year-old game at that point to scratch a particular nostalgia itch (probably unsatisfyingly).\n\nAnd, again, we're not ignoring the long-term gain. We're acknowledging it, and then making the conscious choice to value what you term the \"short-term gain\" over it.\n\n> I never said it was for the sake of preservation. That would be stupid but a byproduct of the nondigital age is they can't TAKE BACK THEIR SHIT FROM YOU. \n\nWE DON'T CARE.\n\nJesus, dude. Calm down.\n\n> You pointlessly misconstruing my point.\n\nNo, I'm not. I just think your point is really dumb, and super fucking myopic.\n\n> ITS NICE TO PLAY THE SHIT YOU ARE NOSTALGIC FOR.\n\nGreat, good for you.\n\nThe rest of us don't care.\n\nI have scores of physical copies of games from the 1990's and 2000's. I have ***less than zero desire*** to play them again. In fact, the very small handful of older games I've chosen to re-experience (like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2) have been in the form of enhanced or remastered editions I've happily purchased as digital copies, because the time I would have to spend hunting through closets and boxes in the garage to find my original copies (not to mention going through the effort of connecting a CD-ROM drive to my gaming rig) is worth ***way*** more than the cost of purchasing the games again in digital form.\n\n> Being directly able to play stuff from the period is nice.\n\nIs it? I've never found the appeal. I don't think many other people have, either.\n\n> I can pop on my Gamecube or SNES and play shit from my childhood while I don't think kids of this generation won't get that luxury with how restrictive these companies want to be with their IPs.\n\nI've owned a Sega Genesis, N64, Gamecube, and PS2 - all of which were essentially physical-only. I have never, ever fished any of those consoles out of wherever they're currently hidden to try to replay anything. I'm just not interested. There are too many good modern games to play, most of which I will never have the time to enjoy.\n\nHaving nostalgia for the past is fine. Indulging in that nostalgia, however, generally isn't worth much. In many cases it's actively harmful.\n\n> That is the travesty. \n\noh nooooooooo\n\n> Especially with how anti pirate many companies are becoming and that isn't new but the tech to enable their rights protection are getting better. The fact we can still play things like Marathon 1-Infinity, Myth on PC because its all abandonware is fucking neat. \n\nAgain - no one really cares.",
