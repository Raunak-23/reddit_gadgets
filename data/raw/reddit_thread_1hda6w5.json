Plus changes to middleware and drivers to support the change,and need be supported in life for the phone in software updates, this could run into the millions.\n\nI\u2019d guess Apple have taken the decision, with a relatively old device, to discontinue it for the EU as the cost / benefit doesn\u2019t stack up",

Based on that source, I was able to find the EU's implementation guide which says:\n\n>This will not prevent **existing stock of equipment that have been placed on the EU market** before the entry into application of the new rules from being sold legally after the entry into application of the new rules. The \u2018Blue Guide\u2019 contains further detailed guidance on that matter, notably in section 2. See also the answer to question 43. (emphasis mine, [source](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C_202402997))\n\nSo it's actually _incorrect_ to say that it only applies to items introduced after that date; it applies to items _placed on the market_ after that date. That term applies to devices, not models or model lines. That means that if there are iPhones with lightning connectors already in stock within the EU, they don't have to be removed from stock after the rule goes into effect. But Apple cannot ship additional phones with that connector into the market after that date.",

As these phones feature a Lightning port, they are in violation of the European Union policy, which goes into effect starting January 2025.\n\nApple could have elected to make a new version of these devices with USB-C ports instead of Lightning, but they have not done so. Instead, the company has decided to simply discontinue these models slightly earlier than they otherwise would.\n\nHowever, it is not that big a loss. In spring 2025, Apple will launch the new fourth-generation iPhone SE, which will naturally feature a USB-C port. (The new iPhone SE is expected to resemble an iPhone 14 in chassis design, featuring edge-to-edge screen, upgraded camera, and USB-C charging.)",

Kids' toys must be compliant with EU regulations like the Toy Safety Directive 2009/48/EC. In this case, the CE mark is nothing more than a self-declaration from the manufacturer that these regulations are followed. If you make a kids toy that has wireless emissions (e.g. a wifi-equipped talking bear), then it also has to comply with the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) 2014/53/EU. It's this directive, the RED, that requires certification. So for wireless products, the CE mark _does_ mean it's certified, but the vast majority of products are not covered by regulations that require certification.",

Standardisation is a meaningful and significant improvement. I have a generic Amazon USB-PD 45W charger plugged into my bedside table. It will fast-charge either my phone or my laptop depending on which device is about to run out of juice.
