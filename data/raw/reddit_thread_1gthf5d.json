LLMs can be a great tool for natural language interfaces, but it needs to be backed by a properly designed, deterministic code if it's going to control something else.",

The corrected prompt us fed to copilot, and copilots output is fed to a security layer verifying the contents fit certain guidelines. None of these directly communicate outside of input output. None are comprised of the same LLM/program.

You can't do a security review of that -- it's just too complicated. There's too many opportunities for bugs, and you can't have bugs in safety critical software.\n\nSo, instead what you can do is focus on creating a traditional system which handles the safety critical part. Take a self driving car, for example. \"Drive the car\" is an insanely complex task, but something like \"apply the brakes if distance to what's in front of you is less than stopping distance\" is much simpler, and absolutely could be written using traditional approaches. If possible, leave software altogether. If you need an airlock to only ever have one open door, mechanically design the system so it's impossible for two doors to open at the same time.\n\nThe ML layer can and should still try to avoid situations where guardrails activate -- if nothing else, defense in depth. It's just that you cannot rely on it.",

For 30 years the story has been hailed as a prescient prediction of the internet, but over the past few years it clearly resembles LLM services more than anything, with a bit of cloud computing sprinkled in. Of course the AI in the story is a *real* AI capable of reasoning, understanding, and performing computations, rather than an autocomplete algorithm that tricks simple-minded humans into thinking it\u2019s an AI due to pareidolia, but the core premise of safeguards being trivially easy to remove and cause chaos if you know how feels more relevant in the 2020s than it ever did before.",
