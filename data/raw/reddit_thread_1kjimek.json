I bet they'll release only some models and specifically in areas that don't make them any money anyway. They can do these shaver attachments, for example, because they already sold the shaver and they know that anybody could model it anyway. So they aren't losing any sales... And they might make some sales from people who like the initiative. There are probably a few things like that all over their product lines. But I doubt we'll see these models for anything that somebody couldn't pretty easily just make themselves or that Phillips has a decent side business for.",

This wont fix those blades, but its a step the right direction by the maker. Fragile is an understatement for those things. Seriously. \n\nWhen a device has parts inevitably requiring consumable replacement parts like buzzers and blade the maker really needs to hard press retailers to buy both or no deal. At least on a 1:1 ratio. Like I get models and designs change, but none of the stores I bought my 4 freakin OneBlades from had replacement blades in their stock log, let alone stocks. They never stocked the replacement blades. There may be a predatory excuse behind it but Im giving this co the benefit of doubt, because its stupid marketing if it was intended.
