New home has tons. Also it\u2019s great that you can just place it on an entertainment center and don\u2019t have to mount it, but it also always there and in the way sort of speaking. The screen is what makes it amazing. The cancelling of light from above and the sides. It only throws back the image from the projector. It\u2019s a giant matte screen. I may miss that. May hate glares once I move on to just a tv. Don\u2019t game too much but I\u2019m sure you can find reviews measuring lag. This particular unit is super bright. The fan kicking on won\u2019t be missed. It\u2019s the screen that makes it theatre like. Would recommend under low light to no light. A normal projector only in no light.  The other thing is that ust aren\u2019t getting vastly better. This is a 4k unit and it is amazing, I don\u2019t think the processors on these have been getting better as quickly. Some 4k units are only up scaling 1080p somehow. These need to get smaller and quieter to keep warranting a purchase. TVs will eat up the xxl market soon.",

If you're watching a news channel 24/7 with rolling text, then yes, you're likely to experience some burn-in.\n\nHowever, the reality is that 90% of OLED users are well-informed about the strengths and limitations of the technology and purchase them without any problems. I'm active in OLED forums where gamers use their displays at high luminance for HDR gaming without issues as well.\n\nAs for lifespan, you can comfortably use a modern OLED display for ten years without concern. The technology has advanced significantly, and most burn-in issues from early generations have been largely minimized. Unfortunately, these so-called issues are often exaggerated in the media by non-users, leading people to believe that OLEDs are still plagued by burn-in and low luminance drawbacks\u2014when, in reality, they are not.",

What is it, if not tradition?  Because if it's a stylistic choice, it's... certainly not a \"choice\".  It's what every movie with almost no exceptions does.  You'd think an art form would at least sometimes vary the parameters of its medium, and the fact that this one is sacrosanct smacks of tradition and dogma.

But it would have been nice if you'd named even one reason why 24fps is inherently preferable in all of this.  It's like boxing a ghost.  I'm responding to my own experience of, 24fps *hurts* for me, especially when there's a pan and it looks like a slideshow.  It always has.  Every once in a while there's higher-fps content and it's like a breath of fresh air.  \n\nSo there *are* some advantages, and there is basically nobody catering to that at all, and that seems weird.  And I'm very curious if, given a real choice for an extended period of time, the viewing public would find it preferred 48fps and never look back.  Right now, we're not being given a choice, and just being *told* what we should like.\n\nEDIT: And it should be noted that modern TVs tend to insert extra ai-generated frames anyway.  Cinephiles all know to turn that functionality off because it ruins the directors' intent, but tv manufacturers wouldn't include that functionality in the first place and leave it on by default if it weren't selling TVs.  It's a suggestion, at least, that the quiet majority buy it because they think it looks better, even if they don't know why.  That's signal that it seems like creators should be paying attention to.",

They may not notice its absence at the theater, but I suspect if they had a choice between the two they'd pick the smoother one there too.  They might not know why they like it more, but again: if everyone had a choice, I have a strong suspicion that the market would push us all towards higher frame rates.  We're not being given a choice, except on TVs which add smoothing.  And there, we're choosing smoothing.",

LCDs still have all the normal LCD issues. \n\nThe current \"thing\" is HDR. For most people this means displays that can compete with ambient light while still maintaining contrast, and also not having color banding in dark, low contrast scenes. Also your TV can flashbang you I guess. \n\nWide color gamut is the other thing that displays still haven't managed to cap out on. \n\nI'd also expect 3D to come back once someone figures out how to make a glasses-less 3D display. Also collapsible TVs might be a thing at some point, since big TVs are kind of an eyesore when you aren't watching them.",

      "body": "Somewhat of an expert in this area.\n\nThis isn't really new. The reason this hasn't been commercialized has always been cost and scale. The article doesn't really talk about the technology but presumably they made some improvements to the manufacturing process. It is just another incremental step. Nobody has found an easy way to place millions of LEDs in a way that is cost effective enough consumers could afford it, yet.\n\nSony has shown earlier versions of this. I believe it was called Crystal LED and was shown at CES. Samsung similarly has been showing \"The Wall\" microLED TV for years. \n\nBelieve it or not this tech has been around even longer than that. The massive displays you see in stadiums? Direct RGB LEDs just like this. It has just been prohibitively expensive to scale for general consumers. The way in which the image is generated is actually much simpler than LCD.\n\nThis is also the same thing as microLED technology by some definitions. I like that they aren't using the term microLED because there are actually 2 very different types of display that have both been called \"microLED\" and it gets confusing. They are differentiated by their manufacturing process. This display and Samsung's \"The Wall\" (marketed as \"microLED\") transfer millions of microLEDs from a wafer and spread them out over the display. Apple was also working on microLED displays for their devices (sadly no longer) and their tech would also fall under this first category. The second type of microLED display (which I personally think should retain the \"microLED\" name) leaves the microLEDs tightly packed on the wafer and directly bonds them to a backplane. This second type of microLED is for very tiny displays (even smaller than a watch) that will likely be used in future AR glasses. \n\nThere is no official definition of how small the LED has to be before it is called a \"microLED\". Even relatively small microLEDs only a few microns wide are plenty bright for a TV. The main thing that dictates the microLED size in these large format displays is cost, not performance. Bigger LEDs use more material and thus cost more. There are some papers out there that estimate based on cost even large TVs like this will probably need to use microLEDs about 10 microns wide (or less) to be meet the bottom line.\n\nPerformance wise it will beat (or tie) LCD and OLED in just about every way. Brightness, contrast, efficiency, lifetime, viewing angle, refresh rate etc will all be better. Color purity is debatable and really depends on the LEDs used. But it will cost you.",
