      "body": "From the article: This remarkable feat has been running successfully for an astonishing eight years without a single battery replacement, as detailed by the creator, Glubux, on the online forum Second Life Storage.\n\nThe setup is housed in a somewhat unassuming shed 50 meters (164 feet) away from the individual's residence, but its purpose is anything but ordinary. It combines old laptop batteries with solar panels to create an off-grid power supply, essentially turning a pile of e-waste into a sustainable energy solution.\n\nDespite the unconventional nature of this system, there have been no reports of fire hazards or swollen battery issues throughout its nearly decade-long operation. In fact, Glubux claims he can power his entire house from it, including the washing machine.\n\nThe project's origins can be traced back to November 2016, when the creator shared his initial plans on the forum. At the time, he had already begun producing part of his electricity needs with a modest 1.4kW solar panel array, an old 24V 460Ah forklift battery, charge controllers, and a 3kVA inverter.\n\nHowever, Glubux aimed to expand his setup by constructing a dedicated shed to house additional batteries and charge controllers/inverters. He had already amassed around 650 laptop batteries and had started sorting and assembling them into packs, each designed to hold approximately 100Ah by carefully matching the number of cells and using copper wiring for efficient connections.",

Most laptop batteries and electric vehicle batteries are still pretty useful for stationary power despite being too degraded for EV use. He will probably get several more years out of this system but I would be curious to see how much he\u2019s actually able to store relative to the initial capacity. \n\nThat being said, unless you really know what you\u2019re doing you should not try to do this at home. The potential for thermal runaway is extremely high. That\u2019s the whole reason why this person put it in a shed 50 meters from their house.",

The same can be said about powering a computer (relatively).\n\nI was asking if these high power processes are the reason why these batteries don't work for their original purpose but can work in this scenario for other things like powering lights.\n\nThe question about linear vs parallel connections was asking if the batteries are all connected linearly where the power would be running through each battery (as so defeat the proposed benefit in the first part of the question where the power requirements are significantly higher, if applicable)\n\nor\n\nWhether they are in parallel so that the batteries provide the same amount of power but don't need to conduct the power provided by the upstream batteries. It's the difference between plugging your phone into your laptop to charge it (linear and so potentially more strain on the laptop's battery) vs plugging your phone into a different outlet (avoid extra strain on your laptop battery).\n\nAs you can see, the last part of the question is more complex and I doubt I would be able to appreciate the answer since I've only had introductory courses in electrical circuits so I said they can ignore it that last part of the question.",

You basically need to test capacity of each little battery a bunch of different times and sort them and then sort them again.  Then finally assemble the battery and charge it in a some what specific way so the battery charges evenly and no one cell is stressed.  After that, the BMS does most of the heavy lifting keeping the batteries charged and balanced.\n\nWhat's also important to note here is this setup is extremely basic.  It would not meet the needs for the vast majority of people.  1.4kW solar setup is TINY.  Not to mention, these DIY batteries are also quite small.\n\nThis setup would work for someone who gets a lot of sun and has a VERY low demand.  I have serious doubts that this could even run a small heat pump/AC unit.",
