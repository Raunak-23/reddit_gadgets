They were using 4 year old architecture in order to increase margins which was pretty underpowered compared to available hardware with better efficiency. They sold each console with a decent margin of 14%. The console and dock itself only cost them $167 to make. They could eaten up the 14% margin and ended up with a better processor which by far the worst aspect it had. They made a ton of money on games that they never drop in price. So yes there is a point of view to critic them but that is just the general opinion. 85billion was made on the switch including its games. 75 billion would also be nice and we would get a more future proof handheld console",

Ideally it should be used only 4k modes with the user having an option to turn on a 1080p performance mode that doesn't use it.",

I might not be neck deep in tech standards but Hall effect sticks seem like a relatively recent thing (ie after Switch 1 developmental period). It might've been possible with a hardware refresh but who knows what development costs would have to go into it.\n\nI have a controller with Hall effect sticks, that I bought specifically for after learning they existed at all, but it's 3rd party. I would almost expect Nintendo to advertise them for being the first (correct me if I'm wrong) first-party controller to have Hall effect sticks.",

                      "body": "So after all the backlash around the joy cons last gen and the EU also addressing it, Nintendo offered free repairs to all joy cons indefinitely. That was probably more cost effective than going back to the drawing board and releasing a 2.0 model. When Nintendo started to offer repairs, I think it's safe to say people might have expected a redesign where this happens less frequently. Because compared to any other controller, joy cons were reported to drift very quickly using the same tech.\n\nNow I'm not saying at the time they would have started to offer hall effect, because like you said it's relatively new (at least as far as I am aware), but why do joy cons drift so much sooner than their pro controller, the PlayStation controllers and the Xbox who all use pentominner sticks.\n\nSo since they never did a redesign, they clearly didn't think there was anything to change. By saying \"hey we changed the tech in the joy con 2 so these won't drift as much\" you're going to have a big crowd of people who will say \"why didn't you offer this last gen\".",

By saying \"hey we changed the tech in the joy con 2 so these won't drift as much\" you're going to have a big crowd of people who will say \"why didn't you offer this last gen\".\n\nThat's the thing though, they don't have to say \"new tech to fix the old problems\" they just have to market it as \"this is fancy new technology\" and pretend to be forerunners of the tech. The people who'd complain about it not being offered are going to complain regardless, and your average consumer probably would probably understand \"this wasn't really a thing back then but it is now\" over \"maybe we could've but it would've cost lots of money and development time\".\n\nBut I suppose saying nothing is the safest option for brand protection so who am I to argue lol.\n\n\nTangent but I've been meaning to learn more about the technical side of things; I've always wondered if it's feasible to have some module to swap out analogs for in existing systems but I doubt it's translatable without some major hardware/programming changes (at least from what I've gleaned in my work experience).",

You can move it into favorite types of bread, how to make bread, how to use bread, anything that still relates to bread, because you\u2019re simply narrowing down a general topic.

I narrowed it down to the 5090, because their wording did not apply to that one. You then ignored the 90 and went on about the 80 and 70, which doesn\u2019t follow what I said.

The most prominent one being that the 5070 is just as powerful as a 4090, for $500 MSRP (a fraction of the cost). If this were true, that would be AMAZING. Well, if I recall correctly (someone correct me if I\u2019m wrong), the 5070 actually performs WORSE than last gen\u2019s budget card, while all of those extra frames come\u00a0from DLSS. DLSS is very good in many instances, allowing us to play games at higher frame rates than the card is capable of running by itself\u2026 but there can be too much DLSS. So, when you turn it off, we find that the card runs games at a single digit frame rate. Yes, single digit on modern hardware, whereas its predecessor could get playable frame rates on the same games without DLSS.\u00a0In fact, the entire 5000 series cards performs WORSE across the board on OLD games from the early 2000\u2019s because Nvidia removed PhysX. People are getting half the frame rate in games like boarderlands 2 on their $2000+ graphics card, when their old card ran it at double the speed. Eitherway, with the 5070 and DLSS,\u00a0the AI is doing so much that it causes severe ghosting\u2026 imagine driving a car in gta5, at half the frame rate as your old card, and everytime you go around a corner, your car splits into 5 versions of itself like a fan.\n\nNvidia basically false advertising.\u00a0",

(Edit: keep in mind this is whithin the context of many consoles trying to force V-sync, even if they cant hold that v-sync framerate, which also massively increases latency)\n\nIts why most 60hz tvs have \u201cmotion smoothing\u201d for 24fps movies. Because otherwise you end up with a 3:2 pull down, which looks like stutter (I personally always turn motion smoothing off, as I think it looks awful, and I have a 120hz tv which does divide evenly into 24fps).\n\nYes screen tearing is also caused by a mismatch between the monitor framerate and GPU target, but I didnt mention it as the word \u201cscreen tearing\u201d is technical jargon that the average street person doesn\u2019t know. \n\nIf I told my mom \u201cg-sync matches the GPU framerate to the monitor, this improves uneven frame-pacing, and removes image tearing\u2026.. however make sure you cap your framerate to 5fps below your monitors refresh rate to stay within the monitors refresh rate, this also keeps latency lower in a similar way to nvidia reflex\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026 my moms response would be \u201cmatch the what to the what now, it makes the game tear less? Whats a tear?\u201d. \n\nWhere as if I just say \u201cit make game look smoother\u201d, then thats a simple enough explanation. And on a handheld like switch 2, the console will automatically handle all the g-sync settings. So the technical breakdown and jargon will just confuse many console players.",

You'd be expecting to run 30+W on Orin for that.\n\nIt looks like they actually might have held out for Thor and using Blackwell. Especially if they are boasting Ray Tracing.
