Samsung is looking at folding tech because a phone/tablet may be that disruptive bit.   Apple are looking at VR tech, because they think THAT will be the disruptive tech.  EVERYONE is looking at AI because a lot of people think THAT will be the disruptive bit.\n\nWho knows, but for now, phones are definitely a mostly mature tech.",

In no way do I want to double the complexity of these phones all so you have something to show off.  A single fold for me is perfect. Having 3 panels is not only overkill but adds to the complexity.  No one talks about the failure rate of Huawei's 3 panel phones because no one wants to admit they have a device that isn't fully baked.   What I would rather have is a rolling device, not a folding one.  But that it 3-10 years off still.",
