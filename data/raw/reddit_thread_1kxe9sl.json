The voting systems ensures what is popular with the users is repeated and regurgitated, and what is not gets downvoted to hell and never actually seen. Try sorting most comment sections by \"controversial\" and your whole outlook will change.\n\n*REDDIT* hates AI. But a lot of younger people, and non-tech people *LOVE* AI.

All it says is:\n\n>I'd use it. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nNothing inflamatory. On topic. No profanity. Just a user sharing their personal opinion that they would use the button. And downvoted to the bottom of the comment chain because it's not what reddit wants to hear. So people won't see it. Downvoting opinions that go against what you believe, or want to believe, does not make those opinions go away. You just stop seeing it.

I see this has both a flaw and a strength of reddit. I don't think I would get rid of it in its current form though. Look at youtube. There is a upvote and downvote button, but only the upvote does anything visible and they hide the number of downvotes. So what's the point of those buttons at all if all you can do is validate videos and comments? On the other side of that Reddit coin, very often posts and comments that are not in line with the groupthink are essentially removed by downvoting it. Thus not allowing alternative ideas. Hell, even moderators enforce certain narratives whether political or whatever in their individual Subs. Now that I don't agree with. I think it should be free discussion on whatever topic unless you're really really crossing the line.",

                              "body": "He's right, though.  Facebook and Google are primarily ad companies.  They sell ads.  Users consume the ads.  Facebook and Google data mine user information, then also sell that.  To other ad companies.\n\nThis is exactly why Facebook and Google are such shit these days.  For example, Google doesn't want to give you relevant search results.  It wants you to view as many ads as possible.  From their perspective, they'll make more money if the first link isn't what you want.  Google has ads within the search results, but then Google is usually the main ad provider on any site they link to as well.  So, you search, get ads with your results, click a link, load a page with more ads, don't find what you want, go back to google, get served more ads, clink another link, get served more ads, etc.  The more time you spend on Google, the more money they make from ad revenue.\n\nGoogle is able to do this because they essentially have a monopoly in the search space.  If the space was competitive, they'd have to actually provide a good product.  The space isn't competitive, so they don't.  It's why I use Bing, even though it's not much better.  (Duck Duck Go and all other non-paid search engines just use a combination of Google and Bing.  You aren't escaping them unless you're paying a subscription to something like Kagi.)",

                      "body": "I've got one of those great cameras. For the few times a year I plan ahead to bring it to a place where I intentionally plan to be near photogenic things or activities that I want to really take a bunch of high quality pictures for, it takes great photos. Then it goes back onto the shelf. The overwhelming majority of photos I take are the ones I take with the almost-as-good camera I keep in my pocket 24/7. It's too easy to whip it out. As it's coming out of my pocket I'm double-tapping the power button and by the time I'm holding it in front of my face I'm snapping 1, 2, 3 pictures. Capturing a moment before it disappears. The high end one with big lenses takes amazing photos but it's almost never around when I just want to capture a moment.\n\nIt's a no-brainer to spend $1000 on the latest pixel with a really great camera vs a $400 basic dumb phone with potato camera. And $600 certainly can't buy all that much high end standalone camera when you talk about the price of a single lens being that much (or more).\n\nOh and also, with the standalone camera, not only do I have to plan ahead to bring it and get it out in time to take the pics I want, now I can't share the photos with anyone til I can get a chance to get back home, load the SD card into the computer, file through the photos, upload them to some self-managed file server I maintain, etc. I just came back from fiji a week ago and all my stand alone camera footage and really fantastic looking drone footage is still sitting on SD cards waiting for me to have a free evening to mess with it. Meanwhile I was sharing photos taken from my phone with family members while I was still actively on the trip. If I drop my phone into the water, everything has already been backed up to the cloud so no worries. I was sweating bullets when passed my drone through customs, hoping they wouldn't muck with my SD card and losing it as they pilfered through my luggage. It would have been awful to have taken all that great footage and lost it. I didn't have space to lug a laptop and external hard drive along with me (and didn't really have the time to want to sit and manage backing the data up). The phone is just quietly doing it all for me in the background.",

Nobody gives a shit what you're doing minute to minute. But again, you have your cheaper phone to get that dopamine hit if you really need it.\n\nI have family who lives 3 hours away. They like to be a part of my and my kids lives. When I can take a photo of my kid doing something goofy before school and send it to my family members on the way out the door, they get to feel included. Later after the kids get home from school and they call grandma and grandpa on the portal, they get to joke about the goofy thing the kid was doing that morning. They can encourage my daughter to not be nervous for the play she's putting on at school the next day. I can record her performance and send it to the family as it's happening. They can celebrate her wins with her, while it's happening to her, not weeks later when dad finally gets a chance to dump his SD card. Technology lets us stay connected. Sharing doesn't just refer to social media.\n\nI also just enjoy photography as a hobby, and it's important to me to preserve the photos I take. Generally speaking it's easier to maintain my photo collection with a phone than a camera and computer. I do both, but the phone is just easier and my life is busy.\n\nI lived with a potato phone for a long time. I sat through enough forced moments where I had to get everyone to stay still while the camera did its thing, or just missed moments entirely because they passed before the camera app was ready for me. An always-available camera just works better for me.\n\n> It sounds like you need this the same way I do, because apparently you can't stay away from your phone. I have that same issue, it's addicting this hell, so I'm having to set up inconveniences to try and make my life better and spend more quality time with my kids rather than a light box that brings no real joy.\n\nI spend very little time on my phone. I keep it in my pocket so I can communicate when needed, especially as it pertains to my job. Because it's already there, it means the camera it comes with is my most commonly relied-upon one. Sorry to hear you struggle with keeping away from yours, if using a cheaper one helps you with that I don't see any problem with that approach. Especially if it helps you stay more involved with your family.",

But that particular person would have to have no ambition or imagination. I can't even picture what somebody who can't even think of a single way, not any single way, that their phone could be better would be like.

I would hate to have to drag that around wherever I went.\u00a0\n\nWhat do you mean by drag that around?

There's no reason why you have to limit yourself to what is possible or widespread today. You're talking *perfect* remember, not just contemporary.",

I'd say 9 years is certainly a good run.\n\n>So I just get a ROKU or some other external device that handles this service for me.\n\nThis is just outsourcing the problem though. Your Roku can also be out of date and then you need to buy another Roku/other similar stick.\n\nYou can do the same with a smart TV: Use it til it's out of date and then just buy a new stick and use it as a \"dumb\" TV.",

We can\u2019t have computer scientists working as translators to tell the AI what we want it to do. Hell, translating one language to another is done better with an LLM, because an LLM understands context. \n\nWhen it comes to utility, the lines are blurry, as there are many practical applications to generative AI. And that\u2019s before getting into how much easier it makes finding information when it comes to research. \n\nThis idea that generative AI has no practical applications is what I\u2019m arguing against.",

I think it's pretty important we don't let that work because it's important to be able to identify which one you are using and what the pros and cons are so that you use them more effectively. Someone being told they have a new AI to, say, sort comments as positive and negative from their product postings online, and they assume that it is powered by an LLM they may be concerned about copyright or electricity use or hallucinations when they really should be concerned about confidence stats and accuracy percentage because it's just an entirely different product. It's the same way that it matters if someone knows if some app is using your camera or your microphone or both. the hand-waviness that these VC companies do is leading to the large drop in technical literacy in our population. They want us to hand wave this stuff so we stop knowing it and they can sell that knowledge back to us. I am not a fan of this and push back where I can.\u00a0",
