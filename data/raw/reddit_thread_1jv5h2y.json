Traditionally they have gone for the value market so $450 is huge for a Nintendo console, but it's not the most expensive one out now so they can be a little more confident in their pricing without seeming cocky.

I think they will to some extent because they're in the same position as PS4 in not wanting to immediately trash a huge install base and launching in a weird economic situation, but we already have the new Mario Kart and Donkey Kong being Switch 2 exclusives, and (as far as I know since I haven't been keeping complete track) no new first-party games announced that will be cross gen, only confirming that ones that were already announced for Switch 1 like Metroid will be getting upgrades for S2. And he very specifically didn't say you could play the same games but instead made a point to say you could experience the same characters and worlds.",

And suffice to say, a lot of us could not afford \"599 US dollars\" in 2006 for the upgrade.\n\nProduction of the PS2 did not end till 2013. That's not a typo: twenty-thirteen! I imagine Nintendo would be all too happy to keep producing the original Switch for as long, if people are willing to still buy it. And since the new game sharing feature on the Switch 2 works with the original Switch, they will have new value.\n\nThat all said, maybe Nintendo should introduce a price cut for the original switch. And a physical copy of Mario Kart World should not cost $90. That's a much bigger threat than Switch 2 launching at $450.",

The entertainment options we have today are not the same as the ones available during the Great Depression, there isn\u2019t any reason at all to think they\u2019d have comparable costs. Despite that, even $80 for a game is pretty cheap when you look at what they used to cost and inflation. If a game is going to have 20 hours of playtime and it costs $80 then you\u2019re just paying $4 per hour of playtime. For longer games the deal is even better. And the cost of entertainment being low during the Great Depression was partly a consequence of the depression, there was less consumer spending so theaters, for example, had to charge less to continue to operate at all. \n\nAnd entertainment isn\u2019t expensive, just the entertainment that you personally want is. There are inexpensive entertainment options, they\u2019re just less entertaining because they aren\u2019t luxury goods. \n\nYou are all spoiled to think that video games are the only product that needs to forever cost the exact same nominal amount regardless of how the economy shifts or how the product changes.",

No OLED screen on launch. $80 games for no reason (even in other countries that do not have tarriffs).\n\nIn a lot of ways, it's the same thing.

People that get defensive over faceless corporations. Those people 100% exist. I\u2019ve seen them, and talked to them, and read their opinions. And they show bias, like in my example before about how Nintendo made a statement about customers sticking with the old console if they don\u2019t or can\u2019t get the new one. When Xbox said that, it was a mistake and people pointed to it as a reason the console didn\u2019t sell. Nintendo making a similar statement could also cost them in the same way. To think that it won\u2019t or can\u2019t shows denial/bias toward one company. Which is fine like I said earlier, it\u2019s the white knighting and getting defensive over it that\u2019s the weird part. I hope the Switch 2 sells like hotcakes, it\u2019s still dumb to make a statement that justifies *staying put* with your old one. And then weird to keep defending their moves like its nbd, because there is evidence from previous companies where talking like that hurt their bottom line.

We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2 price point. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so people still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.",

It won't come close to Xbox One but the world is a very different place from 2017 economy wise and this company needs to get a reality check. Having weaker hardware is fine but this excessively aggressive behavior towards its own customers has always rubbed me the wrong way. From the way their games rarely go on sale, disdain for fan projects, their stance against legal emulation, their pay walled text chat, exorbitant new first party prices. The only thing going for them is the games are good but at what point will they cross the threshold for how much their games can cover for their PR. I desperately hope they cross it with this launch.",

Good dripfeed content is rather enjoyable to me.\n\nFew games are worth their price nowadays imo. The Zelda games typically are to me, but that doesn't apply for all games.
