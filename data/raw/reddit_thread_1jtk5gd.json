It\u2019s still safer for AMD to sell it as an non-XT though as any large scale RMAs would both cost a lot and be bad PR",

I wouldn't assume that any 9070 you buy will be stable flashed as a 9070xt, but I suspect most every 9070 has some disabled cores that are functional.\n\nHopefully AMD doesn't disable the feature for consumers, it's bad for business if Dell & OEM can get more than they paid for (and make the cards appear less reliable in the process), but if a consumer with a bit of knowledge and skill can squeeze out a bit extra it may well be worth the good will.\n\nYou just have to gate the process behind some technical skill which leaves a record to prevent warranty abuse. An easily cuttable lead or resistor would do it.\n\nEdit: it's just clocks and not cores. That said what is the actual process used to disable chunks of silicon?",
