TPMv2.0 standards were created and released by the TCG (not Microsoft) in 2015. Microsoft doesn't just release stuff in a vacuum. They work with their partners to give full warning when they will require new things or drop support. \n\n>Microsoft has a responsibility to provide either a viable upgrade path\n\nThey have. You can upgrade for free.",

If they were serious requirements then you couldn't use stuff like custom ISOs (e.g. via Rufus) or the IoT Enterprise/LTSC editions to bypass them and obtain fully functional and performant Windows installations.\n\nContrast this with e.g. how Linux distros work, they also have an EoL but subsequent versions usually do not have insane requirement jumps, and when they (very rarely) do, there are alternatives. E.g. most distros dropped 32bit support (but unlike W11-incompatible hardware, PCs with 32bit CPUs are absolutely rare nowadays, and are usually extremely weak for today's use cases), but some like Debian still support it.\n\nMS has obtained a near-monopoly on \"everyday\" PC operating systems, so they absolutely have a (moral, but this really should be legal too) responsibility to make sure they don't force a rather large number of their users to either shell out money (and make needless e-waste) for a new PC when the preceding one is still perfectly functional or to run an insecure OS.",

ESUs are also not free, and get prohibitively more expensive every year. \n\n\n\n>In the past they released emergency updates to long EOL XP due to massive botnet attacks.

They also did that because the attack vector was SMBv1 and was easy to backport to other versions. \n\nIf a vulnerability only exists on an EoL system, or the patch would be too difficult to backport, it is INCREDIBLY unlikely that they will release more patches.",

In this case, it's not possible.  The TPM and CPU instruction requirements between 10 and 11 are a massive deterrent.  You need to stop asking yourself about the total time the OS is supported and look at how old the hardware that is supported is.  That's what matters to most people.  If I bought a PC 5 years ago, can I use it with the latest OS now?  With Linux and BSD, the answer is yes.  With windows, it depends. \n\nEnd users didn't get 10 years with Windows 10 across the board.  Most bought it after it came out.  Their total support time is much less. \n\nI've only seen one occasion that FreeBSD failed on a newer version with a PC that was less than 5 years old.  The CPU had a defective instruction.  It could have been RMA'd if done in the first year or two of ownership, too.

Not even MacOS supports security updates for longer than 7 years. \n\nBeyond that, for the majority of users it doesn't change their experience in the slightest. Windows 10 will continue to work just fine on their PC's. It just won't receive new updates beyond the end of life date. The histrionics about it being a \"shitty customer experience\" are wildly off base with reality considering Windows security updates (the thing that is ending) are one of the single most complained about things by users of Windows 10.\n\nI'm calling out the unrealistic expectations of unlimited updates and support for outdated products that have already been supported far longer than industry average. People just love to complain whenever a company doesn't provide them with free dedicated support and updates for 20+ years on a software product they paid very little for ($20-30 in the case of buying a pre-built PC, $100 or less for most who purchased their own license separately).",

You\u2019re still potentially vulnerable to zero day exploits even when the operating system is actively receiving updates. Windows Defender still will continue to receive regular improvements for its active screening since it is cloud connected and shares this new data across Windows versions. \n\nThe only change will be that if a new vulnerability in windows itself is discovered, it will not receive a security patch (unless it\u2019s particularly major, in which case they\u2019ll release one patch once every 1-3 years as has happened with older Windows versions) and you will rely on Windows Defender or 3rd party antivirus software to prevent an attacker from executing code that utilizes this vulnerability. This is identical to how it currently works for zero day or recently discovered security vulnerabilities. \n\nA vocal minority (or even majority) of consumers disliking the newer product is not a compelling argument to forcibly extend support for the older product that has already been supported longer than anyone else supports similar products. I\u2019m personally not a fan of the data collection in Windows 10 or the vast expansion of data collection in Windows 11, but the push should be for them to fix the problems with the current product rather than keep something outdated on life support a little bit longer when the vast majority of security improvements (the Windows Defender active screening capabilities) are still going to be delivered for W10 users even after the W10 end of life.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm not saying that Windows 11 is a perfect or good product here. I'm just trying to provide a voice of reason since this article is nothing but rage bait over something that has been planned for years by now, is beyond industry standard levels of support, and is something that will not at all change the user experience for 95% or more of people on Windows 10 computers except by no longer having Windows update annoyances. \n\nIt's not perfectly ideal for consumers, but it's better than what literally anyone else provides and the actual impact to the vast majority is virtually non-existent.",

Just wait and save up your money and buy one yourself. My gaming computer is over 10 years old and still works just fine for most games. Going with Linux soon because even if I wanted to (I don't, Microsoft can keep their garbage spyware operating system) my computer can't update because it doesn't have that chip needed. \n\nLinux Mint seems like a decent one to try out first for most users, then branch out from there. It's supported and free. Just start looking/researching it for yourself.",

The people desperately clinging to the previous iteration aren\u2019t going to leave the platform any time soon. Rather, they will be forced to upgrade for security reasons, or they\u2019ll buy a new computer at some point that already has the new version installed, they\u2019ll complain and grumble and slowly figure out how to work around the changes, and then the whole cycle repeats 10 years later. \n\nIt\u2019s just not feasible to maintain 100% backwards compatibility with every release, and there are frankly not nearly enough power users to cater to the ones who care. \n\nBusiness graduates understand that they effectively have a captured market and there\u2019s little benefit to maintaining the previous versions. It\u2019s akin to every time Facebook made a layout change and everyone lost their minds. People complained, some people installed browser extensions to force the old layout, eventually everyone moves on, and then it happens again when the next change occurs. The difference these days is that SAAS products (like social media platforms/facebook) have learned to/are able to make changes slowly, almost continuously from point A untilto point point B and the users won\u2019t notice or complain. But a desktop OS with limited capacity to force incremental changes aren\u2019t in the same position, so they just deal with the vocal power users by letting them vent in their tech blogs that only get read by other power users.",

Falling back to CLI because some advanced feature wasn\u2019t implemented in GUI is still far too common, and backend implementations like the Xorg/Wayland thing and the QT/GTK split cause weird quirks that essentially require the user to know about the technical implementation of the GUI to understand the behavior of the OS.\n\nOf course, one may argue that more users could change the game, but there\u2019s a major asterisk there. What\u2019s needed isn\u2019t really more users but more money to hire more developers, and because Linux distributions are generally free for end-users, more users does not necessarily mean more money.\n\nIn fact, I would be quite surprised if even 1% of the userbase that switches because their hardware is over seven years old and they don\u2019t want to pay for new hardware that would give a better experience are suddenly going to turn around and pay or donate enough to make a meaningful dent (like say, >$100/year) in hopes of funding development to make a better experience viable in the future.\n\nApple has shown that making a well-funded customer-focused desktop environment as a minority OS vendor is absolutely possible, but also that the secret sauce to make that financially viable is essentially to convince users that they should pay more money to not use Windows. Linux is doing that on the server side (just look at something like RHEL server SaaS pricing), but doesn\u2019t seem to have any idea how to get there on the consumer side.",

          "body": "So I made the hop about 4 years ago, and it's been pretty great overall. Some fiddling for some things, but there are very few programs I have missed, because everything either runs great with Wine, has a Linux native version, or has a great alternative.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you make the jump, there are a few things I'd recommend:\u00a0\n\n\nDISTRO:\n\n\n- Pop OS or Kubuntu. Both are great, though I prefer Kubuntu. The nice thing about Pop OS is that it handles Nvidia Drivers on install without issues. Kubuntu does that now too, to be fair. If you like\u00a0Windows-style UI (as opposed to OSX) i'd suggest Kubuntu, as Pop uses an OSX style display unless you fiddle with it\n\n\nSETUP:\n\n\n- While setting up the OS, there are a few things it makes you do. One of the more confusing ones is setting up drive partitions. I made a ton of choices that I lived to eventually regret at first, so to save some trouble, a mini guide is:\n\n\n- ~100 GiB to Root (/) this is the actual OS\n\n\n- ~32 GiB to Swap (/swap) this is virtual RAM. Useful at times.\n\u00a0\n- As much as possible for home (/home)\n\n\n\n- Recommended sizes for everything else. The main point of this setup is that, by separating root and home, if you want to change Distro at any point, you can just overwrite Root and keep all your personal data and settings, which are stored in /home (or other sub partitions, if for example you want a separate documents partition, /home/documents)\n\n\nPROGRAMS:\n\n\n- There are a bunch of programs that won't quite work as well on Linux as Windows, but there are ways of making some work. Others have great replacements. First I'll say some really useful programs:\n\n\n- Lutris: works with Wine to manage windows programs, makes it easy to configure them and run them. Most of the time. Make sure your wine is Wine64, not Wine32. That's easy to look up.\u00a0\n\n\n- Steam: obviously steam is the fucking best. I want to note that most games that don't have Linux versions can still be played. The website http://protondb.com/ is great for checking what works well. To run a non-linux game, go into the game configuration, comparability settings, and tick the \"enable comparability\" box. This enables Proton, which makes 90% of games run flawlessly.\u00a0\n\n\n- Libre office: Replacement for MS office. Works great, mostly.\u00a0\n\n\n- KDE programs: The people who make KDE make a ton of programs that are amazing. Some are out of the box, some you need to download. They're all great. Some are even extremely popular on windows, like Krita\n\n\n- Thunderbird: the best email client out there, better than Outlook even on Windows. Made by Mozilla.\u00a0\n\n\n- Gimp: decent Photoshop alternative. Photoshop is still king, but actively breaks itself on Linux even with Wine every update.\u00a0\n\n\n- Firefox: just because fuck chrome.\u00a0\n\n\nTIPS\n\n\n- Linux can seem pretty scary at first. I promise you that it's not though. The terminal becomes your friend after a while, but even now I run into things I don't know how to do, mostly when trying to do something new or weird. Most people will barely need to use it.\u00a0\n\n\n- Google Everything. If you don't understand something, somebody else had a hard time already too. The answer is out there.\u00a0\n\n\n- Don't be afraid of Chat GPT.\u00a0 Sometimes Google sucks. Chat GPT is great at filtering complex weird niche questions and gets you an answer most of the time that Google doesn't work. This is one of the few things that it's genuinely good at.\n\n\n- Many people don't like to use snap or flatpak. They suck for most things, and many prefer to install everything from .deb files if available.\u00a0 However, snaps and flatpaks bundle all dependencies and everything together, so they won't break if something on your system changes. Feel free to use them, but they can get frustrating if you become more of a power user.\u00a0",

XDA? This seems to be a rather generic statement about recycling your old computer after buying a new one? Or maybe doing a trade in for a discount of some sort? Where does it say \"trade in their PC for a newer one?\" XDA had me all excited to read about Microsoft sending people emails pretending like it's easy to just swap your PC out for a newer one. Alas, with the context that this writer included themselves: it seems much less interesting than the title made me think.\n\nHonestly this is a tumblr post poorly disguised as tech news.

Just a waste of click.\n- mouse cursor disappeared once for no reason. CtrlAltDel made it come back. \n- File Explorer doesn't want to move a couple of my folders. Says it's locked by an application. No details.\n- Some actions have been isolated from the others, like \"rename\" in the file context menu and I don't get the point.\n- My universal USB3 dock which stopped working one month ago because of an automatic update, still not works (no display). \n\nThe only thing cool with Windows 11 from an end-user perspective was Android integration, but you know what? they ditched it last month.\n\nAll in all, my i7 with 16Go and a bunch of cores somehow gives me the same feeling of sluggishness that my first Linux PC in 1997 with 16Mo of RAM. Knowing that a bunch of fully useful computers are trashed for nothing ... again ... because of the Intel/Microsoft duopoly, hurts my values.\n\nSpeaking of Linux, I agree that it's not 100% ready for office work, but from my point of view, neither is Microsoft.",

Someone with money and time could make a business buying up hardware and reselling them with a Linux distro that matches the user experience level. Take it a step further and offer to import the Steam games that are compatible but also let them know which ones might not be, which is more likely going to be because of video card specifications for than either Windows or Linux compatibility. For what Microsoft said it's worth, it's worth repurposing to make something awesome out of on the cheap.\n\nMS is way out of touch with reality, people aren't going to want to replace good computers, vendors aren't going to accept outdated systems in a trade in unless it was for this very purpose, and I'm not suggesting scamming people with repurposed lemons, but people will buy systems that will work for their specific needs and don't want the bloat and BS of MS. Sure, it might be a new learning curve, but if the alternative is Windows 11, resistance to change is futile, just pick something that works and doesn't cost extra.\n\nI can think of a bunch of uses for dedicated computers for audio. A guitarist could just want to record or use VST effects on the simple end, but if the user wants to pay for software licenses, you could set them up a whole digital audio workstation. If they're new to DAW's, Reaper might be a good way to go, though a lot of others are mostly compatible. They all should be, but 3rd party VST licensing activations are slightly problematic. Most VST work as long as they are self-contained and can use registration codes instead of authenticators. I'd be slightly worried about my licenses for software restricted to one device, might need to deactivate licenses for Windows to reactivate them in Linux, but I'll stop there because I'll end up getting too technical for a gadget thread, turning the gadget into DAW. Plenty of topics on that subject.",

It doesn't matter that greeflation is up, wages are down, recession is here and cost of living is through the roof. Ditch those working pcs, and capable hardware, go and support our new tech with useless crap you wont need and doesnt even work as its all just first gen tech!\n\nI learnt my lesson with windows 8/8.1... never again. W10 stays, my working hardware stays. I dont need AI and fake frames. My raytracing capable gpu and 32gb of ddr4 with 4790k still works fine. WOuld work even better if they actually optimised their games instead of pumping out 100gb of crap and wondering why people dont care for ti anymore. \n\nLike, if they wanted to serve the market w11 would be retro activly compatible with existing fully capable hardware from the last 10years. But it isnt because they want the market to ditch and upgrade and fuel their economy... contributing to waste....",
