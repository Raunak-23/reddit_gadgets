Now you can\n\n>Want touchpad macro / wheel menus on your PC with a controller? Now you can\n\nI've been doing this for nearly a decade with the original Steam Controller. \n\nIf they were making the \"Steam Controller 2\" then it would be an iteration of the Steam Controller. For example, largely the same form factor, 4 buttons on the back, higher refresh rate gyro, higher quality finish etc. \n\nBased on the 3D model from the Steam VR Files, Valve had basically taken the Steam Deck and removed the screen. I imagine a fairly large percentage of the people who buy this will already have a Steam Deck and will use it as their controller for when it's docked or they don't want to hold it as its fairly weighty, as it should have the exact same inputs in pretty much the same place.\n\nInstead of being the \"Steam Controller 2.0\" I see it as the \"Steam Deck Controller 1.0\", that can obviously also be used on PCs, but I feel that the main target audience and reason it's been made is because of the Steam Deck.",

The rest of what you said, I think is over thinking it.",
