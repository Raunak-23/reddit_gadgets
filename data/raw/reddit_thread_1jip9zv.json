There are people who will buy Nvidia no matter what they do, how they treat their customers, or how their cards perform compared to AMD. Even when AMD's cards were unquestionably better (back around the 7970 era) they still couldn't make much headway toward gaining market share in the GPU market. Even for their CPUs which are absolutely destroying Intel at this point there's still quite a few people who view AMD CPUs as being cheap knockoffs but the effect wasn't quite so extreme in that market since AMD did manage to make a lot of progress there.",

Since the 4080 super is an Nvidia card it still holds to my point of buying high-end means buying Nvidia or it\u2019s 7900 XTX which has a terrible upscaling solution using FSR 3.1. \n\nGreat to hear that AC shadows is one of the games that doesn\u2019t have a large difference in ray tracing performance, but a cadre of other games that are coming really want good hardware accelerated ray tracing performance. \n\n If you want to get a high-end GPU, you are stuck getting Nvidia whether it be a new or old Nvidia card or you\u2019re going to be getting an AMD card with some sort of sacrifice. The 9070 XT doesn\u2019t really come close to the 5080 performance in most scenarios though I still think it\u2019s a much better card since it has an actual reasonable price. The 7900 XTX is close enough to at least be comparable but it doesn\u2019t have a good upscaling solution and even if you get it 5090 you\u2019re going to need upscaling because games just demand it nowadays. \n\nLike AMD has done a lot of good stuff and if they launched a 9080 with comparable performance to a 5080 but with FSR four it would be my go to recommendation for anyone who\u2019s buying an xx80 tier of GPU, provided of course that the pricing is good.",

In that case there just isn\u2019t an offering that\u2019s comparable with the 5080 on the AMD side. The 9070XT seems like an incredible product but it\u2019s mid range and though it can brush close to 5080 level performance in some scenarios in most cases it\u2019s definitely a weaker card.",

                      "body": "Well, it\u2019s offering better performance than both last generation cards and all the high-end AMD offerings. Personally right now, I am playing assassins Creed shadows on my 4090 and getting roughly 50 frames per second at 4K DLSS 4 quality mode with everything on Max. Instead of playing it at that frame rate, I add frame generation to smooth things out. Yes there are some slight artefacts but in general the game feels similar to 90 FPS visually speaking and though there is some added latency it\u2019s not a whole lot and since I\u2019m playing with a controller, there\u2019s already going to be some latency. Multiframe generation isn\u2019t magic, of course not, and the way Nvidia markets it is ridiculous, but to me it would be a value added feature. If I had the 5090 instead of the 4090 and I could run the game at 60 FPS and then use multi frame generation to get it up to 240 which is the refresh rate of my monitor that would be a better experience than running the game at just 60 without it. I\u2019m not going to compare a real 240 and the frame generated 240 because they are not comparable. What I am going to do is look and see if my gameplay feels better with frame generation or multiframe generation which I feel like it does. I think Nvidia is manipulating the numbers to make it seem like they have far higher frame rates than they actually do but to me frame generation does add value.",

It's unfortunate that the mostly fixed driver issues with radeon was still a cloud hanging over their head, but the negative sentiment around this time was about price and availability for both brands, and very valid for a very large segment of the population.",

In these I locked the games to 30fps, kept the settings near maxed @1080p, and the scrolling/running/panning were noticeably smoothed out and I didn't mind some additional input lag.\n\nWhenever I tried LSFG with a FPS though, I quickly disabled it - they just *felt* so much worse to play despite the *visual* smoothness of looking around.\n\nFor funzies I played some Wacky Wheels, and old DOS cart racer that runs at 10-12fps, with LS set to Adaptive FG (60fps). It was a very surreal experience, like playing the game on hallucinogenics.\n\nI originally bought Lossless Scaling for the, well, lossless scaling functionality - integer scaling to use with lowres retro games so I could see their pixels in all their glory without interpolation from GPU or monitor getting in the way. So for me, all this \"FG\" stuff is just a bonus that was added later.\n\nI'll be getting a new PC by end of year, after MS drops support for Windows 10 (Win 11 won't take to my i7-920, lol), so right now I'm avoiding games my PC struggles with, both CPU and GPU wise. Plenty of games in the ol' backlog that I don't need any kind of framegen for performance boosting. Who knows, maybe I'll even get around to Skyrim (probably not).",
