And they had some of the most asinine bugs and flaws in them I have ever encountered.\n\nSome of my favorites: \n   \n\n* Oops the RX/TX packet count has rolled over to a number that is too large, so we crash the chip. (this means there is no way to make the card respond until you hard reboot boot.) This would result in your NIC just... not working. It would online/offline in the OS all day, and pretend everything was hunky dory! But never actually handle any packets at all.\n\nIt took about 12 hours to hit that packet count on a busy server. So imagine having to hard off/on your production servers.. every 12 hours, because the broadcom ports are all mentally deficient.\n\nThis also happened on routing/switching if it had this specific set of chips in it. Womp womp.\n\n* If you sent the right kind of packet fragments through, it would just.. disappear them into the void. It would also never tell the OS or the network anything about doing this. It really loved doing this on UDP data streams.\n\nGood luck figuring *that* out!\n\n* I'm sorry, this TCP packet is just too weird for us and we don't know what to do with it, so the NIC is going to hang for about 3 seconds and then resume operation. It's also not going to report any error codes to the OS or the network, ever.\n\nWe had done a full row of servers and routers and switches and about half of them had these chips in them, **IT WAS PURE INSANITY.**",

No? \n\nYou don't even know what you don't know.\n\nEdit: FYI to anyone reading this, the person here clearly has no idea what they are talking about because they also are not achieving 3.5Gbps between their NAS and their single 5Gbps capable PC because that is not how port aggregation works. No single stream can exceed the speed of one of the constituent members of the aggregation group. So if you have 4x 1GbE ports making up an LACP group on the NAS, the maximum bandwidth a single stream can acheive is 1GbE. \n\nThat this idiot goes on to claim they are getting more than that shows all we need to know. I didn't point this out originally because this was the least of the problems in the post and because it would be a waste of time, I've no doubt they'd immediately pivot to some bullshit about \"oh but no, I started 4 individual file copies!!!!\" and then I'd have to spend time educating them even further, only to be ignored by a complete rube.",

I'm sure there are people with a home SSD-based NAS, but...I don't think they're *that* common.\n\nWe'll use it eventually, it's not like a faster thing for cheaper is *bad*, but compared to existing options, it's not really that much extra utility for most home consumers. \n\nOf course, if you want to stream uncompressed 1080p60 video over your network, I guess this would be pretty useful.",

And 4k60 wouldn't be possible over 10Gb. \n\nI guess my point was mostly that we're getting into the realm of extremely niche (Home consumer. Enterprise, and even commercial gear has already had 10Gb for decades) use cases where this is useful.\n\nLike, someone asking \"if they need to upgrade their router or will the free router work\" absolutely doesn't need this. And frankly, I know several people who do have a home NAS or home server setups, and I don't think I know *anyone* who needs this.  That doesn't mean those people don't exist, but it's a pretty specific niche.\n\n\nAnd you're right, and I said as much: It's not that having better stuff for cheaper is bad. The fewer bottlenecks we need to wait to clear by the time we *do* need them, the better. It's just that...not a lot of people need to go run out and buy this right now.",

Do you want [some random reddit threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1ha5192/10_gbs_vs_1mbs_ethernet_speed/) where [people clearly](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/35lu2j/eli5_why_is_the_sata_iii_standard_6_gbs_needed_if/) make the distinction between [GB/s and Gb/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/is095z/why_is_it_called_sata_6gbs_if_its_slower_than_an/)?\n\nThe case matters. People will continue to read what you write as though case matters, and the entire reason you're getting corrected is because you said something that was misinterpreted, because you used the terms wrong, as judged by people reading things you wrote on the internet.\n\nI'll grant you, Gbps is more common, but Gb/s is still used a pretty decent amount in common internet parlance, and when dealing with such a technical subject, I'm not sure why you think the technical standard is an inappropriate definition.\n\n\n>Its not confusing, as you keep trying to make it out to be.\nRelax\n\nlol? Was there something about my single comment with two sentences of purely factual statements that lead you to think I was enraged? Why don't you relax and just take the L? It's pretty obvious you just got it wrong. It's fine.",

I also showed numerous examples of people having normal tech conversations on the internet clearly showing that they think that case matters.\n\nSo, I'll ask again: What evidence would you accept demonstrating that you're wrong, if it's apparently neither the actual technical standards for a technical unit, nor the actual usage of those units being distinguished in internet discussion?\n\n[Usage in the tech press?](https://www.bit-tech.net/news/tech/storage/sata-32/1/) Multiple different [versions of PCI-e being discussed with both units, when each is more applicable?](https://www.keysight.com/blogs/en/inds/2020/03/30/pcie-standards-what-you-need-to-know)\n\nAnd if there is no form of evidence that could be provided to indicate to you that you're wrong, maybe that's something to reflect on.\n\n>Pretty much any application that transfers files will display the speed in that format, always meaning bytes, not bits.\n\nWhat file transfer application have you ever seen using \"gb/s\" referring to gigabytes per second? They use GB/s, referring to gigabytes per second. Because everyone understands *case matters*. \n\nThey don't use gbps, you're right, because usually at the file-transfer level, they're not concerned with the bitrate. They're concerned with the data rate, which is measured in bytes per second. Applications aren't concerned with if the data on the wires are in 8b/10b, or 128/130b, they only care what the actual data they're receiving is.\n\nThis isn't necessarily implied when you're talking about the storage technologies, though. NVMe, running on PCI-e will talk about GT/s, GB/s and Gb/s, and those are all valid, but distinct.\n\n>Why don't you relax and just take the L? It's pretty obvious you just got it wrong. It's fine.\n\nExcept you have mustered no evidence in support of your argument. You're the only person who thinks that you're right, and you're just saying that you weren't wrong with no justification.",
