Plenty of physical games have updates. Generally a good thing cause if the disc had a bug or something its good to fix that bug. \n\nYou say chip too which confuses me. It looks you're playing on an ultrawide? Does the Switch (I'm assuming Switch cause that's the only chip-like game system I know of) support ultrawide?",

That includes phones and smartwatches even though they have done nothing for the battery life when other watches have way better batteries, are cheaper and come with about the same features because I believed in samsung. Now if they start paywalling things in their watches, it is only a matter of time before they do the same to other products.
