It doesn't have the factories, it doesn't have the worked knowledge, it doesn't have the refineries for the raw materials and in many cases, it doesn't even have the raw materials it would need in the ground. It also doesn't have 10 years to try to build all the infrastructure it would need to even be able to produce this stuff at home, in a 'perfect' world. Manufacturers will continue to build this stuff in china but they will just raise prices and try to reduce costs (cut as many corners as possible) to try to keep the prices slightly lower. Unless everything is rolled back basically now, Americans will be buying tech manufactured in China in a year's time for double the price and with 50% of the component quality.",

Everyone's been trying to do exactly that and the ports have been clogged up as a result. The big companies have their own logistics though; just look at Apple and it's last minute flights with high value items.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump openly brags about how two of his buddies made billions through his stock manipulation.\n\nThe ultra rich are making money hand over fist through all this. Everyone else, be they poor or rich, suffers. But they're not who Trump and his Republican buddies care about. It's honestly unbelievable at how successful the Republicans have been in convincing those worst off in society to vote against their own interests.",

I wonder how much is left in those mines now. And besides. Bauxite is incredibly energy intensive to refine. In fact one of Iceland's main exports is Aluminium because with so much geo and hydrothermal energy, electricity is cheap and one aluminium plant consumes as much electricity as a medium sized town, all by itself. So even if America had the mines, the processing of it would require a vast energy infrastructure just for it's processing.\n\nIf they have mines they don't have refiners, if they have refiners they don't have energy. Just a single energy plant can take between 3 and 10 years. Depending on the energy source, the complexity and the output.",
