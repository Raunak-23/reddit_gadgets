It is also kinda rare in this market, as it stands right now. Most portable monitors don't have an active digitizer in them.\n\nYou are paying for the premium of a 10bit 4k display that is over 100% aRGB colour accurate with 550nits of brightness. There really is no competition for that yet in the portable monitor market. Then you add in the active digitizer stylus, and now there is even less competition for it yet until you get into actual drawing tablet territory, like the Huion Kamvas Pro 16.\n\nThe price hasn't been listed yet, but it'll probably be around $650 I'd imagine, as $799 is the price for the 17.3 inch version. I'm not gonna go digging deep on AliExpress/AliBaba for some possibly better device, but just simple searching on Google shows that of the portable monitors that do exist with similar specs (4k, 10bit, 100%+ aRGB, active digitizer), they are priced similarly or higher.\n\nThere are some lesser options, like with only an 8bit panel, and you'll pay significantly less for such a device, but that isn't comparable imo. But as I see it, like I said earlier, the only direct comparisons right now are actual drawing tablets, like the aforementioned Huion Kamvas Pro 16, which has a lesser display.",
