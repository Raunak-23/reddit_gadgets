      "body": "This is actually really cool and seems to be a novel method that sounds **CHEAP!** It's just a couple radio emitters and a reflector/sticker like thing.\n\nCameras, Lidar, GPS, etc. can struggle indoors depending on the environment and this is just cross-polarized radio wave reflections with 7cm accuracy that can accurately locate a drone.\n\nSeems like a good, final tech to close out the last little leg where drones currently struggle plus I'd guess the cost to implement this all over the place could be dirt cheap.",
