The superiority of Xbox Live during the PS3 era is one of the big things that carried them. I honestly think that a lot of their current customers were people who bought into their ecosystem with the 360 and never left. Without the success of the 360 and Xbox Live, Xbox would be totally dead now.\n\nHad they not fumbled with the Xbox One and kept a majority of those 360 customers, I think they would be in great shape right now because the PS4 generation was the generation when the online gaming stuff became extremely important. The PS4 launched early enough that there were plenty of people who weren't so invested in the Microsoft ecosystem that they weren't willing to switch over. Tons of 360 owners bought PS4s, and that's why Microsoft is sorta fucked now.",

Shooters outsold any other genre on Xbox by a huge amount so much so that a lot of publishers didn\u2019t really push out anything original on Xbox just ports. Halo, Gears, CoD were the big hitters on Xbox at the time. Xbox never diversified its base audience and when it fumbled Halo there was no reason to stick around on Xbox as the shooter genre was evolving.\n\nAlso gen z and gen a consume games differently than millennials and older. They only play two or three games but they invest a ton of time into the game and spend a lot on that game (think Fortnite, Roblox CoD). This is dangerous for console makers as it lowers the number of games sold on a console. \n\nMy hot take (got no evidence) is that the console user base is greying out and the younger generations aren\u2019t buying enough games to sustain the typical console model going forward.\n\nI call one more generation of standalone Xbox hardware and two more generations of standalone PlayStation hardware before consoles move to a lower cost thin client/cloud based and byod model",

Nintendo basically combined their two income streams into one. It was a pretty huge success, but they cannibalized their Gameboy/DS business in order to make it happen.\n\nIt was also $100 cheaper than the other consoles at launch, which really helped.\n\nIn any event, I think comparing it to the PS4/PS5 and the Xbox line is an apples-to-oranges comparison.",

          "body": "I was a PS5 Hardware Support Specialist at PlayStation, and the amount of consoles that we had to repair from being faulty was incredibly small.\n\nNearly every single repair we had was from someone who had damaged the HDMI port, with a much smaller number of people who didn\u2019t provide adequate ventilation for the console.\n\nEdit: Little bit more context: Out of the thousands of requests I received, only one was actually a faulty console, and it was overheating then turning off, user had it laying down the entire time with proper ventilation of 4\u2019 on each side. During my time there, I can\u2019t think of a single other instance we had of a console that was faulty.\n\nThat being said, Dualsense controllers were a dime a dozen. **So much stick drift**",
