At least it's possible and fairly easy to run alternative OSes on that hardware. Was a major concern when they brought out their M chips; there's at least one Linux option now, but with a fully integrated hardware and software platform, Apple has the final say in what you can run on the hardware you paid for - you don't fully own it.\n\nMicrosoft seems to want a slice of the same pie; they've dabbled in it before, such as Windows RT on tablets with ARM CPUs that were also a nightmare to run alternative OSes on. However, whilst they have a significant majority in the OS market, they don't have much of a presence in the hardware market. They can't force obsolescence in the same way Apple can. I wonder what's going to happen with Windows 12; will it only run on machines less than a year old? If so, I foresee an even larger exodus to Linux.",

If the whole motherboard needs to be replaced, that's another story. Even if still under warranty, the warranty usually doesn't cover a loan device while your own is being repaired, so I'd much rather have a laptop that can be repaired in minutes if it comes to that, as opposed to having to be shipped across the country to some repair facility where, after three weeks, they decide it's not worth the work and they send you a new device instead that you have to configure again from scratch.",
