There's a reason electric bikes aren't legally allowed to go over 22 mph in most states and that's because that speed around pedestrians is unsafe. I can get my 10 speed up to 47 mph with just my legs but I can't keep that speed effortlessly by holding a throttle. The typical bike rider's average speed is going to be under 22 mph and they're supposed to be in the road mind you not on sidewalks. There's no regulations on where you're supposed to ride your skateboard so when the sidewalk is where most skateboarders ride 45 mph is a recipe for disaster. I have a skate shop next to my work and watch people on skateboards run into people walking all the time I could only imagine the damage to both people with a collision at 45 mph. Not to mention the 4 adult longboarders I watched run into parked cars.",
