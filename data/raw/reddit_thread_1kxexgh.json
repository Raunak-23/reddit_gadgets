And was given like $9 per handlebar as an example. Which would never happen for his company. Almost the whole price of the bike or whatever he was saying. \n\nThis is a small example of why a complicated device like the iPhone will never be made on US Soil. Not to mention the amount of workers needed to ramp production and such. \n\nYou could maybe \u201cmaybe\u201d assemble them in America with the right tax incentives but that would still take 5-10 years to strike a deal and build and shift the supply chain.",
