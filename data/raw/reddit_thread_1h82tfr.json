The low tide is really showing what product lines are swimming naked.\n\nMicrosoft was adamant at the beginning about not putting VR on the Xbox because of how little uptake it had. People said heh... Sony aint... They and their Playstation got their games on lock! \n\nAnd then a few years later PlayStation halts their VR efforts after dismal sales.\n\nI expect we'll see more examples of fat trimming from Google, Microsoft and many other tech companies coming soon.\n\nI'm surprised Google hasn't pulled the plug on their Pixel Fold line yet. If Google killed their Pixel tablet due to sales, I could only surmise how little quantities the Fold managed to sell.",

The screen and the materials of the Samsung tablet were superb but I can't believe how crap every app on it was.

So much wasted space and unnecessary scrolling buttons etc.\n\nI think the HW for great Android tablets is there but there is no real app eco-system. I fully understand why Google cancelled their tablet line.",

You need enough users who can afford it, who want it, and who would benefit from it.\n\nEven though it looked pretty cool even to me as a product.\nNot remotely an IMac competitor, though.

Thats if. But xbox is not everywhere. They have gamepass in a lot of places. Cloud gaming in a lot of places. But my xbox libarary is only available on my xbox. My xbox experience is only on my xbox. I honestly have no idea whats available where. Just like the xbox itself. I dont know which one to buy anymore. The X? Series X? The S? Series S? The one? The 720? They ruined the brand by pretending like I can have my Xbox anywhere except its a different experience with a different subscription everywhere I go. No thank you. Comming from somoene that has had an xbox since 2001. Havent bought a game in probably 4 years.",

The iMac also suffers from the problem of having an absolutely beautiful frame and display being tied to a specific set of hardware. It just doesn't make much sense for most people, where the display will far outlast the computer it's attached to. \n\nThis is compounded by the fact that it's tied to x86/amd64.

Then it just kind of disappeared, or at least seemed to anyway? \n\nThis is where MS falls apart on the hardware front in comparison to Apple - even when they come up with a compelling product, they just don't seem to be able to infiltrate the creator market and make the product ubiquitous, so you see it all over YouTube and in movies/tv and in offices you visit in day to day life.\n\nIf Apple had made the studio - and this device was the closest MS came to creating something that looked like an Apple product - then maybe it would still be going today and be a successful part of the Mac line up? Seems sad really as it was a cool looking and, from the advertising (having never used one myself), innovative and practical device, that could have been really popular. Oh well...",
