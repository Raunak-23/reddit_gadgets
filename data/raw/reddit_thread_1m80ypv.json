There\u2019s a dedicated kit from Bambu Store that they can purchase named Maker\u2019s Beginner Kit. It includes a small motor (030 Micro DC Motor), a battery connector, a gear set, and some magnets and screws. These are enough to make the mechanical parts in the 3D printed racing toy move. For the building part, the players need to print and build the motor and battery case using the instructions in the kit. Then, they screw the support pieces to the base and insert the rollers, which help move the rolling track.",
