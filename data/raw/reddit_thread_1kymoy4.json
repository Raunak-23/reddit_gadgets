There's nothing wrong with that now that they have so much more muscle behind the software production end of things than they used to and they seem to be adopting the idea of putting their games on Steam, on Playstation, etc.\n\nThere's something to be said for trying to do everything and trying to be everywhere at once, but that can work against you where you're just spread too thin to seriously compete with just about anybody else who is far more specialized in specific areas.\n\nThey seem to have an issue with commitment.

Games for Windows Live?  Keep going and support that shit properly instead of abandoning it and then royally fucking up every game that was designed to use it when it no longer functions.",

Back in the 90s, Microsoft made DirectX, which gave developers a common API for graphics cards. This directly led to the graphics card arms race that is still playing out today. This meant Windows was the only option for games with cutting-edge graphics.\n\nThese days, Unix systems have more options for graphics. I don't know that they can match Windows for cutting edge graphics, but maybe they can. At least now, there is enough capability that most games can run fine on either platform.",

I saw a new game launch last week (Fantasy Life) that uses Easy Anti Cheat that is Verified to run on the Steam Deck.

          "body": "> how could it be that hard\n\nwooo boy. Even Nintendo is having some trouble with getting Switch 1 games running on Switch 2. In particular it's the damned shaders issue that plagues gaming. The shaders are compiled specifically for Switch 1's hardware, so Nintendo has to decompile and recompile them since they don't have access to the source code. And this process is not perfect, it's also why Vita hasn't been emulated well yet. Now S1 to S2 is a hardware upgrade, so there are resources to spare towards the conversion/emulation process.\n\nXBOX Series to a portable would not have that advantage, the hardware would likely be weaker than XBOX Series S, as a portable would have to use less power than a device plugged into a wall. That makes it even much harder to get the software running on it. Sacrifices have to be made, ie: resolution/framerate. Now MS has worked on emulation in the XBOX Series to run OG XBOX/360/XBOXone games at higher resolutions/framerates, so they could turn those hacks backwards to lower requirements, but they don't have such a system for Series games. But like Switch, the shader issue will be there.",

      "body": "This is the wrong move, imo. You will likely sell an Xbox branded handheld to far more than a windows branded handheld.  I would imagine the performance would be much better as well, seeing that the Xbox OS is leaps and bounds lighter than Windows Mobile. \n\nWhat on earth is MS doing? I swear these decisions are being made by people that have no idea what the gaming community actually want.  They see windows as a bigger brand so they think that will sell better. Which is simply not the case.  Outside of business related circles, Windows has a pretty negative reputation. For good reason too.",

If the original plan was for a handheld and console to be released at the same time, Series X/S style where every game must be capable of running on both they were gonna have more issues than when X/S were launched.\n\nLaunch the handheld a year or two after the console and they at least can have some better chances of developers porting games to the handheld. Not sure they should require all software to have a handheld mode, but all first party software should be able to do it.",

With increased silicon costs PS6 will likely be 600 at launch so I think Nextbox will be a little less powerful than PS6 and only 499. Then they will release the Xboy handheld in the middle of the gen around 2031. It allows mobile silicone to mature more. It will mean a handheld probably on par with Series X and PS5 instead of Series S at best if they released it sooner.",
