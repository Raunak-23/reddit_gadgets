But the doom and gloom then wasn't reflective of the outcome, and I doubt it will be here either. All sorts of new horizons opened up each time, and each time people moved fluidly over those horizons and we experienced a boom in quality of life increase in the process.\n\nIn 15 years we will be taking ai for granted the same way we do smart phones today.",
