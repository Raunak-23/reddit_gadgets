PC growth is still great mind you, I have ultimate and use it on my PC as well, though it\u2019s an uphill battle breaking into the PC market when your using a storefront with a bad reputation among PC gamers who\u2019d rather not have an extra subscription and keep their library all on one storefront (Steam). Hence the reason why Microsoft is no longer forcing users to the windows store or Gamepass for their games, and you can purchase all their big titles on steam.\n\nMicrosoft will keep hardware around simply as a Trojan horse for getting easy gamepass subs, because a decent PC is still going to cost substantially more than a console especially these days, and they are trying to sell subscriptions, and flipping current PC users is still an uphill battle against Steam.\n\nDon\u2019t shoot the messenger.\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/1421225/xbox-game-pass-subscriber-count-console-service/",

Bit of an issue today, but the tech has made strides in recent years and will continue to do so where headsets will easily allow you to see your pets/family around you while immersed in VR by having them overlayed into the experience when nearby, and of course there's MR functionality where you can always see the real world. \n\nOf course I wouldn't suggest you go play some crazy 360 degree VR boxing game with a pet in the room even with such tech, but it's not like you couldn't use the VR headset for its many other applications. It would just be a small minority of games/apps that wouldn't work well in a circumstance like that. Most of my VR and most of my friend's VR usage is done seated, sometimes laying in bed. \n\nThe size, weight, and hassle are definitely issues, but they will be solved many decades before VR works through a neural interface.",

Does anyone remember the push to sell us 3D TVs?\n\nBut still, I can see VR having *some* application and user base in video games. But even then there will be very few developers who will spend a fortune on developing fully fledged VR games.\n\nOn PlayStation 5, VR is basically just a Gran Turismo 7 controller, maybe Resident Evil too. And that\u2019s it.\n\nFor productivity AR was always a better bet. But again, developing anything for AR is vastly more expensive than just making an iPad app or whatever.\n\nIt\u2019s been years and years and years and barely anything other than expensive tech demos was ever made for AR.\n\nSo, there is a sliver for hope for VR. But probably not even that for AR.",

The reason it hasn't caught on yet is because the headset has to be lightweight and comfortable to wear for hours without it bothering you and because there has to be a flagship application or game.  The tech with Apple's headset might be good enough but it was too heavy and lacked that flagship application.  Otherwise I expect it would've caught on.  Get one to catch on at the high end $3000+ price tag and the cost can come down later.  But if it'd double as headphones/TV I expect lots of people would pay $3000+ for one that all those criteria.

The initial iPhone only supported phone, maps and web browsing and the web was far from rich on the first iPhones. But it was still inovative enough to bring in the masses and let them take more time to bring everything together in the next couple iterations. (and for the iPad, early the SDK wasn't that far from the iOS one, so very little work in comparison to provide it to devs, it was treated like a large iPod Touch for a while) (and competition didn't really start directly until Google came in and developed a large offering of apps for Android, which is when Apple actually started facing comparable competition in the space)\n\nThe Watch segment had the advantage of being a lower function device, so you can get most of the benefits of owning one without installing any apps on it since the OS health data offering allowed syncing their data back to the phone app in the worst cases.\n\nBut this, this is a totally different paradigm, stuck between gaming, entertainment and work, not unlike the PC but in a way that is thoroughly more invasive to your personal space, both in the way the information is presented and in the way it impacts your experience of the world. I believe it's gonna take a while and we'll need something that is way less in the way, like the Google Glasses were, for this to become more ubiquitous but I agree with you, them leaving those spaces every other year and coming back, be it MS, Apple, Meta or others, is nothing more than them trying to see what form will stick. Once one of those becomes actually mass produced we can expect all the others to follow suit and have that segment start becoming identical.",

The input and interaction is so different from common modalities (keyboard and mouse, gamepad, etc.) that it's hard to develop something that works in VR/AR and also on a traditional device.

MS put a lot of time and money into it, I think their insight is simply that the tech required for that ideal is nowhere close to being a reality, and the use cases just aren't there.\n\nMeta's Orion demo, while very cool from a technology standpoint, really highlights the limitations.  This is a product they say is *10 years* away from commercial viability - and what they demoed was a boring looking pong game no one will play, transparent low res instragram video, and AI labeling a bunch of groceries on a table.  \n\nIt's just not compelling, nor is it superior to the super computers everyone is already carrying around in their pockets every day, which boast ultra high res and beautiful OLED displays, can display every kind of media and games people actually care about, and are just as capable of the same computer vision tech, while not having to be worn on your face to use.\n\nAt least the more traditional VR headsets on the market today like Quest and VP can deliver truly unique immersive experiences that are only possible with a headset.  Strict AR glasses can't do this, and even the Quest and VP despite offering those immersive qualities as well as passthrough AR that doesn't suffer from the limitations of Orion/Hololens headsets, still struggle to achieve mainstream appeal or compelling AR use cases.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad others are continuing to pursue this, simply because I like cool tech and I'm personally interested in it, but I get more and more skeptical about what's actually possible and the future market viability every year.",

Corporations become beaurcratic and risk averse.  An entrenched corporation is actually one of the worst places to look when it comes to predicting future trends.

Generally when they see the writing on the wall they just throw money at the horse race.\n\nInstitutions stabilize and then \u201cstagnate\u201d.

But I would argue that the level of talent and all around innovative capabilities exist at most large companies today so it\u2019s much harder to stand out as truly being innovative and visionary. \n\nI used to work at an innovation studio that was hired by the Fortune 100 and 5-10 years back most companies didn\u2019t know how to do design thinking or had processes for internal innovation \u2013 they outsourced it to agencies or consultancies. Nowadays many big companies have beefed up their internal capabilities to do R&D and crank out experiments and new products, not to mention there are tons of \u201cinnovation labs\u201d or \u201cstartup incubators\u201d now.\n\nAll that to say competition is way more fierce today. Companies can copy your tech fairly quickly: I watched an interview with the founder of Uber saying he was impressed with the speed that Chinese competitors copied their features and processes and offerings.\n\nNow with the VisionPro, I truly think it was less on the inability to execute on the VisionPro, and more on how fast AI/LLMs are changing computing and industry as a whole. \n\nIn my opinion, you don\u2019t really need a crazy virtual way of doing work using your fingertips or a headset when you can just prompt or use voice to build apps and design something or an agent can do it all in the background for you. Apple\u2019s product was a new way to do computing but with all these tech advances of late, it\u2019s being relegated to an entertainment device which doesn\u2019t justify that price point.",

Tim is somewhat better operationally and with delegation within the company I think.  For the VisionPro I also try to imagine how Steve would have approached it.  And I think his version would have been much smaller, lighter, and out of the way...more like the Xreal, Meta Ray-Bans, Lucyd form factor we're seeing hit the market today.  But I think Steve would have pushed what was possible with that form factor to its absolute limits, where consumers could have something that was out of the way, intuitive, and useful while not standing out as a wearable computer or gadget...but more of a style statement.\n\nThat said, it might be the case that Apple is arriving to that conclusion as well, just approaching it differently than they typically would have.  [Apple\u2019s AR smart glasses may not be dead, after all](https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/tech-companies/apple-s-ar-smart-glasses-may-not-be-dead-after-all/ar-AA1yH8yF)\n\nOnce the hardware catches up to the power of what they achieved with the VisionPro, I can see them going this route for a trimmed down yet powerful version of what they accomplished with the bulkier headset.",

And it's quite possible that people just aren't into them. That said, if there's anyone out there into rhythm games and curious about VR, I can't recommend beat saber enough. Such a fun game with lots of custom maps and is actually kinda decent for cardio too. \n\n\nBut anyone who says VR is too pricy is living in the past and is misinformed. A quest 3s is cheaper than a lot of TVs and is pretty decent for entry level VR hardware. Its entirely stand alone with the option to hook into a PC and the only real downside is having to sign in with a meta account (and you can just use a burner account with a fake name and email).",

In fact, there's tons of research that backs up my claim. Mel Slater's work is a good primer in particular: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2781884\n\nVR kicks our audiovisual systems into high gear, and these being our [two most dominant senses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6777262/) is why the illusion of VR works so well, especially because of the brain making use of multisensory substitution. \n\nThis effect enables visual, audio, or audiovisual input to create believable perceptual experiences by using this limited set of data to fill in gaps for other senses. Notable examples of this include phantom limb pain and supplying a fake arm to numb the pain, the rubber hand illusion, the McGurk effect, Pinocchio illusion, ventriloquist illusion, and motion bounce illusion. \n\nMore specific to VR, you have the [body transfership illusion](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/3/241/4067543) for remapping the brain's sense of self onto a virtual body and [phantom sense](https://neurosciencenews.com/vr-tactile-perception-phantom-touch-25208/) for feeling physical sensations based on what a user saw/heard in VR such as heat from a virtual campfire or a tingle from an avatar's finger on your face. This audiovisual information can deviate from the real world and still provide convincing perceptions, as [described in this timestamped Valve talk](https://youtu.be/9kzu2Y33yKM?t=2160).\n\nUltimately VR taps into our sensorimotor systems to enable a natural and cohesive experience of a world that when done right the brain simply treats as \"I am here. This is my model of reality from which I infer information from. I do not care what world the data came from, just that the data is parsable enough for me to treat it as *a reality*.\"\n\n> Also, you are completely incorrect about fatigue not applying to this type of tech. People get fatigued and sick faster in AR/VR than they do on Zoom calls. \n\n\nRead up on specifically why 'zoom fatigue' occurs and you'll instantly know that aside from audio latency, none of this applies to VR/AR: https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2021/02/four-causes-zoom-fatigue-solutions\n\nSickness is a different story; VR/AR does indeed suffer from this.",

We had a call with Microsoft and asked what we could do with it beyond basic video calling that would benefit our organization and they launched into this whole prepared speech about creating software and training programs that use AR and how we could create 3D blowouts of the parts we were making for our customers for better visualization and creativity. \n\nWe then asked how these are created and they said that they are partnered with a limited number of software developers who could assist in creating these programs for us. We reached out to them and every single partner company we talked to said that they were putting a pause on their AR programming contracts. \n\nSo now, it's been sitting in a box in the back of our server room for 2 years gathering dust, even less useful than strapping a GoPro on your head and doing a video call with that because the headset can't make calls unless you purchase a very specific license from Microsoft.",

Consider this: The first 3d movie was 'The Power of Love' which was a silent film released in 1922, using red and green plastic filters over the eyes. The first polaroid filters (showing stereoscopic effects through polarized lenses) for 3d cinema were demonstrated in 1939. Yet, when Oculus started their doomed project to create a portable VR helmet, the vast majority of films were still being screened with no 3d, 70 years later.\n\nIf you can't sell people on a pair of polaroid lenses for a two hour movie, then how on **EARTH** are you going to sell them on strapping a giant helmet for an evening's gaming session? It's just clunky, uncomfortable technology. Until some genius comes up with a way to project an image directly into your retina using an ultra-low wattage laser, 3D display technology is dead on arrival.",
