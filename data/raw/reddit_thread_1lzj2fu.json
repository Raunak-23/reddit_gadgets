Bye Bye data.\n\nGenerally a self-destruct mechanism on a drive does two things: \n\n* Wipes encryption keys so the data is unrecoverable.  Drives like this will have built in hardware encryption that's always enabled and wiping the key is effectively wiping the drive.\n\n* blows some kind of fuse / anti-fuse that it can detect in firmware.  If detected, it will refuse to initialize and there's no way to reset it.",

Wiping a multi-terabyte device under it's own power requires having a large battery and guaranteeing it's always charged, which is impractical, takes a significant amount of time and could fail or be interrupted. Wiping a 256 bit key contained in the crypto module is trivial, fast, and extremely secure.\n\n> You don't want anything detected by firmware.\n\nWhat it detects is a permanent fuse/anti-fuse that indicates the drive is disabled. It's not so much a security feature as an anti-theft feature.  It prevents the drive from being reinitialized with a new encryption key and being used by someone else.  There's no way to reset it. \n\nThat's usually optional on these kinds of drives. Turning it on or off doesn't make the data any more or less secure.",

One such solution was exactly this. A system designed to heavily encrypt and wipe a drive with a secondary safety feature designed to activate if you move the computer which would physically destroy the hard drives and memory. \n\nThe advantage of this was it was two stage, even if the destroyed drive wasn't completely destroyed You're now still dealing with heavily wiped and encrypted data. It also meant if you knew what you were doing you could potentially stop it from physically destroying the computer so if it was a false alert you'd still have a viable computer.",

On SSDs that operation takes 2-3 minutes, which seems about right per their demonstration and since they state they\u2019re concerned about power loss midway through the operation. If that\u2019s a real concern, how do they stop people from just unsoldering the NAND and reading the chips directly? Why not just make it a SED with 256-bit keys and have the button wipe the stored keys? That would take the time for data sanitization down to under a second, and it would be just as secure.\n\nThe physical destruction method seems kind of neat, but I don\u2019t see why the drive needs to be the thing sending the high voltage current. Could very easily be a separate module that does the physical destruction. Also, with high voltage current being the method I would worry about partially functional NAND still existing. It might make the drive \u201cundetectable\u201d, but any number of things could cause that. It could have just fried the controller, or the NAND could be only partially destroyed, or the PCB could have been damaged. There\u2019s no real way for them to check if physical destruction worked either, since voltage was the method for destruction. For a device that touts use in secure settings I\u2019d want something more reliable.\n\nThis product seems like the first draft idea that I would have made in my data forensics class in college.",
