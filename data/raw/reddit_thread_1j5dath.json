The desktop gpu is more powerful, mostly because it takes 50 watts more power, which is not really an option on a laptop card.\n\nThe only real selling point is the multi frame Gen which to be honest sounds like crap anyway (who wants bad latency and an artifacting crappy image in exchange for fancy motion smoothing?). \n\nWe will see, but with the way it is the rtx 4080 mobile should beat the 5070 mobile anyway. The amd refresh should provide similar performance for a lot less money but not quite the same performance in heavy ray tracing. \n\nAll in all, kind of a pointless upgrade cycle unless you are really due for/needing an upgrade. That said, the new efficiency in synthetic benchmarks should make for better workstation gpus but kind of underwhelming for gaming.",
