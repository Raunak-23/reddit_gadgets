      "body": "It's cute observing the people who want it to fail. They're going to be severely disappointed. To think it's going to sell Wii U numbers shows a serious lack of brain cells. Wii U failed because of shit marketing. The casual audience that makes up Nintendo's majority, especially after the Wii, didn't know it was a new console. They thought it was an add-on. Switch 2 leaves no room for confusion. \n\nThe price of the console itself isn't even that bad, and DK Bananza will be the \"usual\" 69.99, so I'm not concerned. The price for the Zelda upgrades is awful...if you either don't own them already or don't have NSO, in which case it's either free or 20$ (I think?) which is the exact same price for certain PS4 to PS5 upgrade games like Ghost of Tsushima.\n\nThe discourse is wild. Without ragebaiting twitch streamers or YouTubers who are going to buy it anyway on the excuse of it being their job (their job should be to avoid the Switch 2 and find other avenues to make money), I don't think there would be that much negativity. Influencers truly run the online discourse now. So few people are able to form their own opinions.",

The leaks pointing to a reported performance of 1.7TFLOPs in handheld mode and 3.1 TFLOPs in docked mode, which line up closely enough with what Nvidia said about the Switch 2 being 10x more powerful as well as a display that's a lot more capable than the Steamdeck's. The evidence based on some 3rd-party ports' builds that are as old as two months old now only point to that direction. As much as I criticise Nintendo a lot in recent years, this is one of the only instances where they might have done something right.",
