Why do you think Cook just donated a million dollars to the ~~slush~~ inauguration fund? So that way he can ask that they make an exemption for Apple products. \n\nOr to put it anther way - Company A and B both sell widgets for $10 and make $2 in profit. Company A gets a tariff exemption. Company B doesn't. Company B's widgets get hit with the 50% tariff, so they now sell widgets for $15. Company A doesn't have to worry about tariffs because of the exemption, so they could still sell widgets for $10 and become the dominant player in the widget game, but since their competition is selling their widgets for $15, they could raise their price to $13 and still be dominant AND more than double their profit from $2 to $5.\n\nAs for your last point, yes to a point - rising prices eventually hit a \"pain point\" where the consumer just stops buying it. But if your phone or microwave or laptop dies and you need a new one, you don't have much choice but to pay for it. And also remember, Company A is making more per widget than they did before, so even if their sales drop off by 50%, they are still making more money on fewer products, which means they can even scale back on some of their overhead like scheduling fewer shifts and less overtime.  Hotels are starting to do this shit, too - my friend's mom works at a fairly large hotel chain that isn't worried about selling out every night because they are making more money than ever since what they charge for a room has more than quadrupled, and with fewer rooms that means they don't need as many housekeeping staff (which were already getting screwed since they cut daily room cleaning)",

Which is a pretty huge positive. But no major company, like the richest companies in the world, such as Walmart want that. You are fucking high to think any of these fortune 500 companies give a shit about the American people or the exploitation and abuse of individuals abroad. These companies don't want to bring back manufacturing to America. Elon Musk wants to import engineers so he can pay them less. If you think any of these CEOs have the interests of the commonfolk in mind, you are adorably naive. The biggest companies that would produce the most jobs in America are going take trump's tax cut, pay his tariff exemption fee, and make products abroad even harder. The only reason Amazon in still in the US is because of logistics. \n\nTLDR nobody is moving their manufacturing here.",

LG & Samsung raised their prices on washers to cover the cost, but they also raised their prices on dryers because washers and dryers usually cost the same amount, and people buy them at the same time, so they both went up.\n\nThen Whirlpool, who produces washers domestically and wasn't impacted by the tariffs, raised their prices to match the cost of the imported washers, because they could.\n\nWe (american consumers) paid a total of $1.5B in tarrifs, and the tarrifs resulted in the creation of 1,800 domestic manufacturing jobs.  $800K per job. That's not what the people working those jobs were paid, just what we paid to have those jobs created.  The jobs paid $21.46/hour.\n\n[https://archive.ph/08Bo5](https://archive.ph/08Bo5)",

Potentially 16-20 years in the grave as the world changes around them.\n\nThe only reason the GOP regained the Presidency in 1980 is because the GOP under Reagan was a fundamentally different party with a completely different leadership. Gone were the Rockefeller Republicans and the Goldwater conservatives. The New England moderate GOP of Lowell Weicker, Chris Shays, the Chafees, and the Bushes petered out over the next decade...G.W. Bush in 2000 was much more aligned with neoconservatives than the GOP of Prescott Bush and G.H.W. Bush and is far more a creature of the post-Reagan GOP.\n\nCould the GOP bounce back that fast again? Possibly if the resurgent GOP is unrecognizable as this GOP...repudiating evangelicals and MAGA/Trump, moderating heavily, finding a way to peel off disaffected non-establishment Democrats on common cause issues, etc.\n\nI suspect the next GOP will be moderate, socially libertarian, far more enamored of small government and less enamored of Wall St. Wall St. is going to adapt if Trump sinks the ship, probably shifting hard toward the establishment Democratic party and its support of stable, but moderated economies.\n\nThese changes happen more often than you'd think. The Clinton third-wave shift in 1992 was just as profound, toward fiscal conservatism and away from the social welfare state of the post-WWII Democratic party. This allowed them to shave off enough socially-moderate Republicans, combined with Perot taking budget-hawk conservatives from Bush to win.",

Monkey with cymbals would be even too complex to fit inside that head. \nHey we should still vote for the candidate that suggested covid could be cured by shining an extremely bright light inside of the body.

They\u2019ve already destroyed in California with their climate policies. Why do you think those fires are burning so heavily?  The climate activists have passed laws that do not allow for brush clearing or the like.   They ration water unnecessarily.  The firemen go to tap a fire hydrant and run out of water in minutes.   They can\u2019t even save a home because they don\u2019t have enough water to do it.   Newsom will not survive this debacle and California will turn far more conservative because of this.   But you idiots wouldn\u2019t know any of that and wouldn\u2019t believe it any way because being smugly \u201cright\u201d is more important than being correct.",

Getting everything properly dialed in to achieve the required tolerances for modern designs and adequately training the staff can easily take another ten years. We're talking a multi-billion dollar investment which will need to be paid off, and that would be reflected in the prices the plant charged. And even after you do that... You still need imports to get the raw materials. Modern chips use parts that are literally just a few atoms across, which means the level of purity you need for everything is absurd. While there aren't any natural sources good enough to meet those standards, there are a few that require significantly less processing to get there. And roughly 80% of them are located in and around China. That's why so many of the world's fabs are located there. If we tried to use domestic sources we'd quickly exhaust the high quality stuff and have to transition to using lower grade material that required significantly more refinement, which would raise the price the fab had to pay.\n\nEven if we make the generous assumption that the plant would be able to pay exactly the same wages to its employees, the added startup and procurement costs alone make it impossible for them to match the prices of an established business with much shorter supply chains. The reason to build domestic fabs is ultimately more about adding some much needed redundancy to a vital part of the global supply chain, which got absolutely hammered during COVID.",

Best time would have been November and December. Tons of deals, and there was more availability. The GPU companies planned on selling out their stock of current generation before the launch of the new generations as usual. So there\u2019s barely any deals right now, and many gpus that were available are discontinued or gone or marked up. Like the RX 7900 GRE is discontinued and now unobtainium, though to be fair it was a limited launch as it was a former China only gpu.\n\nNow, if tariffs do happen as I suspect they will, maybe with an exception for certain items like computer hardware though I doubt, ANY TIME before tariffs start is the best time to buy a gpu lol. So I agree with you though it\u2019s a gamble, as trump likes to walk back lots of his promises as evidenced by his first term.\n\nIt\u2019s just awful that it\u2019s tied with new generation graphics card launches, normal advice would be to wait 2-6 months from now. But it\u2019s totally possible that with tariffs, new graphics cards will have the prices raised by 25-50% (50% due to knock-on effects and trade war consequences, 25% is JUST the tariffs). So the idea of a \u201cnew cheaper performance per dollar generation\u201d just EVAPORATES overnight.\n\nAnd as soon as gpu prices start climbing due to tariffs, the used market\u2019s prices will follow. And the used market\u2019s supply will very quickly become limited, then become HIGHLY predatory, similar to the gpu shortages of a few years ago with the gpu mining craze.",

The increased expenses stem from higher tariffs and transportation costs associated with importing necessary materials from Taiwan. The Arizona facility will start producing 10,000 12-inch wafers monthly using a 4 nm node, with plans to double output to 20,000 wafers at full capacity. Four major technology companies\u2014Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm\u2014have committed to purchasing chips from the plant for their AI and high-performance computing needs. The 445-hectare facility highlights ongoing challenges in America's semiconductor industry. Despite the aim to strengthen domestic chip manufacturing, the plant must import materials from Taiwan to maintain production quality, revealing gaps in the US semiconductor supply chain.\n\n>This overseas dependency drives up operational costs significantly. While TSMC's investment marks an essential step in rebuilding domestic capacity, the substantial cost difference between US and Taiwanese production raises questions about long-term viability. TSMC has already begun trial production at the site and plans to expand operations with additional phases. The company's Phase 2 facility is completed, and equipment is being installed, while future expansions aim to produce 2 nm chips by 2028. However, unless the cost gap narrows, the higher production expenses could impact the plant's competitiveness in the global semiconductor market, even competing with its own Taiwanese facilities, where customers could decide to use Taiwanese fabs due to lower costs. Meanwhile, TSMC continues to expand its Taiwan operations, with plans to build new 2 nm facilities in Kaohsiung's Science Park starting next year.",

And for TSMC, they have to export their supply chain since the USA doesn't have it, which means chips being manufactured in the USA are at least 3 times more expensive and 2 generations behind. It's mainly meant so if Taiwan gets obliterated, at least the US military and some sectors might have some chips.\n\nBut what do I know, my only sources are TSMC employees that have been shipped over to Arizona and my company also helps handle their transition.",

We used to manufacture over 90% of our clothes.  In my own lifetime we manufactured 50-60% of our clothes.  Now, it's 3%. The existence of the physical factories did not result in continued domestic production, because once economic conditions change, producers will respond accordingly.

It's going to be filled with US workers in the middle of US territory even if the company even if the company were to shift policy to be hostile to the US they can't effectively do anything since everything is in the US. Compared to a scenario where this doesn't happen the US would effectively have to invade the country, try not to destroy any infrastructure PLUS would have to prevent any sabotage to equipment.\n\nOne of the issues with tariffs though which I think is partly why it was condemned and this actually happened last time Trump was president is that tariffs are a really heavy-handed and blunt instrument to go about accomplishing the goal of trying to bring domestic production back and doesn't actually achieve the stated goal.\n\nSo the reason why this is a pretty heavy handed method is that raising tariffs on Chinese goods doesn't actually cause companies to shift their supply chain back to the US what it does cause, and what actually happened in the previous administration is that it causes companies to shift production/supply chains to the next cheapest location. \n\nFor example when this happened previously, companies shifted production from China to places like India, Vietnam, Bangladesh/Cambodia because guess what those places are still cheaper to produce than the United States. So actually to do this you would need to apply a Tariff to China and then also to all the other countries that could potentially do this cheaper.",

Apple's iPhones, for example, only cost around half as much to produce as they retail for.\n\nFor the US-made stuff, they'll have to pay, say, an average of 40% tariffs on the parts they import, but that doesn't mean the final cost of the laptop goes up 40%; it just means the parts will be assessed at whatever they cost BEFORE shipping, assembly, and markup on the final product. In other words, likely half the retail cost of the laptop will be subject to tariffs. A $1200 US-assembled laptop wouldn't just spring up 40% in price; it would include the cost of tariffs on some $600 in parts, plus potentially additional markup from the manufacturer, placing it around $1500. That's a 25% increase at most, not 40%.\n\nAnd that's assuming the Trump administration levies the full tariffs on every country involved in the supply chain, plus 100% on China. He's been happy with SOME tariffs on China in the past, building SOME of the border wall, and getting SOME concessions in the renegotiation of NAFTA. As long as he can say he made a Great Deal, he's happy. \n\nBlanket tariffs on the entire global supply chain is...really unlikely.",

If dell / apple / Lenovo etc all raise prices in lockstep, smaller players will 100% try to compete on price and steal market share in the low to mid market range. Additionally, laptop demand is much more elastic for consumers.\n\nThis is closer to the auto industry or even the fast food industry- both which are seeing falling prices due to consumers no longer willing to pay such high prices.",

The only way to maintain high profit margins would be through monopoly/oligopoly, which is not the case for laptops.

Most defenders of corporate tax cuts argue that they should be cut to attract investment (a race to the bottom with other countries where corporate investment could be more favourable), not necessarily to increase worker wages or decrease prices for consumers.\n\n[This paper concludes that improve aggregate efficiency but exacerbate inequality](https://economics.yale.edu/sites/default/files/2023-01/The%20Efficiency-Equity%20Tradeoff%20of%20the%20Corporate%20Income%20Tax.pdf).\n\n>We find that private incomes increase by $97 billion and tax revenues decline by $88 billion, implying a net aggregate output gain of $9 billion, equivalent to approximtely 0.04% of GDP. In the the model, reducing corporate tax revenues by $1 generates an additional $0.10 in output, implying substantial efficiency gains from corporate tax cuts. We also find that the gains from corporate tax cuts disproportionately flow to those with high incomes. We estimate that approximately 56% of the gains accrue to firm owners, 12% accrue to executives, 32% accrue to high-paid workers, and 0% flow to low-paid workers. When we adjust these calculations to allow for the empirical fact that many workers hold equity portfolios, we estimate that 78% of the gains flow to the top 10% of the earnings distribution, and 22% flow to the bottom 90%.",

The grass is always greener on the other side.  \n\nNo, I don't know what happened to prices at the pump when NY cut its petrol tax. I was unable to find a relevant result on Google. Here's an analysis of Germany's petrol tax cuts enacted as a response to a decrease in supply caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140988323004462  \n\n> To attenuate rising gasoline and diesel prices, the German government implemented a temporary cut of fuel taxes from June through August 2022. In contrast to the impression in the public debate in early June 2022 that petroleum companies retained part of the tax rebate, we show that the temporary reduction of fuel taxes was indeed passed on to consumers. We find full pass-through for gasoline when comparing prices in Germany to a synthetic Doppelganger based on a sample of European countries",

Or any of the other numerous competitors that exist (and there'd be even more if an oligopoly were to be attempted by Coca Cola and Pepsi)?  \n\nTo think most products suffer from monopoly/oligopoly pricing is to be wilfully ignorant. Try and understand barriers to entry. Oligopoly might be a problem in railways or internet services because infrastructure is an enormous barrier to entry, but that's not the case for food. I've seen people attribute the recent rise in egg prices to \"corporate greed\". If eggs are being sold at such a high profit margin, as is implied, why aren't we seeing farmers taking the opportunity to produce more eggs and rake in a lot of sales by selling them at a lower price? The answer is that egg prices rose because of a reduction in supply, not collusion.  \n\nEconomists have repeatedly pointed this misconception out. The general public is very quick to blame price increases caused by a shift in supply/demand on \"greed\". Read \"The Myth of the Rational Voter\" by Bryan Caplan, for instance. It happens with eggs, it happens with petrol, it happens with housing, it happens with anything you can imagine... People just want an easy thing to blame.",

If Lidl decided to join in on the oligopoly, new competitors would quickly appear to undercut them, grabbing all of the oligopoly's consumers and forcing them to lower prices.

Otherwise, someone is eventually going to allocate resources to compete with you, destroying your cartel out of their own self-interest.",

This almost complete pass-through underscores the policy\u2019s effectiveness in lowering consumer prices, closely aligning with its intended objective of providing immediate relief to consumers.\n\nTariffs are essentially sales taxes on imports. Just as prices increase when sales taxes are raised, so do they decrease when they're cut. \n\nIf markets were as uncompetitive as most users in this thread make them to be, why would the greedy colluding companies wait for a tax to be removed so they could pocket the would-be price difference? Why not raise prices right now? If the laptop market is an oligopoly, as so many here imply, why would they wait for an excuse? The answer is they wouldn't, but neither is the market an oligopoly. It's competitive, and thus attempting to pocket a hypothetical tariff/sales tax cut would easily result in losing market share and consequentially total profit.",

Trump establishes a 50% tariff on Chinese laptops. We pass the tariff onto the consumer. The laptops now cost $1650, keeping the same profit margin.  \n\n4 years later, a new US administration completely eliminates tariffs on Chinese laptops. You think \"huh, I'll just keep the $1650 price and make much more profit\". You keep the $1650 price. I drop my price back to $1100, because who's going to buy your $1650 laptop if I sell an equivalent one for $1100? This is my game theory profit-maximising move, you're forced to compete by dropping your price, lest your sales suffer an abysmal drop. Now, why don't we collude to keep the laptops at $1650? Because, instead of one fool, we'd just be two fools being undercut by many other competitors, as the laptop market has no large barriers to entry and therefore plenty of competitors. The oligopoly attempt might've worked if we were ISPs, due to the high barrier to entry of infrastructure - there are only a handful of ISPs, but a market that's much more open to competition? No chance.",

The price of a pair of shoes goes from $150 to $225. Now Shaq can open a factory in the US and make shoes at the same quality for a lower price. LeBron sees how much money Shaq is making and does the same.  In order to compete Nike has to move their factory back to the US. Us shoe factory workers unionize and it becomes a good job. Shoes are still sold at less than the $225, and more Americans are making enough money to afford them. This is just a hypothetical situation obviously. The low prices we are seeing right now is only possible with the use of horrible labor practices.

That's hilarious.  Also, you know labor costs are not part of the tariff right.  So how is a new company paying $7.25/hr going to compete with a company that pays $7/week?  Lower prices?

So where is the company making the extra money to open a new factory?  Also, that's a long effort before they even break ground.  I guess you're expecting me to pay double for a laptop in the interim?  That'll definitely help the economy\n\nOr- we could hang on to tech longer (which will also happen) but that'll effect companies like Apple, Intel, AMD, etc. which happens to be where Americans retirement investments live.  We can bail out the companies again but there's still a world of hurt for the consumer.\n\nThe concept sounds great on paper.  Then again, so does pure socialism.

For now I am using my M-series mac for work, it\u2019s not as good as it could be with CUDA, but still better than my 980. The M-series macs are surprisingly good and I see many colleagues and also professors and students at the University I went to adopt them, but unfortunately CUDA is still state-of-the art for what I am doing. The only regret I have is not having gone with enough RAM, but that shit was expensive from Apple, as always. At the time I bought it, I did not think I was ever gonna do the kind of GPU reliant computation I have to do now, so I was fine with what I got. It was either an M-series mac or a Framework, so polar opposites. The final decision was however, that I needed a mac at the time for a specific course.",

I needed a new GPU anyway and I have no complaints with it right now. I knew the 50 series was around the corner, but the previous price speculation was higher than what it was announced to be, and the tariff possibility making them even higher was not something I wanted to gamble on for a cheaper card.

Yes, the framework is better for consumers since you can disassemble it easily and upgrade everything, versus a Mac where everything is soldered and glued down... but most people are going to go for the easy, familiar Macbook instead of a Framework.

Honestly, a large component of this stuff is labor; next biggest is often the housings.

Most of its a PCB with a few dozen components, mostly resistors and caps that will go from ten cents apiece to fourteen. Raw boards, there\u2019s a few places in the States, some in Western India. Sometimes an IC will cost a few bucks and then it\u2019ll cost one or two more. But the housing and labor take a sizable chunk of the cost.\n\nSo, if this is some conspiracy to help Deere (who\u2019s on Trump\u2019s shit list for building a plant in Mexico, which makes sense because the market for farming and earthmoving products worldwide makes the US look like a joke), it\u2019s not going to work. If their prices go up ten or fifteen percent (because, again, this isn\u2019t just some populated board out of China), it\u2019s still cheaper than the alternative. The nice thing about Deere is that it all comes in the box, so you don\u2019t have to bolt it on. Oh, you pay for that, but not having to do something that you *can* do yourself is why Dell and dozens of other companies still make pre-built desktop PCs. \n\nSo, nothing is really going to change that much. The same companies that compete with Deere are still going to be around in five years. Maybe some of the add-on companies will go out of business, but I can think of a few that haven\u2019t been doing well for several years, more because of lousy management and lack of innovation than a shifting market.",

I grew up with children of farmers, and most inherited the family farm and they\u2019re still working, after getting out of college with degrees in Ag, Business, Engineering, and a couple of other majors, but those are the big three among the people I know. They\u2019re *all* college educated, because that\u2019s what it takes, now. It\u2019s kind of hard to believe, but 90,000 tractors get sold in the US every year, and farm equipment is a $7 billion per year industry (it might be $6 billion, now; the farm equipment market took a dive in 2024, and I\u2019m not dead sure of the reason). If you make something that will make farmers more money, they\u2019ll buy it. \n\nBut right to repair is dead in the US for the next couple of years. Elizabeth Warren is probably going to keep pounding the drum to anyone who will listen, but with a Republican controlled Senate, there\u2019s basically no chance of getting a subcommittee on right to repair for at least two to four years (because the 2026 Senate election isn\u2019t likely to swing the chamber back to the Democrats). So she\u2019s basically powerless. I think there\u2019s still a class action suit in the courts, but I doubt it\u2019ll work its way up to SCOTUS, which would swat it like an annoying fly. So there\u2019s really no remedy for a while.\n\nBut saying Deere will kill farming is a massive overstatement.",

Mine is $16, so we are going to go from a few bucks a day, to $58 a day, to $128 a day. \n\nAnd wait till I tell you about the produce pickers...\n\nI'm personally excited.

I know it may be complicated if you are used to just picking them up in the egg cartons.\n\n>Too many fliocks have been destroyed recently in fear of new disease.\n\n\"Fear of a new disease\" Bird Flu, H5N1, is already spreading. It's killed millions of chickens and even has spread to humans a couple of times (granted, immunocompromised humans). \n\n> \"If mass deportations occur (I believe to be unlikely, but I'll humor you)\" \n\nI suppose that would make sense. Trump has said mass deportations will occur, and we know how often he lies. \n\n>Labor won't be a major problem unless there is a significant chicken or human pandemic.\n\nLabor won't be a major problem with 30% of the labor force being cut out? I don't think you understand how labor works.",

There was a lot of inflation in 2020 but it was hidden by oil's price tanking. When oil's price recovered in 2021 and 2022, all the 2020 inflated prices stayed high, but everything dependent on the price of oil went up in price as well.\n\nMoreover, Trump's hand out programs mostly didn't hand out money until 2021-2023, after he left office; I worked for one of those programs. Getting the money out was a logistical nightmare because nothing was set up beforehand, so all the programs were very slapdash and the first programs led to tons of fraud.\n\nPlus he literally just handed out thousands of dollars in 2020 and 2021 directly to everyone.\n\nThe reason why inflation is down now is because Trump's ridiculous overspending - cutting taxes + increasing spending - finally ran out.",

Those who didn't cast a vote don't count. That's how it works. \n\nYou can make whatever assumptions you wish about how those who didn't cast a vote *might have* voted, but, at the end of the day, that's all it is...assumption. You could just as easily make the same claim that the people who didn't vote *would have* voted for Harris but didn't because they bought into the notion Harris was already going to win without their votes. \n\nSince assumptions don't add anything productive to the conversation, I'll stick with the identifiable facts.",

We don't know for sure, but the one thing that's for sure is these voters lacked the intelligence to understand the value of true democracy and how many people died for their right to vote and how many oppressive regimes out there currently prevent their citizens from voicing their opinions.

More than half a trillion dollars every year. So $18 billion is a rounding error. Also, that means that these tariffs are on specific things, probably to protect a US industry sector that is already set up. Targeted tariffs could serve a purpose; general tariffs, such as on everything coming in from Country X, would cause more harm than good.",

Biden's \"targeted\" tariffs don't accomplish anything either and will also drive up costs of goods for Americans. like if you are going to oppose something, at least be consistent. But I can see how tariffs, much like fracking, and separating immigrant families at the border, and mass deportations, etc. are only bad when Republicans do them",

      "body": "For all the people blaming the government for grocery and rent prices\u2026 the average inflation rate across 4 years of Biden was 5.2%. For reference, it was 8% under Ford and 9.9% under beloved peanut farmer Jimmy Carter. Prices don\u2019t just triple out of nowhere in 3 years even when inflation rates are seemingly higher than they \u201cshould be\u201d (target is ~2%). The real problem in my humble opinion is that large corporations see us blaming the government for prices raising and use it as an opportunity to hike prices while receiving zero backlash because their role in the problem gets overlooked. I paid 35 dollars last week at a CVS in NYC for two sticks of deodorant and a tube of toothpaste. 8 bucks for a bag of tortilla chips. That\u2019s not inflation, that\u2019s pure unadulterated corporate greed. I don\u2019t have communist or socialist political ideals at all, but the corporate greed and obsession with the bottom line in today\u2019s America disgusts me. A good, ethical business takes care of its customers while maintaining a sufficient profit margin to keep their employees well paid and happy. Those kinds of businesses are hard to find these days. And part of the issue, frankly, is the way economics is taught at most universities. Half the curriculum is literally using calculus to figure out exactly how much you can milk your customers before they get fed up and turn to your competitors. I certainly didn\u2019t see any classes teaching ethical business practices at my college.",

This is why laptops are designed in America and manufactured overseas. \n\nIf the US had a large laptop manufacturing sector employing millions of employees then maybe there\u2019s a debate to be had. The reality is that manufacturing has already left and unemployment is super low. The US importing more than it exports is a benefit of being RICH!",

ANY additional tariffs will INCREASE the price of goods coming from those countries. It really doesn't matter the reasoning. Additional tariffs will indeed be passed on to the American consumer, per how tariffs work. What's hilarious about this comment chain is whatever medias you Magas normally listen to are obviously unable to spoon feed you bs that \"disproves\" the claim that the tariffs will raise prices, because even they know exactly what's going to happen. Even Musk has said that the American consumer is going to feel it for a couple of years \"before manufacturing comes back\". Which is extra funny considering the difference in cost of labor between where things are currently manufactured and here, not even mentioning us having the lowest unemployment levels ever and the projected decline in the american population in the next few decades. \n\nYou guys literally elected the billionaire business class to kill market competition. That's all they've promised to do so far. I guess besides Donnie's \"concept of a healthcare plan\".",

Because it rewards companies who commit to this. Which is great.\n\nMaking companies like Intel, Dell or HP eat a tariff doesn't aid them in building industry domestically, which they are already comitted to do with the CHIPS act. All it does is ultimately increase cost for US consumers and industry for as long as the tariff is applied. Because lets be real, they ain't eating that tariff.",

Again, **IF** this happens at all, it will take an *extremely long* time to ramp up our production.\n\nIn the end, for your 'best case' scenario to even remotely have legs, we'll be eating these massive markups for roughly a decade or more all while our wages continue to stagnate and the tariffs lead to cuts to domestic safety net programs that further keep us all as wage slaves.\n\nSo you might eventually get to a point where we're producing more goods domestically, but at the cost of us as consumers not having any money to buy those goods.\n\nTrump is not a serious man, and this 'plan' is going to, as your buddy Elon noted, result in MAGA \"fucking themselves in the face\".\n\nSo I can't wait for you and those like you to get yours, my 'fellow' citizen!!

Many meat packing facilities import from Brazil and Argentina and cut and package in the US then ship to local grocery stores as \"US\" since the final \"work\" was done in the US. \n\nHonda, Nissan, and Toyota built US assembly plants in the 1980s+ to take advantage of tariff rules over the years, final assembly gets the most \"value added\" portion while towns are happy to get 3,000 jobs for a new warehouse to assemble things.\n\n.",

The sheer cost to build semiconductor manufacturing in the us in such a short period of time will induce massive cost and manufactures arent going to just eat all the risk, theyll pass the price onto the consumer. Then ontop of that the US pays much higher wages, has higher workplace standards, and more employee benefits making even baseline price much more. \n\nEven once everything settles down and cost to produce goes down to a minimum, people have now settled for the new price point. And while prices may go down a little. Your $400 laptop today will still be probably twice the cost excluding inflation afterwards.",

Cook sold Trump on the idea that an iPhone tax would benefit Samsung Electronics Co., a South Korean rival to Apple. He also pitched the administration on the Apple Watch being a life-saving device. That product briefly had a 15% tariff, but it was reduced in 2020.\u201d\n\nGranted, not completely avoid the tariff so I correct myself on that. But they and some other companies were able to curry favors with Trump to avoid the full effect last time",

But if you want to really work you still need a proper computer and in terms of the market these days that means a laptop. \n\nYou can still buy desktops but usually you walk into an electronics store and hit the computer section you're lucky if they have a couple of gaming desktops. The rest is rows of laptops and tablets. \n\nWhen it comes to smaller electronics like phones and tablets I prefer android. I don't spend a lot of money when I need a new phone or tablet. I'm not an Apple person so that helps when it comes to buying stuff like that.\n\nPeople do work a lot on laptops. A lot of gamers they still like their desktops though there are good gaming laptops out there too. Laptops are ultra portable these days even if you opt for a bigger screen. \n\nI don't see that changing much. People have a lot of options when it comes to fun but for doing actual work a laptop or desktop is still the norm. \n\nOne thing I have noticed is that monitors have been getting a lot cheaper and screens are larger for the same money. 21 to 27 inch monitor is the norm and you can get a decent one for well. under $150 now. A few years ago the same thing would have been way more money. \n\nI don't see regular laptops and desktops completely vanishing because they are still needed for work but tablets and smaller computers like Chrome books are definitely a major thing. \n\nThe kids in school more and more they have tablets or Chrome books that are actually given to them to use. They don't have lockers full of heavy textbooks now. They just have it all on the portable machines. \n\nIt's just a matter of the right gadget for the task but I think there is still a market for everything computer-wise though these days more and more you have to shop online to get what you need at a decent price...",

Considering the US is at the forefront of tech and information, this will impact us greatly. \n\nThe best solution here is to encourage and incentivise domestic production. Not only would that increase jobs on US soil, but it would drastically lessen our reliance on foreign produced goods. The downside is that while one of the goals is to lessen the financial burden on US consumers, domestic production may be more expensive, assuming today's pre Trump tariff state (proposed). \n\nThe problem with outsourced production of tech hardware and software abroad are the security concerns of that tech being shared or easier to be stolen by other countries. \n\nImagine Taiwan were to be successfully or even unsuccessfully invaded. The impact to the US would be even greater than tariffs alone. So we need a strategic approach if we we to impose tariffs. When, how to do it, how much, etc. All need to be addressed concerning domestic production vs foreign production and tariffs alike.",

For the money they are asking it's a very good laptop. \n\n17\" screen, 32 GB Ram, 1 TB drive. Black Friday deal about $400 after coupon. I got the business model not the gaming model but I've had no problem playing the casual games I like on it. \n\nI downgraded to Win 10 Pro because the Windows 11 Home that came on it was a hot mess. Until I switched I had random crashes and the R click menu wasn't working right. Windows 10 Pro this laptop works great, practically purrs. \n\nIt's very fast and I'm very pleased with it thus far. I'm going to stay with Win 10 Pro and just get a better security suite when Win 10 stops being supported. \n\nThey have great customer service. They are very responsive if you need info or have an issue. There is a Nimo subreddit too. \n\nHonestly this does it for me for a long time. There's no lack of electronics here. I've got an old but speedy desktop that I inherited from a guy in my building. I have my new laptop, a cheap android tablet for reading, and a year old phone that can do 5G. I have an older DSLR.  \n\nAll work well and are everything I need. I can easily wait out said tariffs and will. In any case most of the time I buy used gear anyway and there is plenty of stuff on the second hand market. \n\nI'm a little nervous about how this tariff thing will affect local food prices but otherwise I planned ahead.\n\nI wasn't planning on the new laptop but the price on the Nimo one was so good for the specs that I decided to do it. Right now I'm sick a lot and I'm having major back issues again. I am spending a lot of time in bed and I needed a light weight laptop that was fast enough to voice type on. I'm doing everything from bed about 2/3 of the time so I figured it was a necessary evil. \n\nI still need a proper laptop desk that fits it. Right now it's on a table beside my bed but I need something that's workable to put it on the bed in front of me instead. I'm looking on Amazon for that but so far I'm not finding anything I like that's not expensive. \n\nIf you're going to do any major electronics purchase I'd advise you to do it now before things change. By the end of 2025 everything like that could be really unaffordable to buy new..",

If Americans have to pay $300 for a sheet of plywood, Trump can blame Canada and use American anger as a pretext to seize territory.  It's an insane notion, but we have elected an insane person. He wants his legacy to be territorial expansion and will probably try to get his face carved on Mount Rushmore and rename Greenland \"Trump Island.\" I don't think he will get away with any of this, but he will try because he's a Machiavellian narcissist with a god complex.",

This whole Tariff's thing is Trump's massive idea to paywall oversea countries to pay billions of dollars for exempt status or lose profits due to strangling our own economy. \n\n This will cause all out trade wars that will not only impact our country. But other countries as well because if they can't make the large amount of profits off US consumers and don't wanna pay the bribes. They will cease importing to USA and jack up the prices else where to make up the difference. All while they wait out this massive level of idiocy until someone either throws Trump out of office, Override his Tariff's or wait out his term. \n\n These idiots don't realize that the largest consumers in this country are not the middle and upper classes. It's the lower classes that blindly spend money to ignore how badly they're getting screwed by overpriced garbage and high interest rates. This will attack the already crumbling pillars that make these idiots rich in the first place and if they continue this course. It will lead to another great depression if not a total economic collapse.",

Maintaining domestic steel production is an example of that.  Because the federal government (20% of our economy) is buying US made goods, it helps keep domestic production alive.\n\nTrump's tariffs are on *everything*, even consumer goods.  While Biden was okay with the feds paying higher prices, Trump is going to raise prices on the things that *we* need.",

But the consumer doesn't see WHY the increase in price, just that it's gone up.\n\nAs an example, let's say 2 countries introduce new taxes. Country 1 charges a 10% purchase tax to consumers, and Country 2 charges a 10% tariff to importers.\n\nItem is imported in both countries at a cost of $100, and the importers also then directly sell the product to consumers with a 10% mark-up on their import costs, at $110.\n\nCountry 1 introduces their sales tax of 10%. Importer still charges $110, but that's now $110 + $11 sales tax, for a total of $121, visible on the consumers receipt.\n\nCountry 2 introduces their 10% import tariff. Importer is now paying $110 to have the product imported, so, still wanting their 10% mark-up, they now charge $121.\n\nIn both instances, consumers now pay $121, but sales tax means customers can see WHY the product has increased, tariffs \"hide\" the reasoning, making it easier to shift blame for why.",

              "body": "I appreciate the reply. I'll preface this by saying that I am in the US and am only casually familiar with VAT, but whenever I see anything listed for sale on a UK website, it always has the post-VAT price and says \"VAT Included\", or something similar. I don't know if that is the case universally, but it seems like VAT is equally hidden and consumers are only seeing the total price including VAT. In the US, sales tax is always added after the fact and clearly itemized. Also, my understanding of VAT is that it is actually added to each step of the sale process. Manufacturers get it from the distributor who gets it from the retailer who gets it from the consumer, who ultimately pays for it all in the end. Or something like that, where each leg of the transaction gets credit for the VAT they paid vs what they collected from the other side. \n\nIf I am not mistaken, UK also charges hefty import duties as well. As do most other countries. Not only on purchases from stores, but even on person-to-person transactions. I know this because many people in those countries often ask for an item to be marked as a \"gift\" to get around paying insane import fees. So it seems like the UK, and many other countries, get hit by fees all around.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying adding import tariffs to the US would be a good thing. I'm personally against it as I don't want the costs of good to go up (either directly or indirectly). I just find it a bit hypocritical when people/organizations in other countries talk about how bad this is, and yet don't equally complain about their own system which is even worse. But based on what I've seen, it seems like the US not charging import fees on most items is actually the unusual outlier compared to most other countries. Which is why our products are so inexpensive compared to other countries. Well, one of the reasons.",

                  "body": "\"Import duties\" are something paid I think the world over. Here in Australia, if I import personally something valued at over $1,000, then I have to pay those myself. \n\nTariffs are different in that they're generally used in a much more targeted fashion, at specific origins or industries. Here, for instance, we have a specific \"luxury vehicle import tax,\" which was ostensibly meant to protect Australian car manufacturing, which has now still left our shores, and we're still left paying $200,000 for a new Audi or BMW (very generalised and somewhat hyperbolic, but you get the point).\n\nYou're correct that sales tax is the whole way through the chain. Our GST is a \"goods and services tax\" which basically means if someone is getting an invoice for something, on that invoice, there is a line that adds +10% GST, which is then incorporated into the total. This is why, in my example, I simplified it to \"from importer to consumer.\" Because even without taxes, there's also then all the mark-ups that happen in that chain so each layer gets their piece of the pie.\n\nSticker prices on shelves for consumers will usually have a singular (GST inclusive) price, with something like \"inc. GST\" on the sticker, but our receipts will still have that itemised (which was what I said above).",

Trump is appeasing the wealthy US business owners who will now have less competition...unless its for their jobs, because trump expanded the H1B visas as well.  Brining in people from outside the country to fill highly skilled jobs, and imposing tariffs on other countries that will increase cost of a ton of shit.  \n\nI feel bad for anyone not invested in the market...investing in these american companies is the only way to hedge your bets.

The executive\u2019s of a company have an obligation to stabilize profits, and when they can increase them. \n\nJimJimmery is right that a company cannot operate at a loss. They may have investors expecting returns. There may be creditors expecting repayment and interest, there may be customers expecting products already in order. \n\nDepending on the product, there may be customers that use the product to create their products. Much like raw materials-> components-> circuit boards-> laptops. \n\nImagine that copper is mostly imported. If the total cost of importing copper increases we will pay more for what we would normally use. I happen to be a chip manufacturer and now I need to produce some chips and my copper costs have increased. Well if everyone\u2019s cost increased then prices would increase to offset the costs. Unless we could source elsewhere where the good could be found lower. \n\nIn that same manufacturing chain the cost gets passed on to each link until we have a finished product that is out in sale at an increased price. \n\nThis is how inflation impacts prices. How scarcity impacts prices, and how consumers ultimately pay the price for government decisions. \n\nBut the same goes for subsidizing products. The general public pays for that indirectly as well. Through either taxes paid, or if subsidized by tax breaks, deficits or loss of programs due to a lack of resources.",

Lawmakers immediately started drafting new tariff legislation, and in 1894, the Wilson-Gorman Tariff passed, which lowered US tariff averages.[15] The 1890 tariff was also poorly received abroad. Protectionists in the British Empire used it to argue for tariff retaliation and imperial trade preference.[16]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Tariff#Reactions",

You not only have to build factories you also have to build the infrastructure. This will take years on top of being insanely expensive for these companies. You\u2019d have to do this over several industries because laptops consists of many separate parts. And that\u2019s disregarding getting the materials to build these parts. Sure you could import these or go a step further and get the parts to just assemble the laptops in the USA but that doesn\u2019t work either because there\u2019s still tariffs on everything needed to build a laptop. On top of all that you have to pay your workers more, they work less, have more protections, and you have to stick to a bunch of rules. All of which takes a chunk out of your profits. Laptops produced in China will simply still be cheaper than the stuff produced in the USA even with tariffs applied.",

I didn\u2019t say anywhere.\n\n> Where do you personally draw the line, why produce anything in the USA? Everything will be cheaper coming out of India and China, so why not just mothball the remaining manufacturing the USA has?\n\nDid you actually read my comment? It is viable where there\u2019s either an already existing industry, the related industries are already in place and/or the raw materials are readily available. The only way it will work in other industries is through massive subsidies. That money has to come form somewhere. Usually your pocket through higher taxes or through budget cuts in other places. Like healthcare or education. So not only are you paying more for USA made laptops than for laptops made in China, you also have less money in your pocket and/or you children will be dumb as fuck and sick. \n\n> It doesn\u2019t take years, you\u2019ll be surprised how much money motivates people to accomplish things, you could get a basic production up and running in months.\n\nYou could. But, again, in this case it wouldn\u2019t make the companies any money. What does make them money is stay put wherever they are and raise prices for their products to cover tariffs. Unless of course subsidies. Which I covered above.\n\n> In fact the USA is already looking to start producing microchips in the USA instead of importing, something which you say is not possible... The investment into it is billions which means it will get up and running very quickly.\n\nAgain didn\u2019t say anywhere it\u2019s not possible. Simply not cost effective. Define running very quickly cus it has been three years since those initial investments were made and so far it\u2019s not exactly up and running. Of course producing chips is a great idea tho. I don\u2019t disagree with that. However, where are you gonna get the raw materials for the chips from and all the other parts you need for laptops? \n\n> There\u2019s tons of businesses in the UK and the USA whose entire USP is the fact it\u2019s made in that country.\n\nYes, for the third time, I don\u2019t disagree with that nor did I say anywhere it\u2019s not possible.\n\n> Double or triple the price of an iPhone in order to get a made in the USA version and every celebrity and wannabe rich person will own one...\n\nOk and how are the people that can\u2019t afford the laptops from China, which are 68% more expensive, afford the made in USA laptops that are now 100%-200% more expensive? Like who is gonna buy them if nobody buys the cheaper ones cus they can\u2019t afford them?\n\nThere are of course ways to bring manufacturing back to wherever but those would require severe reforms and fixing of systemic issues. Something most governments and their corporate overlords are not exactly interested in.",

It is simply not cost effective across multiple business segments even with tariffs in place. \n\nChina has no labor laws, whereas the US (despite what people think) has very strict labor laws including minimum wage, benefits for full time and part time workers, and PTO. It simply costs more to pay people in the US. \n\nThe US does not have the physical infrastructure in place for simple manufacturing. It\u2019s hard to conceptualize, but planning, developing, and implementing manufacturing plants is extremely difficult in the US. We have a lot of land in the US, but our population is isolated into many big cities. The US has, historically, done a great job of identifying specific complex manufacturing industries that are extremely profitable like aircraft/aerospace in locations close to large cities to be attractive to workers. \n\nLastly, we don\u2019t have the workforce for simple manufacturing. We have relatively consistent and low unemployment. Most average Americans have quality 9-5 jobs that pay decently. To bring back basic manufacturing to the US, you would need those people to quit their, already profitable, jobs in the segments they work in today and then move to manual/physical labor jobs. More than likely, they will also need to relocate to less ideal locations where plants can be built. And without subsidies, they will also almost certainly be taking pay cuts. You\u2019ve also left behind gaps in the workforce that they left to trade for low education simple manufacturing. \n\nThe end result of these tariffs, at least in the tech world, is manufacturing will stay where it is. The price of goods will increase across the distribution landscape all the way to the end customer. If you see any tech companies moving manufacturing from overseas, it will be due to [subsidies that you are paying for with your tax dollars.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIPS_and_Science_Act). \n\nIt\u2019s fine if you want manufacturing in the US. Regardless, the prices of the goods will go up. You will be the one funding the prices of the goods going up with your tax dollars and paying the higher prices. You will be relegating your workforce to low education, manual/physical labor pools rather than the current profitable business segments that we are world leaders in like IT, Security, Pharmaceuticals, Aerospace. \n\nThe only people that want any of this are the people that are low education laborers, or the wealthy that want to keep people lower class.",

Taxation without representation inspired our founding fathers to stop paying taxes and literally overthrow their government. Another way to fight back against the government is public opinion: advocate against war and other such things that make our government more powerful and wealthy.\n\n\nBoycotting corporations is far more legal and I don\u2019t think you are asking about that.\n\n\nAs for the second stated question: corporations can have a huge impact on what the government does. They can lobby and literally buy the votes of our government officials. So that answers your question about how but not about why.\n\nThe reason why corporations arent doing anything about \u201chim\u201d is that they are on the same side of this struggle. They are class allies and don\u2019t want to see each other fail. Tariffs don\u2019t directly effect the corporations, but the consumer.",

      "body": "Well, that's one compelling reason to keep using your older laptop / PC, and toss Linux on it.\n\nI mean, I bought a new Ryzen 7 micro PC this Christmas, for 300 bucks... so, adding 68% to that price, would be a little painful, but nothing that would prohibit me from making a leap to a better performing piece of hardware.  I bought two other micros, just to tinker with, and one to use as a router.\n\nMy point with this ramble, is that, most people, who work with computers, will pay the price, those that tinker, have freecycle options... and early adopters of tech, have always been willing to pay out the nose for bleeding edge hardware.\n\nIf it gets tough on you, and you're a student, with little to no budget...make friends with the local I.T staff at your school, and see if they have any \"junk\" they want to get rid of...most schools swap out computers every 5 years, just to keep up with tech...at worse, you might get some info on a state auction site, to pick up a whole warehouse full of old tech for a few hundred bucks, if you're willing to pick it up, and do the work to get them up and running. They may just invite you over one day to help them clean out their \"Junk Room\" and let you keep whatever you find, because it is in their way.",

Lawmakers immediately started drafting new tariff legislation, and in 1894, the Wilson-Gorman Tariff passed, which lowered US tariff averages.[15] The 1890 tariff was also poorly received abroad. Protectionists in the British Empire used it to argue for tariff retaliation and imperial trade preference.[16]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Tariff#Reactions",

The price will probably increase a little to offset the cost, but there's a sweetspot on the supply demand curve where you want to be, to maximize the people actually buying your product while also covering your costs. \n\nHaving said that, Biden has worked to diversify the sources of computing components (thanks pandemic) and any tariffs affecting the traditional locations of those sources will only strengthen the Biden alternatives. Which is ironic. \n\nRemember that trump only lost control of inflation due to a pandemic, and that it stayed around 2% during his inane tariff wars last time.",

Even then, after everything was built just to start producing those things here, resources would still have to be imported for production, and now labor would be dramatically more expensive so the consumers still end up with a massively more expensive product and American buying power is greatly reduced.  \n\nIt's literally cheaper for all of the companies impacted by this to just wait for it to blow up in everybody's face so that a government change would see somebody removing the tariffs.  Anybody who tries to start building that infrastructure here would just be wasting money until the tariffs would eventually be removed after backlash from the damage they cause on American consumers, and then they would just be competing with the cheaper imported products anyway so it would be a losing effort.",

So everything about profit margin here is you just trying to use business words you know to make it seem like you understand what you're talking about when it's overwhelmingly obvious that you don't. \n\n\nIf you raised your prices by 20% it doesn't reduce your tax burden on your total profits one bit. You don't understand basic math or income tax.  \n\nYour tax burden is a constant 20% of your profits. No matter how high the profits are or how low the profits are, it's always 20%.  \n\nYou still pay the 20% no matter how high you raise the price.  If you raised the price 100%, You're still paying 20% of whatever your profits are.  Always.  The customers don't pay that for you.  20% of $10 or 20% of a million dollars is still going to be 20% that you have to pay.  \n\nThis is different from a tariff in that it's going to be an upfront cost on importing materials or goods.  If you're importing $1,000 of t-shirts at a 20% tariff, raising your sale price will cover that because it is a static number.  It's not variable based on whatever your profits are like an income taxes.  It's $200. You just have to raise the price enough to cover the $200.  \n\nThis is very clearly a situation where things can be explained to you but they cannot be understood for you.",

So you raise prices by 25% to move the tax burden on the consumer.\n\nThis is why in the US many places do not list the tax on their products, to hide the fact they're moving the tax burden on the consumer and appear more competitive.\n\nI do not believe you run a business if you do not know even basic percentage math taught in elementary schools.\n\nEdit:\n\n>in the example numbers I gave you, I never stated what the expense was to make that $10 profit.\n\nIt's a simple math problem...\nYou said taxing 20% of $10 profit costs $2. Then raising prices (you specifically said prices) by 20% would end up with $12 in profit and $2,4 in taxes.\n\nThe only way profits increase to $12 or 20% when raising prices by 20% is if the margin is 100%, because expenses do not scale with a price increase... you should know this much if you ran a business.\n\nIf the price is 100 percentage units and expenses are 80 percentage units of that, raising prices to 120 percentage units and expenses remaining at the old 80 percentage units, would make your profit margin from 20 percentage units of 100 percentage units to 40 percentage units of 120 percentage units.\n\nIn other words, raising prices by 20% would increase your profit margin by 66,7%. Unless you had no expenses (100% profit margin) and therefore it'd remain the same.\n\nThis isn't rocket science, you silly goose. Your expenses do not magically multiply if you change the price.",
