      "body": "From the link:  \"The Biden administration has unveiled its \u201cAI diffusion rule,\u201d which aims to restrict the export of GPUs that are most coveted for AI applications. Although it does not mention the nation by name, it's broadly viewed as a means to prevent China from outpacing the US in AI development.\n\nThe rule proposes three licensing tiers. The first tier is unrestricted and includes the domestic market as well as 18 strategic allies. The majority of countries fall into a second tier, which will have caps on how much compute power they can import via top GPUs from the US. The third tier includes China, Russia, Iran and North Korea, and effectively bars US companies from selling their most powerful GPUs there.\n\nUS-based companies would also be prevented from sharing many details of their AI software models with countries outside that first tier, and would need to ask permission from the federal government before building large data centers in any tier two nation.\"",

No country can manufacture these chips completely in-house (including the US), and what US sanctions do - more than preventing direct sales - is freeze China out of the global supply chain.\n\nEven with China pouring the required billions into this annually (at a time where the Chinese economy is slowing), they still can't produce the ultra-pure silicone, EUV lithography machines, EDA tools, or numerous other critical components. Each one of these might take a decade of investment to get to where we are now, by which point their global rivals have a decade more experience working with these chips, no longer have the overheads associated with a newly refitted fab, and will already be rolling out their newer, faster nodes.\n\nChip War by Chris Miller is a good, well researched book on this.",
