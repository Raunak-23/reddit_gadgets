Maybe the current draw was too much for the power supply they wanted to use, or maybe it was because the CRT needed to be woken up in a nonstandard way and apple just didn't want to deal with the support/software hassle. I think the only technical thing keeping CRTs from working with the box is it doesn't pass through the analog video signal pins, which seems like it would both be a very easy thing to fix and probably something they would have to do deliberately in the first place.\n\neither way, it was a pretty lame thing for apple to do to its customers who bought the CRT.",

Many smaller computers even mount to the back of the monitor so in that case the cables would be running up there anyway.

While it's not a game changer for me directly on any given day, I would say it's a game changer for the general UX and use over time - and how many people will be impacted by this.

Yes, it had a big bulky connector you had to screw in, but it was capable of higher data throughput because it was functionally equivalent to two HDMI connectors. It took a while for HDMI to completely catch up. While I think the physical connector is probably the number one reason why HDMI won, I'd venture a close second would be that HDMI licensing usually required implementing HDCP. Gotta make life harder on your users, after all.\n\nThese days there's an even better royalty-free standard in the form of DisplayPort. The original DP connector is better than HDMI and has a great self-locking connector, but nowadays I think most people probably know it better as the video output capability of USB-C.",

Obviously Las Vegas felt that the monorail was not enough, otherwise they would not have started the bidding process for a new or expanded system. And Boring won the bidding process.

To go above that, your device probably needs a DC-to-DC converter, which is adds costs and reduces efficiency.\n\nI'd like it to be a bigger, more robust connector, ideally with an optional locking mechanism.

I shouldn't need to explain how proper spying is the stuff we don't know about. The more you know about the size of a spy network, the less effective it is. If you know more about the size of the US network than the Chinese one that doesn't tell you that the US is larger, it just means that the US is more widely known.\n\nEffective spying is like an iceberg where it looks small to unnoticeable on the surface but is massive below.\n\nThink of it this way. Say we know about 5 US spies and 1 Chinese spy. That doesn't mean that the US has a larger network if they have 5 spies we don't know about and China has 99.",

We're talking about spying, not invading.\n\n> How many countries has China gone to war with in the last, I dunno, 50 years?

I never made any argument that America invade less than China, we're talking about their aggression with spying, surveillance and that general area.",

So just because the connector connects doesn't mean that it's always going to be compatible. That's my point. However they organize the cables inside of that USBC Is different than another cable that charges your phone. \n\nI'm more knowledgeable about this than normal because I recently got a whole bunch of different USBC cables and tested them out with all my different devices so that I wasn't wasting any port that could do either faster or higher volume charging.",
