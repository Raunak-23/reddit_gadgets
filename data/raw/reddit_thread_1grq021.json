I totally forgot those were even a thing. The One S/X's are still grouped with the original Xbox One, so the Series S/X games won't work on them still",

          "body": "Their naming is completely fucked.  The issue they had was PlayStation was on PS3 while Xbox would have been called the Xbox 2.  Dumb consumers especially parents buying consoles for their kids would automatically buy a PS3 because a 3 is bigger than a 2 so it must be newer and better.  So to combat that, they called their second gen Xbox the Xbox 360.  Also 360 sounds bigger than just the number 3.  Well that screwed them with naming because their next Xbox they called the Xbox One.  PlayStation moved to PS4.  And I truly thing the name Xbox one is also one reason it wasn\u2019t as successful as the ps4 (not counting all the always online and Kinect crap that killed them that generation).  Now they have series x and series s but again the naming convention is confusing for non gamer consumers buying consoles for their kids or spouse etc.",

Once you isolate the gaming element of each company, it's pretty crystal clear.\n\nXbox still hasn't made any public commitment that they have made any profit on GamePass, making it likely that they are juggling massive amounts of debt to keep it running. (Expenses of catalog are probably more than revenue of subscribers.) This isn't even mentioning acquisition costs. Meanwhile, their market share continue to drop year over year.\n\nPlayStation, Steam, and Nintendo all take slightly more of Xbox's piece of the pie annually. To respond, Xbox continues to spend ridiculous amounts of money that goes into acquisitions and programs that don'tdo anything for brand/hardware loyalty. Phil Spencer is either out of the loop here or lying to save face. The future of Xbox, ironically as they phrased it to Nintendo, is \"not selling games on its own hardware.\"\n\nI say all of this as someone who grew up with an Xbox, upgraded to the 360, and then bought an Xbox One with my first few paychecks as an adult. Xbox chased their people away and have continued to do so.",

Either GamePass will be a failed platform or they will need to drastically increase the cost of GamePass\n\nThink early DoorDash. It wasn't profitable. It was virtually the cost of food and a tip and turned no profit. Today you are charged a delivery fee, handling fee, and uncharged on any food you ordered. That's objectively the future of GamePass. Especially as their market share continues to dwindle and they have less console users to advertise it to. PC GamePass is a thing, but it doesn't even dent into Valve's market.\n\nBest of luck with your battle. I'm rooting for you.",

Xbox as a home console business and maybe the business of the entire platform cannot afford to have a drought when they are losing market share and/or don't have the dominant position in market share.  If everybody has Playstation... then there's no desire to get an Xbox.\n\nIf you want to gain market share, you need to give people a reason to make a switch if they're not already on that platform.  You are asking people to give up a library of games under Playstation, to give up their friends list, their trophies, if you're into multiplayer and the game(s) aren't cross-play then you're giving up multiplayer communities/player numbers, etc, to make that switch, and that's a very tall order.  Without giving people that reason to switch... people are just going to stay where they are.  For Playstation, that means it can sit on its roost and do nothing.  Xbox doesn't get the same luxury unless it's happy with what market share it has, it's happy with sales numbers for their software, and they aren't looking to grow more than where they are right now.  As a publicly traded company, staying in your lane is **never** the MO... so I can't imagine that Microsoft is not looking to grow.  They should be in overdrive mode if they want to grow, the way Nintendo was after the Wii U bombed and they were like \"holy shit this could be the end of our entire video game centric business if we don't course correct\"... and that's how we got the Switch and the absolute fucking barrage of Nintendo software that that console got within its first 3 years or so.",

They care that you buy an Xbox product whether that's a console, game, gamepass, etc. As you noticed, the media industry has evolved in every way in how people see, connect, purchase, and consume media. Whether that's Blockbuster to Netflix, from cable to streaming, from physical to digital, from buying a physical VHS/DISC to digtial license to subscription, from single player games to service based games. \n\nEvery single part of the media landscape has evolved EXPECT consoles relationship to all of those previously mentioned things. Consoles are still stuck in the Genesis Vs NES days aka a console war. I don't know exactly how it all works but Xbox is trying to evolve how people interact with consoles, just as the entire media landscape has evolved around it.",

I think what\u2019s pathetic is the fact that a lot of people especially Sony fanboys still believe that Sony cares about them even though Sony has been dropping their first party games on pc and those games aren\u2019t exclusives anymore. I\u2019m confused as to how a lot of people especially Sony fanboys don\u2019t see the writing on the wall already. Why do you think Sony is so fixated on making live service and subscription games? I think Sony is trying to compromise and change the way they go about business because they understand that this is the only reason as to how they can stay afloat. You guys think that now there are more ways to about playing Xbox games which is weakening the Xbox brand? I can understand if there are people don\u2019t like seeing this direction because they still believe in this whole console exclusivity which is not true anymore because Pc gaming has been getting all of sony first party allegedly exclusives games and Sony didn\u2019t care about locking those games down as exclusives. You don\u2019t need a PlayStation console to play those quote unquote exclusive game which you know the same argument that people especially Sony fanboys use towards Xbox. What I find confusing is the fact that a lot of people especially Sony fanboys have so much confidence in the concept of exclusivity even though Sony is essentially backdooring their customers by putting all the major exclusives on pc and nobody says that would disvalue the PlayStation console. The highest selling games on PlayStation 5 happen to be Xbox games which are Diablo 4, call of duty and sea of thieves. A lot of people especially Sony fanboys are mad at the fact that Microsoft has expanded further past the whole concept of a console and this is how how they\u2019re making their money. Microsoft has outgrew the concept of console gaming and they realize that they can make money off on mobile platform, pc platform, and even from Sony fanboys. That\u2019s why Sony is struggling and Microsoft Xbox isn\u2019t. Microsoft is able to offer their games on Xbox ecosystem through subscription service for their consumers while Sony fanboys have to pay for those games on their ps5. Let\u2019s be honest. Sony always does things late and PlayStation 5 is just Xbox one of this generation. Microsoft decided to put their games on pc during the Xbox one era and moved it to something else. Sony will follow suit and Sony are always known for copying Microsoft Xbox.  Since PlayStation owners didn\u2019t pick up an Xbox console and Xbox owners didn\u2019t pick up a PlayStation console  all this time, now Microsoft xbox and Sony have to find a way to bridge the gap so they can continue to make money.",

They wouldn't have the ability to make residual revenue off players since they don't own the Xbox digital storefront / Game Pass. If they *could* find a way to make the hardware profitable, why can't Xbox do the same?",

This is an increase of $2.56 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cNintendo is slightly down revenue-wise, at least for calendar 2023. The company made about $12.08 billion in 2023, down -4% from last year\u2019s $12.6 billion.\u201d\n\nSo, is Nintendo a failure?  Should they just shut down as a company since they are in third place, even though they are also profitable (in fact their margins are the highest)?\n\nNote Xbox\u2019s division\u2019s profit margins were HIGHER than PlayStation last year.
