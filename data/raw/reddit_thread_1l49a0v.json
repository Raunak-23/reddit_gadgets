If someone is smoking next to a leaky propane tank I don't have to wait for there to be a multi-fatality explosion to realize that's a bad fucking idea.  Obviously, this isn't quite that level of incompetent stupidity. But dropping this box from 3-4 feet up on 4 out of its 6 sides has a solid chance of causing damage to the console.  That's garbage design, man. \n\nMuch more durable components for other things are packaged with more crush allowance to prevent there being a problem.  Any kind of shipping of these things outside of a non-palatized method is a recipe for losses in transit.",

What\u2019s even more ridiculous is the counterstance: complaining about a problem that doesn\u2019t exist just so you can rage on the internet. \n\nIf there WAS a problem, you think it wouldn\u2019t have come out already over the last eight years? This thread proves that argument. This is ONE STORE on ONE NIGHT and it got around within hours of it occurring, with major gaming news sites like IGN covering it. If any substantial problem existed with the packaging, we would have heard about it. \n\nBut no, it hasn\u2019t happened and the Switch packaging is fine. Despite that, people need to complain like it has happened so they can have a made up problem and have nerd rage. Now THAT\u2019S ridiculous.\n\nFINALLY, let\u2019s talk about \u201closses during non-palatized transit\u201d. This is actually perfect timing. I had my last Switch 2 arrive yesterday direct from Nintendo (I bought multiple for family and a coupe for friends who couldn\u2019t get preorders). Whoever packed the box packed it with the system face down toward the bottom with no cushion below, my GC controller on top of that, and air pillow whatever they\u2019re called packing on top of that. The bottom of the box clearly had incurred some impact because it was pushed in a bit. That worried me. As I unpacked the box, I couldn\u2019t believe their warehouse workers would put the system on the bottom, face down. That absolutely IS a problem. But despite that, guess what arrived in perfect condition? Yes, the Switch 2 is just fine. CLEARLY, there is no issue with the packaging and I\u2019ll take my experience as proof. I did examine the box carefully and noticed that the system doesn\u2019t sit quite flush with the lid. It actually does have a bit of room between the lid and the screen. \n\nBut hey, that must all be nonsense. Believe what you want to believe, but after that experience yesterday- and no outstanding issues over the last 8 years- I\u2019ll believe reality\u2026.not angry dorks with some weird anti-Nintendo vendetta posting online.",
