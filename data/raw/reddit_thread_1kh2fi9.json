That gave way too much attention, I had a friend who was playing BoTW in front of my eyes and when I asked which emulator he was using, he asked me what an emulator was. It was THAT easy. I don't see why I should blame the emulators devs for doing that. You could blame the Yuzu devs for making too much money with their patreon because they'd lock the early access versions behind a paywall, but Ryujinx were square.\n\nIt's just bound to happen when piracy becomes THAT easy and mainstream.

They weren't making \"too much money\" because nothing was locked behind a paywall, and that's probably why Nintendo never tried to sue them, they just knocked on someone's door and threatened. That's what they do.\n\nAnd honestly, even in Yuzu's case, I don't think they were cooked on the matter of who's right, but they were definitely cooked on the matter of Nintendo having time, energy and resources to spend on court.",

Allocating memory, sending the command buffers and some synchronisation is mostly it, which is just the address space, channel and syncpt sections of that reference. The rest don't really matter.\n\nFrom the actual GPU side, the architecture will be the same. Graphics drivers ultimately just exist to turn the graphics api commands into a string of instructions to be sent to the GPU. The process by which this happens (pushbuffers) doesn't change, it's the same in Maxwell as it is in Ampere, and was introduced before Maxwell, but I don't remember which architecture it came in on. Maybe Fermi.\n\nnVidia's open docs don't list all architecture manuals unfortunately, but you can compare the oldest they have (volta) with ampere, for the pushbuffer stuff: [volta](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/manuals/volta/gv100/dev_ram.ref.txt#L814) vs [ampere](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/manuals/ampere/ga100/dev_ram.ref.txt#L842). They're identical, and I promise it's the same format for Maxwell on Switch 1, as this was implemented in Yuzu and Ryujinx.\n\nAnd then you can look at the engine methods themselves, like the 3d engine for example, since that's what people usually care about most: [maxwell](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/classes/3d/clb197.h) vs [ampere](https://github.com/NVIDIA/open-gpu-doc/blob/master/classes/3d/clc797.h) and yeah they obviously differ in offsets, but all of the basic stuff we care about is pretty much the same. Old and new still of course have setting the type of vertices, if transform feedback is used in the geometry shader, tessellation config stuff, setting the rasteriser config like viewport/scissor/depth/clip planes/stencil, blend settings for fragment shader output etc etc. Which shaders are active, their program pointers and bind groupings. I see there is some new stuff, like the mesh shader methods in Ampere, but as far as I know mesh shaders aren't used very much currently, so they're not going to show up in a large percent of games anyway.\n\nSo yeah it's a bit different, but it's not all unheard of for basic operation to get Switch 2 emulation going, everything that already exists in the Switch 1 emulators can be reused there. The way you interact with the GPU via the nv serivce will for sure be almost identical, the way you read the commands and send them off into the engines is all the exact same. The engines themselves are the only things which differ, but they're very similar overall. nVidia don't entirely re-design their *entire* GPU architecture every new series, it's iterative development.\n\nI think Switch 2 emulation, if the console was day 1 hacked again, could show up within just a few months. It wouldn't be a basic emu, only running the basic launch titles like Puyo Puyo Tetris for Switch 1 either, it would be a pretty mature emulator. That is, if people weren't afraid of a Nintendo lawsuit.",

(Not saying that's the value of the dev's work, just that it's not a franchise I'm super into.) I did order a switch 2, but only because I'm worried about US pricing and availability and because I know there will eventually be new Zelda, 3d Mario, and Pok\u00e9mon games I'll want to play. I'm not into any of the launch titles except the DK one. That looks incredible but I'm balking at the price for now. I also have zero interest in physical releases that require downloads so I guess we'll see how that develops. I'll just buy the game from the e-shop if a \"game key\" is the only physical option.",

And with that nintendo said F it and decided to go for quirky and something for everyone.\n\n  \nSteamdeck released in 2022 and switch still kept selling more even after that.

Not only that, but the L1 cache was also only 2x 12 kB per SM (as \"SM sub-partitions\"), down from 2x 24 kB. Shared memory store is down from 96 kB to 64 kB.\n\nInterconnect was also wimpy, data from each SM could only travel at 64 bytes per clock out to the L2. With only one L2 partition, that's a peak bandwidth of around 46 GB/s. No, not TB/s. Slower than main memory on nearly all of the GTX 900 series.\n\nIt was the smallest, lightest, and weakest thing which could legitimately call itself \"Maxwell\". Due to the paired-GPC architecture, Maxwell couldn't actually go below two SMs and here, yeah, it was two SMs.",

There's no magic pixie dust to get massive performance out of less power.\n\nAs we know Switch 2 uses Ampere on an 8nm-class node (Nvidia doesn't transition architectures between nodes as a rule, but maybe it did) and it's based on T239, which has 1536 CUDA cores, we know straight away it's inferior to the almost unlovable RTX 2050 (taking the second testicle off the RTX 3050).\n\nWe don't know clocks, but we know they're not going to be high. Low power Ampere was around 1,300 MHz (Tegra T194, which had more cores). It'll probably have 6 GPCs with 2 SMs each. Memory performance will likely be utterly awful, because that's the nature of LPDDR.\n\nRaw specs, it's going to be around 4 TFLOPS FP32, 8 TFLOPS FP16, and 110 GB/s RAM.\n\n**By handheld standards** it's about double a Steam Deck. We also have Nvidia's reputation here: Nvidia has a very bad reputation in small SoCs. Tegra became such an insult that Nvidia all-but bandoned the brand. It never seemingly recovered after the failure of Project Denver (and the firing of the entire SoC team...) and made few mass-market inroads since, the Switch being one notable exception (and still dogged by very poor GPU performance).",

Not running DLSS when transformer is available is honestly a mistake at this point, if I were Nintendo I would run DLSS on quality even at 720p to get either better battery life relative to the performance or more frames per second at the reduced handheld clock speeds (or some combination thereof).

Even so, it's in many ways entirely capable of matching the PSX, mostly just being held back by \n\n1: Cartridges being far smaller than CD-ROMs, forcing sounds and textures to be compressed significantly compared to those on the PSX (and making Final Fantasy VII style several hundred megabyte pre-rendered FMVs a non-starter), and\n\n2: the ridiculous latency of the system's Rambus memory, which requires programmers to take a very different approach to their work compared to other systems where moving data from one part of the system to another is generally quite fast between solid-state components.",

It got blown out in _sales,_ but the actual hardware performance between the two is reasonably competitive, with the Nintendo 64 having things like a Z-buffer (so you don't get the characteristic warping of most PS1 and Saturn games) and a much faster CPU, but you also have memory latency from hell that forces you to write code to minimise read/write operations between parts of the system even when in theory it would be more cycle efficient. \n\nOverall, if the PSX could do it, you could probably get an N64 to do it with sufficient knowledge of how to code for the platform, and vice versa (storage medium limits notwithstanding). It's not like comparing either system to something like the Dreamcast where it's a clear and undeniable slaughter for the fifth-gen hardware.",

They also had far more permissive terms for publishing software than Nintendo, who were still imposing various strict requirements on publishers at the time. On top of this, the PlayStation had an existing install base, room to cut console prices if needed from cost savings and a pretty decent library of titles by the time the Nintendo 64 came out. \n\nNintendo probably wouldn't have run into the severe issues they did in getting third parties to support the console though, which would help their performance in the west. Though the management's prejudice towards 2D games would still lose them sales in Japan where, ironically, the Saturn's design legacy making it a sprite-drawer first and a polygon-drawer second made it an ideal platform for things like scrolling shoot-em-ups, 2D platformers and traditional fighting games. \n\nIn turn, that would've stopped the GameCube from being a total bust since it would've given them a better chance of actually having games for the damn thing to launch with and allowed it to come out closer to the PS2, though they'd have to use full-sized DVDs to avoid losing half of their developers to Sony.",

If games play identically on the consoles and/or PC then I don't need more than one of them. Like I said Sony does get timed exclusives but they eventually get to PC so I could just wait, Xbox games are just immediately on PC. On the other hand Nintendo has countless titles and series that won't get ported. Going further with the uniqueness of the switch for example having a touchscreen and of course the Joy Cons they're able to create experiences that can't be matched on the other platforms. Unfortunately console exclusivity and unique experience kind of go hand in hand.  \n\nThat being said I do think to the push to multiplatform is bad for the industry and arguably a large part of why AAA are so stagnant. There's no reason to innovate the games. Instead Sony and Microsoft are in a technical arms race to make slightly better hardware than the other that marginally improves graphics over the other.",

I've never had an experience that relied on hardware gimmicks like motion controls, the kinect, or dualsense controller that engrossed me the way a simply really good game will. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them and hope we keep seeing fun little things like this, but they do NOT push the industry forward to me. The only exception would be VR cause that shits crazy.\n\nAgain, I don't know where you're looking for games to be able to say AAA is stagnant right now. Like what do you think is missing?

They would always point out how the Switch's SoC was made in 2015 like it was a bad thing even as early as 2020, but it's fine for the Switch 2 to actually be older tech than the Switch 1 on release, and charge you $150 more...

GF still should be looked at, even if Gen 10 may not look absolutely incredible, Overclocking the OG Switch to its actual factory speeds basically eliminated most FPS issues with SV so while the argument is that GF should be developing with the specs they have in mind, it does show that SV just needs a bit extra power.

              "body": ">When hasn't this been the case for Nintendo systems? They've always been focused on games rather than high end hardware. If they have any more horsepower it'll drive the cost up.\u00a0\n\nThat's point I was making even. I always thought people were too harsh on the Switch 1. They were also known for affordability, and decided that wasn't going to be a thing anymore, and decide to charge even more for 5 year old tech, and charge MUCH more for their own games. $80 for Mario Kart is just dumb. Now we also have this weird game key card BS with third party games (at least most of them) that's also invalidating the huge amount of physical sales of Switch games, and the plug an play aspect of their games that is VERY absent with the other platforms. This is also assuming that people who are buying these products have reliable access to Internet with good speeds, which even in the US, we still have areas without reliable internet.\n\nThe whole point of having affordable gaming products is for more people to get into it, and more people can buy them which equals more sources of money. I also understand that Nintendo isn't the only one who has raised prices, but just mean this overall. I would love to see the cost per unit on their hardware myself.\n\nEdit: Yes down vote something sensible. \"Just don't buy it\" has to be the most flawed logic imaginable. Most people who are talking about it WANT to buy it, but can't afford it! Not to mention, action like this never lead to anything with a company like this who is arrogant. WiiU and Virtual Boy flopped because no one actually wanted them, or was marketed extremely poorly.",

The snes is the last time this wasnt true.\n\nThe n64 cpu clocked 3 times the speed of the ps1, had double to quadruple the ram but got out innovated on the disc v cartride. \n\nGamecube time comes around, again a more powerfull console but loses due to being out innovated again with the dvd and dvd player functionality of the ps2. \n\nThey took the lesson learned here and made the Wii, a less powerfull console (the cell processor on the ps3 stomped it pretty severely and won the generation because they out inovated the competiton. Wiiu is a nightmare on all fronts. switch comes out, this thing has 3 gigs of ram and is about as powerful as a mobile phone from a few years prior. Still wins it's generation. Now i doubt the switch 2 is going to do anywhere near as well, for some reason they thought the eyetoy was gonna be a defining feature (like not even kinect which was impressive but the fucking eyetoy).\nBut the lesson for Nintendo seems pretty solidfied as doing our own thing is a better way to go.\n\n(this all is of course heavily speculated by me as I am not the famous John Nintendo, owner of Nintendo)",

The Switch 1 still runs quite a few of the best titles on that platform, which look great for how small it is. And it's from 2017 and definitely started development earlier than that.\n\nNintendo clearly isn't prioritizing top level fidelity and raw horsepower anymore. They're prioritizing an experience, something only they can offer. I personally still think games like Mario Kart, BotW, and Portal 2 look great to this day. Yeah, they're no Cyberpunk but they don't look terrible at all.",

          "body": "The specs of the switch 2 are cool for now but what happens when the next gen comes out?\n\nPeople are pretending Switch 2 is a current gen console. \n\nIt is not.\n\nIt's an early Next Gen console. \n\nNintendo sat on the Switch 2 for YEARS just so the C-Suite could chase the \"Most consoles Sold\" trophy. Sucks for anyone that bought a switch within the last few months or got one for Christmas and were not \"in the know.\"\n\nNow the real problem happens when next gen comes out ( one or two years from now) and the consoles can actually handle a mature UE5 game using RDNA4/5. Meanwhile, Nintendo will be on 3 generations old tech that can barely run the raytracing demands of a future title with its 12 RT Cores.\n\nLet's put it this way. When Nintendo cheaps out on hardware, you get 1st party titles that look like Pokemon. Nintendo use to be known for their highly optimized high performance titles. Now, everyone just settles for playable from them. Dropped frames be damned. \n\nThe real question is will the Switch 2 be viable when it hits near end of life around 2031 (2033 if Nintendo keeps the 8 year cadence instead of the six year console release)? \n\nThey had an excuse when they released the switch because the Wii U bombed so hard they were turtling up and being cautious. Why are they being cheap now after the meteoric success of the switch? They are shooting themselves in the foot for no reason outside of \"fans will buy it regardless.\"\n\nEdit: Nintendo hasn't prioritized graphics since the GameCube. Also forgot to mention Nintendo cheapest out on RAM with the switch 2 only having 12GB of shared RAM which will age very poorly.",

I really don't see any switch games utilizing any sort of ray tracing at all, or at least not the full fat thing. How many gamers actually only game with RTX or equivalent on in every game? I can't imagine it's many. I never did when I had my 3080, and I still don't with my 6950XT.\n\nYes the switch 2 will be less powerful than an Xbox or PS5, but that's fine. It's not a speed machine. Nintendo will use it to sell Mario, Zelda and Pokemon just as they always have.",

The Storage being severely slower, lack of AI, the RAM being 12GB instead of 16GB minimum, Ampere instead of least Lovelace, the overall mediocre specs for 2025, it all leads to poor optimization down the line. You think the 3050 level of power will last even with God tier optimization till 2031?\n\nThen again what's the point of arguing with \"it doesn't matter, people will buy it\" in a debate on whether the Switch 2's specs will age well.  People will deal with Pokemon level of optimization.",
