You can pretty much plan on the phone being useless in 2 years due to battery deterioration and/or hinge damage, meanwhile you can probably get a lot longer out of a standard phone that does the same thing. You are going to be charging it twice per day if you use your phone at all for phone stuff which will lead to premature battery degredation. Also these basically cannot be repaired, if the battery or hinge fails, you are getting a new phone, there will be no options for repair. I am sure they just replace rather than repair even if you send it in for repair. Most other phones can be repaired.",

The outter screen is much smaller and will use less energy than if someones using the inner screen. So it'll save energy if people use the outter one for something quick. Signifigantly more durable than the inner one too of course for obvious reasons.\n\nPeople aren't gonna buy a foldable with no outside screen now anyway. Would be an instant flop.
