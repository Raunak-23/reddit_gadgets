It'll play games without a PC using an ARM processor and a translation layer to make PC games run on ARM (like how the Deck has a translation layer to play Windows games on Linux). My money is on this being a test before making an ARM powered Deck 2. The leaks show Valve mostly testing VR games with their translation layer, but also a ton of flat games. \n\nAlso, for better or for worse, Valve is a very slow company that doesn't feel pressure from competitors. Their Index headset is ridiculously old and outdated compared to competitors, but they're still selling it at full price and people love it.",
