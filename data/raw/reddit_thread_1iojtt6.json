The reason they melt is because the power isn't transferred cleanly across all of them, and single wires will peak at over 20 amps of draw when only rated for 10.\n\nTransferring 50 amps is not hard, this has been a solved problem in electrical engineering for over a century. You don't use more cables, you use thicker cables, which gives you a dramatically larger crosssection and avoids all the worries with load balancing. Tech companies are just trying to reinvent the wheel because apparently we'd rather risk electrical fires than build in an extra half-inch of clearance.\n\nXT60 connectors have been the gold standard in RC and more recently e-bikes for 30 years at this point. They're rated for 60 amps continuous, are significantly smaller than a 12VHPWR connector, and can handle thousands of connection and disconnection cycles just fine. The downside is that they use 2 relatively thick wires and therefore need a bit more room to have a 90-degree bend in the cable.\n\nMaybe instead of trying to fight physics, we should just accept that cases need to get a half-inch wider or that you need some clearance below the GPU so the cable connects in a different direction.\n\nedit: some folks are talking about higher voltage as an alternative solution, that's just not the limitation here. There are ebikes with these XT60 connectors pulling over 3,000 watts at 72v out of their battery with barely any measurable heat generation in the connector. That's double the wattage and triple the amperage you're even allowed to pull from a wall outlet with standard US wiring. The issue isn't the connector, it's the obsession with using tiny wires so they're easy to bend.",

What if the solution requires a different connector type and engineering for future PC PSUs? That's a whole lot of follow-on changes for other manufacturers, etc. What if the solution is an additional power lead from PSUs? Again, that affects more parts within the PC system currently, since there will be many left with not enough power outputs from currently deployed systems, etc. Overall, it's fixable, but will very likely require more than just effort from NVIDIA on a fix. But in the short term, this is very bad for them with the current manufacturing going on for the cards and sales thereof. \n\nThis is also a -great- time for a competitor to seize some market share if they can push additional GPU power and features and maintain better stability. \n\nI don't think we're at the end of the line yet. Certainly I remember very low wattage early PCs and lack of dedicated GPUs even. We've come a long way. Power requirements have grown but we aren't outside of being able to make it work. Not yet. \n\nI guess we'll see what happens here and how they handle things.",

I worked on some pretty high powered projects in my career and one of the big golden rules was *never run cables in parallel to meet current handling requirements*. You just cannot guarantee that you won't have a minor ohm mismatch in the connections or cables that would cause one to exceed its capacity.\n\nThere were so many ways to fix this. The absolute easiest would have been simply to go back to independent 12v rails on the PSU as a requirement for 12vHPWR. Or go higher voltage, up to 48V like power tools and USB-C did.",

Electricity follows the path of least resistance. Nvidia did load balancing on the card for the 3090, and we didn't hear anything about cables melting despite being 12vhpwr, because the worst case scenario is that any single wire of 6 had to deal with 200 watts. The worst case scenario for the 40/50 series is that a single wire could have to deal with 600 watts. This made improper contact a huge issue. Each improper contact means another wire not properly sharing the load, and that's a death sentence because the safety factor on the cable is only 1.1, you can't afford a single dud on the cable when your using over 500w. \n\nImproper contact aside, it's still an issue just running the card. Even if material and coating was identical, there's still going to be minute differences that's unnoticeable by any reasonable human measurement in the resistance that the majority of current will flow through a couple wires out of the available 6. Causing wires to have to deal with 20-30 amps instead of 9-10, all because Nvidia can't be arsed to balance their God damn load.",

There's also might be cases where power draw might peak instantaneously above 400-450watts even if not OC'd, but you'd have to OC to have any sustained load.  \n\nThe wire is supposed to deliver a max of 9.5A x 12v x 6 pins = 684 watts. Specified for 600 watts and a safety factor of 1.1. Every bad connection removes ~114 watts from the safe power cap. If you had bad/faulty connection on say 2 of the 6 pins, you're already down to ~457 watts of safe delivery, and that's not accounting for the fact the load isn't balanced so there's no telling if you've got wires running way above spec unless you measure them. The cable will survive 20-30A for a few mins on an individual wire, but eventually the connectors are gonna melt and it'll be too late to save your card once you smell burning plastic. \n\nmy advice is to not OC this generation and rather set target power to 70-80%. It'll take some tweaking on clock speeds, but you'll probably lose ~5% performance, but the card efficiency will sky rocket and save you some $$$ on energy bills. I know like half of enthusiasts hate that type of advice (i paid for X i want it to do what its made for), but thats my personal opinion. \n\nmy other advice is to inspect the wire. gently, like barely any force at all, tug on each wire on your 12vHPWR/12v 2x6 cable, and see if the pins move. If there's a loose pin, you probably won't get good contact on it as it's lose and will get pushed out, or even slip out a bit if you ever finagle with your pc despite the connector being fully seated.\n\nAlso visually inspect the wire to ensure the pins are at the same level in the connector. \n\nstupid we have to do this, but thats where we are.\n\nEdit:typos grammar",

                      "body": ">Not quite, if any of the power phases were out of whack, the card would not operate. This would happen long before 200W was sustained on a single connection -- the voltage mismatch as this happened would have shut the card down or prevented it from powering up.\n\n...? Thats not what i'm talking about.  \n\n6 wires deliver power in a 12vhpwr, 600W max. 3 shunts. 200 watts shared between 2 wires, on average they should be delivering 100W per wire under heavy load. In the worst case of improper connection, yes the card will suffer instability and not work properly, but it will probably attempt to draw power and so the worst case is 200W for a bit before the card says no mas. Which is why the 3090 never melted, but a 4090 had single shunt so it doesn't know if any wire wasn't properly connected... hence melted 4090s. \n\n>FFS can we just add a 48V rail already with a single 14 AWG wire pair\n\nThe short is the ATX standard is 12V. The long answer is because that would require the entire PC market to agree to change voltage, and its a kind of a waste of money, and potentially hazardous. Any efficiency gains switching to higher voltage is going to be largely lost because the of the gap in Vin vs Vout. Most of the core components gpu core/cpu use like 1V. 12V is also what alot of peripherals use. So if even if you switched to 24V thats still more conversion. if Nvidia forcibly switched the industry to 24-48V that'd be pretty arrogant and wasteful. Force a new mobo standard, more conversion, more cost. Also we're talking about the home DIY market here too. 48V is on the edge of dangerous for safety standards, and many people build pcs without knowing diddly squat about electrical safety.",

Now, you are obviously running into modern games that are definitely pushing the 3070 to its limit, but if you can concede some of that stuff, it won't matter. If you really *needed* to upgrade, I wouldn't go the 5000 series due to their extremely high cost and extremely low availability. Especially considering how disappointing they are when they are basically only a 30% increase in power than their 4000s equivalents but at a ridiculous price point. \n\nThe best thing to do IMO is wait, or find a 4000 series card on sale or for cheap. Or alternatively, go to AMD which always will have better bang for you buck if you needed to upgrade from the 3000 series. For comparison, an NVIDIA card typically costs about $100 to even $300 more than an AMD card that performs similarly. Granted, if you care for the Ray Tracing, then NVIDIA is the better option. \n\nNVIDIA is rapidly becoming more of a \"luxury\" item due to their really fucked price to performance value on their cards. I will say for a 3070 upgrade, if you wanted to have more VRAM and better bang for your buck, look into AMD's 7800XT to 7900 XTX. Or the 9070XT which apparently will be priced \"aggressively\" which doesn't mean fuck all atm until we actually know the price and specs.\n\nBut most importantly, if you wanted to upgrade your 3070, you need to get something for cheap IMO. Paying full price or even higher than that for a card is not worth it cause your upgrade options aren't that much better to justify paying for it. You can likely find some deals right now on some 4000 cards (don't get a 4060) since people are selling their used cards for a 5000s card.",

It's the unfortunate truth about today's PC games.\n\nI can run games like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 maxed out and get 170-180 fps at 1440p. beautiful game, lots of fun, highly recommend it. turning down just a couple settings shoots my fps up to a very very steady 240 which is my monitor limit and no matter how hard I look for it I honestly cannot spot the difference at all. Keep in mind that KCD2 is decently well optimized... but like 99% of games today, there're tiny graphical settings that will make near zero difference in fidelity and yet will cost you disproportionately in performance.",

Processors are running hot, GPUs are running hot, and usually this is even on games or applications that do not require the power that needlessly generates heat. \n\nAs an example I was playing a game on a 7th Gen i5 and a GTX 1060. It run perfectly in near silence. Now, if I pay the same game on a 13th Gen i5 and RTX 3060 ti, I need a special cooling setup on my cpu and the GPU fans are busy, for ultimately the same performance in the game. It's like companies are chasing numbers and in so doing creating inefficiency.",

I mean this is in theory only going to get worse as these things get more powerful, right?  Shouldn't this tell the industry that we're really in need of a real solution for this?  What they're doing now really can't continue on.  For me, it's already too late if problems like these are occurring, but I can't help but think about the next generation, or the one after that, still using these connections/connectors.  Does somebody have to have a full-on fire or an explosion first?",

Most people aren't aware that mixing cables is a risk and they shouldn't need an electrical degree on how to plug a GPU power connector in. While some of these cases are user error, the cable should be robust enough to factor in the user error like the prior connections did.\n\nAlso it's been looked at by electrical engineers and they are saying it's flawed. People need to stop blaming ourselves and blame the company that's charging high prices and who put more R&D in their coolers than the basics of \"safety first\".\n\nI'm checking my 4090 daily because I'm paranoid, even when using the PSUs 12VHPWR cable.
