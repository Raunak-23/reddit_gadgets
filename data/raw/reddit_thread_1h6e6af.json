It seems to work pretty well for popups and google ad sense stuff, but if the ads are directly embedded into the site, pihole can't differentiate them.\n\nFor example, I'm using pihole right now while typing this comment, but still getting banner ads on reddit for some car because the thumbnail is being hosted on reddit's servers. (at least I think? It's also totally possible I set something up wrong)",

              "body": "No, don't think you can't install it on a TV, since those are pretty closed systems that can only install certain apps.  Most people run it on a Raspberry Pi device (hence the name Pi Hole), but it can be installed on other things.  I know my Asustor NAS has it as an app I can download, for example, so I'd guess that QNAP or Synology also has it.  Another similar product is called Adguard Home, does basically the same thing.  You could theoretically install in on your main computer, the caveat is the device running PiHole needs to run 24/7, which is why Raspberry Pi's are so popular since they are very low power devices so it doesn't cost a lot to have one running all the time.\n\nThe basics of it is it acts as a DNS Sinkhole.  The PiHole device sits on your home network and you point your Router's DNS settings to the PiHole.  That way, any device on your network has it's DNS queries go through the PiHole before going out to a public DNS server.  So if it tries to go to a known ad-serving address, the PiHole will not allow that traffic through, effectively blocking the ads.",

It's constantly sluggish and prone to freezes and crashes.

I bought a smart TV that was fine when I bought it, then they updated it, which fucked with the color balance, and I preferred it before. I did an insane amount of research on my TV, paid a lot of money to get the exact one that I wanted, and then they fucked it up with an update. I also had one where they made it so instead of just going to my content, like it did when I bought it, they updated it so it went to their shitty, ad-riddled \"home screen\" where I had to select my input first before it would show my content. I could no longer just turn on my TV, I now had to turn on my TV, then select my input while seeing ads.\n\nAs I said, I do a lot of research on products before I buy them. When I buy something, I am paying money and deciding to be content with the features that I get in exchange for that money. If VRR wasn't important to me when I was doing all that research, then it isn't going to suddenly become important to me later. If I decided I want a new feature set later, I will buy a new product. \n\nFor the record, VRR is an important feature to me, and I do have a TV that has it. But I made sure that it had it before I bought it, even though my PC at the time couldn't use it, because I wanted to future proof myself for when I could use it (and after a GPU upgrade, I can).",

It will block ads like the ones you\u2019ll get on a smart tv homepage and many others. It also reduces your overall network traffic. Combined this with using a computer with Firefox and some Adblock extensions and you\u2019ll practically never see an ad again unless you watch a live broadcast. You can even block promotional segments of YouTube videos where the content creator promotes some product. You can block it all and be ad free.\n\nThis won\u2019t block ads from streaming services that are embedded in their content. But it blocks pretty much everything else.",
