Or did you see the Samsung name and then make the assumption?\n\nI will not come out and say Samsung soundbars are an audiophile's dream, or that Samsung is the single best possible option for this price range, but I will say they make for excellent upgrades to TV speakers especially when you don't have the space or wherewithal to set up 7 channels throughout a room. \n\nEven for those where it may fit and they don't need to worry about angering their landlord by screwing holes into the walls/ceiling, many people don't like the look of having dedicated speakers all over the place, and would prefer the one simple and clean soundbar that provides them with a sound they are more than happy with.\n\nThis isn't the audiophile subreddit, and I totally understand this soundbar isn't for people like you, but that doesn't mean it doesn't provide a good solution for others, especially if you enjoy being able to control your soundbar quickly and easily through the SmartThings ecosystem.",
