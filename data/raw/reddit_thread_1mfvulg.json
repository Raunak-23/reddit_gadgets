By contrast with the stuffed animals they can effectively \"set it and forget it\" with no concerns about the rabbits dying and the like. (If the trap is set to send out a signal if triggered, researchers won't normally have to check traps or do anything with them until they have successfully trapped a python.) It also is probably easier to deal with non-live rabbits in terms of things like \"keeping enough in stock in storage\" and avoiding them accidentally escaping or biting a researcher or the like.",
