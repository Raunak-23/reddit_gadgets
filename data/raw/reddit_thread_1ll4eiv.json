      "body": "i found this article talking about the same thing, and I liked the way they explained: https://www.techspot.com/article/3006-nintendo-switch-2-display\n\n\n> Our best guess is that Nintendo has not implemented overdrive to conserve power. Overdrive applies a higher voltage to the LCD layer to force it to transition faster; higher voltage equals higher power consumption. That's fine on a desktop monitor plugged into the wall, but not fine on a handheld device with a tiny 19.3 Wh battery.",

They might not understand it, but they will see (especially in scrolling 2D titles) the difference compared to ALL other screens they are used to.",

Overdrive applies a higher voltage to the LCD layer to force it to transition faster; higher voltage equals higher power consumption. That's fine on a desktop monitor plugged into the wall, but not fine on a handheld device with a tiny 19.3 Wh battery.\n\nI would call that explanation accurate but the conclusion that this is a good thing nonsense. \n\nBetter LCD Smartphones (before they switched to OLED) didn't even have that much of a late 90s era amount of blur, nor are other LCD handhelds close to this bad. \n\nIf you can't even show a 60hz signal w/o tons of smearing let alone the 120hz you advertise, than you are saving at the wrong end.",

Well, it's not the best display we've ever seen, but we are talking about a handheld gaming device, so comparisons to desktop monitors are only fair up to a certain point.\n\n> Compared to the original Switch 1 LCD, the Switch 2 is generally an upgrade. It's larger and higher resolution, which makes it more enjoyable to use. It's brighter and has a wider color gamut, which gives it additional vibrance and it subjectively produces better-looking images because of this.\n\n> It also has better reflection handling, so while the contrast ratio isn't improved, in actual usage conditions it has better apparent black depth. And it supports more advanced technologies like variable refresh and a 120Hz refresh rate.\n\nHonestly, I think it's weird to compare a screen like this to full PC monitors that are permanently plugged in with few power use limitations. Reviews of other handheld devices show results that are far more comparable to the Switch 2's display:\n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-Legion-Go-gaming-handheld-review-Good-idea-not-quite-perfectly-executed.794034.0.html\n\nhttps://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Ally-Z1-Extreme-Review-Gaming-handheld-with-120-Hz-display-and-AMD-Zen4.716680.0.html\n\nIt's clear the display is undervolted and has no overdrive to maintain half-way decent battery life, and that it was necessary to maintain the overall display quality in the face of the Switch 2's much more powerful SoC and its comparatively small battery.\n\nLike, the S2 display is brighter, has a higher resolution and it's larger (compared to the S1 LCD).

The idea that Watts are a rate is confusing --- every other rate we see (frames per second, miles per gallon) has the word \"per\" in it, and that explains to us what it is.  That \"watts\" is synonymous with \"joules per second\" is very non-obvious, and walls energy use off from intuitive understanding.  And then saying \"watts\" is synonymous with \"watt-hours per hour\" is even more confusing.\n\nIt's a shame we don't trade in kilojoules and kilojoules per hour in common parlance.  *That* has a direct analogy to gallons of gas, which we're familiar with.",

E.g. power is measured watts and energy is measured in \"spouls\" (super joules) where 1 spoul = 3.6 kilojoules = 1 watt-hour. Then we'd measure large amounts of energy in kilospouls and megaspouls.",

I think it's handy to have a short form if it's something you find yourself saying all day --- if you're a scientist or an engineer --- but for most people, \"joules per hour\" is both easy enough *and* easy to understand.

The resulting discussion of adding yet another new unit (\"spouls\") goes even further away from my suggestion of just, \"we already have a unit, let's just use it as is\".",

That wasn't planned.\n\n\nThe original switch had a less bespoke processor, it was basically an off the shelf android tablet processsor that ran nintendo's custom OS. However, there are a lot of people in the modding community with tons of experience getting into android and it wasn't long before they realized power + vol up + home button on boot still got you to recovery mode. From there, installing a custom OS is identical to a phone or tablet.\n\n\nThe only issue was that the home button on the controller isn't the android home button, but they found some pins on the right joycon rail that would send the home button signal when shorted together.\n\n\nSo basically Nintendo had to modify the hardware on the switch to prevent that signal from getting through, and they also changed to a different processor that happened to be more powerful than they needed it to be.\n\n\nSo they downclocked it to work like the original one, which gives the refreshed system better battery life than the OG. It was really just a coincidental upgrade.",

If you're interested in Undertale, I suggest you play it without using any guides. Expect to play through it a couple times if you want to get the most out of it. (It's short, and subsequent playthroughs actually change). Deltarune is meant to be played second, as it plays off your memories of Undertale in some very interesting ways. I hope you enjoy them if you end up playing!",

You are encouraged to talk things out with every enemy in goofy/funny ways instead of killing them. There's tons of random subtle references spanning many Nintendo games, other RPGs, and even internet culture (but in a very well handled, non-obnoxious way)\n\nThat being said Deltarune is great. There's only 4 out of its 7 chapters out. The writing is hilarious, the gameplay evolves a lot between chapters.\n\nWhats good though is that the first two chapters of Deltarune are also 100% free to try, and your save data transfers over.",

They could in theory fix it with an overdrive setting, but why would they when it serves it's purpose for a handheld and like you said they want the OLED double dip.",

TN's viewing angles are crap. If we go off best values and compare their TN LCD's 3.7 ms to the Switch 2's best of 11.8 ms, that's +2.2x (or an *absolute value* of 3.2x time required for best case response, *not* 3.2x worse).\n\nThe Switch 2's screen isn't great, and a user-selectable overdrive mode at the cost of battery life would have been great... but the headline is also factually incorrect.",

There are probably cheaper ones too. \n\nAnd yeah, the reason is that the technology in OLED and VRR don't mix well. Why would they want to spend more for a compromised experience?\n\nAnyway, my comment had more to do with OLED screens not being solely responsible for the OLED SD being $150 more than its base model. People think these small OLED panels are a lot more expensive than they are, but there are actually plenty of affordable handhelds with 1080p OLED screens.",

I do object to $450, and I object much more strenuously to $80 games and the choice of MicroSD Express over something like NVMe that would\u2019ve been both cheaper for customers in the short term, and much faster in both the short and long run.\n\nIt\u2019s probably true that a couple years from now they\u2019ll release an OLED model, and there\u2019s a very good chance that at that time it will be $449 or $499, and the original will either be discontinued or discounted. In addition to the desire to drum up more sales, though, it simply is the case that hardware you\u2019ve already been producing for some time becomes cheaper to produce as you move further into its lifespan, due to economies of scale. Barring unforeseen circumstances, it will literally be cheaper for them to offer an upgraded unit in a couple years than it is today.\n\nBut that\u2019s then. This is now. If they had put an OLED display in the unit, it would have cost more, and they would have then raised the price on the unit, likely by more than the difference of the cost of the display, since that\u2019s how for profit companies with popular and desirable products tend to operate. I dislike this fact. I dislike capitalism in general, come to that. \n\nIf you think me acknowledging their economic incentives for doing this is \u201cdefending Nintendo,\u201d so be it, I guess. I constantly run afoul of all the Nintendo fanboys who get a persecution complex and go all whataboutist in response to any criticism of the company whatsoever too, though.

Response time is just the time it takes for a completely black pixel to become a bright white without under or over shooting its target brightness. Way too much response time can cause scenes with interactions between bright and dark scenes to appear motion blurred, but it is not nearly as important as input lag.\"",

In handheld it\u2019s just not something to care or even notice.  \n\nI don\u2019t even play Fortnite anymore, but I tested it just to see how it feels in handheld. Felt smooth and completely playable handheld, which the let down is that the joysticks are still not completely comfortable to be playing competitive shooters in handheld, Far better than S1.  \n\nThat being said, when docked in my LG C3 I get to see how smooth this console is.  \n\nIf anything a little bit of ghosting on the minuscule level probably helps making 30fps not feel so jarring lol. Seriously wtf are games getting released at 30fps anymore. It\u2019s painful. Give me less graphics and a minimum 60fps and I\u2019ll still be happy",

I know their staple games aren\u2019t focusing on insane graphics or anything, but I could not even consistently get 60 fps while playing BOTW on the console it was released on, and could not even run Minecraft Bedrock edition on fancy graphics. The Switch 2 specs are still far behind modern console specs, so why on earth are people foaming at the mouth for them at their ridiculous price point? And by the time the price comes down to a reasonable amount, it\u2019s going to be very obsolete.",

It\u2019s expected. Laptops that are the same price as desktops never hit the same performance either. There are $1000 handheld PCs on the market that don\u2019t perform at the level of a PS5, expecting Nintendo to cram a PS5 into something smaller than those for half the price is completely unreasonable. The PSP was $250 in 2005 and was slightly worse than the PS2 but significantly worse than the upcoming PS3, and it sold great, 80 million units. Power just isn\u2019t as big of a deal for handhelds. \n\nGoing beyond that, specs cost them dearly with the WiiU. So yes people do care about that with Nintendo. People love painting this idea of a rabid Nintendo fanboy army but less people bought the WiiU than the PS Vita. Keep in mind the WiiU was right after Nintendo sold a combined 250 million Wii and DS consoles, so there were more hypothetical fanboys going into that than there are coming off the Switch 1.\n\nThe Wii did good because it had a very competitive price point ($250) compared to the 360 ($400) and PS3 ($600), people cared about the specs but also the price was fine and it was new tech to a lot of people who never messed with motion controls. Motion controls weren\u2019t gonna sell the WiiU though.\n\nThe Game Cube outperformed the PS2 on the power front by a wide margin and sold like trash, btw. So power doesn\u2019t help Nintendo either.",
