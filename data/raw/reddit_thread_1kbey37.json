          "body": "The problem is that PCs are a very \"legacy\" market. Everything is supported very long. And while you can get cheap adapters for other old things, like PCI and IDE (even more so when those technologies where used parallel to what we have now) building a PSU with 12 and 24v and maintaining high efficiency while staying in the form factor will probably be very expensive. So you'll have to switch GPU, CPU, PSU, and probably fans (unless the Mainboard transforms that voltage, which probably will hurt efficiency) and additional stuff like drives or RGB. I mean, it's still not a bad idea, but every time someone tried to implement a completely incompatible standard in the PC Market, they failed, so I can see why no one is doing it.",

It doesn't have to be a \"positive\" wire and a ground wire- it can be any wires at different voltages. You could even use a +12v and a +5v wire, and you'd get 7 volts across them. Any electrical device connected across this circuit can't even tell the lower voltage wire isn't at ground potential without a ground reference. It doesn't matter at all.\n\nThis principle is how North American houses get 240v for large appliances like electric stoves, dryers, and water heaters. There is no 240v line running to the house. Instead, the appliance is connected across two split-phase 120v conductors. Being 180\u00b0 out of phase with each other, at a point in time one is at +120 volt potential while the other is at -120 volts, giving the appliance a total of 240 volts (RMS).\n\nIt's a neat way to make higher voltages and powers available in a circuit while simplifying the power supply and, in the case of residential AC power, maintaining a lower, safer maximum differential from ground.",

I went all-in with an RTX 4080, and when I first plugged it in, everything seemed fine. But after a couple of weeks, I started noticing this weird yellowish tint showing up on the edges of the GPU\u2019s fan. It wasn\u2019t quite as bad as what this guy is describing, but it definitely had me freaking out. I\u2019m not exactly the most tech-savvy person, so I figured I probably just got a bad card or something, and started stressing about potential overheating issues or worse. I ended up reaching out to the manufacturer, and after a few emails and back-and-forth, they ended up sending me a replacement.\n\nIt was a huge relief when the new card didn\u2019t have any of those weird marks, but it made me so much more cautious about these high-end components. With tech getting so advanced, you kind of expect them to just work perfectly out of the box, but I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not always the case. From my experience, if you're ever in a situation like this, it's worth reaching out to customer support sooner rather than later, because companies seem pretty good at addressing these issues, especially if it\u2019s a known defect. It still blows my mind how much we rely on these gadgets, and even a small issue can be so stressful when you\u2019ve invested that much money into them. Has anyone else had a similar experience with their high-end GPUs, or was it just me being unlucky?",
