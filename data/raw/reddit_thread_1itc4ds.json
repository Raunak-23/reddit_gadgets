It's a somewhat unique gadget for people with an affinity for gadgets, money to spare and a usecase in their life.\n\nI'm not even thinking about buying it, but I'm really happy about things like this being released, because bringing up something new in the stale smartphone market might lead to actual innovation (like significantly larger batteries or maybe usable projectors) for once, instead of the usual \"We made our fartphone 29 0,5% thinner, it has a 100 mAh larger battery than last year and we crammed some AI crap into it, for only 1.000\u20ac\" that we get yearly from every company.",

          "body": "I have a Doogee VMax Plus which has a 22,500mAh battery and I love it. Yeah it's a brick but I have to charge it less than once a week and that's with two small kids watching hours of video on it a day. The big advantage you get with a single device over a combination is that you never have to worry about power. If I'm going away for a few days I don't need to bring anything other than my phone. I don't need to worry about chargers, power outlet types, connection cables, battery packs or anything else. I can happily go away for a week with none of those things and still not be concerned about whether or not streaming a bunch of stuff is going to cause me to run out of battery.\n\nNow the phone itself has a few issues, the main one being that fast charging doesn't seem to work which means a full charge takes about 9 or 10 hours. I've been onto them about it but Doogee's customer service is garbage tier to say the least but other than that it works fine, the side button is good but tends to activate when you don't want it to but those are device issues separate from the battery life.\n\nI don't see myself ever going back to a phone that doesn't have long life batteries. It just removes a few of those small daily annoyances and that's worth so much more to me than the minor inconvenience of lugging it around.\n\nAlso your point about a separate battery bank avoiding a single point of failure here doesn't apply. If you are depending on having a working phone, a working charging cable and a working battery pack for your phone to work you haven't eliminated a point of failure, you've added two additional ones.",

So a C-rate of 1 on a 33000mAh(or 3.3Ah) battery means you could charge it at 3.3 Amps. Watts are Amps * Volts, so 1C for this battery would be 16.5W.\n\nThis product claims it can be charged at 66W, which would be 4C, and that's...already pretty high.  Honestly higher than is advisable&mdash;the higher the C-rate typically used to charge it usually means the lower the lifespan of the battery.  And because the USB-C power delivery spec already comfortably allows 66W, there's no real reason to use more than one cable.",
