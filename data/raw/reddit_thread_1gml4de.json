It is failing to get through basic tests. XPeng and Huawei are excellent ADAS systems already, arguably closest to L4 without geo-fenced lidar mapping like Waymo and Baidu. One advantage to Chinese is that the sanctions are porous. They have no problem accessing H100 for training. For onboard inference, is 2nm really going to make a difference? It might not matter because you are reacting to events in real time. Having a 2nm just means you can stack bigger models, but bigger models can mean slower reactions.",

That means they have seemingly fixed their quality control, their substandard metallurgy, precision manufacturing tolerances, in ten years. \n\nI know it\u2019s easy to scoff at them, and yeah for some reason they like to show every less than perfect iteration of something and way over state its capabilities.

Buying knowledge and stealing technology has been finessed by the Chinese over the past decades and we underestimate that country's engineering prowess at our peril IMO, not least because of the vast resources in terms of people and money they can throw at projects. \"Move fast and break things\" but on a massive scale. Their achilles heel (now that they have probably improved engineering QC) is probably corruption, which often becomes endemic when vast bureaucratic ventures meet limitless money.",
