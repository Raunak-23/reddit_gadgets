Even with that power draw it would fall into the worst category G of the EU energy label.\n\nA quick market research shows that most monitors fall within the categories E and F of the EU energy label. In category F a 30\u201d screen is allowed 30\u202fW of power consumption. A 27\u201d screen can draw up to 26\u202fW. In category E the values are 25\u202fW resp. 21\u202fW.\n\nAs an air purifier has to overcome the air resistance of the filter, it draws significantly more power than a case fan. The values of 30\u201370\u202fW of u/elmo85 seem more appropriate here.\n\nIn the end I would argue that the actual ratio is not of importance, but rather the additional cost for running the air purifier. If we assume the rather low end of the power consumption of 30\u202fW for the air purifier and assume an average usage time of 1\u202fh/day of the monitor, it will take ~11\u202fkWh of additional energy consumption per year. With typical electricity prices from Germany that would be less than 4\u202f\u20ac per year.\n\nObviously if you use your monitor more, it will be more expensive but you\u2019ll also have more filtered air. And the other way around.",
