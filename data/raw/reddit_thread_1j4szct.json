                          "body": "I did some digging, and for some reason this isn't laid out simply anywhere, but it seems you're kinda correct. The AACS encryption used by Blu-rays allows newer Blu-rays to contain updated key lists, but there's also a trick in the system that allows them to Blacklist certain software/hardware from decrypting the updated list if deemed necessary. Probably an attempt to prevent compromised hardware/software from gaining the latest keys. The disc isn't modifying the players, just providing a list of updated keys that a player may or may not be able to decrypt because of the blacklist trick in the encryption. In cases where your hardware/software is blacklisted, it must be replaced or updated in order to start decrypting the updated key list again. \n\nIt seems the PS3 either can't read these lists on Blu-rays though, and thus can't update its key database to play new Blu-rays; or the PS3 is considered a constant security risk by AACS(maybe because people can easily mod it these days) and so they constantly Blacklist its older firmware in order to force people to download the new firmware. The former situation makes me wonder why they can't just add the needed functionality in a firmware update, unless it's because it requires specific hardware now, which the PS3 doesn't have by fact that it's so old and one of the first blu-ray players. The latter makes me wonder why they even bother blacklisting the PS3 if they aren't preventing modding from taking place anyway, and there are likely other sources people have to obtain the keys at this point.",

Some are a lot better than others.  (I've seen some products made in China that suffer from 'solder rot' within 2-3 years.)  But if it takes 10 years to understand that it's a bad solder formulation to use, it's too slow for a manufacturer to make a meaningful, informed, change.  When a product is 10 years old, the manufacturers would prefer that you replace it anyway:  customers don't make the association of bad material selection with reduced lifespan. \n\n   ... but it is in some other ways largely consistent.  We're now groomed to expect 10 years as a reasonable lifespan for electronics, and after that point we accept that we're on borrowed time.  That wasn't true previously.  In my industry, there are tons of 40 year old electronics that still work fine, and 20 years or (much) longer was standard.  Stuff got replaced because it's capabilities or features were no longer sufficient, not because the solder failed.  \n\nCRT televisions and computer monitors are a good example:  most got replaced while still working, because they were too bulky, didn't have compatible tuners anymore, etc., etc.-- but not because they quit working.",

We've seen cables with a total of 6 lead-free solder joints fail within a few years, while the same cable/connector with leaded solder expected to last until the rubber insulation on the cable deteriorates.  And in some ways, older style point-to-point or thru-hole circuitry are more at risk from early failure, since the predicted instance of failure happens first on large solder pads, not small ones.       \n\nLead was added to solder for a couple of reasons:  to prevent the normal tendency of tin to crystalize over time (leading to fractures, air permeability and corrosion of the joint), and to reduce the melting point of the solder.  The reduced melting point, among other things, allows an wider 'window' between being hot enough to melt & flow the solder, but not hot enough to damage sensitive components.  In my view, the crystalization issue is the hardest one to adjust for with lead-free formulations, since it takes time (perhaps years) to present as an issue, so it's harder for manufacturers to be aware of issues, and make changes.  With the current trend towards everything being manufactured to be disposable with shorter lifespans, there's also a temptation to just not worry about it at a manufacturing level:  repairs that are not economically viable for the end-user fits in well with the manufacturer's desire to sell you the newest model anyway.  Manufacturers are quick to find workable solutions to the melting point issue, since failures would occur during warrant periods or early consumer satisfaction with products.  But manufacturer's don't have the same interests in worrying about long-term stability of solder joints, since it's a natural conflict between wanting to build good products, versus wanting to sell you a replacement for a product that failed earlier.",
