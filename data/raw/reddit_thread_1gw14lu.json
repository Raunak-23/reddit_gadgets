I researched positioning systems for my uncle\u2019s prototype (grass printer that can print images like on the end zone of a football field) and came to the same conclusion. Getting three dimensional millimeter-precision positioning is expensive and generally needs two or more outer reference points. This would reduce it to one source point and if they are able to reduce the cost while maintaining accuracy, we\u2019re about to see a crap ton more drones.",

The state of Israel and enclaves of the Palestinian people are at war. This article is about a development of new missile and drone technology that allows them to operate when gps is unavailable. You then stated that because it is British it is going to be used to target Palestinian children. I don\u2019t follow the logic there but I can extrapolate from the article my own knowledge and knowledgeable comments on it, that it is unlikely but possible that it would be a tool that the Israeli military would need in their arsenal against Palestinians. As I stated their current weapons are more effective, tried, tested and economical. Stating this information doesn\u2019t in any way imply approval or disapproval of any side of any military conflict or their tactics. My conversation here is a discussion about a technology and its deployment in theatres of operations not the morality or justification of given sides in a conflict.",
