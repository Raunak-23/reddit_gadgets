      "body": "As someone who works at a repair depot i find Lenovo to be the easiest OEM to get parts for, and they're extremely easy to take apart and put back together.. at least the thinkpads. You can replace the whole bottom half of the laptop in 20 minutes which would take a good hour or so on an Apple. A lot of their units have replaceable keyboards which you can literally swap out in 2 minutes if you take your time. HP aint bad either however they have some ridiculously outdated serializating processes for their system boards etc.  \n\nDell is by far, by FAR the worst. They use an AI chatbot to screen out our warranty claims, and if you can't really get parts from them if the unit is out of warranty.  Fuck Dell",

Everything was fine after cleaning and drying the mainboard, but the keyboard was absolutely cooked. What\u2019s sucks is the keyboard on this model is integral to the palm rest, as is the trackpad. It required purchasing the entire palm rest/keyboard/trackpad assembly for nearly $300, and complete disassembly from the bottom-up to get it done.\nNOT fun. But it\u2019s as good as new, and it now stays in my office away from the toddler.",

Spent $50 drop shipping the plastic palm rest from China, just to realize the keyboard is heat staked to the palm rest... Had to spend another $70 for the combo. Other than that it's really easy to take apart and there are a ton of replacement components even 5 years later.\n\nHowever they fucking soldered 4gb of ram to the motherboard. At least make it fucking 8gb....So now I'm running 12gb on a 4gb and 8gb stick. It came with a slow ass hdd too, so I threw a SSD in there. I've also swapped out the screen for ~$100 because the stock one suuuuuucked. That wasn't too difficult either, but I did absolutely mangle the old screen trying to peel it off the chassis. This is a 5 year old laptop now though. I wouldn't be surprised if newer ones have more heat staked and glued in components.\n\nIf I hadn't bought it refurbished in 2020 for half price, I never would have bought it. I had to sink $200+ into it just to make it usable, and from what I hear their Ideapads haven't gotten any better.",

So you get a brand new bottom case, keyboard, touchpad, touchbar and battery for $250. Pretty sweet deal. \n\nApple only charges $89 for iPhone batteries too, and their batteries are amazing. I wish my Android had that, my only options are shitty third party knockoff batteries that don't last as long and I have to replace it myself or in a third party shop (tbf I have a OnePlus phone, I'm not exactly depending on their support for it).",

While warranty claims can be tedious, finding parts outside of warranty isn\u2019t an issue. Dell has a parts lookup tool by serial number, and we regularly source parts for 4\u20135 year old devices through their site or Amazon before sending requests to procurement.\n\nSo, saying you can\u2019t get Dell parts out of warranty is just wrong. Here\u2019s an example of an older All-in-One system with available replacement parts: [Old All In One](https://www.dell.com/support/product-details/en-us/servicetag/0-OGFnQzBLVjY2UU1MZ0taRHpJS3R3Zz090/upgrade)\n\nAlso, Dell\u2019s driver tool is awesome and they do a much better job on bios update tools than other brands in my opinion.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nDell parts are available well beyond warranty through a third party or them\u2014we order them all the time. Their driver tool is great, too.",

Gets to be a pain in the ass. Whereas Lenovo they basically have everything listed on their website, in plain view easily found.  \n\nI was exaggerating a bit when I say you can't find parts, you can, we use Parts People all the time, but that just introduces more possible failure points as you get used parts that are sometimes defective.",

If you don\u2019t have the firmware, you can\u2019t flash a clean one to fix a very basic charging circuit repair, which is easy on most PC laptops and all Macs.\n\n2. Modern devices tend to use Lenovo ThinkEngine as an SIO chip, which means if it dies, you need to find a donor to fix it.\n\n3. **WORST shit.** They have been using low-temp solder for a few years now, with a melting point of around 138\u00b0C. It is fragile as shit\u2014it dies if the mainboard bends (it fucking bends as you type on the keyboard or grab the laptop by a corner). This leads to all sorts of ripped BGA issues\u2014memory, CPU, SIO, and inrush MOSFETs literally soldering themselves off the board (which has become a signature problem on certain Lenovo devices).\n\n4. **Even worse shit.** **Compound.**\n\nBecause of point 3, Lenovo decided to glue chips onto the board with an extremely hard adhesive. It\u2019s way tougher than on iPhones, Macs, or even automotive devices. On newer devices, it hardens further when heated. This makes trivial repairs **extremely** difficult. Some adhesive variants are thermally unstable, which means: you solder a GDDR chip near the GPU, keep everything around it as cool as possible, but remember the 138\u00b0C solder? You finish the job, and now the chips around it need reballing too because the solder popped out from the compound.\n\nRemoving chips on some devices is extremely challenging. I have a **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 9** here, which just needs a simple SIO reballing (it only turns on if you press on the chip, which is a 100% easy fix on any device except Lenovo). Most likely, I will have to **drill it away**, since pulling it under heat would likely damage the PCB and rip off lots of pads. So instead of a 30-minute job (including disassembly), it becomes a **\u201chard case\u201d** simply because of its manufacturing design.\n\nI happen to know someone who has access to Lenovo\u2019s internal remanufacturing kitchen\u2014Lenovo themselves **have no adhesive removal method**. If they need to remove a CPU from a board, they **CNC-drill it away**.\n\nTo sum it up\u2014yes, Lenovo is the **shittiest brand to fix** if you do component-level repair.",
