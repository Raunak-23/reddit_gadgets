The US has tons of treaties with tons of different nations and trading blocs, and traditional US allies may join the US in tariffing certain industries/countries. Countries may join the US purely to show solidarity as allies, or because they agree with some reasons for the tariffs (see Chinese EVs). If your country decides to join in the tariff wars, then yes, your prices will definitely go up.\n\nThis alone means that the answer is extremely convoluted, but it's made even more uninterpretable by the fact that Trump 2024 is an unprecedented and historic fuck up by the US, and US allies are realizing now more than ever that the US isn't a reliable ally. This will force countries to heavily review themselves, and will almost certainly force more spending as other nations realize that global peace is much further from guaranteed than they thought.\n\nIf I had to guess, I'd say that the next 10-20 years will be significantly more expensive for everybody to buy almost everything (beyond just regular inflation). That said, I also think that the biggest reason PC parts skyrocketed is because of COVID causing a MASSIVE shortage and because of cryptocurrency going absolutely bananas (and everyone buying parts to mine crypto). I don't think either of these two things will happen again in the near future, so maybe PC parts will remain reasonably priced. \n\nI guess there's also corporate greed to consider? They could just raise prices because they're assholes. There are very few major competitors making PC parts, so we're also at their whim. If the market will bear (and still consume) elevated prices within the US, perhaps the same will be true without the US?",

In US the average household income is 114k while the median is 80k. That gargantuan difference showcases how the average is inflated due to rich people and it's not representative of the majority of the citizens.  \n\nBut also, you are comparing currency trades, not real purchase power. Cost of living in Europe is on average 60% of the cost of living in the US. If you earn double but pay double for the same apple, you are not richer. Currency conversion only affects international trading, which,  of course , affects the final price, but much less than what you can expect.\n\nThat's why, in the end, Europeans can save more and can  afford better social benefits despite earning less according to the currency market. But believe it or not, in europe people pay in euros and purchase in euros, there's no trading conversion, so there's no loss in money.",

Technology and electronics, more expensive than in the US. Cars, too. Specialty items (tools and whatnot) for whatever industry or hobby or business venture, much more expensive. I\u2019ve been dying to find a bank that would approve a mortgage so I can own the roof over my head but for the median property price they all ask about a demonstrable income of around 3-4K USD per month, which isn\u2019t happening because that is reserved for the top 4% of earners at a national level. \n\nMinimum wage doesn\u2019t get you shit in mexico. I\u2019m not kidding, it\u2019s barely a life. You spend most of your income in the public transport rides that get you to and back from your job, and your daily lunch. Most low income workers live 2-3+ hours away from their jobs because they can\u2019t afford rent in closer places, and the vehicles they use get routinely mugged. So you wake up at 4am to leave your house at 5, pray that you don\u2019t get robbed on your way to work, get to your job by 8 and most companies don\u2019t adhere at all to federal labor laws so it\u2019s common to not get stuff like overtime. Let\u2019s say it was a good day and you end your shift at 6 and get home a bit after 9. You\u2019ve spent $5 of your $12.50 daily income and need to wake up 7 hours later if you\u2019re lucky to do it all over again. \n\nNot to mention, many many jobs don\u2019t even pay minimum wage. Our institutions are a joke and it\u2019s a prevalent practice because they obviously get away with it. There\u2019s people working more than 70 hours a week, for $30 total. That\u2019s $120 a month. \n\nSo yea. I\u2019m blessed in ways that 90% of the country can only dream of, but if I performed the same job in the US I\u2019d earn easily 10x as much. Regardless of what an avocado costs in the supermarket over there, my standard of life would increase exponentially. I lived in Vancouver for a while and earned practically the same as a dishwasher a decade ago, than nowadays after building a real career in my own country. And I could afford so much shit and travel and do so much more. \n\nComparing dollars to pesos is completely ignorant. Even at $7 an hour, US workers have it significantly better.",

The hope is that since Chinese steel is now X% more expensive, it'll incentivize American companies to buy steel domestically and therefore incentivize the raw steel companies to make more steel domestically.\n\nJust a few problems with that\n\n1. Making new steel capabilities, mines, forges, whatever, doesn't happen overnight and doesn't happen without massive capital investment. In the meantime, our companies need steel regardless, so they're buying from China anyway.\n\n2. Even if we DO ramp up domestic raw steel production, the domestic companies can just sell their own steel at some Y% markup that's only slightly less than the X% tariff. Why would they leave potential profit on the table? In the long run, this will still lead to products costing more.\n\n3. And finally, there's a reason why companies have been outsourcing for decades. Even WITH an X% tariff, Chinese steel may *still* be cheaper than whatever American steel that can be made domestically. Combine that with the previously mentioned massive initial capital investment needed to ramp up... So companies keep buying Chinese steel, there's no great revitalization of American Big Steel, and the consumers have to eat the cost anyway for no real benefit.  \n\nAs a tool to \"lower inflation\" it just doesn't work. It barely worked as a protectionist tool to keep American industry domestic anyway. There's a reason why we abandoned mercantilism last century.",

Which means they don\u2019t have any money to buy anything else, this goes into the wealthier Americans losing jobs because gdp is falling off a cliff. Which leads to, the top 1% buying all resources and creating an oligarchy society. Which is what people like Peter thiel and Elon want, because they think the majority of Americans don\u2019t have the knowledge to run a country but they do. \n\nif you think tariffs are going to magically boost domestic production within a few years. you are delusional, it took decades to move manufacturing out of america but somehow its magically going to return in a few years lol Secondly, this theory eliminates the rest of the world, as if they are going to just sit by and allow US to move all manufacturing back. people have no semblance of critical thinking.\n\nAlso, go look at the impact of his manufacturing and tariff policy in 2016. The final report showed it cost the American tax payers an average of 815k in taxes to return 1 manufacturing job.",

If people forsee money getting cheaper and massive new tax cuts for corporations then the markets themselves will surge.  \n\nTrump wasn't awful for the economy, he was pretty middle of the road but he did explode the deficit even pre-pandemic and all his tax cuts never even achieved over 3% gdp growth once.",

The subsidies are meant to keep prices artificially low (with help from slave and child labor) so that American companies can no longer compete and have to move manufacturing to China. The tariffs will be paid by importers, yes. However, in order to keep prices competitive, China would have to subsidize their companies even more so that they can sell their products at a low enough cost that they still beat out American made products. That\u2019s how the Chinese government ends up paying at least some of the tariff in a way.",

Mostly because it makes shit up and isn\u2019t even relevant to my earlier points.\n\nTrump literally said he would put 70% tariffs on all goods from china.\n\nAnd 10-25% tariffs on all foreign goods.\n\nThat includes food. That includes plastic. That includes electronics. Literally everything from other countries.\n\nI don\u2019t think ALL tariffs are a bad idea, but trump\u2019s brainless idea of just putting blanket tariffs on everything WILL increase prices for american consumers by a ridiculous amount.\n\nAnd inflation wasn\u2019t because of Tariffs. Or because of Biden. It was because of trump\u2019s stupid policies while he was in office the previous 4 years, and partially due to the long-term consequences of Covid finally being felt. Because he chose to do nothing about them while he still could.\n\nInflation STARTED under Trump. Pretty early in his presidency actually. And it continued growing until the inflation reduction act went into effect under Biden. Biden managed to slow and stop it after years of trying to get a bill passed, and now trump wants to get rid of the inflation reduction act altogether.\n\nSame with the CHIPS act. Which helped Arizona start investing in the domestic manufacturing of microchips. Both republicans and democrats have been working for the better part of a decade to get that passed, and trump wants to scrap it on a whim. That will GUT chip production in the US. And make us even MORE reliant on Taiwan.\n\nAnd deporting 12 million illegal immigrants will gut our agricultural sector. Because there are tens of thousands of farms on which the only workers are illegal immigrants. Those farmers can\u2019t afford to pay minimum wage to american workers, so they hire illegal immigrants.\n\nWhat do you think is gonna happen to the price of food when all foreign food has a 20% tariff on it, and domestic produce prices skyrocket due to farmers having to pay american workers 2x as much as they paid illegal immigrants?\n\nFood prices are already high. They\u2019re going to become outright unaffordable for many families. I predict that we\u2019ll see a MASSIVE spike in people needing food stamps just to survive in the next 4 years.\n\nA program that trump wants to gut as well, by the way, so it will have less funding than it does under Biden.\n\nNONE of Trump\u2019s braindead ideas are good. All of them will result in economic hardship being felt throughout the country, mostly by working people.",

If he legit puts a 60% tariff on all tech imports from China, that's widespread and hits almost instantly. I don't think he's going to ramp it up slowly.

Meanwhile VOO, VTSAX, S&P 500 are all up 36%+ over the last 12 months, inflation is sub 2.5%, and we dodged a recession without completely destroying the labor market.\n\n\nIf you invested in the markets, and make enough that the recent inflation did not have a meaningful impact then its fucking obvious how great things have been.  These people will be perfectly fine under trump as well.  It is a very different story for the people on the other side who are not as fortunate.\n\n\nFor all the people who are not in that scenario that voted for Trump its going to be a rough ride.  Inflation is already down, and it will never be reversed.  Tariffs are going to raise prices across entire markets.  We live in a capitalist society, and if foreign imports go up then domestic products will raise their prices as well.  The markets will probably still do well under Trump, but that wont help these people put food on the table.\n\n\nThere are a lot of people who treat elections like its their fucking sports team and went out to own the libs, and to those people i say enjoy the ride.  That said there are a lot of families on the right who just voted out of ignorance that are going to suffer because of this as well.  I'm not mad or resentful that Trump won, I'm just disappointed that so many of my fellow Americans let fear and lies convince them to vote against their own best interests",

To rebuild/renovate, retool, and restaff manufacturing plants would take years of time and hundreds of billions (or trillions) of dollars - not to mention the massively increased labor costs. No industry is going to make that investment when dumbfucks who tariff willy-nilly are going to be out of the office in a few years. Plus, it's likely that almost no industry *can* make that investment without a ridiculous amount of funding from the gov't - which means raised taxes just so we can pay raised prices for American goods. \n\nEven if smart Americans wanted to attempt to bring back American manufacturing, the industries would fail almost instantly. Products would cost astronomically more than similar products from anywhere else. Who's going to buy an American product when you can get a comparable product for a fraction of the price? Certainly not anyone in the rest of the world, and certainly not the average American who is already living paycheck-to-paycheck and who will have to contend with everything costing hundreds to thousands of percent more. Almost nobody will buy American goods because they'll be far too expensive. \n\nAmerican general manufacturing will never make sense again. The US is too far ahead of the rest of the world in terms of cost of labor and production.",

Last time Trump was president he put tariffs on Canadian Aluminum, this raised costs of producing goods so much that a lot of people lost their jobs, a lot of businesses closed as it was no longer profitable, nobody is going to pay like 30% more for a already created product over night when they can import that same product for 20% more internationally.\n\nBefore tariffs are put in place....  You need to ensure the US can meet the required numbers, if you can't you have to build those factories/refineries etc etc to meet the demand with Federal Dollars, then finally you have to subsidize them and already existing manufacturers to keep costs low while people get used to increased prices. EG: subsidize the cost of US made products/materials and slowly decrease the subsidy over a 4 year term, this way businesses won't get blindsided, less people will lose jobs etc...\n\nTariffs suck ass.\n\nAnyways why are they a good thing? They can increase...  domestic production which creates manufacturing or whatever jobs but only if the feds invest into whatever they're putting tariffs on...",

You do realize that right? \n\nSure, that's called an economy.\n\nBut governments also have responsibilities, it's not a libertarian society where you have to pay a ton of money to build roads yourself that you personally need to drive, that I do not. You can't do those things without money.\n\nHell, you can't have social safety nets without these things. Ironically to your views, the rich are immoral, by hoarding money and *taking away* jobs created through the transfer of money for goods and services. Often tax cuts don't do much at all for the layman, but do a lot more for the rich, but that money often gets focused on wealth rather than redistribution.\n\nIt's the funniest thing about libertarian views when it comes to economics is the whole ignoring that a lot of people straight up want to horde funds rather than want to be running lean to promote job growth, so people would just spend as little as possible on things which means everything you *do* spend on will suddenly be much more expensive as nothing is subsidized by the masses.",

Federal government isn't supposed to create all the rules we live by.  It is supposed to be the body that protects from foreign threats and makes sure the states can work together and enforce the fundamental rights of the constitution.\n3. Social Safety nets are not a safety net.  The government just sucks money out of these programs.  What happened with the hurricane money or Maui?  Supposedly only have 750 for the purpose the program was actually created.  Social security age keeps getting pushed back and even then the amount of money doesn't even make sense.  If some one works from age 18 to 65 the amount of money just placed into an mutual fund would be like 10x as much and they would still have the entire fund in their control.  Social security is shit.\n4. The FDA isn't actually protecting us.  They actually help enforce the system that is creating the reliance on the medical system for a constant stream of symptom preserving treatment plans meant to sap money out of your pocket until you die.\n\nHow do we pay for everything?\n\nFederally it gets paid by tariffs. By doing this it creates an incentive for politicians to bring in more money to the country.  It also does the same to companies.  If you have a high enough tariff it has the effect of forcing companies to build at home.\n\nState by state you just have sales tax and tolls.  This is what Florida does and they literally have a surplus of money.",

Does it matter Republicans now have a quadfecta in the federal power, and have control over most states governments partially or fully? Not to them it doesn't. The economy is always! dems fault. So that's why they elect us every few years once the economy goes sour (eyeroll)\n\nI mean just look at all previous elections in recent memory -\n\nGeorge HW bush (with impacts finally being felt from Reagan's terrible economic choices) crashes economy - they elect clinton. Clinton fixes economy and gives us surplus\n\nGeorge W bush steals election from Gore and destroys the surplus, international affairs, and crashes the economy\n\nObama comes in and fixes Bush's economy.\n\nObama leaves, Trump says (everything is terrible!) (everything is not terrible). He comes in, rides Obama's great economy. Fumbles covid (doesn't crash the economy but makes it worse) and the economy 'crashes' to covid.\n\nBiden comes in. Post covid the entire world deals with inflation and other issues. Trump prevents Biden and dems trying to secure the border. Biden finally gets inflation under control, better and faster than most other countries. Starts to fix infrastructure (which republicans voted against but took credibility for the funding), and adds many new jobs.\n\nNow back to Trump, he's going to ride the changes Biden made and claim that lower inflation and what not was his doing. If economists are right, he will crash the economy with tariffs and spending cuts and tax cuts for the rich.\n\n  \nHonestly I'm considering voting for republican in 2028 (if we can even vote). I don't want them to fucking scapegoat AGAIN and use us as their doctor to set the bones and bandage the wounds. Let them and all of us suffer in their shitty choices for once, and make THEM solve their economic downfalls.",

This allows for fractional distillation, allowing you seperate out \"fractions\" which are mixtures with a set range of hydrocarbon chain lengths.\n\nNow in the crude oil industry, there are 4 broad terms which dominate describing the types of oil. There's Heavy and Light - heavy means the oil is dominated by long chain polymers, light means its a mixture of shorter chain polymers.  \nThen you have Sour and Sweet, which refers to sulphur content - sweet oil is low in sulphur, sour is high in sulphur (these terms come from when well-borers literally tasted the oil to check quality).\n\nLight, sweet oil is highly desirable because it requires minimal processing to refine it into high quality fractions. You get a lot more gasoline out of it straight out of the door, so it commands a premium.\n\nUnfortunately, 70% of the worlds crude oil reserves are heavy crude, and that's a problem because you cannot just distill that to get gasoline (which is roughly in the range around 8 carbon atoms long, hence the so-called octane rating). Instead, they use a process known as cracking, where the heavy oil is heated to high temperatures in the presence of a catalyst which then breaks up the longer chain polymers into shorter chains which can then be distilled in kerosene, gasoline, naptha, etc.\n\nOnly problem is, much of these heavy crudes are also *sour*. Sulphur fouls up many of the processes, can cause crosslinking of hydrocarbons and all kinds of bullshit chemistry that brings down your yield and generally gums up your equipment.   \nSo you need more advanced systems to scrub the sulphur out of the oil to more acceptable levels, because the regulations also limit the sulphur content in your products (high sulphur gasoline is both bad for your engine and your lungs).\n\nSo as a result, you need highly skilled chemists and engineers, lots of capital and billions worth of equipment to clean and process the crude that comes in, and you prefer to focus on sour heavy oils because your advanced technologies were expensive to develop and build, and you want a return on that investment.\n\nThis means that the refinery capacity in the US is predominantly built to handle heavy, sour crude from exporters like Venezeula, Mexico, Russia and Canada. Not nearly as much capacity handles light crude such as West Texas Intermediate.\n\nAs for your question about refinery locations, oil is rarely refined onsite. Instead, refineries tend to be sited near logistics hubs, where millions of barrels can easily be shipped in by tanker, railway or pipeline. Then you refine and ship it back out the way it came.\n\nIf you've read all this, well done, but this is just a tiny dip into the science and engineering behind the scenes.",

Get engineers to sustain the site etc. takes time. \n\nAnd then you have to worry about the supporting infrastructure like proper road/rail access, proper road/rail vehicles, proper harbors, proper airports to sustain everything.\n\nIt can be done quicker dont get me wrong, but even if you build within the place that provides most of the bulk raw materials and machines, for example giga3 in Shanghai that was build within a year.

Within 5 years you should be good on that front...except for a bunch of other factors.  \n\nThe problem arises because that's for *one* material. And it has to happen across the board. This means that companies are going to have to pay more for resources, and that's going to slow it down considerably as it needs to fit into annual capex budgets. Tariffs are going to very quickly make that a lot worse, because most goods aren't made of a single material and the costs for supplies are going to spike in retaliation.  \n\nIn the meantime, customers still need to buy whatever is being produced, and that's going to be at an increased cost to them because China isn't paying the tariffs, consumers are. That slows the economy, and less money being spent all around will quickly stall out growth. Those budgets are now tighter still.  \n\nOh, and then there's other issues. See, it turns out that if you mass deport people, the industries they work in (often ag) now can't plant crops or pick them. In some ways that's good because exploitation of workers is fucked up, but now they need workers. Most Americans are absolutely not going to do that kind of labor at those wages, so prices will increase at the market again, or we're back to importing in the middle of a trade war. Not a good idea in general but a hell of a lot worse with the rest also going on.  \n\nNow, *eventually* that probably sorts out. Which is good - **don't get me wrong, I absolutely want these industries back in the US!!!** - but now all the countries we export to have moved on to cheaper options elsewhere, and aren't going to come back to us.  \n\nAll of this is why Elon is telling you to brace for severe economic hardship.\n\nIf anyone wants to look at an easy to understand example (rather than a whole supply chain for manufactured goods), look at American soybean farmers for the actual effect.  \n\nI'll give a quick synopsis: Trump put in a tariff last time and started a trade war with China, with the expected end result of retaliatory tariffs. This ensured only that domestic soybean farmers' product wasn't moving, and we had to bail them out to the tune of 25 billion dollars. Meanwhile, Brazil ramped up soybean production and undercut us - and the customers never looked back. *Our* farmers suffer, not China.",

Sure, he may have a majority in all branches, but he doesn't have a majority in his MAGA cult. Hell, he might not even actually WANT to pass something like this.\n\nMost, if not all of those Republican congress members comprehend just how terrible this plan would be, and it'd likely have a negative impact on their political career if they're attached to a bill so devastating that it'd lead us STRAIGHT into great depression 2.0.\n\nI believe there is some loophole that he *technically could* use to enact this as an executive order, but that itself is a stretch. In all reality, I think he just capitalized on language that would \"appease the masses\" while campaigning. He took advantage of dumb voters without critical thinking skills. MAGAts obviously don't know how tariffs work, so they'll gladly hop on the, \"yeah, fuck China, make them pay 20%!\" train. \n\nTrump *isn't* as much of an idiot as he lets off, and he is surrounded by advisors of all kinds... he 100% knows how tariffs work and he knows they would not be successful for our economy. \n\n  \nBut, on your point -- If this theoretically did pass, it would absolutely be devastating. Just look at what happened with Trump's washer/dryer tariff in his first term - Whirlpool began producing in America and they ultimately had to raise their prices by *more* than companies like LG/Samsung. Whirlpool was able to make \\~200 jobs at the cost of \\~$800k per job, while LG/Samsung created \\~1500 jobs for Americans without changing a thing.\n\nA 20% flat tariff across the board would lead to every single thing rising 25%+ in price, and wages sure as hell won't change. There wouldn't be a single benefit to this plan.",

Either way though, even if all of us agreed on this point, we're all still too individualistic and divided to form a united front against the powers that be. We would have to spend several uears in suffering until we couldnt take it anymore. Everyone of us are still too comfortable texting our disdain from the comfort of our food filled apartments and homes.",

It's already back to it's normal background rate. In fact, the US handled inflation better than the rest of the world. But these idiots think \"stopping inflation\" means we go back to 2019 prices, which simply will not happen.

Once there's a 60% tariff on goods from China, China now only gets $4 for selling something to the US for $10. China still needs to make its profit though, so they raise the price of the item to $25, now they get $10 when selling it. The net result is that Americans pay more now for the same items, and this is in the hope that some American company would step up and instead make the item and that Americans would buy from them instead. The problem with that assumption is that even if an American company would sell you the item, they'd likely sell it to you for much more than $10 because labor and materials here will cost more money. So that $10 item you were paying for from China is now $25, and the American version is probably at least $25 as well. It's a tax on Americans with the hopes that America gets to keep that money, but let's be realistic, the people getting to keep that money are mostly the rich, and the prices will be going up for the poor and middle class to make that happen.",

They can import it for $100 or buy it from a supplier in the USA for $120. Obviously they import it. \n\nNow along comes Trump as says, well, lets stick a 30% tariff on that import, now it costs $130 to import and $120 to buy from the USA. So they switch to the USA supplier.\n\nAt this stage the USA business has had its cost increase 20%, will they just take the hit, fuck no, the price they resell that product for with increase 20% to cover the lost revenue. Maybe even more if the business wants to appease the shareholders and keep the same margin of profit.\n\nNow, what will also happen is the USA supplier that was selling the item for $120 will see importing that item costs $130 and will then move there own price to match the importing price because no business is going to leave free money on the table. \n\nThe original business that was paying $100 to import the item will now have to pay $130, meaning the price will always match the over inflated tariff price whether or not it is mane in the USA or not. Once again the increased cost will be shifted the consumer. \n\nThis will result in price increases across the board leading to higher inflation.",

Granted those were much lower tariffs than what trump now says he wants, but the only result was companies paying the increased prices and passing that cost along to consumers.  There was no increase in domestic manufacturing. In fact it resulted in a net loss of domestic manufacturing jobs - when companies increased their prices due to the tariffs, demand fell, so those companies that imported tariffed goods (such as domestic manufacturers who use a lot of steel) cut their workforce due to reduced demand.",

Evil people have spent the past four years collecting competent backers to support him this time, so even if 45/47 doesn\u2019t end up following through, it might not be his decision any more.\n\nEdit: For the sake of being more precise, [PolitiFact](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/?ruling=true) gives us the following for 45/47's 2016 campaign promises: \n\n* Promise Kept: 23% (24 promises)\n* Compromised: 22% (23 promises)\n* Promise Broken: 53% (55 promises)\n* Stalled: 0% (0 promises)\n* In the Works: 0% (0 promises)\n\nThe totals here seem to be prone to rounding errors, so we'll give the campaign the benefit of the doubt and correct it to 53% Broken Promises, and include 22% Compromises, for a total of \"75% of promises didn't go as planned.\"\n\nPolitiFact even gave him a gimme in that he kept his promise to \"\\[never\\] say 'Happy Holidays.'\"\n\nWhat's really interesting is he had an \"accidental promise kept.\" Trump promised to make no cuts to Social Security, yet eventually he did propose them in mid-2020. Luckily Congress nixed the proposal, and in effect forced him to keep that promise.",

A quick Google search, as you suggested, reveals the following:\n\n[Politico: \"President Biden announces moves to relax weed restrictions\" (2024/05/15)](https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/16/biden-announces-marijuana-reclassification-00158408)\n\n>Biden announced on Thursday his administration plans to reclassify cannabis from the most restrictive category on the federal list of illegal drugs to a moderately restrictive category. \\[...\\] The move would not make marijuana federally legal, but would lessen the tax burden on state-legal cannabis companies and make marijuana easier to research.\n\n[PolitiFact: Administration formally proposes to ease restrictions on marijuana (2024/05/21)](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/biden-promise-tracker/promise/1529/decriminalize-marijuana/)\n\n>In a landmark step that was decades in the making, the Biden administration has begun moving toward delisting marijuana from the most restrictive category of drugs.\n\n>On April 30, the Justice Department told\u00a0media outlets, including PolitiFact, that Attorney General Merrick Garland had \"circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana\" from Schedule 1, the most restrictive category of drugs under the Controlled Substances Act, to Schedule 3, which involves fewer restrictions on use and research.\n\n[NPR: The Biden administration is moving to reclassify marijuana. Here's what that means](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions)\n\n[AP: US poised to ease restrictions on marijuana in historic shift, but it\u2019ll remain controlled substance](https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-biden-dea-criminal-justice-pot-f833a8dae6ceb31a8658a5d65832a3b8)\n\nThere are more from other reputable sources. Biden really did not talk about marijuana at all, continuing the Trump Administration's policy of \"let the states decide,\" until 2024, and even then it was reclassification, not decriminalizing or legalizing.",

It was supposed to be in full production already, but just finished their first production tests last month and isn't planned to start production until next year.\n\n\nThere were delays due to TSMC not being able to find people in America with the right knowledge and experience to work at their plant, and building the plant was more expensive than in Taiwan so chips from TSMC Arizona will end up costing about 50% more.   And on top of that, the chips still need to go back to Taiwan for packaging because TSMC decided it will be too expensive to build a packaging plant in America which means they still get tariffed on their way back if Trump is serious about tariffing all imports.\n\n\nFor reference, TSMC manufactures the processors in pretty much every device you own.  Even Intel's newest line of processors is manufactured by TSMC because Intel couldn't figure out how to manufacture transistors as small as TSMC can.\n\n\nAnd if you think that's bad, every device you own also uses DRAM chips for memory.  There's basically only 2 companies that make these for most devices, Samsung and SK Hynix, and neither manufacture them in the US.  Or what about storage? Solid state storage in almost all devices these days uses NAND chips.  There are no NAND chips produced in the US.  Even LEDs, there's only a single LED manufacturing plant in the US.",

Intel has been trying for a while to figure it out but haven't had much success, so much so that even they're contracting TSMC to produce their newest line of chips so they can at least have a competitive product to AMD.\n\n\nIt quite literally just comes down to there's only a small number of people in the world that have the knowledge on how to manufacture chips of that calibre and they're all already working for TSMC and to a lesser extent Samsung who have admitted they're a couple years behind TSMC.",

There's a reason why it took billions of dollars in American tax payer money and a heavy tax break to convince TSMC to setup a fabrication plant, and even that couldn't work in the whole supply chain considering packaging still needs to be done in Taiwan.\n\nConsider that where they're currently located, they have access to a market of 8 billion people.  With how expensive it is to duplicate their fabrication plants it is, it might not be profitable to serve a market of only 300m people.  And if you still need to buy their product because no one else in your country knows how to do it, what incentive is there for them to take that loss?  They'll happily just keep selling you their chips and letting you suck up having to pay the tariff on it.",

It\u2019s important to keep in mind that the study was commissioned by a trade group that stands to lose an enormous amount of cash should the tariff go through on electronics. That said, it\u2019s still a strong indicator of where the industry\u2019s head is at and what it believes would be a worst-case scenario when Trump takes office.\n\n\nThe study looked at ten different consumer tech products: smartphones, laptops, connected devices, video game consoles, and various computer accessories. According to the study, a tariff on electronics from China would have the immediate effect of spiking prices and the long-term effect of driving manufacturing to other countries. Critically though, those other countries would not be the United States. It\u2019s still too expensive to make stuff in America and keep costs down.\n\n\u201cAcross the board, the tariffs will cause significant price increases for the U.S. consumer,\u201d the study said. The CTA estimated that laptop and tablet costs would go up 46%, smartphones would go up 26%, and video game consoles would spike 40%. That kind of increase would put the cost of the forthcoming PS5 Pro at just under $1,000. A top-of-the-line GPU, the kind used for AI and gaming, could bloat from around $900 to $1,300. The price of monitors would go up $109, desktops would go up around $74 overall, and headphones could cost an extra $35.",

Not to mention IP that uses this type of writing have been making historic losses. Investors will abandon studios that do not adapt accordingly. The federal government won't have to lift a finger or dictate anything.\n\nWe are going to see a massive shift of the pendulum in terms of societal thinking and it won't be in just video games. This election pretty much pointed out who the REAL delusional people are, have a look in the mirror, you will find the type of insufferable personality responsible for this shift in thinking as well.",

The importer pays that cost once it gets here regardless of if it sells or not,  but typically i'd  assume they wouldn't import it unless they have retailers contracted to sell it to.\n\nThe importers would most likely pass that price into the retailers/distributors it's not likely that many places will take a cut to their profits in the supply chain, so it's expect that initially high priced items would linger on the shelves,  and then get discounted once they sit on the shelves too long. \n\nEventually, i'd expect the quality of the products on the shelves to get worse as corners are cut to lower the prices, or,  more likely,  the manufacturers will offshore the factory to another country that doesn't have such strong tariffs, like what has already been done with moving a lot of production from China to places like Vietnam and India.\n\nUnfortunately, there's not a lot that can be done to bring standard manufacturing back to the US and keep it  price competitive with the cheaper labor abroad. \n\nYou can help by buying American where you can.

China also heavily subsidies many of their products. If they keep manufacturing there they will have to increase subsidies to compete. If it works as promised then we will see prices temporarily higher but then over time as manufacturing returns to the US the prices will lower (not all the way to pre tariff rates because we pay better than jobs in China) at the same time US wages will increase due to a more robust manufacturing market. This in theory should provide more manufacturing jobs that are badly needed in the US. Thus giving US workers more pay to afford the products that are now slightly more expensive and are now made in the US. It will be interesting to see how it plays out and if it works as intended.",

Companies produce in China because it is _much_ cheaper than producing in the U.S. for various reasons and any increased costs from tariffs just get passed on to the consumer, usually with extra price gouging on the side.\n\nSure you could \"theoretically\"  make things cheaper here, but that would require lower safety standards, paying people slave wages and probably a little bit of child labor.",

But even Intel can't figure out how TSMC produces chips like it does so they're now contracting TSMC to manufacture their new line of chips so they can stay competitive with AMD.  That means for 2025, AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Qualcomm, and Apple all have their chips manufactured by TSMC and every single one going into a device sold in America needs to be imported.",

          "body": "Bro. Trump drove the economy into the ground with the *insane* increase in national debt couple with massive tax breaks for the wealthy. The debt increased by nearly 8 trillion under Trump, accounting for nearly 1/3rd of our ENTIRE debt at the time (~24T). That's the *reason* for the inflation problems after he left office. We spent 8 trillion more than we fucking took in. You think that's *good* for the economy? lmfao. Gas prices and egg prices and inflation were up globally, and in most 1st world countries, they were up *more* than the US over the past 4 years.\n\nNot to mention that Trump (along with the GOP majority in congress) let billionaires run absolutely *rampant*. In his final days in office, he also erased flags on hundreds of billions of dollars in PPP loans for the biggest borrowers, giving them essentially free government grants for misspent funds that instead of going to keep workers employed, went into billionaire's pockets.\n\nThe fact that Biden has completely turned around the absolute clusterfuck that took place from 2016-2020 is a minor miracle. Millions upon millions of jobs created/restored, wages on the rise, etc, all despite not having a Democratic majority in congress to get any meaningful legislation passed. It takes time for policy changes to make a difference... We spent the first few years of Biden's administration just trying to recover from the pandemic and fix Trump's free ride for billionaires.\n\nTrickle down doesn't fucking trickle down. Unbridled capitalism and *massive* tax breaks for billionaires doesn't help anyone but the billionaires.\n\nThe narcissist that bankrupted six casinos does not give a fuck about economics, nor does he know how to run a business. He knows how to feed his addiction for attention, and nothing more. He was completely out of his league running a fucking *casino*, a business that is literally guaranteed money, let alone a country.",
