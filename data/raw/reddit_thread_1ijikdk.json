              "body": "I think it's very likely that we will eventually get community support for this controller, just like we did with the wiimote & pretty much every controller ever made.\n\nSpecific game support is ideal, but you can do a lot with the firmware in the case of a purpose build peripheral, or for hardware you don't control an input mapper running on the host computer. \n\nSimplest is mapping the analog stick position to keypresses, but you could also do neat stuff like mapping one axis to +/- dpi for a kind of friction like effect when moving the mouse, or decreased resolution for when you want to make a really fine adjustment in game while moving your mouse a reasonable amount.\n\nor averaging the x/y of the analog stick with the optical sensor. No game specific support necessary, the input is the same as a standard mouse.\n\nAnother feature you could have is chording the analog stick inputs. As an example have all the cardinal directions the analog stick N, NW, W, SW, W etc mapped to a keypress, say 1 through 8, useful for a weapon/item select. If you want more than 8 inputs you could map N to NW, or N to NE for 16 additional inputs, say F1 through F16\n\nFinally, for productivity you could also map the analog stick to keypress/shortcut in such a way that the position controls the frequency of input. Say you are using a video editing program, moving the analog stick to +X 20\u00b0 could send the existing \"advance 10 frames\" keyboard shortcut 1 times a second, while advancing the analog stick to +x40\u00b0 could send that same shortcut 10 times a second. This again gives analog like control without any specific support from the video editor developer.",

The tall and thin (in that orientation) design of the controller seems awkward for a mouse, which is much wider. I'm also a little worried about the controller just being too small. Plus, it looks like you are expected to be using the stick at the same time? Weird, but if it works, potentially interesting. \n\nI'm really curious what they are expecting in terms of surfaces. I personally mostly play in an armchair with a coffee table, but it is too low for me to comfortably use a mouse on. Most people I know use a couch with no table. I could try the arms of the chair or my leg, but both don't give a lot of room and aren't flat surfaces. Is this mainly for use with kickstand mode on the go?",

As some have said lenovo implemented tech with their controllers to make them act as mice- had they patented that design and included the mouse mechanic in it, I'd believe they would be able to defend their patent against Nintendo's if they wanted.\n\nAs for the game design lawsuits, first copyright and IP law can be strict, but the patents Nintendo used show clearly they aren't targeting palworld based on similar looking characters, but on game mechanics. Second, it can be argued, and agreed upon by players and developers alike, that game design patents are wrong and restricting innovation in games, especially in this example where Nintendo seems to be taking action because palworld gained popularity (especially on a platform Nintendo doesn't control). The patents Nintendo are using in the lawsuit dont even sound specific to Nintendo games- I've seen mount riding in tons of non Nintendo games before, doesn't make sense why Nintendo only cares now about it.\n\nBut on a high level, a game design mechanics is a concept, not a specific design that must be unique to one game or IP. A collection of mechanics and assets then form a game, which would be intellectual property by the developers. Sure some software solutions and components may be unique and specific enough for a patent, so the argument with game design and patents is if a single game mechanic is unique and specific enough to be protected- devs against game design patents would say no. Assets and source code and many gsme mechanics when put together fork a game or even a unique component like a plugin, which should be protected from copying, but not the individual words used in the code, or the individual pixels of a sprite, or the make file essential in compiling the plugin, or the individual mechanics making a game (or, related to the patent described in the post, the shape of the screws or color of the controllers, as patents, while the overall controller is the patent)",

A player may think of some unique design element for their game, an easy example being loading screen minigames, but then they risk a cease and desist or being sued because a AAA studio has patented that concept, despite not using it for like 20 years at this point.",

As far as I know the devs of palworld aren't trying to patent any tech in their game, theres no way Nintendo is suing defensively, unless its to defend the Pok\u00e9mon IP, which the patents being used describe only mechanics involved with the game, nothing about the characters or the overall game design potentially copying Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nNintendo has a choice in this situation- do what they did, which was using game design patents against a competitor, where thr patents describe mechanics not necessarily unique to Nintendo games; sue for copyright and IP infringement, making comparisons to the similarities of overall game design and character visuals as infringing the Pok\u00e9mon series; or, not challenge palworld legally, instead competing against them without suing, potentially expanding to the PC market or pushing for their own games to be improved after palworld showed how mechanics seen in Pok\u00e9mon can be used in new ways (the captured animals bring used to do work for the player and wield firearms).\n\nI'm not saying Nintendo shouldn't legally be able to defend their IP, even if I dont like it; what I'm saying is the approach Nintendo is using shouldn't legally be allowed, or it should be shut down as the patents describe mechanics not unique for Nintendo games; and I'm saying game design mechanic patents shouldn't exist as they're concepts or ideas and not specific unique products developed, whereas a game is a collection of said mechanics which can be protected if used in a unique way.",
