PSVR2 released with no games because PSVR1 games are NOT supported. None of them. Remapping controls should be extremely easy for 99% of them, but nope! PC adapter?

The built-in bluetooth has a FAR better antenna than their 'recommended' micro-adapters, and even most desktops a lot of motherboards support wifi + bluetooth directly and... again, the included antenna will work far better.\n\nFor once they actually went with 'industry standards' instead of propietary but then the standards body discontinued it out from under them after they'd already 'taped out' the new tech. :(\n\nBut there are a LOT of third-party PC adapters out now when I look, since it turns out the adapter is painfully simple.",

Go through the normal 'setup' process in the PS VR2 app in Steam but just skip forward when it tells you about the adapter and when it says to plug your headset into the adapter? Plug it into the VirtualLink port instead!\n\nThere is a bug in older PSVR2 firmwares that don't work out of the box with all VirtualLink ports (especially NVidia due to a bug on NVidia's side) so you might need to find a PS5 to plug into briefly to update the firmware on the headset if the one you get has the really old firmware.\n\nAlso one caveat I've encountered with the PSVR2 which others run into: After running SteamVR I lose my mouse cursor on the right half of my primary monitor.\n\nIf that happens to you? Win+Ctrl+Shift+B, it'll restart your GPU driver which fixes the issue.",
