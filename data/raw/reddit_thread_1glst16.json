You setup your film simulation, you take your photo and you\u2019re done. \n\nFuji isn\u2019t aiming for people who want to spend hours staring at light room.\n\nAnd as someone who got burnt out doing professional photography and editing I am pretty happy with just my Fuji film now. It\u2019s so much less work.",
