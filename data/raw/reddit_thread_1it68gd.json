I wish people would stave off the temptation for a few months to show that charging exorbitant prices for games is something we would fight back on. Mid range needs to go back to $500-$700. This $900+ for something that isn\u2019t even at the top of performance is asinine. \n\nPlease people, let the scalpers sit on their stock and sweat while their credit card payments come due. Please\u2026 let this roll until the whole industry gets the hint that playing games might be fun, but it isn\u2019t worth these prices\u2026",
