The X was a smaller phone and it wasn't until the following XS model that they released a bigger 'XS Max' phone that is equivalent to today's top 'Pro Max' flagship. Today's Pro is a continuation of the X, today's Pro Max is a continuation of the XS Max.\n\nSo yes, I'll concede that the Pro Max phone has gotten a $100 price increase compared to the 2018 XS Max. But the regular Pro has stayed the same.\n\n>Tech historically has almost been anti inflationary.\n\nThat really depends on whether it's stagnant tech or something that is quickly advancing I think. Obviously phones are pretty stagnate now. But the price staying more or less the same over the last 7-8 years does mean that prices have gone down in 'real' terms, ie after considering inflation.",
