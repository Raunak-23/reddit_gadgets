NVIDIA is still producing a lot of chips for non-gaming purposes and selling them to companies that make \"AI\" LLMs like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.\n\nThis focus on making GPUs for the LLM market is shifting factory capacity away from the gaming side of things and for the past few years they have been making money hand over fist in the \"AI\" market (higher spec, higher margin chips than on the gaming side) which makes the gaming GPU side a bit of an afterthought for them currently which is negatively impacting the supply of gaming GPUs and contributing to this overall pricing problem.",

PC optimization is SO bad, that the 3rd most powerful consumer graphics card ever made can\u2019t even hit 60fps on some major triple-A titles in JUST 1440p.\n\nWhile that\u2019s an extreme example, it goes show the state of optimization on PC is absolutely abysmal right now. As an owner, I\u2019ve experienced it firsthand, the 5080 STRUGGLES with some games at 4K, and that\u2019s with Nvidia\u2019s proprietary features doing some of the heavy lifting.

However, its definitely a lot worse at RT so you may be right specifically about Indiana Jones since it forces RT. I also cant disagree that there are a lot of unoptimized games on PC. But leveraging FSR4/DLSS definitely gets this tier of card comfortably in a playable range at 4k if perhaps not with RT settings (although I can also do 4k Cyberpunk with High RT settings and get a very playable framerate with DLSS). \n\nI havent used FSR4 myself but according to Hardware Unboxed and Digital Foundry it seems somewhere between DLSS3 and 4 so thats a pretty good result.",

But its not just cards its ram, and cpu and motherboards. Suddenly its not just the new gpu but the new everything that has to go with it. and if you dont w11 wont accept your aged hardware. \n\nLike progress has been at the expense of the consumer, and now everything costs too much, but does pretty much the same thing as 5-10yo hardware just better. But with no legacy support because why would they, they need to make money. So here we are bubbled economy heavign under the weight of unrealistic investor and market expectations and vaporware like promises of the future.",
