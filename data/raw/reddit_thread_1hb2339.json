GTA5? now you can only play single player. Valve are also refusing refunds to a lot of people on the basis that the game has been in their library for more than 2 weeks - completely ignorant (intentional or not) to the fact that the software has been substantially modified from when you purchased it",

Part of the problem with SteamOS 1.0 and 2.0 was the fact it was Debian-based. SteamOS 3.0's move to Arch Linux remedies this issue. \n\nAnd now, Valve is supposedly releasing brand guidelines for other hardware manufacturers to be able to use SteamOS on systems that are built to compete with the Steam Deck. This is a higher level of regulation than what the 2013 Steam Machines were going to have, but if licensing costs are $0, this will help reduce costs for handhelds like the ROG Ally since there's no need for customers or the manufacturer to have a licensed Windows OS installed.",

I think for steam machines to succeed valve really need to price them under comparable windows devices and in line with console costs.",

Most hardware rumors that are this fuzzy usually means that we\u2019re anywhere from 12-18 months away from a release AT THE EARLIEST. In the case of the Nintendo Switch 2, those rumors have been floating around for almost half a decade and we don\u2019t even have an announcement.\n\n2. Valve said that there won\u2019t be a Steam Deck hardware upgrade until there\u2019s a meaningful and significant power difference that they can offer, so even if they did release a new Steam Deck soon, judging by the fact that the cheapest Steam Deck OLED is $549 USD, the cheapest Steam Deck 2 would probably be around least $1,199 and I wouldn\u2019t pay for that when I could probably get a comparable or potentially more powerful gaming laptop for that price",

Yet at the same time, Valve really, really needs to get over themselves to work on it again. For example, voice chat for the chat app was announced back in 2019, and 5 years later there are still no signs of it. Valve created such an amazing foundation with the chat revamp in 2018, just to later act like \"I don't want to play with you anymore\".",

It is the perfected Steam Machine. \n\nEven if they somehow find a reason to offer the steam machine again, if they split attention between steamdeck and steam machine, then they may be shooting themselves in the foot. Microsoft have that problem where they have too many Xbox options which is why they aren't confident making a handheld.",
