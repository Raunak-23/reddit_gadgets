I work in clinical research and have some family who think that big pharma has the cure for cancer but are just hiding it. \n\nLike...I know more about cancer than many people. The complexity and variety, the sheer overwhelming biotechnological prowess we'd need to have achieved to actually create a cure-all for cancer. I'd actually be very okay if that conspiracy theory were true, because it'd mean that we're one step away from a posthuman sci-fi utopia scenario. To say nothing of the tens of thousands of people who would have to know about it, understand it well enough to make the cure themselves, statistically have friends and family dying of cancer, and choose to keep it secret. \n\nDon't get me wrong, big pharma is definitely evil. ...But it's like having an evil overlord who profits off making your life better. They might screw you over, but at least you'll get something out of it usually.",

The companies making the treatments are getting paid no matter what, on top of that. \n\nSo a company who wants some of the money they currently *aren't* getting will create a better treatment or a cure, and can charge a substantial fraction of the lifetime treatment cost for the cure as a fair-market price. The cure is also much, *much* cheaper to produce and administer (medical professionals, chemists, etc. are expensive).\n\nThere's just no incentive to keep a cure secret unless you already have such a stranglehold on the market that it's *still* more profitable just to create an astronomically expensive cure and reduce the production and administration costs massively. \n\nDoes that make sense?",

I work in clinical trials, on oncology trials specifically at the moment, and can think of a handful of drugs approved in the last 5 years that are major improvements on previous treatments available, all with early trials conducted by startups. \n\nI can also think of a couple outright cures for specific types of tumor (admittedly rare ones) that are simply no longer a threat anymore in the developed world. \n\nI don't disagree that medical care pricing is being manipulated to impoverish the working class...But your perspective on the medical sciences is incorrect. It isn't really a matter of opinion, and I don't really blame you. The one thing everybody wants is to live a longer, healthier life. The people who fund medical research do so because they know it benefits themselves personally.",

I worked on the construction side of the company but with the same office space. He was great when it came to data analysis, he was an analyst of some kind for the restaurant/bar side of the company, he would track consumption of alcohol against several variables to determine which bar is \u201closing\u201d money by pouring too much or too little and potentially losing customers, tracking that against visitor counts daily/weekly/monthly/etc . He also did the same for food; whenever a recipe was introduced by the chefs, he would break it down into each material/ingredient. He would add the initial ingredient order for said recipe into his database. He wasn\u2019t in control of placing orders, he was just tracking the content and frequency of the orders versus the ingredients used and wasted. He did it coming from bartending, and had no help from the company cause I promise you this company\u2019s leadership had no idea how to run either a construction or restaurant business lol. He developed the method himself, whether he used google the whole time or not doesn\u2019t matter in my opinion, he was able to use said method effectively and correctly.\n\nSo he is analytical by nature, and knows when he doesn\u2019t know something. He asked me about construction methods all the time for his home projects. But\u2026 he is also a bit off. Huge fitness enthusiast, props to him. But he would have a week of all meat diets, he would then do 3 day water cleanse no food or liquids other than water.

I doubts he\u2019s even smarter than 40% of Virginia.\u201d\n\nCW: \u201cWow you don\u2019t have any idea how intelligent he is. He\u2019s smarter than everyone in this state combined.\u201d \n\n(This part is iffy on the memory) Me: \u201cDude do you really feel that way?\u201d\n\nCW: \u201cOf course I do, how else is he so rich and have diversified blah blah blah blah",
