Apple refused this, and they did not have the ability to unlock the iPhone in question. It turns out some other company had an exploit to do so. I believe this case was to pressure Apple into playing ball, and when that failed they backed off before it went to court.\n\nApple has also released patches in the past to fix vulnerabilities used by tools like Pegasus, but since these actors are out for their own interests Apple or other white hat security researchers also have to find the bugs so they even know what needs to be fixed. The thing you linked in another reply even points out some of these.",

They are evidence exploits exist, as they exist in all software, and are found all the time. Cloudflare had a bug in their proxy caching mechanism that leaked a ton of data. Heartbleed was a bug in openssh that allowed remote access to servers without leaving a trace. None of these were intentional, none of these mean the researchers who found them knew more about those programs than the people who made them. It just means they found found a bug and with an understanding of how these things work were able to exploited it. In the case of Cloudflare, it was found entirely by accident.\n\nNot that long ago a developer at Microsoft who was not doing any form of security research noticed a spike in CPU usage that he was not expecting in a testing environment, and started to dig into it. He found that the very wide spread xz package in Linux had been compromised, and it looks like it been by a sophisticated state actor. So this backdoor was found and fixed before it became wide spread entirely by accident.\n\nThese things exist without the need for the original companies or developers to make them because people make mistakes. Of course Apple could make the best back door, they have the source code. But we have no evidence they have done so.",

You backed up your claim by linking to the Wikpedia page for Operation Onymous, which makes no claim **whatsoever** that Tor was a government honeypot.  Rather, the government appeared to have exploited a vulnerability in the Tor network by flooding the network with their own relays while DDoSing existing relays.  This would force traffic to go through government-owned relays, which they could then trace.",

There\u2019s nothing they can do to get the passcode short of torturing it out of the phone\u2019s owner.

There are components on the phones where even Apple itself cannot update the firmware. It is literally \"hard coded\" (sometimes physically etched) into memory. In particular the Boot ROM for modern Apple devices. This is, for example, how Apple cannot patch, block or prevent jailbreaks from certain generations of hardware. I.e. Checkm8.\n\n> You know what they need to be able to run it on the phone?

We're talking about phones that are locked or turned off here. Specifically not a device that's on, unlocked, on a network (with service), able to retrieve an update, and where a user has approved said *software* update.\n\nFor an existing device in certain locked states, yeah, there's good evidence that Apple itself is in fact unable to unlock their own devices.",

It's not just asking them to unlock one iPhone in a specific case, it's asking them to make iOS vulnerable intentionally so that all iPhones could be unlocked should the need arise.\n\nThe reason this would be bad is that the FBI aren't the only people who would have access to this tool. Other bad actors could find this backdoor and use it for their own gain. And given how public this case ended up being, if they had agreed to it, then it would have been known to these actors to start searching.\n\nThe FBI also didn't need it, they had tools at their disposal developed by third parties who had already found vulnerabilities to unlock the phone. The only reason they did this was to get Apple to backdoor the operating system under the guise of needing it this one time - when Apple refused and they ultimately dropped the case, they had it unlocked within days.",

              "body": "When talking about cracking smartphones, there's an important distinction between AFU and BFU - After First Unlock and Before First Unlock, referring to whether the device has been unlocked or not since it was powered on. \n\nWhen the device is BFU (has not been unlocked since restarting/turning on), it is significantly more difficult to crack, to the point that most people trying to do it simply don't have the tools necessary. It's only when the device is AFU (has been unlocked at least once) that contemporary tools are able to compromise its security and start reading data.\n\nAll that to say that requiring a passcode isn't the relevant bit for your device being secure. If you've unlocked your phone since the last time you turned it off, it can be cracked",

You need to clone the matching enclave to read a cloned phone\u2019s storage. First that means cutting open and disassembling the chip at a microscopic level to try and read it, and it\u2019s deliberately designed so trying this will likely destroy it, in which case you can\u2019t even read the original phone anymore. Then it involves creating a new chip with the recovered ID key also on it. The ID key is on read-only mask memory so you can\u2019t use an existing enclave, and there are involved hardware measures taken to make it difficult to create another device simulating it.\n\nIt\u2019s not physically impossible but figuring out a way to reliably clone a password locked iPhone from this decade without risking evidence destruction would be like a Nobel prize level achievement in security research.",
