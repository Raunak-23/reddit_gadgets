You can't plug in a monitor to the HDMI and another with DisplayPort and use them at the same time.\n\nDocks normally have multiple display interfaces that can be used at once. For example, my Dell one from work (a WD22TB4), has two DisplayPort and one HDMI, and you can use them all at the same time. It also has two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\n\nWith this Anker dock, you can use the Thunderbolt ports as a display out option as well, however, that is eating into a thunderbolt port that you can use for other things. There should have been at least one other output (either a lower bandwidth DP 1.4 or HDMI 2.0) which would help people with multiple displays with their setups, without eating up a super-fast port.",

MacOS has never supported this because they went all in on Thunderbolt which has its own way of doing it but the monitor has to support it too. All Thunderbolt/Usbc docks use DisplayPort tunneling to transfer video signal and bandwidth is limited by the cable and usually docks that support 3 monitors at once are using DisplayLink which is a software solution and introduces noticeable lag. I\u2019ve seen a few docks that have 2 USB connections to mitigate that. HDMI connections are handled by onboard chips that convert the DisplayPort signal and it leverages DSC because of bandwidth limitations. As for the Mac side of things, M series chips have different amounts of display processors. M has 1, Pro has 2 and Max has 4. Also fun fact each display processor stream maxes out at 4K120hz so if you connect a 4K240hz monitor via DisplayPort it actually has to use 2 display processors running 1920x2160@240hz and combines them.",

Or you can plug one Thunderbolt (NOT just USB-C) dock in and do two screens that way. If you plug a regular USB-C dock in you'll get only one screen or both screens working but mirrored, which is useless. \n\nApple, it \"just works.\" Meanwhile my wife's Dell latitude happily docks via one cable and her USB-C dock and powers 2 screens all day long.

So like many people I have a mix of devices from USBA 3.0 drives through thunderbolt 2 drives. Some of those drives are old enough that I plan on replacing them in the next few years. When I do replace them, I will likely buy drives with faster speeds than my current drives. So I would like a dock I would buy today to support the drives I\u2019ll buy in 3 to 5 years.\n\nAdditionally while today I don\u2019t need a dock that can provide 240w power, I may some day in the future. \n\nAdditionally, thunderbolt five has four PCIE 4 lanes versus PCIE 3. But again is not something I need today but is something I may want in the future. \n\nIf 144 Hz refresh rate is the main thing you need, this obviously isn\u2019t the product for you. But there are a way, way more things a dock can be \u201cfuture proof\u201d for than just refresh rate. \n\nThe place I work is actually in the process of buying a bunch of docks. We have zero 144 Hz monitors and I can say with a pretty high degree of certainty that unless 144 Hz becomes the default and you cannot buy lower refresh rate, they will also not have 144 hz monitors for 10 years from now. We do, however, have to deal with tremendous amounts of data, so being able to move that shit around quickly is extremely valuable.",
