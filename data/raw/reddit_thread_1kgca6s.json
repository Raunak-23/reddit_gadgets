And that's when I lived in the county with a much lower crime rate than the city.\n\nI use to ride with a OneWheel group and one of our members got robbed at gun point for his wheel. He called the police who did nothing of course. One of the group members found the police camera that was on that block, they got the cops to pull the tapes. Sure enough the robbery was on camera, including the license plate of the car. Our sluth managed to figure out who the person was for that, found his Facebook profile where he was trying to sell the stolen OneWheel.  Also pulled the background on the guy, turns out he's wanted for some gun crimes.\n\nThey took all this evidence to the police, name, address, contact info from the ad where he's trying to sell the stolen goods. Cops refused to do anything with the information.",
