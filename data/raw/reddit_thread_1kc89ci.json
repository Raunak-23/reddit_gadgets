Seemed like a win-win.\n\nWhat screwed Microsoft was the inability to realize that the average consumer was just fine looking up a site to view supported NVMes, buying one for cheap, using a screwdriver to open their PlayStation and install it themselves. They should have realized - being in the PC space for as long as they have - that consumers were just fine doing their own upgrades.\n\nAnd this is coming from someone who is an Xbox fan. I\u2019ve bought every generation of their hardware (yes the OG and the Xbox One). But I also bought the PS5 and I have a PC. Installing the Samsung Xbox drive (which I also bought) maybe took 1 minute while the PS5 upgrade I did took a few minutes to research and a few minutes to install. It didn\u2019t take much more time overall and was considerably cheaper for arguably the same storage performance. The only advantage I\u2019ve seen is Quick Resume on Xbox (save states to get back into multiple games quickly) requires fast storage, but that\u2019s a feature Sony can copy (still waiting on that Sony - it\u2019s been 5 years now).",

Like I said, anyone in their right mind will never pay for Windows when Microsoft is literally giving it away. You can even use an old Key from an older machine. I can use my Windows key from my Laptop that has Windows Vista Pro on it, and it works. Microsoft also don't give a shit if you even pirate Windows, which you won't have to as they literally let you download it free from their own site. Windows isn't even verified via servers.",

They should have at least stuck a PRO label on it so we didn't feel like we were buying the same old console for 600 bucks.\n\nAlso, Smart Phones and PC's have an excemption from china import tariffs i'd assume consoles also fall into that exemption???  They just get a flat 10% baseline tariff.  If consoles are included in that then this has nothing to do with Tariffs and everything to do with a moneygrab pointing the blame on a false narrative.",
