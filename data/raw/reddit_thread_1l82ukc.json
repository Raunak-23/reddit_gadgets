Currently much older versions of the Time Capsule still work, I\u2019m pretty sure even the first version from 2007 is supported. I\u2019m assuming they\u2019re doing this so that they don\u2019t have to keep issuing security updates and can just say they\u2019re done with the old AirPort hardware.\n\nThe part that worries me is that it says they\u2019re dropping AirPort Disk, which is when you plug an external hard drive into the USB port on a normal AirPort base station. I thought that used a relatively basic file sharing protocol rather than anything proprietary, so I just hope that this is hardware-specific and won\u2019t cause any issues with other NAS solutions. Removing Time Machine\u2019s ability to back up over wifi would be a huge problem and break a ton of backup workflows.\n\nAlso it makes me wonder about the future of AirPlay support on the hardware. The last generation AirPort Express still has a niche following in the hi fi community since it\u2019s a cheap and easy way to add AirPlay audio streaming to an old stereo that doesn\u2019t have it built in. There\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t continue to work indefinitely, but if they\u2019re dropping features arbitrarily so that they can deprecate the product that would be a problem.",
