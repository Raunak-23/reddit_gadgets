Terms like \"USB 3.2 Gen 2\" leave people scratching their heads due to their ambiguity. Thankfully, those names are finally being phased out, thanks to a new USB labeling system.\n\nThe USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) has rolled out updated logos that ditch the perplexing nomenclature, according to a report by PCWorld, offering more straightforward speed ratings.\n\nFor instance, if you spot a USB4 hub labeled \"USB 80Gbps\" on the side of the box, you'll know you're getting the latest and greatest USB technology with a blistering 80 gigabits per second transfer speed.\n\nA step below that will be marked \"USB 40Gbps,\" which is still quite fast. The approach also extends to older USB specs, so you might see a \"USB 20Gbps\" logo for USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 devices, or \"USB 10Gbps\" for USB 3.2 Gen 2 gear.\n\nThe new labeling extends to cables, too \u2013 the new logo will indicate both data transfers and charging speeds, which will go up to 240W. That's exactly the kind of power you'll need for massive 500W bricks capable of charging five laptops at the same time.\n\nFurthermore, laptop manufacturers are expected to start printing these labels across their devices. USB-IF representatives informed PCWorld that Dell may begin to label its USB ports.",

During that interval between technical document and marketing document all the tech influencers scramble to talk about the new standard, months before there will be any devices that support it and to do so they, and by extension their audience, latch on to the terminology of the engineering document that was never intended to be read and understood by the general public.\n\nSince at least 2022 the USB IF's stance has been that the term used for an USB connection should just be \"USB \\[Rated Speed\\]\", no mention of USB 3.2, USB4\u00ae Version 1/2 or the like. Before that there may have been \"SuperSpeed USB \\[Rated Speed\\]\" but even then terms like USB 3.2 etc. were discouraged.",

What\u2019s funny is the number of folks on even the TB sub that like to try prove to me this is not the case. :-)\n\nOf course intel and the USB implementers forum have not made any of this easy to understand.\n\nIf you are interested\u2026..:\n\nI learnt all this as part of getting 3 important TB4 patches into the Linux kernel (to be clear for bugs I reported, I didn\u2019t write any code, did have to compile my own kernel tot test them for intel - that was a fun experience) - upshot IPv6 now works over thunderbolt -net / usb4 p2p networking and one of my bug fixed a class of disconnect issues that would affect docks, monitors etc (basically if there was a disconnection timeout usb4/tb4 stopped trying to reconnect until all cables were replugged.\n\nAnother way to see this on windows is all true TB4 integrated chipsets (not add in cards which are not true TB4) in windows 11 will appear as USB4 router devices. This is because they are using something called a software connection manager. Hardware connection manager implementation are limited as will still say TB. But that\u2019s just a text string thing, it\u2019s still the same routed protocol.\n\nOh and Apple unfortunately get to make their own rules, so their M silicon TB implementation is some weird hybrid that doesn\u2019t support all features - thanks apple.",

And because there are piles with billions of already manufactured connectors in Shenzen, while a lot of hardware is fine with just 5V over USB - at best, in couple years we will assume every non-compliant connector is USB2 (Or 3, depending how much trust you have in port color itself).\n\nThis sucks. And until new USB2 connectors with compliant markings (480Mb/s / 2.5W ?) will appear on the cheapest, 1$ AliExpress devices - it'll keep sucking.\n\nMost likely, everyone will end up with some cheap cable testers, especially since HDMI has now exactly the same problem.",

This is how usb has all its longevity by requiring all cables to support old usb and plug detection. This legacy support is not only amazing but actually sufficient for 60w charging and low speed devices.\n\nBesides my usb flash drive and a portable monitor (that I use hdmi on mostly) everything else is the old usb 480mbps speed and works fine.
