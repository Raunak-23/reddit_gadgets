          "body": "I hesitated to move to Steam (from just CS1.5) for CS1.6 for around a half year or so because I wasn't terribly comfortable with conceding that much control of my games to a video game company. I begrudgingly made an account because I love counter-strike and wanted to play on populated servers, but steam being a requirement still feels kind of hamfisted. The Orange box also requiring it for single player games felt even more nonsensical since most of steam's features at the time had to do with things like server lists and friends.\n\nNow, I think Valve has been a good steward and has not abused its position as the controller of your access to your video games and has added features to ensure that you can still access them offline, but I still don't think features you mentioned necessitate additional DRM for the game itself. \n\nI think \"tolerate,\" like you said, is probably the right word for it.",

There is that sweet spot there where your content is protected enough to discourage casual piracy but not protected so well that it negatively affects people who actually pay for the content.",

Back then people were just getting enough computer space to store MP3s and there weren\u2019t music streaming providers. So for people to legitimately get all the music they were now being pushed to consume (especially thanks to MP3 players and the iPod) they *had* to either pirate or spend loads of cash on CDs upon CDs upon CDs. So again, the cost of entry for the new standard was too high and piracy was the only realistic option for most people\n\nThe same would happen today if games started costing $200 per release, and that would be the game publishers\u2019 fault. People would crack the DRM, and they\u2019d get loads more people pirating it. Because of the cost, not because of how easily accessible the piracy is\n\nYou don\u2019t need DRM, you just need to make things reasonable to access legally",

The scenario you described probably wouldn't set off any flags for this hypothetical system nor would bans be automated.\n\nAlways-on DRM means that your license can be revoked, invalidated, and completely remove your ability to play the game you paid for. It also means that Valve or whoever else is utilizing it, may track your computer usage through things like when you launch games, how long you play them for, when you close them, and other behaviors that they can then use internally or sell to third parties. It also means that if DRM servers go down, so does your ability to play your games, unless you've already restarted steam in offline mode (assuming that offline mode is even an option assuming it's not steam). It depends on the company that is determining whether or not you're allowed to play the game you purchased to stay in business.\n\n> And people won't have a problem charging a fraction of what Valve does when Valve is the company shouldering all of the costs. They would not be \"competing against\" the gray market resellers, they are the grey market resellers.\n\nGrey market resellers obtain lists of legitimate keys through some other means that an individual can purchase and apply to their own steam account, which in turn grants them all the privileges of having a legitimate key and on the reseller's part requires virtually no work. The reseller who purchases a game on their account and grants access to individuals and then continually has to reset the password for a download of a game requires significantly more work.\n\n>  This would be a green light from Valve to every scummy third party reseller that they already hate because they're responsible for a huge amount of CC chargebacks.

Those processes inherently require an interaction with the seller.\n\n> But your only \"solution\" has required that Valve keep tracking these kinds of things and banning users in an attempt to fight the scammers that you are throwing a massive payday to.\n\nIs it a massive pay day?

Or use something like napster, kazaa, DC++, etc. to share it with others, or use direct connect on something like IRC to send the files over the internet.

Steam would have become what it is regardless of whether not other companies used things like limited downloads because the alternatives were rolling your own online distribution system or big box stores. Steam handled a lot more than DRM and while it probably persuaded some publishers to sign on, it wasn't the selling point. The captive user base and the infrastructure that Valve had developed was what made Steam compelling. Not having to build out your own store, updater, distribution system, online multiplayer, and then subsequently attract users to your platform, was what dissuaded companies from rolling their own solutions.\n\nThey forced anyone that wanted to continue playing popular games like counter-strike and day of defeat onto their platform and then forced anyone who wanted to play one of the most anticipated games of all time, Half Life 2, onto their platform.\n\nThey also apparently did a great job of convincing people that always-on DRM is fine as long as Valve is the one doing it. That it's fine that you can't open a game you ostensibly own if you don't have internet or if you didn't update the game to the newest version. \n\nSteam wasn't competing with other online stores or with DRM.

There were indeed far less ports of console titles but there wasn't a shortage of PC titles. And a lot of those games really benefited from being designed from the ground up for the PC. Entire genres of video games that are practically nonexistent on console because of the control scheme or back in the day, hardware constraints.\n\nNow that people want to target the lowest common denominator, your game basically has to map to a controller since consoles don't typically have keyboard/mouse support, which influences how the game itself is made. AAA gaming is a mess of mediocre, uninspired slop that gets regurgitated in some \"new\" form every year so people can get their fix of open world quest hubathon 37 or CoD 82.\n\nThat probably would have happened with or without steam, and I think that Steam genuinely did enable indie games to thrive in a way that would not have been possible in the 90's or early 2000's, but it's not delusional at all to say that games were *better* back then.

They are also obviously DRM but one of the issues with them is that they don't offer much to the users to make it worth it, that is part of the reason that people don't like them.\n\nEven way back at the beginning when Steam didn't have many of the features that make it amazing now, the ability to be able to keep all your games up to date was a nice feature for the time (I'm looking at you EGS, that feature alone was good FOR THE TIME). Before that we had to go to each game's site to get the update and depending on how they did things, these updates weren't very straight forward to install.",

Here's a more honest account: [https://venturebeat.com/business/monica-harrington-was-the-hidden-figure-of-valve-in-its-critical-early-years/](https://venturebeat.com/business/monica-harrington-was-the-hidden-figure-of-valve-in-its-critical-early-years/)\n\nIt inspired not the Steam DRM, but the cd-key used on the original release of Half-Life, years before Steam even launched. Obviously, the impact of CD burners and piracy were widespread by 2003, so the anecdote doesn't quite make sense in that context. But they were much more novel in the 90s:\n\n>In the final weeks of Half-Life\u2019s development, Mike was working furiously on some of the game\u2019s final code. For Mike and Monica, it was stressful and tense because they knew exactly what was at stake. The rest of the team had mostly finished their work. Finally, in November, the game went to duplication and they had a ship party where Mike broke open a pinata filled with candy to everyone\u2019s cheers. After that day, it was eerily quiet, almost like purgatory. In those days, it still took a while to get boxes out to retail and start getting feedback on how the game was actually selling.\n\n>At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue. Monica\u2019s nephew had just used a $500 check she had sent him for school expenses to buy a CD replicator, and being the nice guy he was, he sent a her a lovely thank you note saying how happy he was to be able to copy and share games with his friends.\n\n>\u201cI knew he wasn\u2019t a bad kid \u2013 he just saw the world differently \u2013 a generational change, combined with new technology put our entire business model at risk,\u201d Monica said.\n\n>Because of gamers like Monica\u2019s nephew, Valve implemented an authentication scheme where customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon, gamers were flooding the message boards saying that the game didn\u2019t work. It was enormously stressful. For a few days, Mike called everyone he could find who complained about the authentication \u2013 and NONE of them had actually bought the game. Which meant the authentication system was working extremely well. It felt like a near-death experience.\n\n>Then, in early December, as game industry reviews started coming in, the Wall St. Journal article appeared with the title \u201cValve\u2019s Storytelling Game is a Hit.\u201d",

But I thought it was so shitty that I didn't buy any valve game (last one I bought was opposing force) and I didn't start using steam until 2011 when Skyrim came out and I had to make an account to play it eventhough I had purchased a physical copy. I was still very pissed for years and I think it took me a year or 2 before I even bought any other game on steam.\n\nThose years in between, I sailed the seas.
