The 4060 is the #3 most used GPU in the most recent steam hardware survey. #1 & #2 are the 3060 and 4060 laptop version respectively.\n\nMeanwhile the first discrete AMD GPU doesn't show up on the list until #30 with the RX 6600. To put that into perspective, the 4090 has a higher userbase at #27.\n\nDon't let reddit's hard on for AMD fool you. When it comes to GPUs they're nowhere near competing, even at the low end, and haven't been for years now.",
