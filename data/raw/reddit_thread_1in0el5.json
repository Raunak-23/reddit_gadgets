[Great video on how older Nvidia cards load balanced here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb5YzMoVQyw), but TL;DR is previous generation Nvidia cards would load balance between the connectors (or between wires for 30 series 12vhpwr cards). Absolute worst case scenario would only put 150-200W through one wire before the card electrically couldn't turn on anymore, and those wires were arguably overspeced anyway.\n\n\n40 and 50 series don't load balance, at all, even the Asus cards. It isn't clear to me if Asus' monitoring actually shuts the card down when it sees major over current on one wire, or just warns you something's fucky. It certainly doesn't seem to have a way to actually fix the problem.",

Nvidia was just the first to use it. \n\nhttp://www.jongerow.com/12VHPWR/index.html\n\nIt\u2019s most likely if this was implemented by _literally_ any other manufacturer, it would end with the same issue. Though there are concerns about connector quality, I don\u2019t think [Nvidia would risk another class action lawsuit.](https://uk.pcmag.com/graphics-cards/143891/nvidia-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-melting-12vhpwr-cables)\n\nPCI-SIG is a consortium, companies who make products interfacing with ATX or PCIE have to pay for membership to be able to access the standards. As a result, it falls on the entirety of PCI-SIG that _they_ allowed this to be implemented into the specifications without proper and thorough testing.\n\nIt also falls on Nvidia and Dell for creating the spec and submitting it without testing thoroughly, but PCI-SIG is also responsible for not having checks and balances in place for this. \n\nEven if it is user error, the number of issues people have had with it means that it\u2019s clearly a problem. What\u2019s worse is PCI-SIG have tried to [wash their hands of the problem](https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/02/pcisig_melting_cables_nvidia/), despite being the ones that approved it in the first place.",

It's hard enough making the current system function within specs - doing it with an isolated converter would be absolutely bonkers and chew up a huge amount of board area with transformers.\n\nI say \"simple\" because a friend of mine actually designs these things for one of NV's suppliers.  They're absolutely hideously complicated to meet the absolutely insane specs in terms of current and tight voltage overshoot/undershoot when the current demand suddenly swings a few hundred amps in microseconds.\n\nThey'd be much better off building a better connector from scratch, or moving to a ground-referenced 24 or 48V DC rail for future high power use for both the CPU and GPU.  Now if you move to 48V that poses its own challenges, but they're probably better than anything unholy that involves isolated converters.",

After flipping it, the other end seated easily in the GPU but the old GPU end (now on the PSU) wasnt fitting without unreasonable force. We're talking a fraction of a millimeter off. It was 99% in place but missing that last little bit for the clip to settle in. The force required to finally lock it in was safe to push on the PSU but it was too much for the GPU. If I was doing it wrong it wouldn't have been that close to locking in place. The plug is overly engineered and a slight variance to the tolerances of the plug can make it a very sketchy situation.\n\n\nI've built my own and friends PCs for over 20 years and the plug is way worse than anything I've seen in that time.",

The individual pins are directly connected to a single metal rail at the back of the connector, which runs down into the board.  You can see it really clearly on the GN teardown vid: https://youtu.be/IyeoVe_8T3A?si=mkx1PKfR9r2qf-DS&t=1180\n\n> The fact that there IS current being measured on all the other wires means that the other wires aren't \"broken.\"\n\nI'm not saying the wires were broken - just expanding on the point that as the card is effectively just one +12v point and one GND point, if four of the wires were broken then there's nothing stopping the card from pulling the ~45a or so that the card would need to operate at 600w through the remaining two wires.  Your original assumption that the pins individually supplied discrete parts of the board wouldn't allow this, as you'd be limited by whatever component the individual pins were connected to.\n\n> So what is causing the uneven current distribution?\n\nThat's the million dollar question.  I've seen speculation that in the case of the cable that sparked this issue, it's potentially the connectors in the cable becoming slightly worn, which reduces contact at the pins, increasing resistance.  This also lines up with the der8auer video that was the source of the OP article, as he specifically notes that the cable being used has been plugged into/taken out of multiple cards before.  As the cable is effectively one big parallel resistor, increasing the resistance of any one connector also increases the resistance of the cable as a whole, but current will increase through the paths of least resistance to ensure compliance with Ohm's law.  \n\nAs a complete dumb example, if the pins in new condition have a resistance of 0.1ohm each, and you're drawing 42A to reach 504w on the connector, each cable will have 7A running through it.  If four of those cables wear and have a resistance of 1ohm each instead, you'd have 1.75A running through the four wires with higher resistance and 17.5A running through the two in-tact wires. \n\nI've no idea if that's what's happening here - and a big part of the problem is that you can't test the cable that caused the fault as there's...a bit of damage there.  Testing for this type of issue I imagine would be difficult, as there's no way to directly measure resistance along each wire while plugged in to both the PSU and GPU.",

Plug into GPU, measure GPU rail to pins at PSU connector end , then plug into PSU side and measure PSU rail to pins at GPU connector end.  The issue there is that you\u2019re having to plug in/remove the cable, and if that\u2019s causing wear, you\u2019ll be degrading the cable and altering the results with each test.",
