There were also enough sales on parts for non-graphics-card-things that made me willing to do it.  $1700 total for an otherwise monster of a machine with PCIe5.0, 6khz RAM, X3D processor and all the other good stuff that should keep me stable for a while.\n\nYes I'm on a 4070 Super which might last me only five years, but that's sufficient for everything that's been made the last six years because I more or less haven't played anything since then because I was using a 970 with my ten-year-old semi-unstable box.  I have like ten years of releases to play.  I'm very happy with that lol.\n\nIt does everything I want it to and should for at least a few years.  Good enough, I say.",
