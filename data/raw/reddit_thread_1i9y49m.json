(as well as rumored messaging via the Globalstar sat network)\n\n1. Apple does make a eSIM compatible model, and for few bucks you can have it connect to towers without your phone. This is useful when your phone is dead, or you just can't reach it. (people who go running use this). It generally costs somewhere between $6-$15 to get this service active.\n2. If you've fallen abd broken your leg in snow, you might not be able to reach our phone. The watch can relay through it.\n3. The apple watch has fall detection. That can be configured to call 911, or emergency contacts (My parents watches will auto SMS my sister and I for instance). After my mom fell in the shower and had to drag herself for 45 minutes with a broken leg to get to where my dad could hear her, we moved to this...\n\n\n\nWearables are fun... I watched my wife diagnose someone as septic based off of their Garmin watch data they sent her once (They were puking and had had fever, and the heart rate data, gave her the confidence to make the call to have them meet her at the ER, and get her on antibiotics).",

The pilot initially said could only take two of the people so I was relieved when all 3 made it out on. I am sure the rescue crew would have left the 3rd person with a crew member and/or supplies.
