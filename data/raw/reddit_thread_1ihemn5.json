I see this a lot once YTers have reached the level of Patreon sponsors, brand sponsor and \u201cfuck you\u201d levels of income from Google. They follow a very strict pattern of here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, here\u2019s who paid, here\u2019s what I did. Like comment subscribe. They go through the motions like any other job. They\u2019re making a product with ingredients and following a recipe, and it would appear that gets boring for some folk. Feeding the beast and being a slave to the algo is hard work. \n\nAll of that said, epic channel and epic builds!",
