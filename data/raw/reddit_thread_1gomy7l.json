At 119$ or so... which adds up to the already expensive pro model.\nI personally got it, because I was lucky getting a 30th anniversary.... but yeah financially doesn't makes sense.\n\nRegardless, regarding the internet thing, to install a disk drive you need to update/activate online I think so... at least for that you will need it, and also I am not so sure how well it works the console even with disks without connecting it to internet from time to time...\n\nAlso if the internet goes out, even digital can be played, up to certain point as it needs to revalidate the license at some point.",

But it's not that. It is a mid-generation refresh, and demand is going to be completely different for those. It's also probably a situation where they expect sales to be more spread out. These are not die-hard PS fans who don't already a PlayStation 5. These are either people who never got the PS5, or people who have ne, and are considering replacing it.",

They are not Sony who has 1000 other businesses and they don't have the same scale for moving hardware: to them, overproducing is an existential risk cuz  it is relatively really easy to increase and scale up production but once you've done it, manufacturing and supply contracts have been set for timescales for years and then it's insanely difficult to scale it back. The hundreds of thousands of units start to pile up and you have to start keeping them in warehouses with all the associated costs, losses due to pilferage and warehouse conditions, and have to get rid of the glut by either slashing prices (like the 3DS) or invest in/hope for demand picking up. They cannot absorb losses like this the same way Sony can.\n\nLots of people believe Nintendo does \"artificial scarcity\", they don't, they are just an extremely financially conservatively run Japanese business because that's what has allowed them to exist for so long in probably the single most brutal consumer tech environment in the last 40 years. Nintendo has walked through this exact boneyard and remembers the skeletons of fallen giants like Atari, SEGA, THQ... All gone from the console hardware arena or entirely, literally because they produced too much hardware they couldn't sell.\n\nThey fundamentally will never risk this same kind of thing happening again because they would rather have unmet demand to leave some money on the table, generate some hype and maybe piss a few people off... vs risking losing it all big time.",

I now live in a big city and have ways to get notifications the moment these things drop BUT again, if you're that parent in small town USA (or wherever) who is trying to buy that big present of a PS5 Pro for the fam....why can't a scalper step in to assist if they can't find it on their normal online retailers or in stores???",
