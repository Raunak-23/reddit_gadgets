I\u2019ve cracked a screen or two but it was my fault, the battery life eventually fades as does on every rechargeable device.  And I know I know you think Samsung is way better but it took like 6 iPhones before Samsung even started catching up and they piggybacked on iPhone technology before they could stand on their own two feet.  \n\nThe iPod and ITunes was a world changer for music when it came out and my original 80 gig iPod will still turn on if I plug it in and charge it and that battery still lasts hours.  And no company released a more reliable mp3 player.\n\nMacBooks last for-ev-er.   I still have a MacBook with flash memory that\u2019s 12 years old that I downloaded thousands of gigs of data through and it lasted 9 years of everyday use and that still turns on and works if I plug it in and charge it.  It\u2019s slow now but it took about 4 years before it really started slowing down.  And that was just one of the lowest end MacBooks, the Pros are on another planet better.  MacBooks get less malware, less viruses, than windows computers and it\u2019s far easier to get that shit off.  They stay faster longer.  The 16 inch screen is the only thing about a MacBook Pro that I\u2019ve ever found to be too fragile.  You can find another company that puts out a couple of good maybe comparable models for laptops but the consistency in the quality of their laptops is really hard to compare.  \n\nAnd that\u2019s just 3 products.  \n\nApple is one of the most successful companies in the whole world and they have been innovating for decades, pioneering and leading markets.  \n\nThe only Apple product that was ever consistently shitty over a long time was their charging cables and charging cables are going to break the way we abuse them.  If you wanna call them junk I\u2019ll support that.  \n\n\nIs Apple expensive? Sure and annoyingly so at times, but they are certainly are top tier products and there is quality in that premium.  \n\nPeople hate Apple because (1) they want something to hate (2) they were told to (3) they had A bad experience but I\u2019ve found that people\u2019s idea of a bad experience is often embroiled in a lack of honesty first and foremost with themselves.  \n\nYour screen cracked because you dropped it or sat on it.  Blame Apple.  You bought the cheapest, shittiest aftermarket charging cable, made no effort to follow the industry wide instructions for battery life and now months or years later, it doesn\u2019t hold a charge.  Blame Apple.  You bought a 128 gb phone filled it with 125 gb data and have 50 apps and 200 tabs open on your browser and now it\u2019s apple\u2019s fault your phone is slow and the battery is dying every few hours.  \n\nIm not going to downvote you im just going to point out the litany of ways your \u2018junk\u2019 designation is not based on any rational basis in reality.",
