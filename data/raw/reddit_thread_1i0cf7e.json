Being able to safely assess how much cooling it has and adjust the limit safely becomes too risky for ranges that are outside normal operation. Essentially why risk letting the CPU ever go that high if it malfunctions if almost nobody will do this.\n\n2.) Even if it has that much cooling, it's not clear what it's lifespan is in this configuration, so possibly it falls outside of the safe operating specs regardless of cooling.",

Though perhaps not as quickly as they did in the pentium days. Blame physics for that: we're hitting physical limitations. Though even if frequency doesn't go up much, IPC (instructions per cycle), number of cores/threads, and efficiency are still going up pretty quickly.\n\nMax boost frequencies for some recent Intel cpu generations:\n\n - 7th gen: 4.5 GHz\n - 8th gen: 4.7 GHz\n - 9th gen: 5.0 GHz\n - 10th gen: 5.3 GHz\n - 11th gen: 5.2 GHz\n - 12th gen: 5.3 GHz\n - 13th gen: 6.0 GHz\n - 14th gen: 6.2 GHz\n\nThough the latest '200 series' CPUs are a step down in max frequencies again, with the 285k having a max boost frequency of 5.7 GHz.\n\nOver on the red team, the latest CPUs also have a max boost clock of 5.7 GHz. That's up from 4.1 GHz for Zen 1, which was released around the same time as Intel 7th Gen.",

          "body": "One limiting factor is related to Dennard Scaling. Sort of simple explanation: for a long time as we shrunk transistors, the power density of the chip stayed the same. This basically means you crammed a bunch more transistors from one generation to the next, but the chips used the same amount of power (and generated the same amount of heat). \n\nPower density stayed the same because many circuit parameters related to the smaller transistor would go down (like capacitance, voltage), which in turn allowed frequency increase, holding power constant. (Higher capacitance, voltage, and frequency all increase power).\n\nBut eventually, when the transistors got \"small enough\" around 10-20ish years ago, other transistor factors that used to not affect things mattered a lot more at these now very small sizes. These smaller transistors experience proportionally more leakage current and, the threshold voltage can't continue to decrease by as much. More power/heat generated in the same area means much harder to increase frequency (which would further increase power/heat). \n\nThis isn't the only reason, but an important one that has made much higher frequencies quite difficult.",

          "body": "There's a couple of things going on:\n\nFirst of all, we could run chips at a higher frequency, but this would dramatically increase chip power draw. It scales roughly like this:\n\nP = C * f * V^2\n\nWhere C is the total capacitance being switched (scales roughly with the amount of gates), f is the frequency, and V the voltage the chip is running on. To run at a higher frequency, the voltage will need to be increased. This increase is roughly linear, so we can also state:\n\nP = C * f^3\n\nMeanwhile, the actual amount of work the processor can do scales only linearly with the frequency it is running on. Which leads to the conclusion that the efficiency (amount of work done divided by power draw) scales with 1/f^2 !\n\nTherefore, power efficiency plummets if we just keep driving up the voltage. This results in chips that cannot reasonably be cooled, or would damage themselves over time.\n\nIn the past, we managed to avoid this bottleneck by minimizing the C term in the equation. By shrinking transistors smaller and smaller, and putting them closer and closer together, we were able to minimize the total capacitance that needed to be switched. This allowed us to run up the frequency while keeping the voltage needed mostly constant.\n\nUnfortunately, as you go smaller and smaller, other effects start to dominate. Eventually, parasitic capacitances and wire self-inductance become a problem and you cannot shrink any further. This is the barrier that stopped the increases in frequency. While modern lithography is getting more and more accurate, we cannot shrink transistors much further in physical size. The meagre gains since then have been because we've been switching to altering their geometry, which allows them to work with less of a voltage difference.",
