VRR can persist with a DisplayPort to HDMI conversion, IIRC the PS5 uses an internal DisplayPort to HDMI converter chip that takes the DisplayPort signal from the GPU and connects it to the HDMI out, and the PS5 supports VRR.",

                  "body": "I don't think the PS5 implementation can be compared to the use of a modified DP Alt mode that Nintendo uses. Regular DisplayPort connections are capable of running full HDMI signals over their pinouts, so long as the controller can create the correct signals. This is how DP++ works, which runs a native HDMI signal over a DisplayPort connector/cable to an HDMI device. Now, I don't know much about the PS5's implementation, and I'm having trouble finding a good source to learn about it, but I imagine this is how the PS5 is implementing HDMI despite the initial gpu output of DisplayPort. The final converter chip would be the implementation point for HDMI VRR, and can communicate accordingly with the GPU directly.\n\nDisplayPort Alt (or a similiar implementation of it), sorta messes with things. It's an actual DisplayPort signal that's being passed and can't operate in a DP++ mode, so it has to be converted. For regular video, that's not difficult as it's mostly how the signals are wrapped for transport so it can be done in real-time. \n\nFor VRR, HDMI and DisplayPort use different standards that aren't just rewraps of something standard, so it would need to be converted, or man-in-the-middle'd. While I think it's possible to convert the VRR calls between the two formats, I'm not sure if the additional latency would make it that functional. Think of it like an emulation layer for VRR API calls. The other method I can think of would involve a device in the middle acting as both a receiver for the DisplayPort VRR spec, and acting as a host for an HDMI spec. I also don't like it because now the middle device needs to have multiple video buffers so it can receive and output on each buffer, which is a lot more complex.",

But usually more. Ping just means how quick a single \"Ping test\" package can be transmitted. But when you're streaming a game you have to make an input which then gets encoded, sent to the server, that server passes that input to the game, the game has to render the next frame (which, at 60fps means it takes 16.6ms), then ENCODE the frame which takes about another 10-20ms, send it to you, which takes longer die to the large file compared to a single ping-test-packet, and then your PC still has to de-encode it and display it which adds another 10-20ms.\n\nSo overall, if you're Streaming with 30ms ping your actual input-latency is somewhere around 70-90ms\n\nAnd now adding framegen to it, which not only means the \"local\" input latency will be doubled (so from 16ms per frame to 32ms per frame) it also doubles the amount of data that's encoded, sent and decoded. So your actual latency will be almost doubled, which is not that bad for local play (there you go from \\~20ms to \\~40ms if you started at 60fps) but for game streaming you'll go from \\~80ms to \\~160ms. \n\nSo yeah, no wonder frame gen feels terrible on game streaming. Try it out locally. It still ads some latency that can be felt, but it's absolutely not unplayable, especially for non-competetive games",

It doesn't know or care if the gpu has had time to finish drawing that frame yet. It will just display whatever the gpu has ready every time that timer fires. With vrr rather than have a clock on the screen it waits for the gpu to say a new frame is ready and only then copies it over to display it.\n\nETA: The main alternate solution before VRR was to simply have an extra buffer on the GPU so it could hold 2 or more frames at once. If a new frame wasn't ready when the screen asked it would simply show the entire previous frame.",

                  "body": "So a game effectively generates a series of pictures very rapidly for a monitor to display. This framerate, or FPS, is not always constant however (sometimes framerate lowers because things are hard for the computer to generate).\n\nA monitor, by default, tries to display a picture at a set rate. There is effectively no computing, so this can just be set to a given number, say 60 pictures a second, or 60Hz. That's a monitor's refresh rate.\n\nScreen tearing happens when the framerate of your game and the refresh rate of your monitor aren't in sync, this causes the monitor to sometimes have to display the information of multiple frames in 1 frame, and that creates \"tears\", with old and new frames trying to display at the same time (this creates the horizontal line breaks you notice mostly while stuff is moving on screen). Think of a picture taking longer to send while the monitor is already expecting the next picture, that creates such an issue.\n\nVariable refresh rate ensures that the monitor refreshes (i.e. displays a frame) at the same time the game does. The monitor will now wait for the next picture before it tries to update the display, rather than always trying to brute force the next picture. \n\nIf they're in sync, the situation where multiple frames might try to display at once cannot occur, as any changes in the amount of frames per second made by the game will be reflected by the monitor adjusting when it displays the next picture to be the same.\n\nI'll admit it's a thing that's much easier to understand with a nice visual representation, but that's tricky on reddit at times, so if it's not clear I'd recommend looking up some videos on youtube on how variable refresh rate works and how it helps with screen tearing.",

Yeah, that's a thing, it's gotten much better over time, I'm not entirely sure how that relates to refresh rate itself, but the issue is minimized on most modern monitors. That said, I know less about VRR flickering, just that it's an issue, and that I'm glad that my monitor doesn't have it.\n\nIt's a very specific issue, and I, and seemingly a lot of other folks, weren't sure what you were talking about in your initial comment, lacked some details.

          "body": "people have only been giving you a partial explanation\n\nback when we used Cathode Ray Tube-based TVs, they didn't have complex computers driving them, but simple electronics that used the frequency of the power grid itself as the clock signal (clock signals are the heartbeat of any electronic, driving when actions take place). This meant in North America/Japan they were limited to 60 HZ, and 50 HZ in Europe. When we switched to more complex electronics in the displays, we could separate the clock signal from the power grid. So that we could run at frame rates that were not a multiple of 60 or 50.\n\nGames send their frames out in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nV(ertical) synced, in that they are synchronized with the vertical blanking interval, which happens at the end of a HZ/clock cycle. This means 1 frame is sent out for each HZ   \n\nNon-synced, which means if a frame isn't done rendering the time it has (1/60 or 1/50 of a second), it's sent out anyway, resulting in an image that is half the new frame, half the previous frame, looking like an ugly puzzle. Some weirdos chose this willingly, cause of the faster response time\n\nNow VRR has the advantage of both modes. No jarring puzzle effect, faster response time. A frame is sent to the TV when it's done, and the TV doesn't care about how many frames per second there are.",

The console itself, you won't see any HDMI port on it. You'll find a USB-C port. The switch uses \"Realtek RTD2175N-CG DisplayPort v1.4 to HDMI 2.1 protocol converter\" according to the rumors. This makes it tricky. But it is something a patch may be able to fix. \n\nI expect that we will see many many hardware patch over the switch 2's lifespan.
