      "body": "From the article: The top consumer model is powered by the Core Ultra 7 255H CPU, while the flagship enterprise model ships with the Core Ultra 7 265H. The processors used in the more affordable versions include the Core Ultra 5 235H, Core Ultra 225H, Core 7 240H, Core 5 210H, and Core 3 100U.\n\nThe new models do not include discrete graphics, but the Core Ultra variants feature an Intel Arc 140T iGPU, which should offer enough power for casual gaming. However, the Core 3, Core 5, and Core 7 variants only ship with integrated Intel Graphics. The Core Ultra models also receives up to 96 GB of DDR5-6400 memory, while the rest come with DDR5-5600 memory.\n\n\n\nFor storage, the NUC 15 Pro PCs include an M.2 2280 PCIe Gen4x4 slot with support for up to 2TB NVMe SSDs and an M.2 2242 PCIe Gen4x4 slot, supporting up to an additional 2TB SSD for a total of up to 4TB. The slots are also compatible with PCIe Gen 5 drives for easy upgrades.\n\nThe mini PCs offer fast wireless connectivity, featuring support for Wi-Fi 7 BE201 and Bluetooth 5.4 in the Core Ultra models. The Core 3, 5, and 7 variants support only up to Wi-Fi 7 BE202. According to Intel, the BE201 Wi-Fi chip supports the 320MHz channel width to deliver up to 5.8 Gbps, whereas the older BE202 chip only supports 160MHz and up to 2.4 Gbps.\n\nWired connectivity options include dual HDMI 2.1, dual Thunderbolt 4, triple USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB Type-A 2.0, one USB-C 3.2 Gen2x2, and a 2.5G Ethernet port. There's also a Kensington lock on the side for increased security.",
