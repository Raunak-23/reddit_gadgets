They ended up making good GPUs on 7nm with RDNA2, but by then it was too late to compete against Turing.  \nSomething was also very clearly wrong with RDNA3, the 7800XT only matches the 6800XT despite having higher clocks and being made on a superior process, and the 7900XTX fell short of their initial performance claims.

But this isn't what usually happens, the 4k video is much larger and thus much higher quality.\n\nThe amount of pixels is very rarely the limiting factor for the visual quality of content on screens. But advertisements (and technical choices to push those, e.g. youtube seems to use better codecs for 4k content) have misled people into associating things with higher resolution, which actually aren't causally related to it.",
