      "body": "From the article: In a workshop filled with the whir of machines and the scent of fresh plastic, two makers have found a new use for an old piece of exercise equipment. Ivan Miranda and J\u00f3n Schone, both well-known in the DIY 3D printing community, have transformed a discarded treadmill into a massive belt-driven 3D printer. Their project pushes the boundaries of what's possible with home fabrication.\n\nThe idea began with a simple question: could the moving belt of a treadmill be adapted to serve as the conveyor in a 3D printer, allowing for prints of virtually unlimited length? For Miranda and Schone, the answer was yes, but getting there took a blend of ingenuity, technical skill, and a willingness to experiment with unconventional materials.\n\nTheir process started with stripping the treadmill down to its essentials. They kept the sturdy frame and the continuous rubber belt, which would become the heart of their new machine.\n\nThe team then mounted linear rails directly onto the treadmill's frame and constructed a custom gantry system to support the print head. To handle the demands of large-scale printing, they developed an extra-large extruder and integrated stepper motors to drive precise movement. Custom wiring and modules tied the system together, ensuring that the belt and print head worked in perfect sync.\n\nThe technical challenges were significant. Calibrating the belt's speed to match the printer's output was crucial for producing clean, accurate prints. Adhesion also proved tricky \u2013 they needed the plastic to stick firmly to the moving belt during printing but release easily once finished. Through trial and error, Miranda and Schone refined their approach, sharing both breakthroughs and setbacks with their online audience.\n\n[Video](https://youtu.be/0rWxUpknTG0)",

It makes no sense... Considering how much they had to change ( ***INCLUDING*** the Frame! ) you're better of making your own from Scratch using off the shelf Components \ud83d\ude11\n\nThe best part about this stunt was Ivan taking a break from his Marble Clock which ***IMHO\u2122*** has really just turned into another never ending Wintergatan thing - It's just just not funny anymore watching content about it... I'd rather have him do cool stuff actually worth pursuing like I don't know... a mostly 3D Printed CNC Lathe akin to his 3-Axis CNC? \ud83d\ude0f",
