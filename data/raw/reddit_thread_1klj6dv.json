In reality, most of the people pirating things would never actually pay money for most of those things anyways. So the company isn't losing anything. If I am incapable of pirating a specific movie, lets say Cowboys & Aliens, my other option is to pay money for it. I would just rather go my entire life never watching it. The same is true for many types of media, and I'm sure is also true for many other people. I'm not going to be buying a Switch 2. The prices are too high to provide value to me when there are plenty other options. If there happens to be an easy way to pirate the games and emulate them, I might actually play them. Otherwise, I will happily go about my life never playing them.",

Because it was $250 on eBay from people's old collection. It was just not possible to buy from Nintendo.\n\nThey then later actually released it, but honestly man... they deserved that piracy.\n\nAnd Nintendo does this all the time.",

The last one I pirated was Tears of the Kingdom which was fairly recent. However, if I was incapable of pirating it, I just wouldn't have ever played the game because I wasn't going to shell out $70 for it. Before that, I'm pretty sure the last game I pirated was Fallout 4 right around it's original release 10 years ago. I wanted to see if I'd like the game, at the time I didn't have a lot of money. And surprise surprise, I own the game now as I bought it on Steam a few years ago.",

I'm a PC gamer. I don't have to be \"invested\" in order to do that... it's pretty easy and cheap. I also don't have to have some huge philosophical will to do it... just a vague sense from hundreds of headlines and experiences similar to OP that the PC is more flexible, affordable, etc. than the alternatives. It's really not something I have to think about or try hard to stick to. But by doing so and by a bunch of other people doing so, that ensures that PC gaming is still growing and supported.\n\nIf I buy a two games from AAA Studio X that sound great but they're both stupidly buggy and then I see headlines now and then about Studio X releasing super buggy games, I'm probably not going to believe the hype of Studio X's next game. It's not something I'm \"invested\" in. It's not something I'm trying and sacrificing hard to impact. It's not something that I'm doing specifically to try to change Studio X (I don't care either way about Studio X, just about my own experience). It's just basic common sense. But as I and others do that, that creates a market for Studio Y to make a competing game. Maybe Studio Y is AAA too or maybe it's indie but I get a game that isn't super buggy and now Studio Y is more likely to have the resources to come out with another game. It also doesn't really matter if this is only reason people support Studio Y or is it's just 10% of its customers thinking this (i.e. a 10% bump in revenue). In fact, it's a GOOD thing is this isn't the only reason people support Studio Y because presumably Studio Y's game should also be good and because we wouldn't want Studio Y to fail as soon as Studio X releases one game that doesn't suck. So, long story short, it's a pretty low effort, low cost, automatic thing and it doesn't have to mean work, investment, sacrifice, etc. and even if the vast majority do not do it, it can still impact the market.\n\nAs another example, local farmers markets are common. It's not because \"the overwhelming majority\" refuses to shop at major grocery stores. It's not because the people who attend are \"heavily invested\" in specifically and only seeking out local goods. It's because enough people sometimes go there that it's commercially viable to have local farmers markets. The fact that the \"overwhelming majority\" doesn't go to the farmers market (especially for their every shopping trip) doesn't really matter. What matters is that enough go enough of the time that now those farmers markets are an option for everybody.",

And as you say, they arguably do already exist because people do this. This is because many people (I'd argue, the vast majority of people) are gaming to fulfill a need (relax, have fun, feel emotional, socialize, etc.) that can be fulfilled by many different games and do not require an exact specific IP to do so. It's only a small minority of megafans that are more concerned with following specific IP than with simply finding things like fun, relaxation, socialization, etc. where many many competing games and platforms exist.",

There will always be a way around whatever control measures a console maker puts in place. Eventually, the pirates always win. All the R&D and control measures you spend to put in place, will eventually be beaten by the pirates. Valve figured this out, and it's why they're so wildly successful.\n\nWhen Valve entered the Russian market, they were told it would be an absolute failure. That Russians would pirate everything. That prediction was proven wrong as Russia became one of Valves largest markets, it was their #2 continental European market behind Germany. Though recent sanctions and such may have impacted this. But that's not on Valve.\n\n> In general, we think there is a fundamental misconception about piracy, piracy is almost always a service problem and not a pricing problem. If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country three months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate\u2019s service is more valuable.   \nMost DRM solutions diminish the value of the product by either directly restricting a customer\u2019s use or by creating uncertainty. Our goal is to create greater service value than pirates, and this has been successful enough for us that piracy is basically a non-issue for our company.\n\n\u2014Gabe Newell",

A lot of \"competing\" brands are owned by the same mega corporations. Unilever, Proctor & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Anheuser-Busch InBev, Nestle, etc. The market, for like the last 80 years, has been an illusion of choice.\n\nI think you're confused about the point here... The point isn't to avoid corporations or punish the perpetrator of something you don't like, it's to create a market for the kinds of products you want to exist. If a megacorporation makes another product line that's like what you want, you still won. Additionally, if 90% of stores only carry anti-consumer products, but 10% of stores carry alternatives, you still won. The market share doesn't matter, it's just when you have the ability to buy what you want. It's about the utility of creating the market for what you want, not the emotional pettiness of destroying the market for what you don't want.\n\nHowever, if we're \"being real\" here then why are you changing the topic to Unilever rather than acknowledging that in the context of the conversation you're in there is actually plenty of choice? Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Valve, Google, Apple, etc. are not the same megacorporation. If people don't like Nintendo's level of control in OP, they can look to the other consoles. If people don't like the general level of control on consoles, they can look to PCs. If they don't like the general level of control on Windows PCs, they can look to Linux. If people don't like the level of control via Steam on Linux, they can use GoG and Wine. There is plenty of choice here from independent sources and Nintendo is far on one end of the spectrum. The reason all of these platforms exist is because people vote with their wallet and there are enough people supporting each platform to make it viable. Not only CAN market competition work, but gaming is a great example of it working. Consumers have so much choice.\n\nAlso, market competition isn't just a story of the big and dominant players. The mere existence of an alternative can force a dominant platform to cap the amount of pain they'll put users through so it's smaller than the amount of pain that switching platforms can be. I say this mainly in reference to Windows/Linux. If Linux gaming wasn't viable, Windows would basically be able to force users to do anything. Since Linux gaming is great, Windows now has to limit their anti-consumer choices to a level small enough that people won't put the effort in to switch. So, even if the amount of Linux gamers is small, they are still contributing to the healthy competition that makes Windows more responsive as well. That's healthy competition. It's not where everybody can only do what you like.\n\nFWIW, I'm coming at this as a person who was a PC gamer and then realized that basically all of my huge library of games works on Linux without effort, so I've now been a Linux PC gamer. It's not some principled stance, it just has worked pretty seamlessly and let me maintain control and save money. So, from that perspective, it's just really funny to me when somebody suggests that it's impossible to overcome what Nintendo or consoles are doing or like it's some lonely, challenging path to avoid them. It's easy to be a gamer and maintain control of your device and it's often cheaper too.",

I was saying that it's an unnecessarily high bar to assume that everybody, even the minority of people so obsessed with a particular brand that they'll buy it no matter what, must change their behavior for alternatives to exist. Alternatives exist when enough people choose an alternative that the producer of the alternative can sustain themselves. That can even happen when it's a minority market, but certain when it's not the entire market. Most people are not so wedded to brands that they'll buy them no matter what, so it's easy for alternatives to Nintendo to exist which is why they do.\n\n> Lol I would love to go back to that delusional kind of thinking.\n\nThe naive delusion is thinking that you should measure \"winning\" not by whether you get what you want, but instead by whether you can override everybody else (corporations you don't like, consumers who want things you don't like, etc.) from getting what they want. What I described is a practical approach that is about tangible effects and achievable goals, rather than naive idealism and inventing reasons to be upset.\n\n> Yeah duh, that's why I said that Nintendo was unique.\n\nOkay, so your comment was unrelated to the discussion then?\n\nSince I was reading your comment in good faith, I assumed the fact that 2/3 of it was ranting about how there is no true competition in the past 80 years was because you thought that applied to the current discussion.

Want to remove all software and run a custom OS with game launchers and emulation? Go for it!    \nNintendo do have a massive monopoly in their sector of the market but their gatekeeping and walled garden (don't even mention removing access to older games) is going to shoot them in the foot.",

You need to get permission to distribute and when you get permission, if they give you permission they take a cut of the sales.\n\nBuying a DVD has the content saved on the disc locally, it was authorized by the company, That's why they put it through production and on store shelves. You own your own personal copy and it cannot be taken away from you like a digital copy because it's stored locally on a disc. They'd have to go into people's houses and physically take it out of their house. If the web went down you'd still be able to watch the movie because it's stored on the DVD disc.",

Zediva was purchasing DVDs, intending that simply purchasing the DVD gave them unlimited rights to the IP on it, as you are currently arguing. They were wrong, as are you. Owning a DVD does not change the fact that you license the IP on it and are subject to the terms and conditions of the license. Zediva is one of the firms who got sued for violating the license of that ip",

Do you not watch the beginning of a DVD? It has FBI warnings about $250,000 fines for reproduction or redistribution of their property. \n\nI'm saying people have the right to own a physical copy to use for themselves and their circles of family and friends. Not to make a profit off the back of the rights owners by making a business out of it like you introduced in this thread. Their screw up is not getting the rights to distribute it on their platform. They made a business out of it and that's why there was a lawsuit because they were cutting into Warner Bros profits. DVD productions that are sent to stores got the rights to distribute so and it's usually the company that owns the rights that made the production through their network.\n\nYou're wrong by misinterpreting what I am saying here and you introduced these other subjects regarding  Zediva when my first comment is that is why you buy physical media. They can't take that from your personal collection because it's stored locally . It is a  dense assumption you made. Never Assume because it makes an ASS out of U and ME.",

And I really doubt that this \"dynamic pricing\" will have smaller games at $40-50 price point. Nintendo makes decisions that are shockingly anti-consumer sometimes. At the same time, video games have probably been the single most inflation resistant thing I've bought from the mid 90s until today. Maybe enough people refuse to buy Mario Kart and prices come down, but I really doubt that.",

Hell, I still occasionally pirate audiobooks today to try them out first. If I like the first 20 minutes of it, I\u2019ll go ahead and purchase it on Audible. But that\u2019s because there\u2019s rarely any trailer/gameplay/demo of audiobooks available to watch on YouTube like there are for movies/tv shows/video games.\n\nBut as a high schooler? I bought exactly zero media that I\u2019d previously pirated. I stole that shit and no argument about \u201coh, well I couldn\u2019t afford it so it\u2019s not really a lost sale anyway\u201d changes that. I stole that shit blatantly and I\u2019d wager 90%+ of piracy today is just straight up theft too. Any argument to the notion that piracy is theft is always so full of loopholes you can pretty much ignore it.\n\nI hate Nintendo for other reasons, not least of which because I don\u2019t find their games fun, but I\u2019m still going to buy a family system so that I can play MK/Smash with my girlfriend and siblings. This threat of bricking hacked systems using pirated games means nothing to me.\n\nEdit: Judging by the downvotes and replies, everyone else is a noble warrior downloading the latest Assassin\u2019s Creed in order to strike back against the evil of capitalism. I am just an evil pirate vs the rest of you. Thank you for this important lesson.",

When you pirate, you don't cause a game copy to go missing, you create a new copy for your own use. It is still morally wrong, but several steps less wrong than going to the physical store and stealing game CDs (where not only the devs don't get money, store owners lose money directly)",

Most people aren\u2019t pirating removed shows of South Park, they\u2019re pirating new HBO shows and fresh single player RPGs.\n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t blame pirates at all. Some people that are pirating are kids or come from countries that have too low salaries to ever be able to afford first world media. But I also just can\u2019t bring myself to blame companies for going out of their way to prevent piracy. I imagine many companies wouldn\u2019t care at all if they could 100% guarantee that the only people pirating are people that 100% never would have bought the media in the first place. But we all know that just isn\u2019t true. Some people will do exactly as much as they can get away with.",

You need the private key to modify the bootloader or to run unsigned code after the fact. Removing and replacing the bootloader does not require any key at all, you're replacing the key in the act of doing so",

Also Sony/Microsoft aren\u2019t bricking your console, they just ban it from accessing their services. The device itself would still function in single player games that you have a physical copy of, either downloaded already or on a disk. The problem is that you lose access to your account\u2019s digital library and can\u2019t download anything anymore. \n\nGames have quickly shifted from being sold on a physical medium to digital licenses and the law hasn\u2019t caught up yet. Personally I think they should be required to clearly display that it is a license when you\u2019re buying a game. There should also be a minimum grace period of maybe about a year where you can still download games. Something also needs to be done about so many games requiring an always online connection when they don\u2019t need one.",

If they attempted and damaged actual hardware, they would be asking for a major lawsuit and they know it.  You can disable them from accessing your servers but, you cannot damage hardware that someone paid for.  \n\nThis is like Toyota disabling your car because you put a turbo charger in it or Asus causing (them doing it, not by your own screw up) your computer not booting because you changed a video card. \n\nCould they?  Maybe? Legally, they cannot do that, and the law does not care about their \"terms of service\".\n\nI guess, like Switch hackers did, when you hack your system, the first thing you do is block Nintendo's services.  Crap, I've had a modded Switch for years, and reverted it like last year, and could play with my kids on it, online.",

It's not much of a thing now but people used to install aftermarket stereos, speakers, etc etc etc.  There are still a lot of people installing fart cannons for exhausts... the whole tuner culture thing in general.  There was a time when a lot of people fixed and tinkered with their cars themselves.  It was kind of expected.  Cars run into issues all the time and need servicing all the time.  If they made you go to a dealership every single time, people would be pissed.  This is a little weirder now because so much fucking software is in cars.  You can make the argument that it would be a big no-no to try and fuck with the software in a vehicle, or go the other way and say that it's your car and so you should be able to do whatever you want with it.\n\nConsoles... I mean, what can you really say about them?  Nobody's opening up a Switch and modifying the console for anything other than piracy.  It's not like a PC where you go in there to upgrade the specs and shit.  Consoles never really worked that way.  *Maaaybe* for repairs from a third party company, but is that a thing for modern consoles like it would be for consoles of yesteryear, or do people just send their consoles in to the company?  Most people never have an issue with their console.  That's not to say that nobody does, but most people either never get their console serviced, or if they're unlucky, they have to send their console to the manufacturer maybe once.\n\nI just don't see this as much of an issue from a realistic point of view.  Yes, the fact that it's there and they can do that in and of itself is shit, but who is it affecting in actual practice?  I guess we'll find out if they mistakenly brick somebody's console, but am I supposed to feel bad that somebody that wants to emulate or run homebrew or whatever on a current console could get their console bricked?  Depending on the console, you were already running the risk of bricking your console if you did things wrong... I think the Wii was like that and so was the 3DS, which my 3DS bricked completely out of the blue for no reason after more than a year of working just fine.\n\nI doubt they will relax on this in the future, but because that line is in a different place for everybody... for me, if it's not a current system that is still being supported, then I'm personally not okay with the idea of remote bricking.  If it **is** a current console that they are still supporting, I'm fine with that being treated as \"sacred\" in the sense that you shouldn't be trying to hack or homebrew that, emulate that system's games, etc.",

The law has been pretty fair to consumers in the US in this respect, the courts usually side with gamers, but you need a competent lawyer to bring the case to court for that to happen, which is a daunting task. Few lawyers want the smoke Nintendo brings, it's often a very intense, very drawn-out proceeding that can take multiple years to finally get a ruling on, and most lawyers don't want to work that kind of case. Most want something quick and easy, even if it's a sure-thing. Think of injury/disability lawyers, it's basically free money because they get to pick which cases they represent and only take the ones they know they can win, but few places specialize in injury/disability law. Why? It's extremely lucrative? Because their potential payday is at minimum 6mo away. \n\nSame deal with suits against a giant like Nintendo; they'll use their infinite pool of resources to keep delaying the proceedings, asking for continuances, wasting the courts time with barely relevant ramblings going through precedent, for as long as they can. You sue Nintendo in January, you get paid in May two years later. Meanwhile, that's gotta be one of your only cases, if not the only one. The amount of work its gonna take means all other cases get either ignored or put on the back burner, so that's 2.5 years of intense work, all while not getting paid beyond retainer; that's a hard sell :/",

I don\u2019t have an issue if they black listed the device from there online services, since clearly that is not owned by you but having someone else able to brick a device remotely that really they have no business doing seems like a good reason to put a law around it.

I think Nintendo is trying to make the argument that consumers are licensing out the software and ecosystem of the Switch, but in that case, then why even make the hardware? Why not just make it a software ecosystem that I can download on the PC or on Mac, or on a Steam deck, or whatever....it just feels like they want to have it both ways. \n\nNintendo doesn't make this software available to any other platform that is more than equipped to run it EVEN BETTER than their own proprietary hardware (whose internals are not proprietary in any way) i think the argument that customers don't own the hardware or the software that is on the hardware is a really hard one to make. If you're selling right-of-use of your software to me, then I should be able to use it freely on any platform of my liking because software is made on a computer, not on a Nintendo switch device. If Nintendo is not able to facilitate this universal feature of any licensed software, then when I purchase a Nintendo Switch device, I'm purchasing the hardware and therefore OWN the hardware, as well as purchasing (for ownership) the software that comes installed on the hardware because both the software and the hardware are integrated for reasonable use and functioning of the product. \n\nThese kinds of terms should not be allowed in any end-user agreement at all. End-user agreements are not legally binding anyway, because in order for a contract to be legally binding, you can't sell me the item first, and then later ask me to sign the agreement to own the item. Contracts for ownership are signed before the item is purchased and lawyers or legal witnesses have to be present to make them legally binding. This isn't' just an issue with Nintendo, this has been a problem with End-User agreements in this industry for decades",

But threatening the nuclear option against people who paid money for your product is a really bad look.\n\nMy BIG concern with it is (and I should hope they have mechanisms in place that will prevent this) that they will accidentally flag consoles that are not modded whatsoever. I'd hate to have to go through that process to get my console/account restored if it was wrongly flagged as being modded.",
