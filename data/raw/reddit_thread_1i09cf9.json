      "body": "I'm running out of phone brands to recommend. I was full steam ahead on the OnePlus Bus until I traded in my 13 with a cracked screen which I found out was literally unrepairable because you can't get parts anywhere and they tried to charge me extra saying it \"did not power on\" even though it did. When I contacted them to sort it out they just told me I should have taken pictures of it turning on when I boxed it up to send it in so it was my fault they were charging me.\u00a0\n\n\nFuck OnePlus. I've been an OP fan since my OP6 several years back, but I can't stand for a company that does that to their customers. Good phones but not worth it considering they're filled with Chinese spyware, and have shit customer service",

I wanted specifically a phone that wasn't contacting Google 50+ times daily/Apple servers once a minute to dump my info.\u00a0\n\n\nI read that a lot of people are buying Pixel phones and putting GrapheneOS on it. Might try that.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm also North America so severely limited options on phone models that support our towers. NA gets fucked compared to EU and Asia for cell companies. Not only do we deal with a duopoly on the operating systems, but there are really only 3 companies that have cell service and all the other MVNOs just buy time on their towers so if AT&T/T-Mobile or Verizon doesnt have a tower with the band a \"global\" phone supports it just doesn't work. Believe me I've been looking for a long time for a solution and never been happy with one yet. Tried a Poco with ArrowOS. Was in the beta program for the Nothing (1). I've got a small stack of weird phones in my closet but there's always some deep flaw that makes them unreliable or highly inconvenient. It seems like there's a \"pick two\" triangle of security, usability and stability and security is the easiest to part with. It's fucking sucks.",
