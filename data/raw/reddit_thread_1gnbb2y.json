I bought the cheapest stainless-steel kettle at the supermarket 12 years ago. It has exactly two settings - on and off. I made 3 cups of tea with it today. There's just nothing to go wrong in it.\n\nBut as you say, making this device 'repairable' by essentially making the electronics modular... doesn't really solve the problem. Because as you point out, it's still an entire electronics module (composed of many smaller electronic components) that has to be swapped out and then disposed of, rather than fixing the one or two actual faulty components. It *reduces* the electrical waste, but doesn't *eliminate* it.",

Most devices won't be able to use the extra current, as they are designed to run on any circuit in the house. You can technically buy some devices that use the 20A, but they are rare.

                          "body": "You can also get instant water boilers here, but they typically will get their own circuit anyways, so it can be run as a 240V circuit.\n\nThe odd thing is, our mains power is actually 240V, we just split that into two 120V lines by tapping a neutral off the center and tying it to ground. So if you go L1 (hot) or L2 (hot) to neutral you get 120V, and if you go from L1 to L2 you get 240V. Usually only electric clothes dryers, water heaters, A/C units, and stoves/ ovens (and electric car chargers if you have one) run at 240V though, pretty much everything else runs 120V.\n\nThere is actually nothing stopping you (other than cost) from running 240V circuits in your house and buying 240V electronics if you wanted to. There are 240V plugs/outlets for both 15A and 20A that are very similar to our normal plugs (they just have some of the flat pins rotated), but you typically only see those used in commercial spaces. They are pretty rare in residential. I have a few that I installed in my garage for some woodworking tools, but most houses don't have them.",

So that puts it out of reach for most. The other alternative is to pay someone to do the repairs, but that often ends up costing the same as buying a whole new unit with a brand new warranty. Unless manufacturers make repairs easier and cheaper, the convenience and economics for the end user will never stack up.\n\nThe only way I could conceivably see things changing is if governments regulate repairability or place a levy or tax on products that don't meet repairablity standards (which would hopefully make repairable products cheaper or more attractive to consumers than non-repairable ones). The free market on its own will never solve this problem.",

Assuming you can even guarantee spare parts for that long.\n\nWhen you can buy a \u00a310 kettle from Argo/Supermarket (\u00a38 in ASDA right now) that lasts 5 years, 10 years if you are lucky - A few years ago I saw a Swan kettle from the 80s still going strong - and they were considered cheap crap at the time also, in a break room that gets boiled 4-5 times a day.\n\nI personally have a stainless steel cookworks kettle I bought in 2005/6 still going strong (descaled it 2 maybe 3 times in that time). I think I also have a \u00a35 white plastic tesco kettle in the garage that would probably work that is older (the cookworks replaced it).\n\nBasically the \u00a312.30 one here: [https://archive.org/details/argos-catalogue-autumm-winter-2007\\_202401/page/n669/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/argos-catalogue-autumm-winter-2007_202401/page/n669/mode/2up)\n\nIt's all well and good over engineering something so that it might last for decades, but the people who need them can't afford them - and the people that can change their appliances whenever they decorate for the aesthetics.",

(Morning beverage, possibly to brew up iced tea during the day and evening tea) and normally they last about 5+ years. I will say getting a water softener and r/O system also helps extend lifespans since the water is is like drinking rocks.\n\nNow all that being said, the idea of self-serviceable appliances is wonderful but I can see a few major unintended issues. The first being that unless they become universal parts then you have the issue of supplies being limited, possibly unsustainable for companies, which then could make the price to fix the kettle more than just buying a new one.\n\nThe other is that this potentially would encourage companies to make their products have shorter lifespans. If they know they will get further sales from you, it would encourage them to get you to that repair point faster. An example of this can be seen in Toyotas with city modes for their engines (when you stop the engine shuts off), once a certain number of starts the car will throw a repair signal for you to take it in even if it's not failing.",

To hit that level of cheapness designs make sacrifices.\n\nTake this design. It'll cost a lot. They are replacing pretty much all the expensive components as the \"repair\". So replacement parts will cost almost as much as a new one.\n\nAnd this is for an item that's exceedingly simple in design, mechanically and electrically. A lot of the shitty aspects of electronics for repair is the extreme measures companies go for water proofing and sandwiching the whole product into the smallest form factor possible. People care about bulk on their phones and aesethtics. And electronics are microscopic these days and require highly specialized knowledge and tools to have any hope of repairing.\n\nIs their a subsection of the population that wants more dumb products that would be easier to repair? Sure. But there's many that are either too wealthy, too uninterested or would never attempt repairs. Do you as a manufacture spend millions to tool up a 2nd product sku for the smaller market? Or do you make one that is mostly broadly accepted/purchased?\n\nIt's mostly economics and design limitations and human preferences, not purposeful greed driving these decisions.",
