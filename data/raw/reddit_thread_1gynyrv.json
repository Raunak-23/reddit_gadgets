If that were true then the mini is already obsolete\u2026\n\nAn equivalent Nvidia card is $150.  And that\u2019s not really equivalent since it also has 6Gb-ish of dedicated RAM and is about 10-15% faster on gaming benchmarks.  And that card is 5 years old.  So clearly not obsolete.\n\nThe \u201cmemory chips\u201d are not higher end than standalone RAM.  They are embedded in the SoC, so are as a whole much cheaper for Apple to manufacture, etc than standalone sticks with their own PCB (and that\u2019s how they get the performance - a good architecture and embedding in the chip package - not just the chips themselves).\n\nAnd I quoted a fast PCI-E SSD. But the mini M4s SSD isn\u2019t even that fast.  Benchmarks have put the 256GB at like R 2000MB/s W 2900MB/s which is way below the Samsung 990\u2019s 6000  / 7000. Apple\u2019s RAM and SSD upgrades are almost entirely profit margin, everyone knows that, it\u2019s the biggest complaint about Apple products, period.\n\nGo look this all up, your info is made up and incorrect without reference to the facts.  Or just think about it\u2026 if 256GB SSD + 16GB RAM WITH all of the rest of a computer is $600, how can adding ONLY 768GB SSD and 16GB RAM cost $800?   The true added BOM cost of those is maybe $100.\n\nAs I have said before - I think Apple\u2019s SoC\u2019s are great.  The MBP M series are the best laptops period when price is no object, and the mini is a great low end PC for its very specific use cases.  But comparing them to equivalent gaming PCs is absurd.  I have half a dozen Apple devices at home (as well as several x86 PCs or laptops).  But I am not a fanboy, I am a computer engineer who has been building hardware and software for 30 years.  I know how much these parts cost and how their performance compares beyond synthetic benchmarks and marketing.\n\nOh\u2026 and it\u2019s easy to find a better gaming PC for $600.  SteamDeck OLED.  You also get 1TB RAM (ie actually useful) and a great display, with a battery.  Not going to match a mini on most productivity tasks but on gaming it\u2019s about the same 3D performance and otherwise better for invisible reasons.",

It starts with 512GB or 1TB if you want to have more than a couple games on it.\n\nSo, 1TB M4 mini is $1000 - and I can find tons of much higher spec gaming PCs (with faster SSD) that way outperforms the mini on 3D games and/or higher resolutions.\n\nHere\u2019s a an example reddit post\u2026 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/buildmeapc/comments/1be0gzo/best_pc_build_under_1000/?rdt=49945\n\nAnd a brief search for \u201cbest $1000 gaming PC\u201d shows dozens of video and articles on Google of people building $1000 gaming PCs with 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD, and 12-16GB Nvidia or GPUs with almost 2x the 3D performance of the base M4.\n\nI even found a $600 PC on Best Buy that still had better GAMING specs ie 1TB SSD and a decent 6GB GPU.\n\nNot interested in a discussion of productivity tasks as I have repeatedly said the M4 is a great chip for that at the price.",

The gen-on-gen improvements since M3 aren't a revolution, but the cumulative upgrades since M1 are now enough to be very noticeable in regular workloads. It's the first M-series chip marketed towards M-series owners instead of just intel Mac owners, which changes the framing of the coverage.\n\nThe same will probably be true of the a1iii, even if the upgrades are similar to those between i and ii, people will suddenly be comparing a camera from 2021 to one from 2027, and so even if there aren't major improvements, having 6 year newer hardware and software will feel like a bigger leap.\n\nI also think they probably released the a9iii and a1ii in the wrong order - instead of the a9iii being positioned as \"a a1ii with global shutter\", the a1ii became \"the a9iii *without* global shutter\". Realistically they were never going to have the global shutter and high frame rate of the a9iii ***AND*** the resolution of the a1i given how recently the a9iii released, but people's expectations suddenly got lifted to an unreachable height. Meanwhile, the many ergonomic and software improvements added for the a9iii were basically taken for granted on the a1ii.",

(plus, adding more MP just slows down processing and needs more expensive storage.)\n\nThe technology has shrunk so much that now the size limitation is simply *ergonomics*, and the size is a product decision rather than a technical one (Is this camera going to have a huge grip to balance very large lenses, or will it be small enough to stuff in a jacket pocket?)\n\nCamera CPU speeds have increased so much that all cameras can shoot faster and longer bursts - even budget cameras exceed the flagships of 20 years ago.\n\nThe ISO/dynamic range is bumping up against the limitations of physics and material science, so you don't see much advancement there any more either.\n\nReally, the only thing left is around integrations with other apps, like direct upload to social media; AI features to 'improve' the photos you take (at which point, why not use an iphone?), and autofocus and ease of use. The last two are pretty decent, but not required for most photographers. And even then, the improvements are incremental. All cameras have phenomonal eye autofocus now; and very little skill is required to get sharp photo's of most subjects (I think this is great, as I have little skill :) ).  \n\nProfessionals are happy to pay for that slightly better autofocus performance so they nail the shot - but even a lot of them are perfectly happy with what they have.\n\nYou're right - Cameras have always done their job well, digital or film. The difference is that with older cameras, more skill was required to get the right exposure, the right focus, the right framing, the right moment in time.

It also gets worse in the low light, and there\u2019s speed of acquisition.\n\nBurst speed, both time between shots and quantity it can take before buffer is done.\n\nImage stabilisation both optical and electronic, which is partly on lens but has to be supported by the camera.\n\nSize and weight. Battery life.\n\nPicture quality itself - namely, photosensitivity, or rather amount of noise sensor generates in low light.\n\nFor mirrorless - for a while they were too lagging for dynamic subject, but now they are actually better, but they ones that are better are excruciatingly expensive. So cost here is a factor of improvement.\n\nEdit: to be clear none of it matters very much for an average tourist or a family guy who wants some family memories. They are also not a target audience.\n\nHowever if you are for example in a wildlife photography, even as a hobbyist you will be facing a lot of small fast moving targets in a low light and in difficult focus conditions - think a flock of finches moving through the branches at dawn. Even at this level every bit of innovation pays. \n\nIf you are in concert photography you might be looking at taking high quality photos of moving subjects in a very difficult light and so on.\n\nCameras now improve for these sort of things and there\u2019s still a lot to do.

There is no computational photography that you get on phones.\n\nMy phone can take a stream of data and identify the perfect frame where nobody is blinking in the group. I press the shutter once and it makes sure it gets the best shot. The Sony accomplishes this by shooting 30 frames a second and then making you scroll through dozens of photos to select the one you like. There's a btter way to do this.\n\nMy phone can use data from previous and subsequent frames to enhance an existing frame. Apple calls this night mode. I have to bust out Adobe tools and spend a good amount of manual effort to get the same effect with the Sony. The Sony does not do this well. It has \"pixel shift\" which is basically just upsampling.\n\nI still have to download photos and apply Lightroom presets to them. I can't have this all done automatically in camera. The Sony preset system is embarrassingly bad.\n\nThe Sony a1 ii isn't better than the a1 because the competition sucks. There's plenty of room to improve. Maybe more room than since the introduction of DSLRs in the early 2000s.",
