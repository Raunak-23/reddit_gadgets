The reason I say it's a gas seal problem is that the only way we would get any practical obturation between the lands and the grooves would inevitably result in deposition of lead. To avoid that problem, it would require a significantly larger bore diameter, we're talking maybe one or two thou bigger, which would cause gas ceiling problems. There's also the problem with the fact that I don't think you would realistically be able to get some of the chamber and extract will maintaining obturation, but that could probably be addressed with a pre-designed fluted chamber. \n\nI agree that it's a really interesting concept, and honestly where I see something like it being valuable would be in the context of increasing external surface area for cooling purposes without adding too much mass. I could absolutely see some company printing a barrel blank with Lewis style radiators on the outside, and then refining the boar and button rifling it. \n\nAs a stands there for DIY, ECM is relatively easy, and then you have some people like myself as well as some of the guys over with OKB-69 actually developing DIY cartridges. Personally I'm a proponent of moving to 8 mm (or more accurately 7.92 wildcat cartridges, as that right there could allow for pretty easy DIY barrel production using readily available 8 mm ID tubes, and then just put on a rifled muzzle device as though you were doing a pin and weld",

The bit about accidentally stigmatizing mental healthcare isn't bad, but it does feel a bit disingenuous to just waltz into a conversation and basically suggest that someone wanting better mental healthcare to solve X is part of the problem because X isn't the biggest part of the problem.\n\nThe same argument keeps working at further removes, and if you try it like that it becomes obvious that it's absurd.  Imagine if someone said: \"Mental health disorders are bad, but they don't really kill that many people in the aggregate.  You're hundreds of times more likely to die of ischaemic heart disease or stroke.  Spending time on mental health services distracts people from focusing on their physical health.  I don't know what to do about this, but it's a serious barrier to people getting the diet and exercise they need.\"\n\nI'm not saying this to pick a fight or something, but I don't think you should be surprised if they focused on the second half of your sentence more than the first.  \"The odds of being killed in a school shooting are extremely low.\"  So what, it's not a problem?  It's distracting from real problems?  We shouldn't care?  No argument that opens with that sentence is going to be popular.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it doesn\u2019t make a ton of sense because these people generally plan on dying in a shootout - but it will limit the kid who wants to shoot a ceo on the street at least a little\u2026 then Feds make fake chat rooms and infiltrate people still trying to make printed guns etc lol they already do all this shit just add another layer and more charges they can toss at someone. \n\nIdk why this seems so far fetched\u2026 \u201cthe government wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d doesn\u2019t really speak to me anymore. The government banned tik tok lol",

You legitimately need to be able to weld to make one of these things as far as I can tell.  Rifling the barrel is an entirely different set of problems that also requires specialty tools and knowledge/skills to do correctly.  Not welding it just means you've got a gun held together by JB weld lmao....which is just going to hand grenade at some point.  I'm sure it'll work great until it doesn't and then you're going to have a really bad time lmao.  \n\nAs a geek (one that already knows about 3D printing) this isn't a weekend a project.  It's going to take time and learning to get this shit done.  Anyone who thinks this is like some lego kit doesn't know enough about it.\n\nAgain, there are kits that legitimately are basically Lego's that convert metal CO2 airsoft pistols into an actual firearm.  The internet has made this accessible to anyone vaguely handy already without 3D printers.  It's a problem, but it's impossible to stop anyone determined to make a gun from making one with or without a 3D printer.  The best you can do is make obtaining parts (like barrels, trigger mechanisms, etc...) more difficult, but even then you're going to see hillbilly pipe guns that absolutely were made in a weekend by someone who's handy.",

              "body": "They could address the problem by going after violent criminals instead of targeting peaceable citizens. \n\nThey focus so much of their effort on hobbyists and restricting the people who go through hoops and do everything the legal way, while simultaneously being softer on crime by reducing the crimes eligible to be held for bail, and imposing lesser sentences.\n\nIt's not the law abiding gun owners who are the problem. And yet they're the only ones impacted by these laws.\n\nLike it or not, the 2nd amendment is the law in the US. States must abide by the constitution.\n\n\n>[I don't need to have numbers, I don't need to have a data point...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvYeGtIGJ0o)\n\nImagine if when asked if they had data showing it was illegal immigrants causing the problems, that a Red State governor said \"I don't need to have the numbers, I don't need to have a data point to show they're the problem\".  \n\nThey would (rightfully) be slammed. Because they're passing laws hurting the wrong people with no data to support it.\n\nNew Hampshire has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the nation. One of the highest gunownership rates. And also the lowest violent crime rate, and is located within an hour or 2 of New York. If the law abiding gun owners were the problem, why is New Hampshire not a warzone?",

                          "body": "SCOTUS has already explained \"every word\" for you in *Heller*'s grammar explanation: \n\n>  The Second Amendment is naturally divided into two parts: its prefatory clause and its operative clause. The former does not limit the latter grammatically, but rather announces a purpose. The Amendment could be rephrased, \u201cBecause a well regulated Militia is necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\u201d See J. Tiffany, A Treatise on Government and Constitutional Law \u00a7585, p. 394 (1867); Brief for Professors of Linguistics and English as Amici Curiae 3 (hereinafter Linguists\u2019 Brief). Although this structure of the Second Amendment is unique in our Constitution, other legal documents of the founding era, particularly individual-rights provisions of state constitutions, commonly included a prefatory statement of purpose. See generally Volokh, The Commonplace Second Amendment, 73 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 793, 814\u2013821 (1998).\n\nEven if you ignore that, I also don't think you'd like the *Miller* case that you cite which protects private ownership of weapons useful for militia service, i.e. weapons of war:\n\n> In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a [short-barreled shotgun] at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.\n\nThe *Miller* case you've cited would seem to indicate that military weapons, like the full-auto M-16, are protected arms.",

There\u2019s been nuance there. It means the militia was in an effective shape to fight.\u201d\n>\n>In other words, it didn\u2019t mean the state was controlling the militia in a certain way, but rather that the militia was prepared to do its duty. \n\nThis is something that is widely understood and uncontroversial among experts in Constitutional law on both sides of the political spectrum.

The National Guard is akin to the historical \"select militia (or corps)\" or which was as troublesome to many of the founders as any other standing army. In 1789, \"the militia\" referred to all citizens capable of bearing arms, \"the people\" referred to in 2A. \n\nAlso, if you understand the philosophical roots of 2A, you'd understand that the notion of the right to keep and bear arms only applying to a subset of the citizenry would have been quite offensive to the founders. \n\n>Yet, somehow in 2008 they found reason to extend the amendment to private ownership no matter state or federal law. Because right wing special interest groups have been trying to re-frame the 2A as only the second half of the amendment, and it has worked. \n\nHeller was merely SCOTUS rejecting the \"collective right\" theory that was largely an early 20th century invention. Your argument that this is because of right wing interest groups is guffaw inducing when you consider that SCOTUS was **unanimous** in accepting the individual right.",

So the go to thing used to be driving out of state and buying ammo. Find a place between where you're staying and Nevada and just eat the extra 2 hours travel time to go out of state. Except the cops caught on and they sit at the border recording license plates and such and then track how long it takes them to come back into state. They know how long it takes to get to the nearest ammo shop and if they see your car leave and renter California within whatever widow they deem appropriate they'll pull your ass over and search your car.",
