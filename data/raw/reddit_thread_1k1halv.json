Neither is a real solution for backups, which should be separate, but ZFS snapshots facilitates fast backups.\n\nSnapshots aren't for high performance, they are for differential copying or marking the history of files so you can go back to that state at any time.\n\nEg you can snapshot, copy the files somewhere, then later snapshot and copy again -- only the changed files will be copied. The crucial thing is unlike usual differential backups, the filesystem already knows what changed. It doesn't need to compare anything, like rsync or others would. This makes it crazy fast, often < 1 second.\n\nYou can snapshot, update the OS (or install some software or anything else), then go back to the snapshot if the update was bad.\n\nMost home users can use a single 18TB or so drive. If you're doing more than that, you're likely already dorking around needlessly and shouldn't be discouraged from the cool things ZFS can do.",

The downside is, as mentioned above, that it doesn't have room for many disks and that it's a bit loud, when pushed at least. \n\nBut there are barebones systems coming out now that basically is a mini PC with room for a bunch of 3.5'' drives. There are chassis for ITX, and barebones with a Celeron, Pentium or a low-powered Ryzen, with bays for 2-8 drives, that are much cheaper than a Synology NAS and likely cheaper than a used \"real\" server.

Everything on my server is in 4K or 1080p and all devices we watch things on can handle that. I don't really stream much video outside my home though, but my phone can also handle 4K and 1080p. \n\nElectricity is also cheap here, but say 150W constantly for a whole year (and that's pretty low for a server) is still over 1300 kWh a year, for me that would cost about \u20ac200. My mini PC on the other hand, draws no more than 20W unless gaming on it, and I don't game on it, so that's about 175 kWh per year, or about \u20ac25.",

Those functions probably don't work too well with crappy SMR consumer drives in the first place and might even cause data loss or soft brick it.\n\nAdmittedly this is still asshole behavior but not a \"Synology is forcing you to buy their relabled HDDs\" level of asshole behavior.",

Having intro and credit skipping alone has made it worth it to me.\n\nPeople should always consider alternatives such as emby, jellyfin, etc, and it isn't impossible to run all of them at once.

It's also a 3 years older than the N150 or 1 year older than 1220P. The 1220P consumes more power at max throughput but all should idle within margin of error. The QNAP also only has 8GB of ram vs 24gb for the beelink. Your main advantage with the QNAP seems to be having 4 nvmes instead of 2, and dual 2.5gb ports instead of dual 1gb ports, and built in IR. \n\nIf you're streaming more than 2 gigabits per second and want 2 more nvme drives, that's the only edge case where I could see getting an qnap. For more than 2x the price I'd find a way to make the 3x faster processor (1220P) work with an external usb-c drive that would be much cheaper for bulk storage. I don't know the qnap software but I'm fine with linux and windows solutions, plenty of free or cheap options for either platform.",

Plex has been moved off my DS, on to a cheap but more powerful MiniPC. Home Assistant also has been moved off to its own Beelink Device. At the experiences have definitely improved. So basically, other than the Synology Photos functionality (which I really appreciate just wish was more feature rich) my DS has just become a NAS as opposed to a more server like device. With slow uptake of 10G, and now hinted HDD lockin I think I will also be looking at not upgrading to any new Synology hard ware to replace my DS1018+ and DS718+ as the are completely fine for the current use case. I also utilize Surveillance but that will be transitioned to Unifi this summer.

The storage system vendor (eg Synology) won\u2019t really build or control the hardware, but they typically will have their own firmware on the drives.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m not in the market for this type of storage, but if I was running a small(ish) business and wanted/needed robust enterprise-grade storage without paying for one of those other vendors\u2019 products (and public cloud offerings just didn\u2019t fit my needs) I don\u2019t see any reason why I wouldn\u2019t consider a Synology Plus system.\n\nThey have other (non-Plus) systems that haven\u2019t been affected by this change for home use.",

The company also restricts storage pools and provides limited or zero support for third-party drives.\u201d\n\nOther than whatever \u201crestricts storage pools\u201d everything else you \u201close\u201d is just a feature of the hard drive itself. The NAS will work exactly the same, but these perks that I\u2019m sure are difficult to maintain for a huge number of hard drive possibilities will just go away. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure some of those things have always been unsupported by hard drives not from a major manufacturer. \n\nAll this looks like to me is Synology saying that if you want the experience you\u2019re used to, you need to have a certified/badged hard drive. If not, basically everything will still work, but it becomes a little more use at your own risk.\n\nAlso, it mentions that they\u2019ve already done this for enterprise hardware, saw how well it worked (by limiting edge cases I\u2019m sure) and are just rolling it out to the next hardware tier.",

But with a product like a NAS where users are 1) counting on it working and 2) responsible for buying and installing half of the system (the drives) there\u2019s a lot that could go wrong if the user buys cheap off brand hard drives. \n\nTo me this is almost about brand protection. Telling the user that feature XYZ will not be available is better than them thinking it is, and the the feature not working leading to lost data. \n\nIf you think your drives will self monitor and the system will alert you to issues, you can be careless about checking yourself. If the system says \u201chey, these drives are not compatible, you\u2019ll have to keep an eye on them\u201d at least the user is aware before it\u2019s possibly too late.",
