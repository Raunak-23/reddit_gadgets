You just create a new product code and force units that would have met the higher product code into the lower product code. Then they get their fuse values updated and wham bam you have a slightly worse card. \n\nGranted I couldn't tell you how much bureaucratic red tape the C suite had to go through to think this was a remotely good idea, but the actual technical implementation would have easily been one two-week sprint. With due diligence of rolling out the change maybe a couple of months but again that's mainly just kind of watching the change propagate to make sure your company's engineers aren't dumb when they tweak one parameter. At least not any dumber than leadership.",

If we wanted to run slower all we do is fool the part into thinking it would need a higher voltage to run then it actually would and you will end up with a new performance ceiling set by your power and temperature limit. That's how one red company does it. Unrelated, that strategy actually comes with the fun implication that if you can cool that part enough it'll just keep climbing up that frequency curve which is why it is so easy and so much fun to do crazy stuff like liquid nitrogen cool parts made by that red company. You can have the fuses do anything you want though. You could literally tell it that no matter how good the cooling and power delivery is Thou Shalt Not run faster than X gigahertz.",
