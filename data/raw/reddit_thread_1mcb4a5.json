Xbox is the 2nd. Sony and Nintendo will also have to follow suit alongside basically EVERYONE who is in the affected areas. Similar measures are happening in the US with \"explicit materials\" (porn) in which some states are going to require verifications. \n\n> However, Microsoft states, \"Starting early next year, age verification will be required for these players in the UK to retain full access to social features on Xbox, such as voice or text communication and game invites.\" You will still be able to play Xbox games with your age unverified (and no note is made of age ratings on games you own), you just won't have access to social features.\n\nSo basically you'll be able to play games...just not socially. Should not affect say GTA6 unless there's online components. Xbox is going to catch the first wave of flack but everyone else will, too. ULTIMATELY, this is why we must **vote** as online petitions aren't worth a damn. Don't believe me? \n\n> The UK has just recently passed the UK Online Safety Act, and despite almost 400,000 signatures being signed to repeal it, the UK government has stayed firm on its implementation.\n\nSo when you all try to pass along those funky online petitions don't pat yourself on the back afterwards....if you live in the areas actually call up your reps or try to start those dialogs and more importantly **vote** as this could have probably been avoided in the UK. Online petitions are bare minimum at voicing concerns. \n\nFinally, this title was awful as this should have been more for us parents to understand what is changing (if you live in the UK. I live in the US so nothing changes for me...yet). I don't get \"Death Stranding\" in relations to this title and shouldn't need it explained. It should instead be \"OK, my kid now needs verification if they're using their own system. Let me decide how to handle that)",
