For now, it's still relatively easy to choose either way based on your preferences.\n\nFor the long term, it's good to have the FPGA stuff figured out for preservation, since those implementations can be saved as data, long after the hardware is gone or impractical to buy due to rarity. It also opens up the possibility of creating drop-in replacement parts for the various custom chips on original hardware, such as with the FPGASID project for the C64 sound chip.\n\nOf course, that FPGA preservation needs to happen while we can still do both.",
