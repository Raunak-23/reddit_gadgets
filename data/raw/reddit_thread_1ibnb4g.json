As someone who\u2019s been emulating since snes9x the price point seems absolutely ridiculous for a console whose library is mostly already available on PSN or recently remastered. I feel this is for someone who wants to pay $180 to plug in their old controllers to play Tomba.\n          \nFor $180 I\u2019d probably crack or buy a cracked ps3.",

I see posts about all the hardware that's just running emulators and can't help but think \"what's the point? I could do that myself.\"",

      "body": "For those that don't know, this is not emulation. Not in the way people understand it.\n\n\"emulators\" basically take the code given to them by the game, and translates that code to something modern your computer can understand. It's essentially taking one language and converting it to another, best as they can. This is why some emulators struggle with certain games or aspects of the game, like maybe the sound is messed up, or there's not a slowdown where there was one originally. It's an imperfect process. Still absolutely brilliant what people have pulled off with emulation, but it isn't the original hardware or software.\n\nThis is an FPGA. Field-Programmable Gate Array. With an FPGA you can reprogram the chip to work however you'd like as often as you'd like. Which means you can reprogram the chip to replicate and operate just like original game hardware and their various chip architectures. in FPGA land, we call these \"cores\" instead of \"emulators\" because they don't emulate the code, they replicate how the hardware and chips worked in the original console. So when you load a game using an FPGA, you aren't translating. you're just playing the original game, natively.\n\nNow I glossed over a few things here and there, but that's the gist of it.",

The chip is not powerful enough to ever play ps2 or gamecube or dreamcast games, so just be aware of its limits. sega saturn support is playable but not 100% yet, but should be in time.\n\n\n\nbut it can also do things like\u00a0arcade machines and snes and older stuff, provided someone has put in the major effort of developing and releasing\u00a0a\u00a0core.\n\n\n\nthis psx fpga is a modified version of his other product, MiSTER Pi: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=shKwRz9MD-A This product doesn't have a SNAC port, but\u00a0has a permanent psx SNAC ports. which basically means zero latency when using psx controllers, like original hardware.",
