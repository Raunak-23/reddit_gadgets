Obviously its impossible right now for Nintendo to use TSMCs 2nm process atm, as I have already stated that its not yet released.  However there are other chips they can use that are newer and more power efficient than 8nm without much additional cost.\n\nNvidia could switch to 18a in the near future if they chose to do so.  I would imagine if they wanted to they could compete with Apple for the advanced process nodes.  But why do that when you can sell $32,000 5nm chips ?  Im pretty sure if Nvidia has more wiggle room on a 32k GPU vs a 1.5k phone.\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-is-reportedly-close-to-adopting-intel-foundrys-18a-process-node-for-gaming-gpus",

No one really needs a faster iPhone these days, the screen are already about as gorgeous as the human eye will see, and even the main attraction of new models(the cameras) are both basically as good as most people need them to be and also !beginning to hit the limits of what physics can manage.\n\nEven looking solely at gaming, it\u2019s increasingly clear how little new technology has offered us. \n\nYou can go back a good 8 years and pluck out a title like BotW which was designed to run on positively ancient hardware, give it a handful of performance tweaks, and you\u2019ll notice very few differences from a current gen title either graphically or mechanically.  Give it a small makeover that most don\u2019t even feel is worth the $10 Nintendo is asking, and it\u2019s downright gorgeous. \n\nI look at some DF videos on the newest games comparing lowest to highest graphics settings, and I often find myself perfectly happy with the lowest and even wondering what the fuck changed because they\u2019re trying to show something like how water reflections are slightly less detailed and lighting is a tad flatter\u2026.a decade ago they\u2019d have been nearly universally borderline unplayable, and the lowest settings would have just disabled lighting and reflections of any kind altogether lol.\n\nThe graphical improvements that have kept each console generation feeling worth the investment have slowly begun to feel like they\u2019re hitting the limit of what people actually even care about.  Aside from exclusives, I\u2019m honestly not sure what the PS6 can offer that I\u2019d care about.  I\u2019m already pretty underwhelmed by what this generation has brought us aside from shorter loading times.\n\nThere will always be niches and applications where we need more, but for the average person just buying consumer electronics\u2026.I\u2019m not entirely convinced of how much more is even left.",

Theres a very bland approach to details, everything is very smooth.\u00a0\n\n\nElden Ring is a massive leap. Compare any landscape shot and the difference is obvious.

In 2017 an 8 year old game would have looked like goddamn AC2 or Mario Kart Wii.  To really hammer home what that last one means: **Native HD wasn\u2019t even a guarantee.**\n\nThe graphical differences just aren\u2019t anywhere near as stark and meaningful as they used to be.

Oblivion is a good recent example; faces aside the world was adored for its details and vastness in 2006. Almost 20 years later, those same details on 2006-ultra are worse than the 2025-lowest settings. 2006 oblivion realism is basically unacceptable as realism. Today you can get screenshots in the remaster that can fool people into thinking its a real life photo, but in 20 years will we still think the same?\n\nNow take a games like Borderlands or Papers Please. Borderlands  cell-shaded comic book art style is going to hold up far longer because the *art style itself* is appealing. Papers Please is intentionally drab and impersonable to make the player feel a certain way. Its an unforgiving, angular, crunchy atmosphere that comes across easily. Adding 4k textures doesnt improve the art style very much because theres only so much more clarity you can get from those styles. \n\nBreath of the wild too! Its cartoony-style is part of the appeal!

Once games started taking years to develop, they started being designed for the hardware that was assumed will exist by the time the game is out. Eg, if someone in 2005 started working on a game they plan to release in 2010, they designed it from the get-go for 2010 hardware. Notoriously, Crysis went above and beyond and designed for hardware that wouldn't exist until years after launch.

Here it is for everyone else (sorry if paragraphs aren't as they should be, copied it quickly).\n\n>**Secure \u2018quantum messages\u2019 sent over telecoms network in breakthrough**\n\n>Scientists have sent messages encrypted using principles of quantum physics over a 250km German commercial telecommunications network, in a milestone towards next-generation data security. Toshiba Europe researchers have used so-called quantum key distribution (QKD) cryptography to transfer messages over traditional communication systems in a way that would be safe from hackers. QKD exploits a phenomenon known as quantum entanglement. This refers to the way two subatomic particles\u2019 characteristics can be related, even when separated by a vast distance. By measuring data from one particle, you can infer information from the other. This allows the pair to serve as keys that can exchange coded messages but are unreadable to outsiders. The researchers were able to send such quantum messages with standard optical fibre and without specialist ultra-low temperature cooling equipment usually used for these kind of communications. They claim this is the first time such an extensive simplified quantum information exchange has been run on a commercial telecoms network.\n\n>Robert Woodward, leader of the fibre QKD research team at Toshiba Europe, said their breakthrough \u201copens the door to many exciting\u00a0quantum\u00a0technologies transitioning out of the lab and into practical networks\u201d. Quantum networks\u2019 potential resilience to hackers has sparked intense worldwide research interest including in China, which is developing a global satellite-based quantum communications system.\n\n>\u201cA near-term practical implication of our findings is that much higher performance QKD is now possible using commercially viable components,\u201d said Woodward, a co-author of a paper on the work published in Nature on Wednesday. \u201cThis paves the way for national and international scale deployment of\u00a0quantum-secure communication infrastructure.\u201d Governments, companies and academic researchers are racing to improve information security because of emerging technological threats to encrypted sensitive data, such as bank transactions and health records. If efforts to develop powerful computers based on quantum theory succeed, they could crack the complex mathematical calculations on which decades-old cryptographic methods are based. The novelty of the German experiment, spanning a 254km network between Frankfurt, Kirchfeld and Kehl, lies in the simplicity of the equipment it uses. It avoids relying on expensive and energy-intensive machinery to control temperature and detect the photon particles on which the quantum data transmission relies. \n\n>\u201cThis paper represents a significant advance for the deployment of secure quantum communication,\u201d said Professor Sandrine Heutz, head of the department of materials at Imperial College London. \u201cThe large-scale deployment of quantum communication relies on practical engineering approaches such as these, combining a focus on sustainability with secure communication over more than 250km.\u201d Recommended Visual story Quantum computing could break the internet. This is how Other researchers said the use of a commercial telecoms network distinguished it from the specialist adaptations deployed in China\u2019s extensive quantum communication work on Earth and via satellite. Using less sophisticated equipment might involve some loss of communication quality, but it opened the way to building large quantum information systems with a variety of capabilities. \u201cResearch teams and governments around the world are building quantum networks at scale, not only for secure communications but also for important day-to-day activities like navigation,\u201d said James Millen, an experimental quantum scientist at King\u2019s College London. \u201cWhile it is possible to build a quantum network using satellites, it is more cost-effective to use existing optical fibre infrastructure,\u201d he added. The use of existing systems creates a potential vulnerability for QKD-based technology through attacks on the infrastructure itself. But the nature of QKD means that any attempts at eavesdropping should be apparent to the parties to the information exchange.",

The difference now is those gains are being made in architectural improvements more than simply transistor die shrinks. You can see these gains in real world applications when you do things like software encoding in handbrake or file compression/decompression, but you see fewer gains in applications like gaming and this is more due to inherent limitations in performance scaling on the codebases themselves.\n\nAs someone who is actually utilizing their full CPU's potential frequently, I do see significant decreased in processing time for lengthy tasks I'm often stuck waiting on, but tobe fair I expect we're close to the point where parallelization, not single system performance, is the future of scaling out workloads at even the consumer level.",

For decades we\u2019d see doubling in transistor densities every 2-3, and that alone meant that prices would drop just due to the gains in performance and reduction in power draw. That is no longer the case. The improvements are still happening, but it\u2019s happening at maybe half the rate that it was, and will continue to slow down. A new breakthrough will be required to see gains like we used to, something that is beyond reduction in transistor density.\n\nIf you want a clear picture on how the progress was slowed, an easy way to spot it is the RAM usage over time, and it's easy to see in console generations.\n\n* PS1 (1994): 3.5MB of RAM\n* PS2 (2000): 36MB of RAM (10x increase in 6 years, avg of 1.6x increase per year)\n* PS3 (2006): 512MB of RAM (14x increase in 6 years, avg of 2.3x increase per year)\n* PS4 (2013): 8GB of RAM (16x increase in 7 years, avg of 2.3x increase per year)\n* PS5 (2020): 16GB of RAM (2x increase in 7 years, avg of 0.3x increase per year)\n* PS6 (likely 2027): Likely 24GB of RAM\n\nEasy to spot that transistor increases really slowed down some time after 2013. You could see since in CPUs as well, you used to need a new CPU for a PC every few years to keep up with games, now a good CPU could last you 7-8 years.",

      "body": "Oh, gods.. Here we go again. \n\nThe argument he makes literally rests on a proposition (Moore's Law) -- that the author himself somehow has now studied to learn now, after the industry has been selling it as a thruthism in the absolutely wrong context -- from the 70s. \n\nSo if you take the argument he makes at face value, there hasn't been done much in terms of progress since the 70s and 80s, long before x86 was even conceived. And that's true, because the consoles he specifies rest on RISC-architectures, which we have not programmed for outside of specific exceptions: the SNES, wii, Switch, the Ps3 (arguably the ps2), and the various Misp-based other console-architectures.\n\nMeanwhile, the Switch is based on an ARM-chipset with an nvidia graphics card instruction set fused to the \"cpu\"-instruction set islands - with an isolated chip so that the instruction set doesn't have to rest on hardware that is \"extractable\" through sdk. And this Tegra setup is now over 15 years old, even though the tegra \"x1\" (released in 2015) didn't find it's way to the Nintendo Switch (after being lampooned universally in the dysfunctional Ziff-Davis vomit we call the gaming press) in 2017. \n\nThe maybe most successful gaming console in recent years, in other words, is based on a lampooned chipset that Nvidia almost didn't manage to get off the ground with the ION chipset - two decades before som muppet in Ars finally finds out that there hasn't been done much new stuff in hardware recently. \n\nThat the Intel setups that rely exclusively on higher clock speeds to produce better results -- have not substantially changed in over 10 years -- does not, in any way trigger this kind of response. Of course not. That Microsoft and Sony both release a console that is an incredibly outdated PC, using an AMD setup that allows the manufacturer to avoid the obvious cooling issues that every console with any amount of similar graphics grunt would have... doesn't trigger anything. That a gaming laptop is released with /less/ theoretical power, but that soundly beats the 200W monsters that throttle from the first second in benchmarks run on something that's not submerged in liquid nitrogen -- doesn't register. No, of course not.\n\nAnd when Nvidia releases a \"proper\" graphics card that has infinite amounts of grunt -- that can't be used by any real-time applications unless they are predetermined to work only on the front-buffer directly, as the PCI bus -- from the fecking 90s -- is not quick enough to do anything else. When \"BAR\" is introduced, and it sadly suffers from the same issues, and resubmit pauses are incredibly high - completely shuttering the OpenCL universe from any traditional PC setup.. no, no one at Fucking Ars registers that.\n\nBut what do they register? I'll tell you what -- the release of a console that makes use of nvidia's great and new and futuristic bullshit-sampling and frame-generation technology -- otherwise on the same hardware as the Switch. Because Nintendo doesn't succeed in selling some bullshit by buying off a Pachter to lie to people on beforehand. \n\nThen they realize - and argue, like pointed out - that there hasn't really been that much progress in computing since the 70s as /some people in the industry says, in a Mountain-Dew-ridden blod-fog/. \n\nAnd then some of us come along and point out that efficiency on performance in the lower watt segments has exploded, to the point where 1080p+@60fps gaming is available to us on 30W -- oh, we don't care about that. When we point out that spu-designs on an asynchronously transferring memory bus (as opposed to the synchronous one we're stuck with), with programmable computation elements (as in ability to send programs to the cpu, rather than let the processor infinitely subdivide these operations themselves at 5Ghz rates. That are the equivalent of a long instruction running on, say 20Mhz, in entirely realistic situations). \n\nWhen we do that, then Arse doesn't want to know. In fact, no one wants to know. Because that narrative is in confrontation with Intel's marketing bullshit drives.\n\nThe stupidest industry in the world. Bar none.",

COVID happened which increased prices, but what happened after that? Prices of everything were kept high and then increased even more. Meanwhile every big media was talking about how big companies were struggling but \"surprisingly\" turns out these same companies were reporting record profits, why could this happen???\n\nAlso in the meantime the orange thing decided to start his tariff war which has destabilized the whole global market.\n\nJust look at Nvidia the company who designed and sell the SoC of the Switch and Switch 2, they have globally increased their prices on everything because, yes, some increased prices by Tsmc, and some other manufacturer price increases, but just because they can get away with it. All their new GPUs are being criticized for charging more for less increase in performance or for the same performance, while their support is getting more enshittified. And for the industry they're now trying to be the solution for almost everything on the pipeline to also extract as much money as they can from them too (while costing more also)\n\nI'm just tired of looking at headlines blaming the obvious thing the big companies want to pass the blame to, so the consumers don't look at the big picture of what's really happening. The Switch 2 is definitely not expensive only because Moore's law is relatively dead.",
