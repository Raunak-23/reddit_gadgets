If you receive a damaged/defective/deceptive product you can ALWAYS pursue a return/refund on eBay, regardless of what the seller writes in the listing. If you have a valid reason and the seller declines to accept the return then eBay will step in and force a refund.\n\nYou should also have similar protections any time you purchase a product using PayPal to process the payment - as long as you don't use the \"Friends and Family\" option. This is also the case for many other vendors and payment platforms. You might need to jump through some hoops to file a claim, but you will get there.

                  "body": "Yeah this is the main reason I quit selling on eBay, because of the general idiocy of buyers, and the me getting penalized for it. I think people have gotten so used to just impulse buying off sites like Amazon and Walmart and just retuning it if it isn\u2019t right they are taking that mentality to eBay now and it screws over sellers. Then you got the ones that fully intend to defraud the seller. \n\nI have never tried to defraud or mislead someone and put all the information possible in my listings, but it never fails someone will buy something with no clue what it is and then get upset because it\u2019s not what they wanted. \n\nWhen I finally threw in the towel was when I sold a PS4 on eBay, they buyer got it and said it didn\u2019t work, I know damn well it worked, of course I said send it back, they sent me a tiny padded envelope with a picture of a smiley emoji in it. eBay said it shows the item was delivered to me, so that\u2019s that. \n\nYou can see the idiocy in Amazon reviews as well. Like you can read the items description that clearly says what it does it doesn\u2019t do, and gives important details and inevitably you will see multiple 1 star reviews complaining about something that was clearly stated in the description.",

I found natural feelings as a replacement, these are perfect and didn't shrink by a noticeable amount after being washed, got 7 pairs for the same price.\n\nalso with amazon you have to take into account people completely changing store pages after the fact, or in the case of electronics, not actually getting what you paid for, this has worked out in my favor of getting something higher end, and worked against me in the passed when I got a mouse that was obviously a counterfeit, there is a fun video on youtube by I forget who about this... it was a fun video where it took 3 or 4 attempts before they got an actual product, you also have cases where the factory workers themselves swap the products, or cases like samsung sd cards where they get counterfeited to the point even retail gets counterfeit versions without knowing it.\n\nit's really hard to say consumer stupidity for everything, its one of the reasons I really like smart usbc charging, I remember barrel jacks, I remember wal warts that god knows if it supply's enough or too much, the sooner we move to usbc everything with a smart charger so it knows how much to deliver to whatever is on the other end, the better, hell there are projects that replace barrel jacks for usb c granted its not one size fits all sadly. \n\nnow on the ebay side, I honestly wonder if there is money to be made in a third party seller that can verify something works and function as the middleman in sales. the problem with that would probably be the risk of that becoming used as a fence, but it's possible that this kind of a service where confirmed working goes in, confirmed working goes out, and could probably institute a no return policy of sorts.",

Scarcity in a free market is when there are more people willing to buy at the retail price than there are units to sell. Scalpers deliberately buy up retail stock without a goal of consumption, as their intent is to hoard and resell at inflated prices. This removes supply and creates scarcity that doesn't exist naturally.\n\n>Prices increasing in response to a shortage and strong demand is exactly what classical Econ models would predict.\n\nMarket manipulation is not classical economics. Classical econ works on free competition and natural supply-demand movements to determine a market clearing price. Scalping manipulates this by artifically restricting supply to force higher prices. It is not an unfettered market when exploitive intervention unnaturally manipulates the market clearing price. It breaks the classical econ model.",

They start taking pre-orders.\n\nNow imagine that scalpers intervene, using bots or other tools, and secure 50 of those 100 units.\n\n- There are still 100 consumers willing to buy the product at $1,000, but now only 50 units are available at retail.\n- A shortage of 50 units has been artificially created by the scalpers, where previously there was none.\n\nThen scalpers reintroduce the products on the resale market, forcing prices above retail.

Let me address the real-world scenario.\n\nYou seem to be floating the idea that in a situation where the market clearing price is above the retail price, scalpers merely \"unlock\" the natural market clearing price, allowing supply and demand to function naturally without being constrained by the retail pricing model. However, the act of withholding stock artificially raises the equilibrium price by distorting the market's natural supply-demand balance. Let me show you how:\n\n**Without scalpers:**\n\nSupply: 100 units\n\nDemand at $1,000 retail: 150 buyers (50 unfulfilled)\n\nDemand at $1,200: 100 buyers (natural MCP achieved, market balanced).\n\n**With scalpers:**\n\nSupply: 50 units in retail circulation, 50 hoarded by scalpers.\n\n50 buyers purchase at $1,000 retail.\n\n100 buyers remain, but only 50 scalper-controlled units are available.\n\nRemember, 100 buyers were willing to buy at $1,200 retail, but there are now only 50 units. To clear this new imbalance, prices rise further until demand drops to match supply\u2014e.g., $1,600. While there can be overlap where would-be $1,200 buyers are among the 50 who manage to buy at retail, even if only 90, or 80 remain, the scalper-distorted MCP will still exceed the natural one. \n\nScalpers don\u2019t unlock market forces - they distort them, forcing consumers to pay inflated prices while adding zero value. This is market manipulation, not equilibrium.",

Even temporarily removing availability from retail channels disrupts the demand supply balance\n\n>There is no driving up of prices beyond the market clearing price.\n\nTheir intervention has already driven up the market clearing price. Scalping pushes up the market clearing price beyond what it would be without scalping, plain and simple\n\n>I wonder if simple supply and demand explains that perfectly?\n\nSpoiler: It doesn't. Scalping doesn't recreate or restore a perfect market, it disrupts simple supply and demand by creating artificial scarcity. They manipulate the supply curve to engineer a rapid increase in prices to profit from the scarcity they themselves have manufactured.",

Would your solution be to just give everyone a 4090? Make more people less \"rich?\"\n\nMyself, I just want one. I'm looking at buying a second hand one. I don't feel owed one. I don't deserve one. My purchase is going to help that guy buy a 5090, I can sell my 4070ti super (yes. I need that liiiitle but more lmao) and recoupe some of my costs, while someone else gets an upgraded card. And so it goes on.",

                              "body": "The legal intervention required is honestly not very difficult. We just need stronger price regulation laws and license requirements for bulk purchase. \n\nOn a product like a GPU a non-license cap of 3 of them would easily fit the vast majority of the populations requirements while making scalping substantially more difficult. Once you have a license you are given a resale restriction cap which limits the total markup you can resell the item at. Obviously breaking this limitation comes with a stiff penalty. Make that limit similar to average for normal commercial stores such as Walmart IE cap of \\~30% markup. Failure to put regulations in place is why the market can create artificial scarcity so easily. \n\nThere are likely expansions required to ensure such a law is less vulnerable to exploitation etc, it needs more cooking but for a basic comment you should get the idea. \n\nThe purpose is to stop someone from buying the entire stock of an item and then selling it at 200-300-400% + markups. These people are essentially just parasites and offer no value to anyone. \n\nYou've also somehow mistaken me saying that rich people are the problem for saying rich people are the scalpers. That was not what I was saying. I'm saying there are enough rich people that scalpers can be profitable which is at its core the problem. I don't support punishing the rich for being stupid with money or for being rich. I support making it impossible for the parasites to exist.",

Sure, the motherboard and case are proprietary and pretty junky, but Steve GN had pretty good things to say about the Dell 4090 and you could just as easily move the 14900KF, RAM, and SSD over to your own build and probably come out on top.\n\nI gave up on getting a 5090 for now and just went for this Alienware instead. Managed to wrangle a student discount, too, which brought the price down to $2600 + tax. I probably would have had to spend that on a 5090 anyway, even if I went the route of camping overnight outside a Microcenter.",

It\u2019s a standard case and mobo, etc so it\u2019s all swappable anyway.\n\nMy only real limitation is they left exactly enough length behind the radiator for what looks like a FE 4090 with a three fan cooler, so I probably can\u2019t fit most of the new cards without changing cases and/or reverting to air for CPU cooling. Since I\u2019d probably upgrade to a Ryzen anyway at the same time, it\u2019s all been upside for me.",

The simplest way around that is to have the seller raise the price and price out scalpers. But everyone loses their shit when that happens for some silly reason.

If Nvidia was absorbing the extra money from pricing higher originally they could also scale down prices faster as demand drops because they are hitting their margins quicker. But they can't because the hit they would take to their to image isn't worth it and if they did this consumers would see no reason to buy at the high price knowing it will drop. I.e consumer behavior is not optimal for maximizing profit in the space and to do so would likely result in lower profits. Right now the scalpers eat the brunt of the hate and NVIDIA likes that. \n\nAlthough the consumer argument is why would they drop prices if they can sell at 4k they will just never drop them and the issue is they have severely less demand at that market price and eventually they are just leaving money on the table for no reason that no business savvy investor is ever going to be okay with.

Economics & supply and demand are still a thing, right?\n\nKinda, but supply and demand has two parts and you're only really considering part of that equation\n\n40 series production has already ended, so probably not really. Sure, the demand dries up when the new gen releases, but so does the supply\n\nWhether the price drop therefore depends on which dries up first. Chances are it will be hard to get hold of a 50 series card, so there will still be demand for the 40 series and prices probably won't drop massively.\n\nIt's possible that there are enough 50 series cards to go around in which case sure, the 40 series cards could drop in price a little as retailers try to offload their inventory... but I think this is probably the less likely scenario and if it does happen it won't be for long, or probably by huge amounts\n\nIf retailers had loads of cards lying around then yeah, prices would drop sharply... but I doubt many retailers are gonna be sitting on a pile of them",

My point is that the PROBLEM with scalpers is largely contributed to by massive numbers of gamers desperate to address \"is my number bigger\" as opposed to \"does it impact my game performance and experience\"\n\nThose are people continually willing to pay above market prices to have the latest and greatest because it's new Shiney, not because they are filling the need.\n\n\nTo that, my point still stands, as i didn't claim i have the highest fps.\nI stated that I run every game on Max with no performance hindrances \n\nI worked for a mobile IT company in a major city for almost 2 years right when the 3000 series came out and them immediately after the 4000 series, and I can't tell you how many calls I had to swap out perfectly good 2080s in exchange for 3080s and then even had some return customers that hadn't even utilized the 3000s have me swap out for 4000s.\n\nI was able to take home a number of 1070s, 1080s, 2070s, 2080s and 2080tis from these people who were convinced they HAD to have the newest or their games wouldn't work well. I gave em all out to people who had way older, shittier cards who played games on my discord, and everyone I gave upgrades to are having fun playing games on higher settings now, and having a blast, without wingeing over \"i can't game without a new 5080ti\n\nAnd myself on a 2080ti as well as the others that still run em that I play with all look at the newer cards and drool over how cool it would be, but everyone has discussed this each time a new card comes out, and pretty much everyone agrees, there's no game with graphics so intense that we're over here struggling to run at max graphics. (For the 2080tis at least) \n\nAnd games have such varied art styles that even the 2070s are unaffected most games",
