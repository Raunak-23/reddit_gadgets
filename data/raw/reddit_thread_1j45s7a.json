I store some personal documents like tax returns and receipts and contracts in my documents folder, backed up to iCloud because its important stuff. My photos collection is maybe 50GB, but I like sync across devices so its replicated into iCloud anyways. Any media I've downloaded lives on a NAS tucked into a closet in my home but mostly I stream things because I don't have time to curate an offline collection. I don't play games anymore.\n\nBut even most of my programming happens on my work-issued laptop with much larger storage. Whatever toy projects I have going on at home are just toys. Frankly, I want a fast laptop with great battery life and a great screen that is used to run a web browser 98% of the time.\n\nObviously plenty of people benefit from larger storage, particularly people working in media, but I think there's a real argument to be made that Apple only keeps the base storage small because for many of their customers (people like me) its simply a waste to have tons more.",

Its main drawbacks are that it is opinionated and not necessarily open to modification and customization.\n- While Linux distros tend to be open to modification. This always feels like a fragile balance that might break with any update. I think I'm just more accepting here of the fact that I might have to modify things and I have a lot of options to choose from. To begin with.\n- Windows might be the worst. While there is some nice behavior or at least behavior everyone expects by now. There are  also some fundamental things like search and app launching that are incredibly broken. I'm honestly not sure how open windows is to modification, but it feels like I would be doing something forbidden and might just end up with a bunch of malware.\n\n\nI think the most frustrating thing about the MacOS UX is that it could be way better if apple just fixed a lot of small things and apple seems like that company that would care about these things.

I\u2019d say commas are rarely optional, in fact, and are, for the most part, pretty deterministic.\n\nBy the way, regarding the comment I\u2019m replying to, a comma there would be an error, as well (it\u2019s called a \u201c[comma splice](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/punctuation-capitalization/comma-splice/)\u201d). Those are independent clauses (basically two different sentences), and so, they need to be separated by either a period or a semi-colon. I would personally use a semi-colon to make them more closely related.",

I wanted a very portable fanless laptop that could take those workloads and still have a good battery life. Weight and size were priorities since I pretty much exclusively use bicycles to get around once it gets warm enough as that's fastest and most convenient where I live and even a 14\" Pro weighs down a backpack noticeably more. I hardly ever need to bring a charger and if I do need to, I can get away with the tiniest phone charger. That little thing can run compiles on end and barely gets warm (and stays absolutely silent obviously), anything I throw at it (that a laptop can reasonably be expected to handle) it does without a hitch, though a bit more RAM would be nice sometimes. Definitely one of my favorite purchases.",

For very compute-intensive tasks I use a cloud VM where I get a whole lot more horsepowers than any laptop. I was a bit skeptical at first too if the M2 without any cooling could really handle my workloads but then I actually looked at when the CPU hit thermal throttling and it I barely ever did even working it pretty hard (GPU when gaming is a different story, 10-15min and it invariably throttles). The silence from not having a fan is super nice as well.",

A reasonable designer would have only shown 2 models with the RAM as an add on, so it was a really odd choice. \n\nWhen the whole point of the article about the new pricing structure, an old pricing practice is placed next to the relatively well priced upgrade is an interesting and notable fact to point out. \n\nBut no..
