There's a lot of details, but at 50-100 gbps compressed file sizes in the 2040s they require massive amount of storage capacity. On a 512 TB drive it's less than a day of video. Raw data is a whole other beast requiring potentially absurd amounts of temporary storage before encoding. To make these kind of future storage services possible requires that enterprise drives continue to grow rapidly.",

I think the throughput on data transmission was nearing 10GBs and for 10 minutes you needed something like 10TB. I\u2019m sure with a better codex you could get that down but truly immersive video is technically possible but you\u2019ll need a couple Petabytes.\n\nEdit:\nDid some quick math and it would be around 102TB for a 10 minute video but only a 1.2Gbps transfer rate.",

                  "body": "That would be the early glimpses of where this is going. One of the best examples I've seen of this is at the end of [Ready Player One](https://youtu.be/kve9w5LdxZY?t=51) where the protagonist is teleported to a copy of someone's room. It captures the idea that one can be fully immersed in a 1:1 copy of another environment and interact with others.\n\nFor reference, future mixed reality will aim for 16K@240Hz per eye with eye tracking. With edge servers it's possible to stream data over 6G (or later) at near zero latency. So you'd be decoding only a partial viewpoint even if the full video file is multiple PB large and allows you to walk into it. A lot of current 360 lightfield video only encodes a small sphere where moving outside this region causes artifacts due to missing views. Nothing would stop say a 3D film from rendering a lightfield with a multiple meter large view region and bloating the file size immensely.\n\nOn the capture side taken to the extreme, [SPAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode) [event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) should be able to scan the world at sub-millimeter resolution. Static scenes obviously don't cost as much, but when you have a lot of dynamic people even in 2040 it might be quite demanding. One example I've seen is someone livestreaming a busy city street where viewers would feel they're standing next to them. The MR glasses would be encoding all the important changes. (It could even use pose estimation and other analysis to compress people in the scene further reducing the cost. Lot of techniques later should make this not as daunting as it might seem. Microsoft research has a number of papers on this topic).",

If you just rendered field of view, it would be a lot less intensive.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that we really aren\u2019t that far off having this be possible at consumer levels. Probably just another 10ish years out for pixel density and once you essentially pass 14K resolution, there isn\u2019t a need to go further. That\u2019s already peak human vision.",
