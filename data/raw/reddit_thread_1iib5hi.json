This makes the process 1000x easier as the glue sets in about 5 seconds, which gives you time to angle it properly. Once it sets, its like a rock.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VHYRGA?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1\nI also used some copper polish to make the pipes bling\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B019EGBVH6?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2&th=1\n\nsystem details. \nhttps://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/toms-hardware-member-system-gallery.1285475/page-197#post-22957870\n\nWhile my case is bigger, i managed to squeeze 3 radiators in there, so you can run that 4090 full speed for days and not worry about the water getting much over ambient.",

It would be hard to make mine steam punky since it was designed around the case its in; It had to go together in a very specific order to even get the lid on. So even if you took the side panel off, you wouldn't see much, since there is a massive rad right there. The reason i have the fittings i do inside the case was they are swivel, so it allowed me to make the angles i needed. With out that, it could never be put together, you were often times putting something in on a angle and then lining the pipe up as it went in, so the fitting had to move as it was going in. \n\nIf i had a ton of money, i could build my own from scratch. I always wanted to build a case where the case was the radiator. Basically using the copper tubing as structural elements; So basically it would be a 'open air' case like his, probably a little larger since for functionality you want to use larger tubing (g1/4 fittings are 9.5mm so using 6mm od creates a lot of head pressure and lowers contact time which will yield less performance.",
