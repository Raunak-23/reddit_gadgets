They've basically just privatised the last one, and this is one of the attempts to make it look like things are better when actually the price has risen immensely, we're almost certainly losing weekend collections and deliveries and the 2nd class service (to \"reduce costs\", even though those were listed as one of their universal service obligations).\n\nIt's a gimmick.  A bit like the recent stories about BT repurposing their cabinets to be electric car chargers.  They planned / pitched for investment for 60,000 such locations.  They converted one, made a big fuss about it on the news, and then immediately ditched the entire scheme.",

This new box will enable the people of the Ulverston Road area to post letters, post-cards and small packages without recourse to the Esher Road box or to the box outside the post office at Turner\u2019s Parade which many people used to use, but which has now been discontinued owing to the opening of this box and also the re-organization of box distribution throughout the whole area, which comes into force with the opening of new boxes at the Wyatt Road Post Office in July.",
