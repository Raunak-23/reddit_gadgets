The clamping connector itself would need to be pretty beefy and would be expensive to manufacture but could ensure a much stronger connection, therefore reducing the risks of unbalanced resistance. \n\nThe whole thing would also look ugly, and 12 gauge wires aren't easy to bend tightly, which would make small form factor builds much more difficult to do.",

The whole point is that these quick fixes ended up helping only up to a point, not really addressing the causes. Mandating these fixes and making the PSUs more complicated when they're not at fault doesn't make for good standards.",

They were not originally designed to supply the current required by these graphics cards.\n\n600 watts at 12v is 50 amps. Each pin in the connector is rated for a MAX of 13 amps, according to the datasheets for these connectors and the crimps within them. 4 pins are sharing that 50 amp load each bearing 12.5 amps! (4 for positive and 4 for negative)\n\nIt only takes one of those connector crimps to not be in full contact with the receiving pins for the remaining pins to have to take up that extra load, which puts them into overload straight away.\n\nEven with tighter fitting crimps with longer sleeves, it only takes a slight misalignment to mess your day up. Add to that the DIY element to many of these builds, they really are not fit for this purpose anymore.\n\nBest practice is to push fit the connector into place, then wire by wire, gently push each wire in 1 by 1 to the fitted connector to ensure every pin / crimp is fully inserted and in full contact with the receiving pin. Mistakes i see often is the plastic connector housing is clicked in securely but the crimp is only 2/3rds the way down onto the pin.\n\nI believe Super Sabre or Mega-Fit connectors by Molex should be used, but what do i know.\n\nEdited to add: the 12VHPWR *is utter dog shit. and is no better than a Micro-fit.*",

They\u2019ll warm up (sometimes a lot) but they\u2019ll take the full GPU current. \n\nThe Minitek Pwr 3.0 connector family and how it\u2019s used is the issue here - the rated 12V2+2 spec pushes the pins inside the housing almost right to their rated max spec, unlike the old PCIe triple 8-pin setup these GPUs would\u2019ve used a few generations back. \n\nThis is theoretically fine - each pin is at or below rating, assuming each carries the _same_ share of the current the card draws. \n\nAnd what you assume makes an ass outta u and me.\n\nIn practice, the contact resistance between pins varies somewhat, and the power rail on the card just busses all the pins together. As a result, a pin that doesn\u2019t _quite_ seat as well as its neighbours doesn\u2019t pull its weight. \n\nThis is an issue because of how close to the limit the spec has been written. There is no real tolerance for any missing or high resistance pin.\n\nThe remaining pins now pass more current and heat up more, until eventually one pin exceeds its rating, overheats under load, and melts the connector around it. Its resistance increases dramatically, the next pin overheats, and pretty soon your GPU either quits or catches fire at the power connector.\n\nBut hey, at least 12V2+2 is smaller than three 8-pin PCIe power connectors\u2026",

Surely the \u201cfoolproof\u201d part of the cable is simply allowing the user to visually confirm their connector is funnily inserted into the GPU (rather than partially inserted). In that, it is foolproof. If you don\u2019t see yellow, you can be assured that the cable was fully inserted. \n\nBut we know that incomplete insertions aren\u2019t the sole reason for melting cables so I\u2019m not sure what the headline is trying to say? 5090 cables are melting because of imbalanced loads creating higher than expected current and heat concentrating on 1 or 2 cables, causing them to potentially overheat and melt. \n\nNo part in the chain is able to dynamically correct if this begins to happen because Nvidia has designed these cards to be incapable of doing so (read: enshitification). The closest anyone can get now is the Asus Astral line which per pin monitoring that can at least alert an owner if there is a load imbalance with a warning on the computer. But that can\u2019t fix the balance or prevent damage. Just give you a heads up so you can save your system in a worst case scenario. If you aren\u2019t around for the alert under load, the cable can melt there too. \n\nSo yes, cables can melt whether \u201cfoolproof\u201d connectors or not. Because the connectors were never the single point of blame. You can seat any cable properly and an unknown load imbalance extreme enough can produce this result.",
