But can you think for even a second about why they would want chatgpt on a roaming theme park robot? A company as ruthlessly dedicated to the image and branding of their characters isn't going to use chatbots on *robots that don't even have to talk*.\n\nAlso, this isn't even the point. Seemingly the only reason people like OP think there would be LLMs is because AI was mentioned, even though that's just a single very specific application of this extremely vague term. If you have some other reason for believing they're going to use LLMs for random unspeaking Star wars droids, by all means share.\n\nYour entire conspiracy is basically just \"article said AI\" and \"Disney sus\". No shit on both counts, that's not an excuse to turn your brain off.",
