The internet works the same way, this is known as a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS).\n\nSome companies want to prevent such scenarios and not get their name dragged through the media mud.

Most users of this type of low end home router don\u2019t understand that they are affected even if you put it on the front pages.\n\nThe DSL-6740C is a combination DSL modem and router that was released in 2013. Most people have no reason to replace their network equipment every 10 years, especially DSL modems generally only get replaced when ISPs deprecate them and issue new ones, or the customer switches to an ISP that issues another one or the customer changes from DSL to fiber.\n\nISPs replacing outdated customer network gear happens mostly in the West. These devices were only sold outside the U.S. (which is also probably why D-Link doesn\u2019t give a fuck).\n\nMost of them are in Taiwan - the primary military target of a large country notoriously known for carrying out cyber attacks, and probably the largest budget allocated to hostile activities by the State.\n\nYes, Taiwanese ISPs should replace the devices asap. But in the meantime D-Link should publish a patch so at least people have a chance to protect themselves.\n\nFrom a D-Link consumer POV, if you bought a router 11 years ago that suddenly fucked you up and D-Link refused to prevent it. Would you ever buy their products again?",

If companies are going to adopt a policy of not providing support for critical flaws like this past the technical end of life date, they REALLY need to make it a matter of course to issue maybe a final, optional patch that allows people to install open source firmware on the router - if that isn't already the case. If a router is perfectly usable, save for one critical security flaw, and the open source community is able to issue a simple security patch to fix it, they should be able to.\n\n\nI appreciate the answer to the second point - and the reason it'll probably never happen is \"but then people would buy fewer routers and any goodwill brand loyalty as a result will be outweighed by the loss of new sales\".",

Any required patches to allow such modifications could be made available the day before EOL if you want to be really black and white anal about what EOL actually means.",

If you buy a product that relies on regular updates from the manufacturer to function/stay secure, you should be able to modify it after end of life so if anyone wants to patch security holes/maintain operability, they're able to.\n\n\nShould apply to phones, computers, smart devices, routers, everything.\n\n\nIt's such an obvious step towards sustainability, but - as I already acknowledged - it doesn't suit the business model of iterative hardware upgrades to sell at EOL.\n\n\nSo it'll never happen at any significant scale.",

It's why even open source hardware eventually goes EOL because there's no one that is updating it.\n\n\nSure you could choose to download source and update it yourself but in reality, it's simply easier and more practical to buy newer, faster, updated hardware.\n\n\nRouter firmware is a perfect example. Although in theory there's so many routers that dd-wrt, tomato, etc support, if you have a really old router, chances are the newest versions of the firmware aren't stable. Because no one is testing and fixing issues that affect that hardware due to the handful of devs working on it. So in the end, you're stuck on old firmware anyway and if there is a security flaw, you're equally screwed as this scenario.\n\n\nMy point is, open source doesn't automatically make something useful past it's EOL. Someone has to find it worthwhile to keep the device alive by supporting it xontinuously. And unfortunately devices that get support are generally the higher end enthusiast devices with more CPU, RAM and features that someone wants to keep alive.",

And obviously security patches are a ton less work than full system version upgrades.\n\n\n2) I can't hold anyone responsible for the fact this perfectly functional device is no longer reliable, from a security perspective.
