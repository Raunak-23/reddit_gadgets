          "body": "Yeah but it's a pretty simple device. If you want the ability to open the garage door using your phone you will either need a bridge or a smart garage door opener. The problem is that software and hardware standards update regularly. Throw in security updates and you can see why products end up being outdated quite rapidly.\u00a0\n\n\nAlso your garage door opener probably has poor security that wouldn't be tolerated in a modern iot product. For all of the old garage door openers I can create a copy of their remote effectively granting me access to most garages in America. If a iot product had that sort of vulnerability consumers would be upset.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's the security updates and WiFi standards that messes with things. I had a wireless camera installed that only worked on 2.4ghz or whatever it was. Somehow we had a WiFi router installed that only supported 5 GHz or whatever. That essentially forced the installed camera to be useless.",

Of course I doubt most of them switched instantly and if you have a remote where you can set the code then you are definitely not using a rolling code version. For the older style that don't have rolling codes you can definitely create a bridge using a radio box. Assuming you mean to have phone control of your door.\u00a0\n\n\nAlthough honestly I bet most garage door openers have a hardwired input meant to be connected to a switch on the inside. You can connect that to a smart switch which could then be connected to your router.\u00a0",

HVAC - already done mostly, garage doors, lights - also done or simple to do.\nMaybe a window blind or two, garden watering, presence detection. Thats it. \n\nThe non obvious automations are already there since ages. Microwaves, fridges/freezers are automated since always. \n\nThe really non obvious automations has been outsourced. Remember jetsons and the robot cleaning dishes or cooking meals? Yup. frozen pizza, bags of buns and bread, blocks of cheese, canned and jared food. That is all that robot. But not at home, its in the factory. That is home automation outsourced.\n\nPretty obvious, right?\n\nMy point is: There is not much to automate at home now. Literally few classes of things, most of that is on/off/status plus very simple if this then that - usually less than 3-4 conditions each.\n\nThat means building it is very, very simple and opensource can do that. And there are projects which does that. \n\nThe issue is: Vendors are scared of that and they put a ton of money to convince you that their cloud is needed. They make things which have literally just one reset button and very obscure ways to hook up the device to their cloud. That is intentional. But I think soon we will popularize the open source alternatives.\n\nThe required element is: People's/Customers awareness. Education about how to manage your own stuff.

          "body": "Great in theory - difficult in practice. Products are sold over multiple years, and while at the start of their sale time period the manufacturer knows what security standards need to be met, 5 years later those have evolved a lot, and the hardware may no longer be capable of doing the new requirements. These new regulations develop quicker than the hw/sw product lifecycle. \n\nOn top of that, if manufacturers need to legally say what they can support, and they don\u2019t know all the variables, the company\u2019s legal team is going to be conservative as possible and only guarantee support over the stated warranty period, unless they have invented a crystal ball. Just look at how everyone responded to the UK PSTI act last year. \n\nOn top of those - consumer hardware products are often \u201cin market\u201d for much longer than a company can control due to distribution pipelines (ie you buy something on Amazon and not direct from the manufacturer.) \n\nSo while it would be ideal to do this - you need a lot of folks working together - law makers, regulatory bodies, and manufacturers in tight conjunction. It\u2019s hard to get everyone rowing in the same direction quickly, as different countries have different laws, and the same exact product is sold in many countries and needs to meet all of those individual country regulations. \n\nTl:dr buy IoT products from established companies that have historically offered long support, and when you\u2019re in the market buy the latest and greatest not the cheaper last years model - it\u2019ll save you money and headaches in the long term.",

Totally agree with your TL;DR though, sticking to reputable brands and newer models is the safest bet right now while all these pieces (hopefully) come together.",
