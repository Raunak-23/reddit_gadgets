But I don't think most people would want to spend this much on a computer and then run into limitations of what you can do because it doesn't run a more feature complete operating system like Windows or Mac OS.",

Small screen for the form factor, low-end camera, it would overheat during calls and grind to a halt if I tried to present anything. It had \"Intel i7\" CPU so it should be capable, right? Nope, that was just a deceptive marketing, as i7-7Y75 is on par with i3-7100U when it comes to performance. I would often choose \"Gmail Basic HTML\" because even the standard Gmail webapp could be laggy. I do not miss it.",

ChromeOS seems more for the simpler stuff like browsing and using some AI and ChatGPT, maybe playing some light games, and working across the Google Workspace (which I mostly use for work, it's great). Overall, a device for someone who wants something simpler for work and can do so within its limits.\n\nAnd I don't really need that, but for those so who do, it looks good enough. I haven't really heard of heating issues or battery issues in this one, but one issue is that the speakers are not up to the mark compared to the rest of the hardware. It's portable and comfortable to carry too. It's great that they used an OLED screen, not super bright for working outside, but solid otherwise. The camera isn't a highlight, but Chromebooks aren't camera-centric devices anyway. As for performance - the Kompanio Ultra SoC is fast and smooth, and UFS4 and 256 storage are good, the essentials for good performance have been given.\n\nThe battery is a highlight, I've heard it lasts almost a full day of work, and some overnight.\n\nThey could've given microSD, but the headphone jack is there at least :)\n\nI wouldn't have minded something like this in Uni.\n\n  \nedit- grammar",

      "body": "from the moment you see its sleek design and vibrant 14-inch OLED screen, you know it\u2019s something special. The display\u2019s sharp 1920x1200 resolution paired with a 16:10 aspect ratio makes working, streaming, or just browsing really enjoyable - everything looks crisp and colorful. What\u2019s impressive is how smooth this Chromebook runs with Mediatek chip inside. I wasn\u2019t expecting the kind of performance that feels close to high-end Intel or AMD machines, but it handles multitasking with ease and stays cool without a noisy fan. The battery life is a bonus, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use, which makes it perfect for students or professionals on the go.\n\nThe keyboard and overall build quality feel premium without the bulk, and little touches like the fingerprint sensor and Dolby Atmos support add to the experience. Plus, AI powered features Lenovo rolled out make managing tabs and projects way easier. So yeah, plus 14 strikes a great balance of power, portability, and style... definitely worth checking out if you want a smooth and premium ChromeOS experience.",
