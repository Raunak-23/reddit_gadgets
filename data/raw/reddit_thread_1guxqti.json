I can get behind that I also don't like that idea. Are you saying no cause you think it's not possible/never gonna happen? That's the direction most of the tech industry is heading in. There are plenty of web based services right now for 'renting hardware' to run things at home. The power users and hobbyists are just that. We will keep home compute alive, and pay a lot more for it, cause it's what we do. It doesn't change the trend for the regular consumer and companies pushing for everything as a service. I know I'm going to get downvotes for this, for those who understand that I'm on your side. I hate this trend too.",
