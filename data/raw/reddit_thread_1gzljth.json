                      "body": "Tariffs do not do that, period. The company doesn\u2019t pay the import tax when production is overseas, the consumer does. If fewer people buy the products because they\u2019re too expensive with this tax, the company reduces production or goes out of business, they don\u2019t just move production here and spend billions on upfront costs only to still sell the products at a significantly higher price because US wages are much higher, people still just won\u2019t buy it.\n\nThe only thing this does is hurt our own businesses without incentivizing anything. If you  to bring production back to the US you need to provide incentives and tax breaks to subsidize the increased costs of producing here, not just raise the prices to import. The only time raising prices like tariffs can be effective is if we already have an existing well developed industry in the US **first** and we want to prevent a huge influx of cheap foreign versions. \n\nFor example, solar panels are largely build here or in NA at large, China has recently started trying to flood the market with cheap low quality panels making it hard to compete. Mild tariffs are effective here because the industry already exists and there\u2019s an attempt to undercut it through anticompetitive means. This is why Biden added tariffs to solar panels and it helped protect our existing industry.\n\nOn the other hand, looking at semiconductors, we had no significant industry here to support them. No supply chains built up, nothing. If we had enacted tariffs on foreign semi-conductors, we would still have just that, nothing. If we had however, like Trump wants to, all of our consumer electronics would be significantly more expensive. Instead, we used taxes to incentivize companies to come build production here through the chips act (supported almost exclusively down party lines by the Dems with only a few GOP signing on). We are now on track to be the 2nd largest producer of semiconductors and produce the 2nd most advanced semiconductors, behind Taiwan. This is why Biden chose to use the chips act to bring people here rather than a tariff to just raise prices.\n\nIt seems like most people don\u2019t understand how tariffs work or what their purpose is. Your comment exemplifies that. Tariffs have never and will never work to incentivize local industry. All they do is permanently raise prices. \n\nYou say it should just be a \u201cmomentary pain\u201d but that\u2019s not what a tariff does. If for example if it costs $10 to produce something locally (shipping and everything included) vs $5 to do so overseas, putting tariffs on it to make it $10 to produce overseas isn\u2019t going to bring anything stateside and there\u2019s no reason the pain would be temporary, it doesn\u2019t magically reduce the costs of producing locally which was the core issue to begin with. It also costs billions to try and move production and supply chains meaning even at cost parity, nothing is going to move. It would have to be so cost ineffective to produce overseas that it\u2019s worth throwing away billions to recreate supply chains, all of that cost is going to be absorbed by the consumer in the form of even further price increases after moving stateside to get a return on the investment, at no point will the prices ever go back down.",

Could that be caused by deflation? Sure, but it typically isn\u2019t.\n\nAnd no, tariffs from the last Trump admin are not anywhere comparable to these. These are general tariffs, not targeted, meaning everything we import will be hit.\n\nHere\u2019s how it\u2019ll work:\n\n1.\t\u2060Trump implements tariffs across the board, causing everything with an external supply chain to spike in price.\n2.\t\u2060Trump starts is immigration crusade, causing massive amounts of labor to vanish in key sectors, like food production.\n3.\t\u2060Since we\u2019re at historically low unemployment, almost none of those vacancies are filled, and those that are will be paid a lot more. But still there\u2019s a supply shortage now due to the decreased productivity.\n4.\t\u2060These two things cause huge amounts of inflation in several areas key to the budget of common Americans, one most notable is food.\n5.\t\u2060The extra money being shelled out for basic shit, and the higher prices anyway, cause Americans to buy fewer widgets.\n6.\t\u2060Companies will slow their production to meet the new demand, increase prices more to save their margins as well.\n7.\t\u2060Since production is now way lower, those companies will now perform mass layoffs both because they don\u2019t need the labor right now and it\u2019s another way to improve their margins.\n8.\t\u2060These layoffs cause even more constriction and this becomes very cyclical.\n\nNow the unfortunate thing is that Trump is a terrible leader who only cares about his image. Since this will be his fault, he\u2019ll lie about it and deflect instead of intervening like the government normally does.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, there will be enough of the \u201cdeep state\u201d, aka \u201cthe adults\u201d, to prevent that cycle from going too far.\n\nBut either way, it\u2019s all on you.

You aren't a neo-con if you sarcastically point out how voting for Trump is going to negatively impact the finances of those who voted for him in ways they likely don't understand. You're casting a pretty wide net, but it's full of holes. You won't catch many fish with a holey net, only red herrings... But I expect you know that.\n\nBeing intrinsically aware of how the world works and why Trump's policies will impact us financially (despite not voting for his fascist rapey ass) and using that to shine a light or joke at conservative's expense just means we are aware and informed about it. It doesn't espouse a specific political leaning in and of itself. It says way more about Trump voters being idiots than it does about liberals suddenly becoming neo-cons. \n\nI would expect liberals are far more aware of how poor a decision it was to elect Trump, and his toxic swamp back into power, with regards to his stated policies  (especially tariffs and deportations) than the majority of people who voted for him. And that's sad.\n\nHave a wonderful Thanksgiving.",

This makes it so more laws and regulations are written and enforced more locally. This is completely contradictory to a fascist. They want more centrally located power, all laws are made at or near the top.\u00a0\n\n\nI'm not arguing against any of the rest of your post just the use of that word to describe the Trump government would be inaccurate. Recommend words like egocentric. Being the people in power are people he admires and wants them to reflect that opinion.\n\n\nI know it's easy to use words that we know to try and reflect on the current situation because I don't believe there has ever been a political ideology similar to that being represented currently.\n\n\nIf you need examples of anti fascist policies, I\u00a0can work on a list, but an easy one is the fact that they are talking about dismantling govt agencies, or roe v wade being overturned and power returned to a state level. I'm not arguing in favor of any of this simply showing this is opposite fascist policy.\u00a0",

My statement is that this current trumpian political movement/group would need a different title than fascism, and I use the trumpian title for lack of a better name because there isn't one yet that I know of. It's defintly a right movement that focuses on removing protections and policies enforced at a central federal level and passes these policies off as liberating, but there are more than this because that alone would be libertarian. It's a cross between so many different political parties mostly on the right. The thing that most people can agree on is that the fascist party resulted in the abuse of its people and this is not good (aside from people who actually identify as neo fascist/nazi). So people throw around the lable of facist as an insult, but doing so is dangerous because it expands the definition to the point of not meaning what it really means, and becomes such an obtuse word that it nearly has no meaning.",

I think most gamers can all agree on that point. But you arent going to win any arguments by saying Mario has been stagnant. \n\nThey literally innovate with every console, sometimes multiple times. The number of spinoff games that are more than just platformers is staggering. RPGs, racing, sports, party, adventure, fighting... They have almost every genre with Mario in it and they are all highly polished and fun, yet somehow intrinsically still \"Mario\"... \n\nHow can you possibly say Mario has been the \"same shit for 40 years\"? What, do you want him to get different color overalls? Mario literally HASN'T been the same shit since the 80s. They created Mario Kart and Mario RPG on the SNES in the 90s...

The Dual Sense Edge only got a second color now with the 30th anniversary, where basically every accessory for the PS5 got a limited edition color. Most of those accessories were only available in one color variant outside that brief window of a few minutes in October. The main controller for the Switch, the joycon, has a bunch of colors available, just like the standard Series controller and Dual Sense controller have a bunch of colors.\n\nAside from all that, Nintendo has allowed licensing of their tech to several reputable third party manufacturers, allowing controllers to be made by outside sources without making them unusable at a whim (as has been done by Microsoft with third party fighting game controllers). There are countless color variants available that way, many even with Nintendo characters. Acting like there\u2019s no choice but a single black controller for the Switch is a dumb take, full stop. Why does it matter if Hori is the one making a particular controller if it works for the Switch, is officially licensed, has Mario on it, and is even sold on Nintendo\u2019s website?",

Also, doing that is what Nintendo is pretty much best at, when you look at most of the Switch exclusives.\n\nAnother point: The OLED version of the 1 is by far the best iteration, and it's often the case that the original versions of any console are rather bad compared to the revisions coming out a year or two later.",

The screen is oriented horizontally on the Switch. There is not enough space to put two emulated screens one on top of another even on the OLED Switch to match the size of the original 3DS, let alone the original Switch or the Lite. Text would be unreadable and games would be unplayable. Aside from all that, while there are games that can be set up to not work in handheld mode, I\u2019m pretty sure Nintendo has a policy that requires docked play to work.\n\nLook at how terrible the ports of DS family games that utilized the second screen extensively are, such as Pokemon BDSP or The World Ends With You.

They need electrical activity to detect stuff, which is why styluses for tablets like the Apple Pencil have to be charged, and why if you do something like tap a nail on a screen nothing happens (whereas any object could be used for the DS family). I agree it\u2019s a loss. A fingertip doesn\u2019t have the exactness of a stylus, but most people don\u2019t have powered styluses. Something like trying to draw maps in an Etrian Odyssey game just doesn\u2019t work as well with a capacitative screen (or drawing other stuff. One of my kids used to spend countless hours in AC Happy Home Designer designing clothes and furniture and stuff).\n\nThat reviewer you linked to really doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about anyway. You can play DS games pixel perfect on a 3DS by pressing select as you open a game and color is highly individual between screens.",

I predict(!) that it will have the same type of processor as before, with actually the same number of graphics cores and nvidia instruction set additions as the previous one. But that it will feature additional power-sinks in a post-processing filter that will \"AI\"-magically smear the source up to a higher resolution stage.\n\nNintendo no doubt is not surpremely confident about this product, but think it might have some appeal to make the Switch still viable and popular. And that it will push more 3rd parties to want to develop and launch their games, also newer games, on the switch.\n\nThis is a terrible idea - because no one buys a premium switch to play low detail PC-games. What you buy a Switch for is for the same reason people bought a ps3 - to play the in-house developed games, on the interesting hardware and the capabilities that it offered. And nothing else. It was the same with the ps2, never mind every single Nintendo product: no one bought a SNES to play ported games. You didn't buy a ps2 to play a low-res port. You bought the SNES to play the in-house developed games with the black box processors, just as that you bought the ps2 to play SoTC or similar games. \n\nNo one who aren't already super Nintendo fans are going to buy this. But what would make people buy one is if they developed another Zelda-game that didn't play like they've ran it through every focus-group they could find. Tears of the Kingdom, for example - how the hell did that even happen? It's like a Hollywood movie that was written by committee, with the explicit purpose of placating every possible movie-goer, ever. With the result that it has no identity, and that it has about the same impact as a styrofoam tennis-ball. And the sad part is that the game underneath that is actually really good.\n\nStop giving the reins to the US office, Nintendo. Just do your own thing.

Your argument so far is that someone will buy a switch because they have nothing else, and would not buy a new console, and can't afford one -- but they would nevertheless buy a switch premium plus console, and pay a premium on the game prices as well, just to play multiplatform games. With the prices on other consoles being what it is, you would then field a switch 2 as an upgrade, but one that costs significantly less than an older ps5 or xbawks(while those still completely outmatch the graphics on the switches on the multiplatform games).\n\nThat only makes sense to you if your name is Michael Pachter. But to anyone else, this is an internally inconsistent argument. An argument that obviously contradicts itself.\n\nSo your argument really is that \"this is my opinion, and it is correct because I say so, in spite of no one possibly thinking this way\". And I really do find it fascinating if someone actually holds that opinion without being hired by Nintedo USA to have it, for a reason that they genuinely think makes sense.\n\nSo far, you don't seem to have that.",

But it will have \n\nb) the same, or a very similar, core configuration as the Switch when it comes to the extended nvidia instruction set (the Tegra does not have a \"gpu\" in the traditional sense - it has embedded instruction sets on the extended \"cortex\" area, next to the \"cpu\"-cores).\n\nc) however, there will no doubt be additional streaming processor cores that will be exclusively used for upscaling.\n\nd) this will be sold, however, by Nintendo USA and Reggie as an upgrade - in spite of it being no such thing from the point of view of what's actually used to generate the in-game scene and graphics complexity in it.\n\ne) A large element of this successful sale will be that the chipset will of course draw a lot more watts than the Switch's 15W - and therefore a great deal of enthusiasts will be very enthusiastic about it. As more watts clearly means more success and graphics power and shit.\n\nWhy can I make such a specific prediction, you ask, without even having as much as three uncles working at Nintendo? Because this is how a great deal of hardware upgrades have been done on not just all of the console-\"upgrades\" that have been pushed lately - but also how the mobile sphere in general keeps \"upgrading\" their hardware. \n\nSo if you're a Nintendo guy who wants to add some steam to the portfolio, but have no idea about how hardware works, or even what makes your platform a good one, or what makes it interesting to customers (and you ask Pachter for advice or something) -- you will genuinely be taken in by this bs and you will think that this is a good method to \"upgrade\" your platform.\n\nWhat they /could/ be doing, of course, would be to extend the Tegra project and develop exclusively for it. We're talking realistic wave-simulations, mesh-deformation, and so on, that really has only been seen on the first Tegra launch demos. They could partner with nvidia and develop the libraries they have for CUDA acceleration, and work with them to make a more generic framework (that could be translated to gpgpu-contexts) for real-time graphics and cpu resubmit-concepts running on very few Mhz - basically reintroducing to the mobile sphere the type of \"graphics\"(that is OpenCL/intense cpu resubmits/advanced math that you cannot run on dedicated gpus without heavy penalties, even with BAR) that we were promised and shown when the ION and Tegra precursors were first demoed in 2006.\n\nBut whatever hahahaha",
