It makes sense. I'm honestly shocked how close to handling modern games they are on systems like the Steamdeck and Steamdeck OLED.\n\nComparing it to just how far from a console experience the PSP and PSVita were when they came out, the gap is slightly smaller, I would say, for modern consoles compared to Steamdeck.",

They don't have any track record of releasing consecutive consoles on any kind of regular time like and they don't operate with the intent to compete against the other console manufacturers so trying to suggest a release lineup to compete is pointless. \n\nI'm not going to assume a deck 2 is even happening at all until it does, much less try to guess a time window.\n\nIf steam deck 2 does happen, then I'll make assumption on a steam deck 3, until then everything I've seen from valve tells me not to get my hopes up until they actually announce something.",

If there's a customer out there who loves what Sony has to offer, but really only wants to buy in if they can switch between portable and docked, there's a $600 bundle with the PS5 + Portal that satisfies that customer.\n\nThe \"PS5P\" would exist **solely** to cater to the customer who fits the above criteria and *also* wants to take their handheld out of the house on a regular basis (where remote streaming would not be a viable option). Based on both Switch and Steam Deck user behavior I'm not convinced that latter demographic is meaningful in size, or at least meaningful enough to make a dent on sales where the former group wouldn't. The Portal already captures the majority of the handheld demographic, the \"PS5P\" just grows it slightly more to cover that final sliver.",
