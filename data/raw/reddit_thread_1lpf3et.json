I certainly didn't rush out to get one after I got stung by having purchased a Wii U.  I think I waited maybe a year or two before I bought the Switch.\n\nThe Wii U's issue was partly software.  You weren't going to know how the Switch software support was going to pan out just from its launch.  Not long after its launch, they started having slam dunks for Nintendo Directs showing all the new upcoming software they were coming out with at the time and I feel like that's when things really started to snowball and the last assurance was out there for people... that yeah, they're working on some *good* shit and they're going to be keeping us busy for a while.\n\nIronically, the failure of the Wii U was a blessing in disguise because that opened up a ton of opportunity for Switch ports of the better Wii U games that relatively nobody played because they didn't buy the Wii U, so Nintendo at one point was *pumping* shit out between regular releases and ports and it made the Switch look very attractive for a lot of people.  They don't have the same luxury for the Switch 2.  It's backwards compatible, they got all those ports out of their system from the Wii U, and it's much more capable in hardware... so it's going to be a little weirder in terms of software support this time around, at least in theory anyway.",

                              "body": "   I think the co-issue that makes the higher prices harder to swallow is that quality isn't strictly increasing with price. With so many games trying to offer more without considering the quality of what's added, lots of gamers including myself are falling back to more refined packages. Take Monster Hunter Wilds: I didn't  buy it because with the demo, the writing was on the wall and I knew it wasn't going to run on PC. Instead I went and tried Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for the first time, costing me roughly $15 for the biggest and debatebly best MH game ever made.\n\n\n   Whether or not it's \"fair\" to compare older more updated titles to newer experiences is an important debate to have, but when considering what matters most to consumers, I dont think it ultimately matters. Games used to run better, still looked good if not better (Iceborne looks better than Wilds, sue me), were cheaper at release and are faaaaar cheaper now, often were more experimental and/or fun, and we have a huge stockpile of untouched games to choose from. If triple A were pushing boundaries *in a way that truly benefits the consumer more than it hurts them*, then asking more money for it is completely fair. However, I don't think that's the scenario we find ourselves in, and I think it's a wound that triple A publishers and studios inflicted to themselves.",

Your criticism of my argument falls flat.\n\nI\u2019m sure Skyrim moved a few Switch units as well, back in 2017.\n\nAnd I stand by my point that it is a substantial upgrade. Metroid Prime Remastered was also a substantial upgrade (it looks like a game that belongs on PS4) and that game made no major changes besides the visuals.",

Sincerely glad you got one!  Yes, I tried walking in stores, and yes, I've gone online to all four stores and checked their stock somewhat regularly.  I'm not going to download twitter for this shit.  Again, my point is that it shouldn't be this hard.  Nintendo could have sold directly to consumers (at retail) before supplying stock to retailers (at wholesale).   It's a bad system that encourages scalping, and I'm sick to death of it.",

Well, it\u2019s the Switch 2, so it should play every Switch 1 games faster. But the point remains: the Switch 2 still only has one exclusive game right now, and that\u2019s not enough to justify buying it. Also, you\u2019re the one with zero reading comprehension. I never said emulation is a competitor to the Switch 2; however, it\u2019s an alternative that can run Switch 1 games faster. It\u2019s a counterargument to your reasoning about why people would buy the Switch 2, other than to just play that one exclusive game.",

It\u2019s so childish, so, according to your words I can\u2019t criticise the system I live in because I live in it. Therefore I need to keep my mouth shut. How would society progress if it didn\u2019t criticise the very system we live in? Nintendo is a shitty company, it stomps creative ideas of fans, eliminates any attempt at preserving older, no longer supported game by Nintendo and is an all around price gouger. The systems they make though are stellar and one of a kind, the games are excellent and cater to a huge huge audience.",

It costs more than double of what a Switch 1 costs, and you have to pay on top for the older games to even run better on it, since those performance increases don't even come for free either. Also, most people have already played Zelda and stuff multiple times anyways.\n\nIt's the Switch (1) hype that created these sales. The console itself has nothing really special about it.",
