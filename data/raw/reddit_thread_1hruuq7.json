Its been 10 years for both 4k and OLED technologies. and we have 2k panels for 6 inch smarthpones printed left and right. Is it panel yields? every 50 dollars of discount we have from new panels 1080p IPS es go down 100 dollars.\n\nI hope Xiaomis new monitors keep coming to drag the prices down.",

          "body": "Iirc it was the yields, but specifically the sizes of the mother glass that OLED panels are cut out of and keeping waste down to a minimum.    \n     \nSo yields for OLEDs have been pretty good (for LG, I don\u2019t really kept track of Samsung) but the \u201cproblem\u201d has been the size of the mother glass and how it\u2019s cut.    \n     \nIt\u2019s also why the 83\u201d models are priced so much higher than 77\u201d per\u2026square inch of screen size.     \n     \nLike a pane of mother glass can neatly cut out 3x 65\u201d and 6x 32\u201d panels to keep the \u201clost\u201d glass down to about 90%. Or that same glass can cut out 6x 55\u201d panels.     \n     \nOr you could cut out a single 83\u201d panel and a couple of 27\u201d panels. Or 2 77\u201d panels.     \n     \nThat\u2019s been the problem; the big numbers are in the smart phone sized panels or TV sized panels. It makes sense to prioritize cutting mother glass panels to sell those, while the odd 27\u201d, 32\u201d, 42\u201d sizes are oddly expensive.     \n    \nOnly reason I even looked into it was I found it really odd 42\u201d and 48\u201d OLEDs were so similar in price and so were the 55\u201d and 65\u201d.",

But realistically they\u2019re taking higher color accuracy monitors over the high refresh rate monitors and they\u2019re happy to pay the premium for said color accuracy.     \n      \nThe other is there is still an inherit danger of burn in with OLED. There will always be a risk of burn in, anything Organic (the O in OLED) is going to degrade with time. You can put as many preventative and life extending features but it will eventually happen.    \n    \nThat is always gonna be a problem for mass adoption. MicroLED is gonna be OLED without the burn in but that tech is at least 5 years away (also I read it was 5 years away in 2020 lol).    \n     \nSo, what\u2019s why people were waiting for the 10.5G factories (currently 8.5G) so bigger than 97\u201d OLEDs could be made but more importantly more 27\u201d could be cut at the same time.     \n     \nDon\u2019t know anything else beyond that.   \nIMO LG/Samsung are making more money per mother glass prioritizing TV sizes. If their research suggested they\u2019d make more money selling 27\u201d-32\u201d monitors, you betcha they\u2019d immediately start trying to sell as many as possible.",
