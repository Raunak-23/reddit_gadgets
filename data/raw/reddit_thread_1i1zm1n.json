So we have been seeing a focus on other areas to improve that are less flashy but still nice like more efficient power usage,  cooler temps, bigger memories and storage capacity, more parallel processors,  and better coded features. And if you're really honest with yourself, most consumers probably don't need much more power to meet the demands of what they ask of their devices. unfortunately, companies have built their entire business model off of a new product at a regular basis and it's getting harder and harder to convince people to spend on a new phone and computer every other year",

It's a real boost almost 40-50% from what I have seen vs my 5950x. So I'm going to put away a few bucks a month till I reach the upgrade kit's mark and when I do I will see if they will release a new line of X3D within 6 months from the time I reached the mark, If so then I set a dead-on target to save the last few bucks till I can outright buy the new \"let's it's say the R980x3D @ 6+Ghz\". If it does not release within the next 6 months from my saved mark then I just buy the 9800X3D and get it over with, then turn the 5090x into a game server hosting machine.\n\nWhen every single one of my parts age past their usual lifespan mark I become weary of the sudden death of a part, but not stressed as they are actually easy to repair when you take it to professional repair people that do extremely fine PCB repair on computer components without charging an arm and a leg. Your GPU's DIE can blow up and they will still fix it if they can find a spare or donor DIE. You can throw it against the wall and they might still be able to fix it.\n\nThey are the unsung heroes of PC repair, they give off that vibe like when your dad's got your back when you severely struggle with something and he masters it like an OG.\n\nIt is then at this point that if the parts have started to randomly whisper Memento Mori that I will put away a set amount per month to save for an entirely new PC, when I eventually reach that mark I buy whatever is available at the time and falls into that number of the saved amount regardless of a new CPU or GPU launching that year, unless it's like than 3-4 months away lol, cause that's usually when they start upping the prices on the existing parts to create a fake \"price dropping effect\" that when the new stuff launches the prices drop on the old stuff. I giggle like a goat every time when someone says the prices suddenly dropped on the previous generations. Like my dude... just take a screenshot or use the wayback machine around 2-4 months prior to release and then around a week before release to see the evidence for yourself",

Everyone saw a glitchy graphics effect by now in VR by even simply turning on occlusion techniques like space screen (mirroring effect on reflective surfaces). One eye sees the mirrored image while the other does not. That is even worse with DLSS.\n\nFrame generation doesn't work in VR at all (not knowing a single game which makes it possible to function that function), not even on those which have been injected with UEVR.\n\nAs a VR user, it's the best to stay away from those minor improved 50X0 GPUs, as those are just lifting most of the stuff via AI.",
