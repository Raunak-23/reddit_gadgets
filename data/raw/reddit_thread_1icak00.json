      "body": "My 5 month old Garmin Venu 3 got an update last month, after the update, the screen just went off after an hour even though I can hear chimes when I was pressing buttons. I tried charging it to full, restarting the watch, nothing helped. I took it to the Garmin service center and they gave it back to me after a week saying they just did a software reset. Well I got it, it only worked for a day then the screen went off again so this time they replaced the entire watch with a brand new one. Ever since, I just kept the replacement watch and posted it for sale, this left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nI bought a Google Pixel Watch 3 which is awesome, I dod miss the long battery life of the Garmin Venu 3 though.",
