Asteroids, even in asteroid \"fields\" are spread out hundreds of thousands of miles even if going in and out of earth's gravity ever made space mining make sense.\n\nThe Earth is already a giant ball of resources where you don't have to fight orbit and re-entry energy costs. All human mining is just a fraction of 1% of the Earth's crush. There is no real scenario where you needo space in space until you have like like robots making robots and swarms of unlimited labor in post scarcity future utopia dreams where you build space mega-structure just because you ran out of anything else to do.\n\nFor real productivity or money making, space mining make zero sense. It's 100% a scam to get investor money with promises that make no sense. There is no space economy, space tourism or space mining happening because there is no need and no Earth like destination in this solar system worth expanding to, just like expanding to Antarctica or the bottom of the ocean is possible and much easier than space, but nobody is interested because it's a dumb idea that would just suck for people to live and cost infinite money for no reason. \n\nOnce money doesn't matter you can do silly shit like that, but until then, no chance and you'll almost certainly never need a robot cat to do any of that.",
