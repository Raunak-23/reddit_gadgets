This camera basically combines the two.\n\nFuji's film simulation is a far cry from the digital \"filters\" you see in camera apps. They're not just a simple overlay that's slapped on a finished image and called a day. They're applied at multiple levels in the process, working with tone curves, color lookup tables, lens profiles, the works. It's an algorithmic process, rather than just an aesthetic one. They're also the result of literal decades of research and development, striving to achieve specific film looks.\n\nA number of Fuji photographers already shoot SOOC JPGs, relying on the innate processing to achieve certain film emulations and save them hours in front of Lightroom \u2014 that's how good Fuji's tech is.\n\nI don't know how well this camera will fare. It's a big swing, but that's what Fuji is known for. People laughed at the X100 when it first came out, saying no one would pay $1500 for a fixed-lens camera. Now it's one of their most popular models, with new models being impossible to find for months after their releases.\n\nUltimately we'll have to see if this camera finds a market, but I think it can. Half-frame cameras are few and far-between, so there isn't much competition. And the Pentax 17 has proven there's a market for every niche. Time will tell.",

They've been buying up outdated digital cameras to achieve certain \"retro\" aesthetics to them. They're also the folks most using filters and film simulations. The X Half marries all of that into a simple no-muss, no-fuss digital camera.\n\nDon't forget: many digital camera users never shoot RAW because they don't have the wherewithal to spend hours sitting at a computer, editing. They just wanna shoot and post. Which is also why the portrait-oriented sensor is so clutch; it's the perfect Instagram Camera.\n\nSure, they could just \"turn a regular camera on its side\" to achieve the same effect, but they could also just \"turn their phone on its side\" to watch videos in landscape mode, and yet no one does. That's why TikTok is so huge.\n\nThe X Half basically gives Gen Z (who I believe to ultimately be the target market) a camera that produces better images and achieves closer film-like looks than their phone \u2014 while still letting them shoot-and-upload (via said phone) without ever having to download to a computer. All in a package small enough to fit in a purse or jacket pocket.\n\nI think it has the potential to be pretty popular. The $800 price tag might hurt it, but we'll ultimately have to see.",

Would you prefer they go out and buy multiple film cameras to house the dozens of different film stocks so that they can swap between them as they shoot? What even is your point, for that matter?\n\n> Never ant mention of software integration or consumer friendliness\n\nThat's because it's not the topic at hand?

Yes you can get a new zve10 with the crappy 16-50 then you have to pay more for a new lens. \n\nMany people find fujis presets superior to Sony, I shoot raw so I don\u2019t know but people often cite this.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely slightly on the high end, but it\u2019s not terrible pricing. However with how inflations going these days and tariffs and nonsense I\u2019m not that surprised it\u2019s 100 dollars more than I think it should cost.",

If you know better, you know the alternatives. GR3, older x100, etc etc. \n\nI\u2019d get it if it was 300-500USD. 800USD is steep but we know the deal. Style, bragging rights, image, kawaii goals\u2026 Many will ironically get it for TikTok or IG and post an image of it using a mobile phone, use it for the summer at most, then set on the shelf. No doubt it\u2019s gonna sell like hot cakes. Fujifilm disappoints my principals on this one but is smart on hopping on this backward facing train for the money.",

The Fuji JPEG's genuinely look really good - I keep the RAWs in case I want to get something from the image the in-camera processing didn't do for me, but almost every time I try to tweak it, when I look back at the JPEG I find that I did a worse job than the camera.",
