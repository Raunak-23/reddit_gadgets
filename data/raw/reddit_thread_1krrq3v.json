          "body": "For AMD it's the bus width. They have 256-bit busses on the 9070 cards, and 128-bit on the 9060 cards. The 9070GRE is the only weird one at 192-bit.\n\nTo do 16GB with the 9070(XT), it's just 8x 2GB modules like normal. The 16GB 9060XT gets the same number of modules, just with 2 per memory controller in a clamshell mount.mounting.\n\nThe only other capacity AMD really could've done on these cards would've been to make a 32GB 9070 variant, which does exist as the R9700. I guess a 24GB 9070GRE variant would also be possible as well.",

To offer 20GB of VRAM on a 60 class would kneecap their highest end products, it\u2019s the same reason a 24GB 3090 still commands $650-$700 used despite being almost half a decade old and a 5080 only has 16GB. \n\nAi can also work across multiple GPUs, but that doesn\u2019t mean as much when even most server boards will only support up to 4 discrete GPUs (without exotic riser configurations). The VRAM on consumer cards is artificially kept low to prevent them from competing.",
