Nvidia has repeatedly and publicly said the budget 60-series cards are its most popular, and this year it reportedly tried to ensure it by withholding access and pressuring reviewers to paint them in the best light possible.\n\n\n>Nvidia might have wanted to prevent a repeat of 2022, when it launched this card\u2019s predecessor. Those reviews were harsh. The 4060 was called a \u201cslap in the face to gamers\u201d and a \u201cwet fart of a GPU.\u201d I had guessed the 5060 was headed for the same fate after seeing how reviewers handled the 5080, which similarly showcased how little Nvidia\u2019s hardware has improved year over year and relied on software to make up the gaps.\n\n\n>But Nvidia had other plans.\n\n\n>Here are the tactics that Nvidia reportedly just used to throw us off the 5060\u2019s true scent, as individually described by GamersNexus, VideoCardz, Hardware Unboxed, GameStar.de, Digital Foundry, and more:\n\n\n>Nvidia decided to launch its RTX 5060 on May 19th, when most reviewers would be at Computex in Taipei, Taiwan, rather than at their test beds at home.\nEven if reviewers already had a GPU in hand before then, Nvidia cut off most reviewers\u2019 ability to test the RTX 5060 before May 19th by refusing to provide drivers until the card went on sale. (Gaming GPUs don\u2019t really work without them.)\nAnd yet Nvidia allowed specific, cherry-picked reviewers to have early drivers anyhow if they agreed to a borderline unethical deal: they could only test five specific games, at 1080p resolution, with fixed graphics settings, against two weaker GPUs (the 3060 and 2060 Super) where the new card would be sure to win.\nIn some cases, Nvidia threatened to withhold future access unless reviewers published apples-to-oranges benchmark charts showing how the RTX 5060\u2019s \u201cfake frames\u201d MFG tech can produce more frames than earlier GPUs without it.\nSome reviewers apparently took Nvidia up on that proposition, leading to early reviews where charts looked positively stacked in the 5060\u2019s favor:",

In a normal review situation, Nvidia would have been rightly criticized for releasing an 8gb card in 2025, but the 8gb 5060 Ti already softened that blow a bit.\n\nBut from a value perspective, it's not terrible, it's about what you'd expect. As a gamer you're better off with the 9060 XT (again, assuming MSRP), but for the \"Nvidia or bust\" crowd, well, there's a reason the 60 series is their biggest seller.",
