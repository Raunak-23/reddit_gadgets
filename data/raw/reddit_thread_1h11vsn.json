Sight is another example of multiple senses rolled into one: light/dark, plus light wavelength (color). Sound is loudness, tone/timbre (frequency), echolocation (which is both origination and proximity). Taste is thermoception, texture, sweetness, saltiness, spiciness, umami, bitterness, sourness, scent/aroma, and whatever sense tells us how fresh/spoiled a food is.",
