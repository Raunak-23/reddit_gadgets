To make matters even more confusing, Microsoft's been pretty good about releasing games on both Xbox **and** PC, so the lines of separation between \"Xbox\" and \"PC\" are blurrier than any other moment in Xbox history that I can think of.  I get what the original poster means in essence, but it's also Microsoft's mess that they've created.\n\nXbox is literally in the name... who is going to buy this thing and then come to realize some games that they've purchased for their Xbox Series or whatever aren't going to work on this thing?  I'm not going to research too hard into this because it's Microsoft's mess and I don't feel like sifting through this spaghetti monster that they've created, but as far as I know, if you bought a game on Xbox Series and it supports \"Play Anywhere\", you'll be good.  You bought it, you can play it.  What if a game you bought **doesn't** support \"Play Anywhere\"?  Did you just buy a handheld called an Xbox Ally X and yet it can't play your Xbox game because it's not actually an Xbox even though it's calling itself an Xbox by being called an Xbox Ally X, or is that not a thing and it can play every game that an Xbox Series can play?  How much X could an Xbox box if an Xbox could box Xes?\n\nSo... hilariously enough, the marketing ought to stress to people that \"THIS IS **NOT** AN XBOX\" to avoid confusing and disappointing people into thinking this is an Xbox and therefore all of their Xbox games can be played on this thing.",

                      "body": "I think the clarification here is that the Xbox Quest 3S cannot play any XBOX games locally on the hardware. Xbox games can only be streamed via Gamepass Ultimate, whereas you would need to buy games from the meta store to play them locally (Of course that is a completely different library of mostly VR games though).\n\n  \nThe Xbox ROG Ally can play (some) Xbox games locally from the Microsoft store, but a lot of games on the Microsoft store don't have Xbox play anywhere support... So those games would have to be streamed anyways.\n\n  \nNow, I haven't had an Xbox since the 360, but as a consumer, when a company tells me \"this is an Xbox\", I think most people kind of expect that that means that you will be able to play your Xbox games natively on the hardware. Right now we essentially have 3 categories of \"Xbox\".\n\n1. The Actual Xbox consoles that play Xbox games and have backwards compatibility.\n\n2. Streaming devices such as phones that let you stream your Xbox games via Gamepass Ultimate.\n\n3. Windows devices that can do streaming AND play games locally, but the collection of Xbox games you can play locally is haphazard. Just because you bought a game on your Xbox console, it's no guarantee that you won't have to buy it again (THROUGH MICROSOFT BOTH TIMES) to play on your PC. In addition to that, cross-save is a crapshoot.\n\n  \nThere is still a real lack of clarity and simplicity around what it means to be an XBOX and the \"This is an Xbox\" branding really just ignores that. I honestly don't have too many issues with categories 1 and 2 co-existing because the library and save progress is shared. Going forward though, categories 1 and 3 cannot co-exist without major changes. If this is the direction Microsoft is going in, then all future games must be mandated to have cross-buy and cross-save across windows and consoles.\n\nIf this means that all future Xbox consoles will run on a version of Windows so that there only needs to be one version of the game, then so be it, but this needs to be done in such a way that console owners still get a good experience. Backwards compatibility also needs to be thoroughly addressed as there is no way Xbox fans would accept a new console that doesn't allow them to play their back catalogue of OG Xbox -> Xbox Series games.\n\n  \nMicrosoft has the route forward, but there are so many ways they could screw it up and any number of those ways will really damage their brand in the long run so they really need to get their messaging right.",

Only reason is because Xbox and because the Switch is now a 'handheld console'\n\nIn any other world the ROG Ally line is literally a handheld PC so calling it a console and then getting mad that its only slightly more expensive than a different console and not comparing the price to a PC or other handheld PCs seems really disingenuous  imo (or stupid, if Xbox is the one calling it a console)",

I've been in the Xbox club since 2002, so obviously the Series X had a lot of traction in my direction, but the biggest appeal to me wasn't anything coming out, it was the fact that everything I was already playing was about to be much better.\n\nEverybody kept talking about how they don't buy new consoles for their old games, but I have multiple generations of old games I still enjoy playing, and will probably continue to do so for generations to come.   \n  \nThe Series X added HDR to Fusion Frenzy LMAO. That's pretty cool. They also have the Xbox version of Morrowind running smooth and sharp, with loading screens that are nearly instant. KOTOR I and II also run well, and these are the original release versions.\n\nLove it. Love it to death. It runs all my old games so well, I can see myself still using the Series X in 10, 15, even 20 years from now.\n\n.. woah, I went on a rant there.

As an Ally Z1E owner, I never saw this as anything but the next generation of Ally handheld, now with an Xbox sticker slapped on it. This is why the price isn\u2019t a shock to me. PC handhelds have always been on the expensive side, and this one is going to be the most powerful one on the market when it launches. So the way I see it, Microsoft don\u2019t deserve flack for the price, but they certainly don\u2019t deserve the praise of releasing a handheld either, which is what many Xbox fans are claiming. This is an Asus product through and through.",

These are big, but gaming laptops are way bigger and heavier.",

Technically you can just install Windows on a Steam Deck, but if you're out in the market for a PC handheld and want Windows as the OS you might as well get the handheld that comes with Windows as a default. \n2. Much more powerful.  The Z2 Extreme in the X version of the ROG Ally Xbox will be significantly more powerful than the SD.  The Steam Deck at this point struggles to play a lot of AAA titles.  If you can swallow the steeper price tag then you can get yourself a handheld that can probably play new AAA release for at least the next couple of years.",
