These average, common PC gamers COMPLAINS AS IF they will gain massive competitive disadvantage by using these wired pheripherals.

It's gonna last me a week (70h batt / 11h use) - though tbh likely 10 since I don't actually use my PC for 11 full hours 7d a week.  \n-When the battery is drained, it's gonna happen mid-something-important.  \n-There is no benefit for me. I have a very large underdesk tray. The cables are routed through loose channels under the desk. I don't see my cables. The cables are neither visually nor functionally limiting in any way.  \n-My exisiting setup never needs any fiddling whatsoever.  If I don't do something every 10 (even 30) days, it keeps working. Guaranteed, every time.\n\nIn other words there is literally zero benefit to me going wireless.\n\nFun fact: my devices are actually wireless, I just keep the USB-C cable plugged in always. This is because I have other PCs (with USB-C cables available) that I move to when I need to do a maintenance session sometimes (Servers/Media/NVR/etc) plus like 2x/mo when I actually need to be in the office.\n\nSidenote: While I agree with you regarding Chinese keyboards, there is no Chinee mouse that mimics the functionality of a Logitech G502 for example (esp with G-Shift). It's a middle-ground between Naga and your typical mouse with back-forward thumb buttons. Not for everyone but if you want that you can't get it in a knockoff (yet, unfortunately). But when it happens I agree there's little downside to going that route.\n\nAnd the same argument I'm using for my mouse, some people may have specific needs for their keyboards that aren't met by Chinese ones. But those are fringe cases typically, nothing to get up in arms about in forums, to each their own.\n\nI will say that the whole wireless charging for a peripheral thing - when that's more commonplace and affordable, I would totally go that route personally. Less cables to route, fewer USB ports used, esp if people have their peripherals on top of their desk.",

It's really frustrating that Playstation locks its input protocols so heavily, only to release what are functionally the same versions of other products.

              "body": "My best guess is that it had to do with the arcade layout for Street Fighter. In the arcade the top row of buttons from left to right is LP MP HP, and the bottom row is LK MK HK. When the game was originally ported to PlayStation consoles they mapped HP to R1 and HK to R2. So this stick and generally all others since follow the arcade layout with the top row as square triangle R1 and the bottom row as X Circle R2\u2026with the left shoulder buttons to the right of them per tradition lol",
