That said, I am not an expert on silicon design, so I certainly won't say its impossible.\n\nThere are a few cases where this could be a big deal for a user. Someone who is working with large data files could take a noticeable hit to performance with this issue- which could include gaming and professional workflows like CAD and video editing.\n\nThe average desktop user will probably notice nothing, but this is yet another black mark on Intel at a time where AMD is making pretty solid inroads not only in gaming and server spaces, but even in commercial desktops and workstations. Its not a great look.",

Will Intel improve, or will AMD get shittier?\n\nThis is a constant ebb and flow battle. Remember that AMD and Intel are competitors essentially in name only.\n\nThe real change is going to be ARM finally hitting consumer desktop viability. It's very close--the chips are there (the Apple M series are all ARM, cloud servers are all moving to ARM chips), and it basically just requires either a larger adoption of Linux (Ubuntu is basically completely ARM compatible, Nvidia is doing lots of work to have ready ARM drivers) and/or Microsoft finally convincing third parties to write ARM drivers for Windows. Large adoption of Linux may seem farfetched, but with the rise of handhelds putting Linux in the hands of lots of people, that doesn't seem like a pipe dream anymore.\n\nBecause x86 is proprietary, only AMD and Intel can \"make\" desktop chips. But if ARM becomes viable for desktops then a lot of chip manufacturers will start entering the space because why not?",

                              "body": "Nah, its all old tech problems. Once upon a time Intel would slap dual cores together and call them Quads. Limitations like FSB and core coherency were not solved yet. Early quad core CPUs were janky. \n\nThen AMD tried to convince us half cores were cores to compete with Hyperthreading core counts. Those CPUs went backwards in performance from Thuban 6 cores to Bulldozer 8 cores. 4 cores with tricks IMO. Thus at the time, 6 old cores would beat 8 new cores all from AMD. Helps explain how we got to heterogeneous CPU designs of various core size and counts. \n\nWhy would you need to know SDRAM to RDRAM to DDR RAM? You don't anymore. Point is *the big* quad core problems predate Ryzen by a bit.",
