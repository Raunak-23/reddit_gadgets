I got the PS4 because I had a buddy who had AC Black Flag, and I was dying to play it through. Fast forward a few years, and I was once again without a console. I tried going back to Xbox (because that\u2019s what I grew up on) and just couldn\u2019t fall back in love with it. My friends, games, everything were all on PlayStation. So I sold my Xbox Series X three weeks after buying it and bought my PS5 the same day.\n\nHonestly when I bought the Xbox it seemed like a massive downgrade from even the PS4. Mostly shooters, while games like the Last of Us, Metro, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc were all PlayStation exclusives. Sony\u2019s got me lock, stock, and barrel.",

What I get I get with Xbox is simplicity. I can play some of the simpler Game Pass games on my old laptop, or cloud stream newer ones on my phone. Ultimate is under $10 a month if you don't buy directly from Microsoft and and the catalogue rotates enough to have me checking back for new things.\u00a0\n\n\nMicrosoft got me with their subscription model because it just works better for my lifestyle. I don't really have time to deep dive into game reviews to buy the latest and greatest for $70. The last real Playstation game I bought at release was Final Fantasy XVI, and it left such a bitter taste in my mouth.\u00a0",

I remember they shot their load with the last Halo game and around 2012 came out with Gears Judgement. That was it.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony kept pumping out game after game even if they weren't the highest of quality to the point that between 2011-2012 it seemed like an exclusive, via 1st or 2nd party, was coming out every other week. Games like God of War Ascension, Sly Cooper, Killzone 3, The last of Us, Journey, Ni No Kuni, Motorsport Apocalypse, etc. and I could keep going. There was a game for every type of gamer.\n\non top of that, PSN was free and because of their data breach fiasco they were giving away real games or if you signed up for PS+ you were getting better games then gold. I remember getting BioShock Infinite on PS+ a couple of months after it released.\n\nThe PS3 launched a year later that Xbox and Wii, struggled between '06-'09 but by the end of '09 with the slim PS3, games like uncharted 2, and a more friendly advertising campaign, that thing gave a MSFT a wallop in one of the most ball drop moves I've ever seen a company do. It might just be 2 million sales difference in the end, but had Sony launched a year later then it would've probably been the winner by even larger margins.\n\nThe install base on the 360 was dominant and they just rested on their laurels like if gamers didn't get bored, shifted priorities to the Xbox one with almost minor reasons for us to upgrade.",

And this isn't some Reddit user's random opinion, this was based on what Phil Spencer himself said...\n\n*\"We lost the worst generation to lose in the Xbox One generation, where everybody built their digital library of games.\"*\n\nThat's a direct quote from Phil Spencer. Maybe the person you responded to could have worded it better, but when he said \"online accounts\" he is as talk about the digital libraries that Phil is referring to in that quote.\n\nIt's not about whether they had better online services or not. It's the fact that it was the generation where everyone got fully invested into one online ecosystem or the other.",

They don't want to compete directly, better for Microsoft, Valve, Nintendo, etc. to work together and grow the overall pie instead of fighting over their pie slices.\n\nIt will be Valve's Steam library + OEM hardware (e.g. Lenovo, Dell, etc.) + AMD/Nvidia GPU + Microsoft facilitating the whole ecosystem and calling it \"Xbox\" to get a cut without having to do much work, just like they are backing OpenAI to do the work in artificial intelligence. They can run Game Pass like you said but competing directly with Steam is a hard and uphill battle for Microsoft.",

That way Valve's OS and Steam Deck market share is reduced in exchange for using the Steam library, and Microsoft's OS benefits in exchange for the game library:\n\n* Microsoft OS + Valve game library + OEM hardware\n\nOtherwise I don't see why Microsoft would open up their games to porting for Nintendo on the Switch 2. I think Microsoft is moving away from hardware and focusing more on pure software, which is their area of expertise.\n\nSure, Microsoft can do their own hardware too like Google makes the Pixel in the smartphone market, but we're not talking about big money here. It would be like the Surface lineup, kind of a niche product just to stay in the game.",

I feel it was more word of mouth, with Sony focusing on benefits of DVD for games (more space).\n\nWith the other ones, it seems when they focused on media stuff, they forgot about other things.\n\nPS3 marketed itself as a media centre. The XMB interface was built around it; the shit has printer support. The hardware justified the price, especially with the built-in PS2, but it clearly failed until the 2009 rebranding.\n\nWii U focused on some TV connection. It failed.\n\nXbox One basically repeated the PS3 fiasco only much worse, as it actively seemed to screw gamers over with things like DRM. It failed.\n\nFor what it's worth, I personally am nostalgic for how the seventh generation placed great emphasis on media functions. I love the PS3 and Xbox 360. But it was something that, like you say, made a touch less sense going into the 2010s.",

Even with several features that a lot of people seem to prefer (from what I can tell on the outside), Xbox hasn\u2019t been able to get anywhere to close to Sony\u2019s quantity and quality of games for nearly 15 years, which is why the Wii U was the only thing keeping the Xbox One out of third place by the end of that generation. Again, by the end of the last generation PS4 was pretty much *the* next-gen console, so when the next generation started and it took Xbox a year to get anything to really have a marquee Series X game, the options basically ended up being \u201cdefault console\u201d and \u201cdefault console but with less games\u201d. And of course that\u2019s just continued until the current state of things.\n\nObviously the nature of \u201cexclusives\u201d for consoles has changed, but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve ever had a generation better demonstrate that they matter.",

The \u201cPS5 has no games\u201d joke came back because they haven\u2019t been putting out that many games exclusive to the platform (which we now know is partially because they tried to put most of their devs on live service forever games hoping they\u2019ll catch on).

People get more excited for something when they know there\u2019s stuff to get excited about instead of it just being something they have to buy if they want to play modern games.",

I'm upgrading my home cinema setup with a 120hz tv, sonos, etc. Lo and behold, playstation doesn't support atmos.\nThen we have the gamepass. 2 years with the console, can be gotten cheap on the market, I can play on both my PC and console, and it even syncs saves. I can play my game when tv is occupied.\nThe amount of content on gamepass is pretty huge, for a family gamer with a schoolkid that is more than enough.\n\nFor me, ps5 didn't have enough value, save the controllers. I miss horizon dearly, but both installments could be played on my ps4pro, so didn't need the 5 just for more pizzaz. No new uncharted game, God of war was never a thing for me.\n\nXsx was an uncomfortable but calculated choice, and I don't regret it. I don't socialise over console, so there is that. \n\nMost games are multiplatform or come out on pc eventually. Happy with my xbox, but I do understand the criticism behind the naming and the awful XSS. \n\nValue and spec wise - there is nothing to complain.",

Unless we\u2019re supposed to believe that the PC market grew without at all affecting the console market then that would be to some degree fewer console players unless the console market grew more at the same time obviously but the point is the same. I think a lot of PC gamers are far too dramatic about how hard a PC is to use. A 12-year-old family friend is buying a PC instead of a console because that\u2019s what is cool with his generation. Yeah PCs need more work but at the same time almost everyone has a laptop for work so they\u2019ve probably already used a PC operating system though it is quite possible that they would be using Mac and not Windows but the differences aren\u2019t that major. Yeah, most people would probably be buying prebuilts, but I don\u2019t necessarily think everyone who\u2019s a PC gamer has to be a PC builder. I think there\u2019s a sense of elitist superiority from PC gamers a lot of the time, but that isn\u2019t really reflected in reality. If you buy a prebuilt PC, you don\u2019t really have to do that much finicking anymore. Nvidia even has their app which just optimises games for you. Not to mention how consoles have got far more confusing in settings menus with options like upscaling frame generation and even more granular options than any period of gaming in the past. \n\nPC also has a lot more games too. You get basically every single game that\u2019s not a Sony title or a rockstar title but they\u2019ll usually arrive about a year or two after launch. \n\nTreating PC gamers as a completely separate market from consoles is just outdated because we know without any real discussion that people are buying gaming PCs and at a shocking rate. The 36 million concurrent steam users aren\u2019t just playing on their MacBooks. Discreet graphics cards have become common. Steam has 132 million users which is more than twice the amount of PS5s sold. I think nerds are desperate to keep their hobby nerdy but let\u2019s be honest PC gaming isn\u2019t a nerd hobby anymore it\u2019s for everyone. \n\n[Here](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/) is an interesting article from PC gamer talking about how the gaming market isn\u2019t just consoles anymore. Also, I think the people who are that technologically illiterate that they think PC is scary. They might just be buying the Nintendo switch which is the console for the technologically illiterate people not the PS5 that\u2019s being sold based on ray tracing and teraflops.",

I understand that consoles are definitely cheaper, but the numbers aren\u2019t far enough away from one another that someone picking up gaming as a hobby or who has played games for a very long time will just discount PC. So many console gamers get tired of the inflexible prices and weird arbitrary restrictions on game availability undecided that instead of buying the PS5 after their PS4 they\u2019ll just get a PC which might cost a bit more upfront but they won\u2019t have to pay for online. They\u2019ll be able to get games discounted they\u2019ll be able to emulate they\u2019ll be able to use old games and they\u2019ll even be able to use it for work.",

All we have is that data indicates premium sales drop 80% when the game is on gamepass.\n\nhttps://www.thegamer.com/xbox-game-pass-80-percent-loss-premium-sales/\n\nWhich to me, makes perfect sense.
