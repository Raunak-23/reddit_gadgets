It was for a web app in an environment and language I was less familiar with, so I figured the AI could figure out the basic syntax while I tell it what I need, but I swear I spent more than half of my time going in circles while the AIs completely failed to provide working code, and kept committing basic syntax errors and omitting context or even complete lines of code. I would give it context with function definitions and requirements and it would ignore the defined function parameters and try to use functions that didn't exist in the scope or even make up its own functions to do things instead. I also ran into an issue where some form validation wasn't working properly due to an abstraction layer in some tool we were using, and it literally went in circles trying to make changes to get it working, and every time it kept telling me things like \"This will work, this is my final change, this will 100% work, this is completely foolproof\" and nothing fucking worked. I spent an hour trying to get working code out of it, but ultimately gave up and spent another hour finding the obscure documentation to just do it myself.",

With Jobs, he was able to fundamentally drive the tech industry forward with new ideas that people actually made use of and wanted.   Beyond his death we have primarily seen the Apple Watch and Vision Pro, but these have not really had that same fundamental impact on technology that Steve Jobs had.  Instead, it seems like Apple is leaning on the product line Steve had, iterating on it, rather than pushing the envelope with revolutionary ideas.\n\nWe kind of take it for granted now, but the iPhone was revolutionary, and to some degree so was the iPad.  Nothing came close to the experiences either product provided at the time of their introduction, and since then many have jumped on the form factor bandwagon.  (even the iPod was a revolutionary idea, and has served its time).  Nothing Apple has come up with since has had that same magic to it.",

He would obsess over the placement of pixels and minute details of different fonts and layouts.  He brought to the industry the idea of diegetic interfaces which was honestly a great experience for its time, even if we've outgrown it (where the interfaces resembled real-world materials and objects).  Not a perfect person by all means, but a visionary nonetheless who understood a lot about how technology could fit in our lives without getting in the way.",

What's the point (in the mind of a megacorp I mean) of providing a 3 days battery life device, given that doing so at the same price would hurt their margin and doing it but rising prices accordingly would lower sales of the device AND lower sales of after sales services? Apple devices are generally pretty good, but they gain nothing from selling a significantly better product if even most of their end users don't get a significant difference in experience, so they go for the best balance of cost to performance that works for them, which is good business practice. That's also the reason why I'm the beginning they didn't even disclose the battery capacity of their phone: for their targeted demographic, it didn't matter. Most of the people who buy a new phone don't care about the actual battery capacity, they care about how long that battery capacity is gonna last: even you, do you care more if your phone battery has X thousands mAh or if you can use it for long enough between charges without being bothersome?",

However, if you look at YoY costs to MSRP, Apple makes some interesting moves from year to year. For instance the cost for the iphone 14 pro was $484 with an $999 MSRP. The cost of the iphone 15 pro was $523 at the same $999 MSRP, making less net profit in the same model line year or year. That would suggest that there is some deeper strategy than just bottom line margins. Super cycles vs \"S\" years, competition releases, and other factors play into what they are willing to spend and net profits. So a minor increase in battery size/cost would be very low impact in the grand scheme of things for their bottom line when it is clear they'll spend money to be in the conversation of top hardware.",

Of course, it's basic math. So why didn't they chose the latter? Is the answer that they can't engineer a better phone? Or that they think they're immune to market demand so they can do whatever they want? Or maybe, just maybe, they made their analysis over the decades and realized over and over that larger batteries gives more downsides than upsides for them and their users?\n\n\nApple has great engineers, they could totally design their phones around larger (physically) batteries. They are rich and their margins are far from thin, they can easily cash out for higher density batteries. They position themselves in the high end segment, they can easily rise price accordingly. They don't do that. Why? Because they don't need to. Even during the battery capacity war about a decade ago they refused to officially disclose their phone's battery capacity until they felt not doing so hurt their sales more than doing it; and their much smaller batteries would have been a great show of how efficient their phones were (which is exactly what happened when they officially put it on the specs), but still didn't because their philosophy has always been to give the users a device that would feel like a magic box: you don't need to know what's inside and how it works, you just need to know that it does and it does it well. I mean, it was LITERALLY Steve Jobs' mantra \"it just works\", what reason more do you need that Apple themselves?",

Eg it's great for \"what's the command to do XYZ?\" where I can put XYZ in natural language without having to use the correct technical term. It's also great for collating quick information or finding a product with some specific qualities/niche. Eg \"find me X but waterproof and mains powered\" saves me a ton of time trawling through Zigbee sensors\n\nWhere previously I'd try a Google search in my own words, scan-read the top 4 results, then repeat for another search until I found what I needed, I find GPT (/Claude/etc) do a good job of quickly scanning that information out for me. I then follow the sources the AI provided (or ask for sources) and verify it myself\n\nAs long as you stick with \"trust, but verify\" then an LLM can be surpringly good for this stuff - basically just a search engine that does more of the work for you. I wouldn't trust it to be correct, in the same way that I didn't just trust Google correctly pulled out the top result correctly - but it does a better job, most of the time, of pulling up the right info for me to check out\n\nThe problems come when people just blindly trust the output entirely rather than checking it\n\nFor me I find it's faster to let it do 90% of the work and use 10% of the time to verify it's not hallucinating - eg searching that used to take me 10 minutes, becomes 1 minute of verifying the LLM output\n\nAlthough I'll note that the more important the information is, the more I'll do it manually. eg when I wanted to know whether my cough was dry or chesty I asked GPT. Whereas when I wanted to know which cough medicines it's safe for my pregnant partner to consume, I looked it up myself.",
