Apparently the vision pro is really good for productivity but the price point is too high. The Quest Pro kinda sits awkwardly in-between as being more expensive than the 3 but not really being much more capable for productivity. \n\nSo if it ends up being a good productivity headset it could outcompete the Quest 3, Quest Pro and Vision Pro in the productivity segment at that price point.\n\nBut for casual gaming the Quest 3 and Quest 3s have that market locked down pretty much, especially since they got exclusives.\n\nI don't think there is that much demand for a productivity headset to really carry sales but who knows maybe Samsung could convince a bunch of execs that they really have to buy a bunch of these for their workers.",

The \"home VR units\" don't even need a built in computer or battery, for example. They should just act as a monitor, that connects straight to your desktop computer via a cable. Think of how much lighter and cheaper they would be!\n\nAnd the \"portable AR units\" (like the FB and Snapchat ones) can continue to get cheaper and lighter so they can be carried around outside, and worn as easily as a smart watch. This makes the most sense for me.\n\nApple could have really been the pioneer in this space, but instead they did a super-expensive \"me too\" product that doesn't do ANYTHING very well (it's trash at portable, and trash at home use), not to mention it's way way too expensive.

Afterall, the VP is still uniquely cabled to an external battery.  \n\nI imagine there are technical reasons why they didn't put all of the compute in the external box as well, but I hope they can eventually get to that point.  It's the only way these headsets are going to miniaturize to a comfortable size on any reasonable time horizon.  If they can shave the weight down by even half, it starts to change the game considerably as far as how wearable it is.",

The quest 3 isn\u2019t only great for the price, but the fact that it is a completely stand alone headset with a totally open platform (android), that also allows you to connect to a pc.\n\nThe Apple vision cannot do this. It\u2019s not open, can\u2019t connect to a computer, and certainly doesn\u2019t allow you to play steam games. If it did, even at that price point it would fly off the shelves. \n\nIf anyone delivers a better quest 3, then even if it\u2019s trice as expensive, it would really fly off the shelves. But doing that takes billions of dollars, meaning that only these giants can do so.",

Several years ago, I had a Galaxy Frontier watch that stopped turning on. I sent it in and two weeks later they sent me a letter saying they did not have any available (still being sold, mind you)  and they included a replacement of a $60 Fitbit looking thing. They literally gave me a $60 replacement for a $300 watch. I spent the entire next year trying to get my actual watch back. Over the course of that I spoke to probably 20 different \u201cmanagers\u201d, received multiple fitbit-looking things, and finally got a Galaxy Frontier watch after an entire year. But get this: they sent me a demo watch! From that moment on, I have not bought one single thing from Samsung and I never will. Fuck their repair facility in Plano, TX!",
