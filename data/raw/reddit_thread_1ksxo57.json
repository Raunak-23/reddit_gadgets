      "body": "It's worth noting the visible light is a lot dimmer than the infrared is. Its purely to do with the physics of it not having a power source and converting lower energy light to higher energy light. You end up with fewer photons.\n\nThe contact lenses only let you see an infrared LED, not passive infrared, at least in the current iteration. They're just not sensitive enough. \n\nSo yeah, you can see an infrared led through your eyelids. But you can already see a visible light led through your eyelids. Just look at a torch with your eyes closed.\n\nIt's definitely cool, and could lead to some cool discoveries later, but I can't think of many practical applications of this version.\n\nAny machine will just use infrared sensors, which will be cheaper than this. They talk about using infrared light to send data but it would have to be decoded by a person. Its something only spy agencies would do and they'd just use another method, why risk someone spotting the infrared light? IR can show up on phone cameras.\n\nThe one use case it might have is making solar panels more efficient by converting infrared light the solar panel can't usually use into visible light it can convert into electricity. Also potentially using the same concept to turn visible light into UV/X rays.\n\nPersonally I'd be a lot more excited about turning visible light into UV/X rays as current UV leds are really expensive and X ray leds don't exist. A cheaper method to make UV leds would be great and a way to make an LED x ray source would be groundbreaking. We'd be able to make an X ray machine way more power efficient and compact. Although this heavily depends on the cost of the material and how efficient it is.",
