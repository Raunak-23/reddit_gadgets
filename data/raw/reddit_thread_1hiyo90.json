The server-side software is engineered to be run by experienced devops, likely on a big cloud platform. It's not designed to be distributed to end users. What we need is some sort of precedent for liability when a company releases a product with an up-front cost that relies on a live service that the product is useless without. What is the expected reasonable legal minimum amount of time the service should be maintained to protect consumers?\n\nThere are a lot of approaches that could be taken for this but a good law would make companies think very hard about whether they want to tie expensive products to a live service so tightly that they can be considered useless without it, with no backup plan for when the live service shuts down.",

It would be unlikely, though not totally impossible, for someone to be held personally liable in a particularly egregious case of releasing something that could be considered another company's trade secrets.\n\nThat said, that's not the only issue. Let's say there's a scenario [where this happens](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/winamp-really-whips-open-source-coders-into-frenzy-with-its-source-release/), they dump their code to GitHub, and it's found to contain valuable code that is not licensed for distribution and the company who owns the copyright on that code is particularly litigious. It will get uploaded to a public repo, get quickly removed, cause a massive media shit storm, and anyone working on their own version of the software will be under intense scrutiny for spoilage. When reverse engineering software that has some dodgy licensing implication, you do what's called clean room development. Everyone contributing code to the project must be beyond reproach when the question arises of whether they've ever seen or been remotely adjacent to the restrictive code.\n\nBy releasing legally questionable code, you've actually made it more difficult to safely reverse engineer software. This has happened in live service game development before where there were server emulators reverse engineered in a clean room environment, then source code leaked and from then on all projects were tainted by questions of whether leaked source was even *referenced* when developing updates.\n\nThis is why the path of least resistance is just releasing API documentation. A developer wanting to take it on can just look at what the the endpoints consume and return. Decoding that is the most difficult part of reverse engineering. After that's it's straight-forward software engineering.",
