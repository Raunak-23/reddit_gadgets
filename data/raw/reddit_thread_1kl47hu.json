It doesn't have an exact dedicated GPU equivalent, but it's somewhere in the rough ballpark of a 6600 or 6600XT. The 5700XT is RDNA1 and is similar in raster performance to the 6600XT but lacks the RT capabilities.\n\nFor most games that don't require RT, the 5700XT can play at PS5-equivalent settings if you're comparing it to the PS5 'performance mode' in most games, and especially so if you're targeting 1080p or an upscaled 1440p. The 6600XT is similar, and the RT is weak, but it's technically capable of handling the RT required games.",

Every other console (excluding the msi claw) uses an amd based APU including the ps5, xbox, steamdeck, legion etc. \n\nAMDs window is the same as it was with ryzen and like ryzen it will take time for them to build market share, UDNA is meant to be a continuation of these improvements and is likely AMDs ryzen 3000 moment.",

Those cards are serious powerhouses and AMD finally seems to have the whole ray tracing thing figured out properly. FSR4 is also really nice from all I've heard. (Haven't experienced it first hand yet.) And from all I've seen Intel actually make a solid card on a budget.\n\nThe game has been stepped up outside the upper echelons of things. Chasing that performance crown that Nvidia has held for the last decade or so is folly. But the rest of the market? That's a spicy scene.\n\n  \nEdit: should add we are in Europe. Tariffs aren't really a thing here.",

There were a handful in the 90s, but from 2005 onwards there were multiple movies per year coming out, which signifies heightened public interest in video games to the point even movie investors saw a lot of potential profit (that the movies were mostly flops is neither here nor there :-D the point is publicity/investment). There is no single event you could point to, though. Just times slowly changing.",

Tetris is the actual best \"selling\" video game of all time, if you want to argue that being first means somethig groundbreaking. But it's not really a great argument - the highest grossing film ever (Avatar) didn't really change the movie media landscape at all.\n\nThough - the highest grossing film of all time - adjusted for inflation - did change the movie landscape quite a bit. It was 1939's Gone with the Wind. In that sense, I'd say Minecraft is to Tetris what Avatar is to Gone With The Wind.",

Not blowing nVidia's out of the water in raw performance, but will have a few features which are killer for some. \n\nFor example, I will predict their lower end models will have piles of RAM for reasonable prices. Like 128GB for the same price as an nvidia with 12GB. Also, the number of compute cores might be bonkers. For the same price as an nvidia with 4000 cores my guess is you will get a chinese one with 10,000.\n\nThen the pedants will argue the ram isn't as fast, the cores as capable, etc. These will be somewhat true; but the reality is that for AI researchers, most want bags of ram.",
