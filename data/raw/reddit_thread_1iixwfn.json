I'm a layman when it comes to video encoding, mind, so please pardon my ignorance. Is it just that old hardware is too slow to decode the files in real-time? And if that's the case - why? Is it like uncompressing a zip file for a huge file or something?",

If it requires 100% cpu, that sounds waaaay less efficient to me, in real-world terms of power cost & energy, instead of just bandwidth usage (though I know your example is about the initial encoding, and not the *decoding* step that's more relevant for us users when we're streaming it in, which is what I was really talking about when asking why the Shield couldn't handle them). \n\nThanks for all the insights though, mate. I used to work in a small archviz studio, so I have a *basic* grasp of the intricacies involved in encoding video, but I was the 3d generalist there, not the video guy handling final output, so I didn't learn too much on the video side (and it was 20ish years ago!).",

Menus are slow to load, switching apps is painfully slow, remote response is piss poor.  I have factory reset them, removed the MicroSD card, made attempts to de-bloat them via ADB, but realistically the only solution is to downgrade the OS to a previous older version, which cant be done as it requires a USB port, which the media player lacks. \n\nYou post this in /r/AndriodTV or /r/nvidiashield and the most common response is \"get the $200 pro!\", which also has the same problem, but has a USB port needed to downgrade the OS.  So the solution is to buy a more expensive device that absolutely requires rooting out of the box. Shields are nice media players, but careful what you buy.  I had to replaced my two shields with Walmarts ONN Pro. \n\nIt started out great, minimal menus and all, then the ads took over.",

Notably:\n\n\\- it's Android based so you can side load apps of all sort  \n\\- built in Geforce Now Streaming  \n\\- built in GameStream to stream PC games to TV w/ full controller support.  This enables 4 player local co-op for PC gamers, which is otherwise a huge pain in the ass  \n\\- works well with external receivers that may be buggy with things like Dolby Vision/Atmos, HDR10, or DTS-X (Onkyo in my case)  \n\\- smart home integration(s)  \n\\- connectivity with usb devices or blue tooth, which is handy for some use-cases & users",

So far I only tried Xbox cloud and it was ass, even with 500mbit+ lan.\n\nCurrently thinking about drilling through a wall to connect PC via HDMI but if the shield can stream that well I might go for that instead.\n\nAlso just looked up some YT videos and they've said they disabled game streaming? Am I missing something",

You'd want to look around some other subs for that info.\n\nI have used the stream from PC for several hundred hours though and can attest it works great!  The caveat though may be that to minimize latency you'll want to have a  prosumer grade local network.\n\nI use Ubiquiti appliances and pulled cat6e cables, which included drilling holes like it sounds like you would need to do but in my case I would be doing that anyway even just to stream movies.\n\nI'm also do this sort of thing for a living so it was just another day for me and I can see how that's a barrier to entry for others.  In my case it was much easier to pull ethernet where I needed it than hdmi though.\n\nI'm not trying to sell you on it one way or another.  Mainly just thought I'd share of its rather unique features and that its been a reliable and flexible piece of hardware for me since \\~2019 so I'll be somewhat sad when I have to replace it.",
