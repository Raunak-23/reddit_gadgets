(Not you specifically) \n\nNone of these major companies have nailed it. And I\u2019m not even going to mention that ai pin\u2026. \n\nThe only ones benefiting from ai right now are companies using image generation to create ads for physical goods. (Looking at you Lego) to companies that used to have excellent customer service like American Express making you yell human 16 times before you get passed the ai bot. \n\nThere are good ways to use ai. But man what a mess. It\u2019s 2025 and I\u2019m still getting 10-15 spam calls from scammers every day. It\u2019s exhausting. Instead of using it for something practical, they just slap an ai sticker on the box and say it\u2019s new. \n\nI\u2019m so over it",

You could harvest just fine without it. That's what their metric was and that's why I criticised it.\n\n*But basically everything Silicon Valley has done in the last 20 years has actually made our lives worse.

With a smartphone, I can:\n\n- instantly pull up details of exactly where I am, how to get where I need to go, which methods I can take to get there and how long each method will take.\n\n- control my finances instantly, including checking balances, setting up or stopping payments, scanning in cheques there and then and freezing my card within seconds of realizing it's missing.\n\n- checking literally anything I need to online, instantly\n\n- being able to listen to or watch anything I like, within the bounds of legality and courtesy, on the move eg during train journeys, flights etc\n\n- play videogames that used to require a box a dozen or more times the size plugged into the wall and a TV instantly\n\n- translate anything I find, in real time, just by pointing the phone at it\n\n- using eSIMs to use my phone in countries at the other end of the world for practically pennies and have it arranged ahead of time so all I need to do is toggle a setting when I land\n\n- have cheap and reliable sat nav in my car that's far better than *purpose-built sat nav units* cars used to have. I paid an extra \u00a3300 for an Android Auto that looks absolutely seamless with the surrounding dash and swapped my radio out for it. Worth every penny.\n\n\n\nThose are all just examples I've personally used within the past year.\n\nUnder the other person's message, they're irrelevant. I was living just \"fine\" without them, just like the farmer was ploughing just \"fine\" with a horse.\n\nBut, per your second message, those are all obvious improvements. I'm not denying the downsides of things like the growth of social media. I'm just saying it's either lazy or disingenuous to suggest there's been literally no benefit to smartphones.\n\n\nAs for people who \"assume you're always available\", I have friends who won't reply to messages for days sometimes. Sometimes I don't. None of us care.\n\n\nLikewise, my employer has not once messaged me on the assumption I'm available to work outside the hours I'm contracted to work\u00a0\n\n\nThe fact that you're nearly always contactable is not a problem of the tech. People assuming you're always *available* is a problem with people.\n\n\nI don't care about having the shiniest, trendiest new toy. If there was literally no benefit to smartphones, I would happily buy a brick every few years rather than spending two or three hundred on a smartphone.\n\nBut I'd also be completely lost in new cities, have to have a list of directions pinned to the windshield for longer journeys (and hope I never make a wrong turn), have a much more limited range of options available to me when I visit places like Japan (I have repeatedly used translation services on Japanese only menus or shop products to check what I am about to order/buy), be MUCH more bored on train journeys and out of the loop about breaking news relevant to my job until I could get to a computer.\n\nOh no, social media is terrible. I agree. That's why I deleted my X account.\u00a0\n\nI'd take the evils of social media and the ability for me to walk away from it if the alternative was no social media and no smartphone technology.",

I've used it for Python, SQL queries, fetch XML queries, Javascript, C#, Excel functions, and more. It's saved me literally hundreds of hours over the last year or so.\n\nLarge language models, as you can probably guess from the name, are great at modelling language. The fact that they can be pretty good at providing information as well is a strange emergent side effect of their language modelling abilities. It's a *fascinating* side effect, and I love to play with it.

And if the language or software you're working on ever had a major overhaul, it starts blending the two versions together.

It's terrible at helping me write a function that calls another function that calls an API and returns the results to another function and so on. It will absolutely fuck it up and troubleshooting it will take longer than just writing it yourself.\n\nBut for simple stuff? It's great. Like the other day I had a few dozen CSV files. I wanted to load them up into a dataframe, add a few columns, drop a few columns, then export the results to a single CSV. I know exactly how I'd do it if I were typing it myself. I know what modules I'd use. I know how to loop through CSVs. I *could* do it on my own in a few minutes. But why bother? I can just go to ChatGPT and be like \"Yo write me a function that accepts an input filepath, loops through every CSV in that folder, and return a pandas dataframe\" and I get an immediate result that almost always works perfectly. The fact that I know exactly how I'd write it means I can just glance over it and go \"Yup, that's what I would have done\".\n\nI'm not a developer. I maintain a few small function apps that ChatGPT isn't great at helping me with because of the context problems, but most of the coding I do is small repeatable shit that I've done a thousand times before, which is pretty much the perfect use case for ChatGPT.",

If you ask it to make recipes for a healthy diet and oh by the way no seafood, it has trouble applying the concept of what seafood is to the recipes it's making.

We need to teach, cultivate, or maintain \"everything literacy\" like most literate people did pre-internet, and most effectively in the 60s-90s amidst access to libraries & primary research. Humans need to know enough about any given thing to usually smell bullshit, and then be able to look into primary sources to sort out any claim which seems iffy.\n\nThere are some major challenges involved in going back to living this way. Survival, even via manual labor, didn't leave as many people as tapped out as it does now. It also relies upon curiousity & optimistic interest to feel worthwhile, which is diametrically opposed to the (wholly understandable) prevailing doomerism of the moment.\n\nOne example of why this is so difficult: Anti-vaccine beliefs are anti-science & anti-survival...but people in those circles sometimes mention the endocrine effects of plastics. The culprit is usually more from the plasticizer (chemical component(s) which determine mechanical properties of the plastic) but yeah, endocrine disruption from those is something research has been showing for decades. Anti-vaxers then attribute complex identity formation behaviors to these chemicals, which isn't well-founded in science. But the weird thing we've seen in all mammals in recent decades where the EXACT same amount of food from the same crop types, made the same way, results in more weight gain...that might be environmental endocrine disruption.\n\nHow in the hell would we ever expect someone to sort that out at a glance without a TON of non-vocational education simply intended to produce an educated person?",

              "body": "It's frustrating because I see the potential but these companies are dropping the ball hard when it comes to AI assistants. \n\nI recently started this audiobook for a book club I've started going to, and I was completely lost 2 chapters into a book called Ancillary Justice. \n\nSo this morning in the car on the way to work I turned on voice mode on ChatGPT and had a full on casual back and forth conversation about the various aspects of the book I was confused on, terminology and like the basic premise that I was having a hard time understanding. It knew exactly what I was asking and explained perfectly the things I was having a hard time understanding. It's as if I was asking the author themselves or someone who's obsessed with the book and lore. It even warned me when my questions were getting into spoiler territory with a quip like \"Well, you'll have to read on and find out!'\"\n\nAnd I also use ChatGPT a lot to help manage my ADHD, so I'll put in all the chores and errands I have to do during the weekend and it will give me an hour by hour schedule of all my tasks broken down, and then if things change or I go over the time limit I can tell it and it will reorganize the schedule to adapt. And it does this intelligently so if I say I need to do laundry, it will schedule my day so that I load up the laundry, then I can be doing something else while my laundry is washing.\n\nIf Alexa or Google Gemini could do that and make appointments, lists, reminders, and be able to turn on/off all my smart devices and adapt to my preferences, all in a conversational way? That's where I thought AI would go, and for some reason I have no idea why it seems so difficult for these companies to get that right.\n\nLike shit, imagine an AI at home where I can tell it to listen for the sound of a cat puking, then when I walk in the door it greets me and lets me know it thinks it heard the cat puke.",

The same thing is happenning here but on a larger scale because they are trying to shove machine learning into everything. It's just a bit early to be doing that but also everyone is afraid they'll get left behind so they have to. Kind of a mess. Definitely a rocky start but that will change.",

Not long ago, analysts were predicting that Apple Intelligence would start a \u201csupercycle\u201d of smartphone upgrades, with tons of new AI features compelling people to buy them. Amazon and Google and others were explaining how their ecosystems of devices would make computing seamless, natural, and personal. Startups were flooding the market with ChatGPT-powered gadgets, so you\u2019d never be out of touch. AI was going to make every gadget great, and every gadget was going to change to embrace the AI world.\n\nThis whole promise hinged on the idea that Siri, Alexa, Gemini, ChatGPT, and other chatbots had gotten so good, they\u2019d change how we do everything. Typing and tapping would soon be pass\u00e9, all replaced by multimodal, omnipresent AI helpers. You wouldn\u2019t need to do things yourself; you\u2019d just tell your assistant what you need, and it would tap into the whole world of apps and information to do it for you. Tech companies large and small have been betting on virtual assistants for more than a decade, to little avail. But this new generation of AI was going to change things.\n\nThere was just one problem with the whole theory: the tech still doesn\u2019t work. Chatbots may be fun to talk to and an occasionally useful replacement for Google, but truly game-changing virtual assistants are nowhere close to ready. And without them, the gadget revolution we were promised has utterly failed to materialize.",

Then instead of the dev having to implement all sorts of filters, e.g. your AIssistant could just access a database and craft the necessary function to your requirements itself. Or if none actually fit (like if the filters would show 0 options with all your criteria set), it could figure out the best approximate fit. \n\nMost things, it's better to just have a good software to do the task...",

                      "body": "I think this is an important point that is borne out by a lot of anecdotal evidence that coding AIs are good for prototypes. What you're describing is a sort-of prototyping of additional functionality for existing UIs. Once the value of the additional functionality has been determined, it can be converted to actual UI, which is more efficient to build, maintain, and use (rather than ad-hoc reinventing it with each query, as you do with LLMs).\n\nThis is a common pattern: some tech starts off as software and, once a pattern has been established, migrates down to either FPGA-based solutions, or even then hardware-based solutions. Sometimes those hardware solutions are for slightly less-generalized hardware like graphics cards. Almost nothing starts out as a hardware-based solution.\n\nThis notion of \"virtualization during development\" is already prevalent in industrial development, in which it's becoming ever more realistic to delay hardware development. It's acknowledged, though, that the ultimate goal is still to develop the hardware.\n\nThat's kind of the difference versus the AI hype: virtualization in industrial development is considered a tool that makes development of the end-product more efficient; it's not ever considered as the end-result itself.\n\nMany AI vendors make a different argument, selling their products as creating the end-product directly, rather than a tool to help you build the end-product. I'm not saying that everyone is making that argument and that no-one is making the \"AI as tool\" argument, but that the loudest hype, especially from the more uninformed sources, make the nonsensical argument, which, unfortunately, has a negative side-effect on the whole area.",

AI was going to make every gadget great, and every gadget was going to change to embrace the AI world\n\ni\u2019m sorry but you had to be incredibly stupid to fall for any of these empty promises. it was clear from the get go that this was only a ploy to get investment and drive stock prices up, at all costs",

It's definitely a lot better than the NFT boom for example.\n\nQuick example: quickly writing rough drafts of emails or helping you past writers block, or generating quick images for ideating/brainstorming. For a lot of semi-technical questions (think high school or college homework-level) it can quickly solve a problem for you or run a calculation that isn't easily solvable with a basic calculator or google search so that you don't have to, as long as you are knowledgable enough at the subject to check its work (which is usually quicker than doing it from scratch).\n\nAI code assistants also speed a lot of people up.\n\nIt's far too reductionist to say that the entire thing with AI is BS buzzwords even if gadget+AI from big tech companies hasn't worked out yet.",

Concept artists developing character sheets and using AI to place them in tons of dynamic scenes very quickly.  3D artists scanning in pictures to create textures with physically accurate rendering properties automatically applied, or build preliminary 3D models.  NPCs in video games, etc.  \n\nThe problem is that there aren't really many compelling specifically consumer-facing front end applications for gen AI yet.  It's both not reliable enough nor is it good enough yet.  The use cases are so marginal.  Like GenMoji.  The fun of emojis is finding the right one to express an emotion.  I don't want to create a hotdog on a skateboard.  I don't want to generate images, what's the point?  I don't need news headlines summarized more than they already are.  I don't want a computer to rewrite my emails.\n\nBut I can certainly see the eventual value in an AI agent once it's good enough.  Like I need to cleanup my email inbox.  It would be nice if I could just tell my phone, 'select and delete all promotional emails from [retail sender], exclude any receipts' and have it done instantly.  I've also used the AI assistant feature on Khan Academy and it was pretty nice, a lot of potential for stuff like that.",

AI generated 3D models have been getting better recently, however they have one massive problem, the topology is horrible. The AI does the fun part of sculpting, and then leaves the worst part to the real people, that being Retopology. It should be the other way around. The artists should do the actual artistic creation, while the computer handles the boring and annoying retopolgy. This is true with basically all elements of AI. Creating backstory for characters is fun, AI does it faster. Concept art is fundamental to designing any artistic project. It lets the artist explore in a million different ways. AI can do it faster and cheaper. AI animating tweens is bad because AI can't add style and substance. Its like the AI upscaled 60fps clip compilations on youtube. They look smudged, and the sense of movement and pacing is destroyed. Dragging and dropping pictures into a box just to have an AI do all the fun parts of creating art while I get stuck with the worst part of creating 3d assets sounds fucking horrible. \n\nAs an artist who has worked in the video game industry, AI isn't the future of games. Paying devs well, and not abusing them is the way to get better games.",

That 16x16 patch is then, literally, a \"token\" that you can compare just like language tokens. That embedding space is usually learned as the model trains instead of using a pretrained tokenizer/word embeddings, but you can do that too.\n\n  \nDifferent architectures do different things, but that was the foundational idea from the 2020 paper \"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\".\n\n  \nSometimes instead of doing this (16x16 -> 256 -> embed) you'll use convolutions to do the \"projection\" to the embedding space directly, which is what we see nowadays with a lot of transformer+cnn hybrid models.\n\n  \nThere are lots of ways to do it, but the concept of having a common embedding/token space still exists with ViTs (vision transformers)",

After tokenization and embedding, each 16x16 token (which after embedding could be whatever length/size you want) gets some kind of extra number(s) added to it representing its position in the image. This is so the model can weight how it interacts with other tokens while keeping in mind where they're all spatially located, this is called a positional embedding. Sometimes this is an absolute number specifying exactly where in the \"sequence\" (image) this token was, sometimes it's a learnable parameter.\n\nAfter that, in a classical ViT that just uses transformer blocks, everything is done via attention with no special care paid to the original 2D shape of the image other than that positional embedding we add. It's up to the model to learn during training whether or not the exact spatial ordering of the 16x16 tokens matters or not. Maybe you don't even need to care about how the pixels are arranged, or care very little, in order to classify a bird, the model just figures that out during training.\n\nCNNs, on the other hand, _definitely_ care about the spatial ordering of pixels, it's baked into how they work.\n\nThere are a lot of hybrid ViTs that use a CNN backbone to extract image features, then these features are the things that are actually broken up into blocks and turned into tokens instead of raw pixels. These are inherently 2D up to a point, but then usually they're flattened and the standard transformer stuff happens.\n\n> Also there's typically some masking in language models to avoid attending to tokens in the \"future\", I guess with vision you don't need this?\n\nThe masking in language models happens because usually you're training it for an \"autoregressive\" task - predict the next token. If you were simply training a transformer for something like sentiment analysis or spam detection, there would be no need to mask out future tokens.\n\nYou _can_ mask out image tokens, but that's usually for stuff like self-supervised learning, where instead of having labels for the data, you want to pre-train a model on a massive amount of unlabeled data. In this case, you might train the model to predict what's in those masked tokens with the assumption that whatever features it's learning to extract from the image in order to accomplish this task will transfer nicely to a new task later on when you train with labeled data for classification/detection/segmentation/whatever.\n\nFunnily enough this is pretty much exactly how LLMs are pretrained before they're fine-tuned for conversation. \"Continue the next token\" on an enormous amount of data, then fine-tuned on significantly less data with well-curated labels.",

Remember in the early 00's and 10's when those memes came out showing everything a phone could be? Camcorder, CD player, calculator, yada yada. The next gen push for that needs to be a medical tricorder. My phone needs to be so packed with sensors that I don't even know what they all do. Temp. Glucose. Heartrate. Infrared remotes, terrestrial radio. Infrared/heat camera lens so I can see where my house is losing heat. \n\nMake my phone more than just a 10-in-1 media device with a moderate battery, make it a truly indispensable daily tool.",
