If it is rated for 575W, you can bet there is a scenario where it pulls that much power and those conditions can exist for extended periods.\n\nIn my case, that's been fluid simulation recently, but even 330W, 93% of TDP, would still translate to 535W on a 575W card. 205W more.\n\nI do not mean that my setup is currently anywhere near 1.5kW.

Like I said, Cyberpunk 2077 pushes a bit over 330W, with spikes up to full TDP (355W) every so often. Alan Wake 2 is similar.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that as TDP increases, you get closer and closer to being able to max out an outlet, regardless of what your chosen load is. It doesn't matter if that's a fluid sim or AI stuff or a particularly heavy game, for the GPU, load is load, and with enough, you hit TDP.",

Going into power density and performance.\u00a0\n\nHis original statement was \u201cyou can\u2019t keep throwing more watts at the PC to get more power.\u201d A watt is a unit of power. So his statement is in effect \u201cyou can\u2019t throw more power at a PC to get more power\u201d. This is incorrect in several ways. More power enables you to run faster clocks resulting in more power.\u00a0",

The more power you're pulling in, the more heat you'll have to cool away. \n\nEventually you gotta start using the watts in a more effective manner. It's something that's happening. Smaller transistors are more power efficient and architectural improvements happen every generation, but not fast enough. We're still looking at higher power consumption every generation.",

              "body": "It's not. Component ARE getting more efficient but also smaller, so they cram more and more into the same size die to get more performance per surface area. This is the problem though: we're still using kinda the same architecture as lots of years ago so with every step we're getting maybe 10-15% more efficient than the last, but the market expect also an increase in performance so what do they do? They squeeze more and more stuff into the die so temperatures increases and resistance goes up, so they just increase the power limit and get more performance. That's why if you're conscious about your power budget the parameter you need to look for is performance per watt. And guess what? Most high end GPUs have worse performance per W than lower end ones.",
