I agree with you and they know this will stop people from purchasing but in the end, from their perspective (my coworker said) it allows them to continue to improve and advance  the app and product for longer while also keeping the same wearable instead of leaving the wearable behind as they improve. Like iPhone updates maybe? Idk if that\u2019s a good analogy. But I agree still with you. Not saying you\u2019re wrong. BUT also you can get the tech without the subscription\u2026 that\u2019s an option. Just kind of gets washed out when it\u2019s shadowed by something cooler in a way.",
