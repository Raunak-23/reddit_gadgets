A real assistant could deduct who \"my wife\" is and would know which number to use; THEN it's helpful and not just a verbal representation of a computer selection screen.\n\nAlso that these \"assistants\" need specific implementations for different apps makes them very useless.

Now it almost never gets the right song (10%), takes 3x longer to respond, and regularly times out.\n\nI can no longer send text messages through Siri because it always times out now. One of my favorite features we just saying \u201ctext [wife\u2019s name] and tell her I will be home in 15 minutes\u201d and it regularly worked. I have not gotten it to work yet with Apple Intelligence.\n\nAI can be really powerful in some specific use cases. It is great at recognizing patterns which is why it has shown positive results helping doctors catch breast cancer early. The problem is that they are forcing it on everything because of VC hype, and it is so tiring because it just makes so many things slower and worse. Google search is significantly slower and now gives me the wrong answer at the top with every search.",

People will generally reply that new Siri isn't actually a thing yet and that all they really changed was the animation. Other people like you find it to be a downgrade compared to old Siri in that it's less reliable.\n\nAs for my own personal experience since enabling Apple Intelligence, it seems to work about as well as old Siri when it comes to its capabilities, but I think it's able to handle me fumbling sentences better when I tried testing it on and off. I don't know if I'm just the one person that is getting a good experience out of this, but as of now my Siri seems to just handle mistakes better.",

They are created by people and they follow given archetypes. You can definitely train yourself to better deal with reasoning problems just as you can lateral thinking problems etc. You will therefore perform better, but arguably someone reasoning their way through a problem cold is doing a better job at reasoning than someone who just recognises the type of problem, and familiarity with IQ testing has been shown to influence results and given they are supposed to test people\u2019s ability to deal with a novel problem, clearly compromises their validity.\n\nThe AI is just the extreme version of this.  It recognises the kind of problem and predicts the answer.  That\u2019s not reasoning. That\u2019s not how LLM works. Clearly.",

You\u2019re missing the whole point of the analogy. The seismograph is an objective test as well. All objective tests are subject to false positives! That\u2019s the very nature of testing. You\u2019re talking here about a machine designed to replicate a person. It\u2019s akin to wobbling the seismograph yourself and calling yourself an earthquake. It\u2019s meaningless.\n\nI get the seismograph analogy but it is entirely misapplied here! ARC-AGI isn\u2019t vulnerable to random false positives the way a simple diagnostic tool might be. The tasks are intentionally complex, requiring repeated application of abstract patterns to novel problems. A single \u201cwobble\u201d wouldn\u2019t produce consistent success across many tasks, which is what o3 demonstrates according to ARC Prize.\n\nIf an AI candidate system consistently passes ARC-AGI tasks, it\u2019s not a false positive, it\u2019s a pattern of correct problem-solving. This is distinct from randomly triggering a sensor. A more fitting analogy would be someone consistently solving puzzles under test conditions, the results aren\u2019t \u201cmeaningless\u201d because they reflect problem-solving ability, regardless of whether the solver is a human or AI.\n\n> Again, the randomness was not the point. The objectivity is not the point. You\u2019re choosing to define reasoning in terms of the test, which is not how tests work! Tests do not define what reasoning is any more than they determine what psychopathy is. Randomness is just one of many ways that a test could be fooled. AI is seeded with randomness, it\u2019s just then directs that randomness. Testing is flawed. Testing cannot be definitional. That\u2019s the fallacy at the heart of your argument\n\nThis misrepresents ARC\u2019s purpose. ARC-AGI isn\u2019t defining reasoning in a philosophical sense, it\u2019s providing an operational measure of abstract problem-solving, which is precisely how reasoning is assessed in humans! Intelligence tests and reasoning benchmarks are tools to gauge problem solving performance, not to dictate metaphysical definitions.\n\nBy dismissing AI\u2019s success as \u201ctesting is flawed,\u201d you\u2019re essentially arguing that any attempt to measure reasoning, in humans or AI is invalid. If ARC can\u2019t demonstrate reasoning in AI, then it also can\u2019t demonstrate reasoning in humans. At that point, the discussion isn\u2019t about AI but about invalidating the very concept of testing for reasoning.\n\n> You\u2019re confusing human reasoning with predictive models. It will never be the same. The whole phrase \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 is a misnomer, in that it works in an entirely different way to human intelligence \u2013 it\u2019s just machine learning\n\nI\u2019m not conflating the two, I\u2019m arguing that the mechanism doesn\u2019t matter if the results demonstrate problem solving! Chess engines don\u2019t play chess like humans do but their performance exceeds that of grandmasters. We don\u2019t dismiss their strategic output because the method is different.\n\nSimilarly, ARC-AGI doesn\u2019t require AI to \u201cthink like a human.\u201d It tests for the ability to solve novel problems through generalisation. If AI succeeds by recognising patterns, that aligns closely with how humans reason. The difference in internal process doesn\u2019t invalidate the external result.\n\n>It can never transcend human abilities, just replicate them quickly. You\u2019re anthropomorphising it because you fundamentally don\u2019t understand what it is\n\nThis is demonstrably false! Systems like AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero have exceeded human performance in games that require strategic reasoning by identifying patterns humans had never recognised. Similarly, AI has generated scientific insights by finding patterns across massive datasets beyond human capacity, I mean AlphaFold revolutionised biology by predicting protein structures with remarkable accuracy, a feat that earned its creators the Nobel Prize this year!\n\nI\u2019m not anthropomorphising AI, I\u2019m acknowledging that solving abstract, novel problems is what reasoning looks like, regardless of whether it stems from neural networks or neurons! If o3 outperforms the average human on ARC-AGI, dismissing that as \u201cnot reasoning\u201d feels more like redefining reasoning to exclude AI arbitrarily.",

Normal auto complete might only use the datatype of the variable you are putting the value into to make suggestions, but AI might use the variable name to make suggestions. For example, if I have an numeric variable named \"height\", regular auto complete will start suggesting random function calls that return numbers. But AI will suggest functions called \"getHeight\".\n\nAlso, something coders need to do a ton is copy/paste the exact same code, then change a couple of things. For example, I have a function to get some value out of the database. Now I want to write 10 more functions to each get a different value out of the database. They will be mostly the same looking, but the data type its being wrapped in will be different, and obviously the column name and maybe the table name in the db will be different. AI is extremely good at this. All I need to do is name the function, and 99% of the time, AI will generate the entire function for me perfectly.",

Lots of people in this thread talking about invasion of privacy, loss of intellectual property, etc.  At the end of the day though, your average consumer doesn't care about those topics.  My proof?  The billions of humans who have *already* bought privacy invading, property-diluting phones.\n\nThe issue is that companies want to charge more money for an 'AI phone,' and can't enumerate what that phone actually does for you, what benefit it brings beyond 5 minutes of novelty.  And that, consumers can't abide.  You're telling consumers that you improved the processor, added more RAM, increased the battery, but all of that effort is going to a feature I'm not interested in, can't benefit from, and can't turn off?\n\nThat's the deal-killer for consumers.",

For example, one might tell you Arnold Schwarzenegger had a role in Indiana Jones, and when you insist it\u2019s wrong, it just apologizes. Or Google Gemini outright refuses to tell you the time, for instance.\nAnd no, the prices are not the same. The so-called 'AI' functions (already a marketing buzzword and an inappropriate name) increase device costs and are presented as selling points. But no one really wants these features because they\u2019re just party tricks that don\u2019t truly add any value.",

That said the new AMD \"AI\" branded SOCs are, \"AI\" / NPU features aside, pretty good high efficiency modern processors. That said so are the non AI versions lol.\n\nWill probably pick one of those up if / when they go on sale. And will just slap linux on it. Or roll with win11 and ofc turn all of the copilot etc features off. Hopefully these things are sufficently unpopular that they may see some nice price reductions. Again, the stats on the intel + amd \"AI\" branded SOCs are pretty good.\n\nThat said, yeah, I'd fully expect the snapdragon laptops to be hot garbage. Anyone unfortunate enough to get stuck with one of those (and/or the all soldered on DRAM that seems to be getting a push this generation) is getting scammed.\n\nApple ARM hardware + software ecosystem != windows. Or even linux, for that matter. lol\n\nTSMC 3nm x64 SOCs though are great. And will deliver very \"apple\" esque performance and power efficiency (ish) irregardless. Plus the \"AI\" stuff means we got a naming convention refresh across intel + AMD. Which I'm honestly not mad about, \"AI\" marketing aside this generation of chips is at least *finally* good enough to warrant it. Assuming you're not doing silly things with those SOCs like wasting TDP on the neural engine cores... Or any of the stupid privacy invading (and as per usual almost certainly piss poor security) bullshit that microsoft put into win11.\n\nAnd to be clear here, the NPU hardware will almost certainly *eventually* be a nice to have \u2013 a la the apple M-series \u2013 but only for very niche and specific applications. ie stuff like new photoshop / image editor features that can make full use of that hardware. I'm gonna hazard a guess that you are most certainly *not* going to be running flux (or what have you) on a 15W laptop with 8GB of soldered on RAM though. And nevermind the memory transfer speeds / bandwidth. Unless they also (intel/amd) elected to copy apple (and discrete gpus) there.",

There's a reason that open source software rarely achieves mainstream dominance. It's just too much hassle. Most users are not going out of their way to use an AI service, they're just using what is 'free' to them or it's being forced upon them. the cost for it is their data. They're not going to switch to an open source alternative because that's not what's being provided to them right now and they're just not going to go out of their way to find one. For the users that are specifically using an AI service, e.g. paying for ChatGPT, they're using it to save money or time elsewhere and the services are dirt cheap in that regard. E.g. a company using an AI chatbot to be a first line of communication with users visiting their website. This can save serious staff costs. Or, as another example, my wife uses ChatGPT extensively to help her write emails. She'll put in a rough draft, ask for it to be more professional or say she wants to get a process documented and writes down a rough version of that and then gets it to write it up in a structured neat matter. It saves her *so much* time, it's insane and the cost is nothing, in business terms, at $30 a month.",

Apple intelligence keeps wanting to summarize text messages and notifications which are already pretty succinct. Alexa can\u2019t consistently tell me the weather or realize I only want updates on certain sports teams. Our daily lives and activities are not so rote that they are predictable. What we use the internet for isn\u2019t easily predictable and the auto fill search is pointless. Today, at least, an ai personal assistant is not that, it really is just an information scrapping tool to get more from us and no one wants or needs that.

Instead I think the intent is for that to supplement your camera and to watch your screen and help you with \"productivity\" and \"creativity\" but really its spying on you and just doesn't do anything special that you can't do for free on an old non-AI cheap laptop by just opening a browser and going to ChatGPT or another site.

      "body": "While many comments here make good points re: the current state of AI in general, I think most people here either didn\u2019t read the actual article (shocking for Reddit, I know) or didn\u2019t understand it. It has more to do with the stock market\u2019s valuation of AI PC (in this case, Micron\u2019s recent earnings miss) than whether AI in general, as it currently exists in our lives, sucks or not. \n\nThe market hyped the shit out of everything AI related and ultimately thought AI PC demand would be huge in the same way everything with \u201cAI\u201d in the title got bought up, but it turns out people aren\u2019t as interested in buying PCs simply for the AI capabilities on the machines themselves as the market thought. Surprise surprise, the market overvalued something AI related. \n\nIt turns out, people who buy a PC bc of its AI capabilities right now are for the most part buying it bc the AI hardware on the new PC is just better in general than older PC models. \n\nI suppose in some ways this is a comment on the state of current AI in general. Think about it. What do you do on your computer that\u2019s NOT entirely internet based? It would be next level AI that just doesn\u2019t really exist yet, so there\u2019s no demand for it. Also, maybe that\u2019s just not where the AI revolution will take place anyway, who knows. \n\nIt might be a moot point anyway. The more interesting comment in the article for me as a non-tech person who frequently trades MU is, going forward, people aren\u2019t necessarily going to buy a PC for the AI, but you\u2019re also not going to buy a non AI PC\u2014because why would you? If you\u2019re going to upgrade your PC, you\u2019ll probably just buy the best/better model, which is AI. That makes sense to me, and the article\u2019s comparison to multi core processors and solid state hard drives rings true. I remember when those were totally new and cool and more expensive. In the very beginning, a handful of tech savvy people bought the PCs bc of that capability, but in not too much time, it just became what you expected in a PC. \n\nAnd this is the interesting point as it relates to the current state of AI in the world. If/when AI gets to the point where there is AI that\u2019s good enough to have solutions and thus demand for end user PCs, even if that\u2019s the case, if AI PC has at that point just become part of what we already expect for PCs, then there never really would\u2019ve ever existed true demand for AI PC in and of itself, and in that sense, it might be dead on arrival. Ie, when that happens, AI PC demand will basically be the same as PC demand in general. Which is more or less the analyst\u2019s point. if you\u2019re an investor, you might have to reevaluate how you\u2019re valuing this revenue.",

They write it as storing passwords in plain text and checking if a user's entered password is the same as whats stored on a database. Yes, it works, but its not correct. The correct method being to hash the password, then store that hash to compare to later.\n\nWhat you get out of chatgpt might function, but it also may not be correct. I'm pretty adept at programming and I've seen chatgpt spit out functional yet completely incorrect code before. And a lot of FOSS repos are seeing similar types of commits from brand new accounts that try to be helpful, but end up trying to pull request garbage into the main branch that technically works, but is written completely wrong.\n\nI'd highly recommend looking at places like code academy, github, and youtube to find examples of proper code for your use case, then compare it to chatgpt's output to see if theres room for improvement.",

The current generation of AI-enabled PCs is laying the groundwork for what could become transformative in the next few years.\n\nTake NPUs (Neural Processing Units), for instance\u2014these chips are still in their infancy when it comes to real-world applications. Features like real-time voice transcription, on-device language translation, and advanced personalization are just the beginning. However, the challenge lies in making these features indispensable to the average user.\n\nI think part of the issue is the messaging. Right now, [AI PCs](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/lenovoauraedition/) feels more like a niche add-on rather than a core experience. Once developers build software that truly capitalizes on this hardware\u2014think AI-driven creativity tools, seamless automation, or real-time optimization\u2014we might see a shift.\n\nIt\u2019s less about hype and more about patience.
