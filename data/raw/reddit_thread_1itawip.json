That\u2019s the interesting part.\n\nNow obviously profit margin is going to be the biggest motivator when operating at iPhone scale, but if I had to guess, the security implications of building their own modem also factored into their decision. Malicious or compromised modems can both snoop on your traffic and transmit their own with virtually no opportunities for detection.

If I would start to do what you do and compare the E with the Pro models you would find even more differences.\n\nThe iphone 16e may be a \u201cgood\u201d phone if you live in US. In Europe this phone starts from 700\u20ac while the pixel 8a started from 525\u20ac at launch that is almost 200\u20ac difference. \n\nAnd the Pixel 9a hasn,t even been announced. That would have been a better comparasion if we really want it to compare it to the iPhone 16 lineup.\n\nThat\u2019s not a budget phone when a second hand iphone 14pro is miles better than this iPhone 16e with at least 120hz display, you know, cheap things that you can find on a 250$ phone nowadays considering that 99% of interactions happen on screen and not looking and the back of the phone and saying, yeah nice glass. And all that AI stuff? Give me a break, this is just a glorified Google Lens that should work even on an iPhone XR from 2018.\n\nWhat the iPhone 16e lacks is the dinamic island and second camera.

                      "body": "I can't find an article that spells this out, but I suspect the reason we don't get side mounted fingerprint sensors is that HP owns the patent. HP Elitebook convertible tablet had the swiping fingerprint sensor on the side of the swiveling lid. Android phones starting having under screen sensors, but it ruined screen protectors, worked much worse, had no physical feedback. Sony smartphones had the sensor on the side everywhere else in the world, but for the US market, nothing. However, something changed recently, the redesigned base model iPad has a side sensor rather than face ID. Maybe Apple paid up, maybe that's why HP is buying up the remains of the Human AI Pin, extort Apple some more? This is all speculation.",
