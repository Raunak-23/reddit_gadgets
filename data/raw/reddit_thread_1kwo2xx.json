          "body": "Likely trying to achieve the non square look of CRT screens. Technically speaking a CRT does not have a pixel resolution, it has a raster line resolution that we then interpreted as a pixel resolution when LCDs became good enough.\n\n\nA result of the scan lines on the screen made the \"pixels\" look taller on screen than they were wide.\n\n\nTo be honest, the Mac still created graphics that were pixel based, but showing them on a CRT screen altered them ever so slightly. Nobody thought much about it at the time, as it was normal - like smoking in a McDonald's or hanging guns in the back window of your truck in high school. It was just 'normal'...\n\n\nSome of the first C64 art programs I used looked right on screen, but printed 'squished' because my old Okidata printer did print square 'pixels'.\n\n\n\n\nI am paraphrasing because neither DPI on paper nor raster lines on screen are true pixels.\n\n\n\n\nIF that is what the artist was trying to do, then I think that is very cool!",
