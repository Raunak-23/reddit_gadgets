I've never encountered an ISP yet that doesn't let you opt out of it, but they'll drag their feet on it and try to be a huge pain in the ass if you want to \"Bring Your Own Device.\"  They'll send regular reminders about how much better your speed could be if you used their company branded equipment, even if you're literally using the commercial version of the exact model that would give you minus their sticker.\n\nI had one ISP a decade ago that would send you the router and you'd have to ship it back at your own expense and then separately call them and request the line item be removed from your bill because you weren't interested in renting it from them, so it's really petty bullshit.\n\nOver one person it's not a huge amount of money, but they pull these scams at scale on millions of people, and the average person has not the slightest clue what a router or a modem really even is except \"box that makes wifi.\"\n\nSo... lots of people pay many times more than their outdated garbage networking equipment is worth to \"rent\" it from their ISP, and then get charged fees if they lose the equipment or it gets damaged.  My mom got slapped with a $120 fee for a $70 router/modem combo that got stolen out of a parked car, which she had already paid $600 for over the last decade.",

The extra hardware was like $120 when I got it on a group buy.  Anyone interested can google WAS-110 bypass + AT&T and go down the rabbit hole.

There are some users there who are very quick to update, and will often comment on any issues which have been found. \n\nI also check the official support pages on the ASUS website but sometimes that can take a while to update. A Google search with the model of your router plus firmware for example: **ASUS AX86U Pro firmware** should find it. \n\nUsually I\u2019ll check from the GUI if I login but that\u2019s not very often. I don\u2019t know how quickly it will update if auto firmware upgrade is turned on but I\u2019m personally not keen on it updating automatically even though I\u2019m in a hurry to get the new firmware installed.\n\nEdit: just make sure that google is taking you to the correct ASUS website and section as it can be a bit unreliable and random for some reason.",
