Unfortunately by trying to get all specific, Congress left a massive loophole. Companies just switched to using none of the battery chemistries named in the law. Since it doesn't specifically name lithium-ion or lithium-ion-polymer, manufacturers can seal those inside phones, tools etc.\n\nI'd love to see that law amended to change the language specifying battery chemistries to rechargeable cell or battery of any type\".",

But somehow they get more and more capable as they go. The rumors are that Apple will ditch the Lighting/USB-C port.\n\nPersonally I just don't like to be at the bleeding edge of the changes, so I try to get the last model that does have say a CD drive, and I'll have it for three or four years into the era when most new computers don't have one before finally buying a new computer  that also doesn't have one. Because by then it is normal to not have one and I won't be missing out. Still, I'll keep the old computer in a drawer so that at some point in the future I can still access my pile of old CDs, also in drawers and probably riddled with bit rot.",

Computers stopped having floppy readers, but because they were replaced with CD drives, which fill the same niche. Computers stopped widely having CD drives, but only because they now have more USB ports, which now fill the same niche. My graphics card doesn't have DVI, but it has DisplayPort and HDMI. My computer, which I built just a few years ago, still has a CD-ROM drive (well, a Blu-ray burner but I do read and burn CDs with it semi-regularly), and will continue to have one for the foreseeable future. The handy thing about PCs is that they are actually modular, and you can add pretty much whatever functionality you want. I could install a floppy reader right now and it would work fine (and I kept a floppy reader in my computer until around 2011). I will also say, I will *never* buy a phone without a USB port. I almost exclusively use wired headphones, and at least even without a headphone jack I can still use a dongle. What would the replacement even be? Wireless charging only, and file transfer or system debugging via bluetooth, or worse yet, the Internet, only? A company making their products worse in the name of \"progress\" deserves no defense.",

All I said prior to your reply was that Apple won't let it become standard by not publishing the specifications, and in response to that you came in talking about how it could readily be reverse engineered, which I never claimed it couldn't be. You're just arguing to argue.",

Also in practice different manufacturers flash may have different requirements (e.g. failure rates / wear leveling) which becomes much harder to do with shared controllers.",

Nvidias gpu price hikes since the 3000 series have been insane, especially now that the improvements they make from gen to gen are marginal. Best we can do is buy used, but the crazy fandom and consumerism around the latest gpus doesn't help, especially from youtube tech channels that seem to always be pushing out the latest gotta-have-gpu from nvidia. \n\nIntel has in the past resorted to scummy practices when they have a large part of market share(like disabling hyperthreading on their lower end lineups just because they can), but as of late, AMD seems to keep them in check as a viable alternative, so for the moment im not worried there. \n\nMicrosoft isn't without fault but compared to apple they're angels. Windows always works on most hardware, and windows licenses don't lock you out of OS features just because you upgraded hardware that deviates from manufacturer's(dell/lenovo/hp/etc) original spec.\n\nGoogle..just as bad as apple. Their increasingly invasive war on our privacy has pushed me to find alternatives where I can, but their dominance on web services shows what happens when one corporation claims victory on the market, we have no where else to go. I abandoned google search a long time ago(duckduckgo user), I use firefox instead of chrome, I tried abandoning gmail by self-hosting my own email server, but the big email players don't trust our self-hosted emails so much and mark all of our mail as spam, so I've given up on that front. Maps services insnt that much better, we're stuck using apple or google maps now, because the small players while decent can't keep up with the accuracy of the top two.\n\nHowever apple leads the forefront on anti repair practices, and holds a draconian grip on apps while hiding behind the pretext that it is all done in the name of security. EU finally forced them to allow 3rd party apps on the iphone that don't have to go through their pay-us-first-to-be-on-the-app-store toll booth, but in the US there is still no such thing. Replacing components disables features on the phone. There are videos of phone repairsmen removing iphone camera, even with another iphones camera, and the iphone camera features are degraded, which means 3rd party repair shops can't even use original apple parts to fix your iphone, you are forced to go to apple care.",

For this MacBook (also I was wrong its a 2013 not 2012) It has a replaceable NVMe SSD (but to your point, it does use a proprietary key slot so I did have to get an adapter to upgrade the internal SDD) It has 16GB of RAM (soldered so thats another point in favor of your argument)...and while Apple was the first to solder down RAM on the Board, can we be certain that when other companies started doing so it was entirely because of Apple set a precedent?..Maybe so maybe so...I suppose the soldering of RAM bothers me far less with Apple Silicon Macs in comparison to the x86 Macs because there is no performance justification with those older setups.....Idk man, I genuinely do feel like I could make this M series machine last 12 years if I absolutely had to, but realistically I will want to upgrade far sooner than that just based on the year to year performance gains the M chips seem to be achieving (I fully expect the performance gains to normalize at some point but do you not find it impressive that even just a node enhancement from N3 to N3E saw a 20% performance gain?)....Anyways, im sorry for coming across like an ass before...just been a rough week depressing week....I'll agree with you that Apple is by no means a \"consumer-friendly\" company....I'll still call them out when they implement anti-consumer proprietary bullshit like this M4 series proprietary SSD module...but at the same time I'll give them props for making it modular and hence in theory user replaceable in the future solely in hopes that the positive feedback encourages them do less anti-consumer shit in the future...thats pretty impressive with the $600 Lenovo lasting that long, I suppose laptops on the PC side have been improving too which is something I didnt consider..anyways, cheers",

Putting the controller into the SoC mitigates this issue as the SoC already has high cooling focus.\n* There are crap tons of NAND structures and controllers. All with their own separate problems and issues. The benefit of this is that manufacturers can innovate without having to worry about the controller on the mainboard or SoC. But the downside of this is.... now you have all these controllers that each of unique operating characteristics, caveats, defects.\n* You can upgrade the NAND Controller without having to upgrade your whole SSD. Of course, upgrading your CPU so you can get a new NAND Controller might sounds weird.... but what I mean is that the different iterations of Apple silicon can use the same 'SSD' card things with new iterations of the controller. (So it solves a potential supply chain issue.)\n* Maybe there is benefits to having the controller closer to the CPU? It's now way closer. I doubt it's even on a PCIe bus at all. Just like we used to have memory controllers on the motherboard, there can be benefits to having controllers 'closer to home'. What if your NAND controller can put things directly into memory or even directly into cache. Even if they aren't doing this now, having the controller on the SoC means that a new iteration of Apple SoC could do this and use the already existing NAND \n\nI'm not sure which of these are actual true benefits, but I could see them being the case.\n\n(Of course, I could come up with a list of downsides just as easy. I'm not saying this is the right choice but it's not black and white.)",

The reasoning was Apple didn\u2019t see people getting the faster chips, and decided to go a cheaper route since those were the models selling.\n\nHowever if we had to say they were the last of the \u201cgood\u201d ones I would kind of agreed. 2012 models iirc also did not allow for expanding storage like the 2011 models did. 2014 might have had the soldered RAM, but the 2011 to 2012 swap most definitely was the start of the downfall.\n\n(However do note that I was busy with college, so the model years may be a ahead of the year I am saying, ***BUT*** I know for a fact it was 2011/2012 I was looking at these computers. We could possibly getting a disconnect if Apple uses model years like car manufacturers do.

They all had HDD connections, but the 2012 had the option for a Fusion Drive so that would imply they also added their proprietary PCIe connector for the 2012.\n\nAdditionally, the base model 2012 was the exact same $599 as the base model 2011. Again, it was the 2014 model that had a weaker base CPU for a cheaper price, soldered RAM, etc. The 2012's were better in every way except base model GPU.",

I realized immediately, this is another Apple profit-ploy, get you to buy the maxed-out machine upfront, because you can't improve it downstream. Always thinkin', you guys.\n\nEDIT: Well, now that the downvote brigade has done their usual dance, let me say I've been very happy with this machine, one of the more reliable and long-lived computers I've owned, in a lot of years of owning computers.
