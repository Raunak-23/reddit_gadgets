It's sitting in the corner of my office because I still can't make myself throw it away, just in case I ever find a way to fix it. I *loved* that printer, and as, a work printer, it put out a lot of pages in 14 years. Brother toner, fine. Generic toner, fine. Fancy paper, fine. Cheap copy paper, fine. It didn't care what I threw at it; it just printed. Let the toner get so low I could barely see the prints, it didn't care; just kept spitting them out. I bought a new one in 2013 because we had budget surplus, but ended up giving it to a colleague and using my old one.",

I've maxed out it's RAM, installed a 100 megabit EIO JetDirect print server card, installed a PostScript module (which reduces the max RAM installable) and replaced the control panel because the left direction on one of the rocker buttons didn't work.\n\nI haven't bought a hard drive for the 2nd EIO slot because I don't have a use for it. I would like to get another huge paper tray to stack under the one already under it. The 500 sheet 4th \\*trays\\* are readily available at a decent price, but the whole mechanism the tray slides into (which only seem to be available with a tray) - sellers want some gold for those.\n\nThe really neat part is it still works with Windows 11 just as it did with Windows 2000 through 10.

              "body": "Reminds me of when Xerox tried selling inkjet printers. They had Sharp rebrand some of theirs. Sharp was paid to erase their name from the software and firmware, replacing it with Xerox.\n\nThe problem was the printers were crap. The printheads ALL failed. It'd start with a few nozzles quitting on one color, followed soon by the whole color quitting. The ones with a scanner developed a problem where they'd make a yellow stripe in everything. Quite oddly the cure was to take the thing apart, loosen the lens in its housing and rotate it about 1/4 turn. I took the lens out, couldn't see how a lens with no specific orientation could change how the sensor sensed the light reflected off what was being scanned, or how it could work fine out of the box then suddenly cause a yellow streak. But I put it back in, rotated from its factory position, and no more streak.  \n  \nThen the printhead failed. By then Xerox had washed their hands of the whole mess and printheads were not available, even from Sharp. Xerox had them alter the design a bit so they wouldn't interchange. IIRC the ink tanks were cross compatible.\n\nBut the trouble started even before the printers went on sale. Xerox advertised them as 1200 DPI AND compatible with Windows XP. Never mentioning the caveat that they only made drivers for Windows 9x and provided a \"feature reduced\" driver to Microsoft to be included with Windows 2000 and XP - which only supported up to 600 DPI. Might even have cut the scanning resolution too.\n\nI suspect Xerox lost money on them. If so they deserved every penny lost. I'd hoped there would be a class action lawsuit over their false advertising. Nothing anywhere mentioned they only did 1200 DPI with Windows 95 OSR2 with the USB update, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows Me.\n\nThe lack of full drivers for XP smacked of an overly long development cycle and Xerox had to push them out anyway after the release of XP to try and make their money back.",

There is approximately zero percent chance anyone would do this unless they knew what they were doing.

It's not a setting you can clutz around with and enable on the printer, or on the router even.

I used to work for a company developing a WiFi router (I was actually the lead software engineer on the project). We did a ton of market research before we started, and it turns out 70% of users didn't even know their WiFi password. 90% didn't even know that there was a different set of credentials to log into manage their router's settings. If a troubleshooting step told them to forward a port, I guarantee you that 99.99+% of users would just give up there. Even if they did manage to log into their router, every router's settings are laid out differently, and it would be damn near impossible for them to figure out how to forward a port unless they already know about port forwarding. And those people likely already know the implications of port forwarding and why you shouldn't do it to a printer.",

These days most people have questionable IoT devices on the same network - cameras, smart scales, smart TVs, smart lights, old Android devices that no longer receives security updates, you name it... MANY of these are vulnerable, often the company that makes them no longer exists and they no longer get firmware/OS updates. If one of those gets compromised, the malware gets installed there and it can easily scan the local network for other devices, find your Brother printer, access its web interface to grab the serial number, and you're now hacked.\n\nThe solution is to not only have a firewall, but to segment the network internally so that IoT devices cannot see one another, and if they *must* see each other for some reason, then restrict the ingress and egress ports to only those which they need.",

So now you have to make sure that if nothing else that TV you have in the conference room can see the router same with the phone. BUT, the other network jacks have to be on another VLAN.\n\nYes there are other ways but how many network admins are going to go down that rabbit hole.\n\nOtherwise you will have equipment that you have ZERO control of sitting on the same network as everything else.\n\nYes, it's an edge case but it's something else to think about.",

A resume would be sent that had exit codes built into it that would compromise the printer.  When HR departments received resumes they would typically print them.  And from there the printer was a backdoor with a reverse ssh tunnel.  It would capture PII data off every future document printed by a department that works heavily with PII.  No antivirus for printers, so the exploit could go on for months or years unnoticed if the company does not have good network inspection policies.  Eventually the PDFs could be detected as occasionally they would brick the printers.  But it\u2019s still an effective way to trench in as an attacker.  We still don\u2019t have great defenses against firmware exploits like this.",
