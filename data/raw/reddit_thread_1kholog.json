If you've been working dcops for 7 years without even being able to manage an A+ then... I mean, jeez, talk about bad management.\n\n>10 year experience as, it looks like, and auto-mechanic?\n\n#***You've just activated my trap card!***\n\nA+, net+, sec+, CYSA+ CCNA/P, CCST, CISSP, and 8 years towards my pension baby! No ASE though. \n\nI do work on cars for myself, family, and friends, but 10 years as an auto mechanic is still probably the worst guess you could have made based on my post history. Marine mechanic might make sense, hell 40 years as an accountant would too. But an auto mech? I made a single post asking about the best way to fix a rust hole in my girlfriend's truck. Yeah, I'm a real experienced mechanic all right. \n\nBut yes yes, carry on. Mock me for my interest in learning and working with my hands! The fat 3k check I just got for 2 days labor (undercharged, but I'm a nice guy) repairing a boat is in absolute shreds from such a tongue lashing.\n\nWould you like to mock me for my other interests and hobbies too? Electronic engineering is for losers too, right? Designing PCBs to improve my life sounds like something for the *poors*. Please tell me component level repair is still cool?!\n\n---\n\nEdit: I don't really take many opportunities to boast, I'm generally humble to the point of it being a problem. But when life gives you some pompous ass on a knee-high horse and the opportunity to dunk on them... It feels good, like a little mini therapy session.",

Demand drops in the European market, fewer sales but overall make more profit to offset the losses in the US market due to the actions of US leadership.

Can you maybe go without updating your phone for a few models? Unfortunately, for a while there I kept outpacing hard drive capacity so had to keep upgrading every few years. At first, I had 2 x 4TB hard drives but then I was running out of room unfortunately the next generation only went to 6TB so I got two of those then I was running out of room I had to get 2 8TB then 2 12TB finally it took longer to fill those and by the time I needed new hard drives they were finally in the 20TB limits so I purchased two of those and now am set with two 20TB hard drives. But I have not updated my phone for a few gens now I have a Samsung Galaxy 20 Ultra and have not upgraded since the later generations removed the Micro SD card as many companies use that as a way to sell us Cloud Storage. I am sticking with m,y phone for the moment as I have a 1TB micro SD card and 500MB internal storage whereas the next generation only have 256GB 500GB internal but no ability to add additional storage. I feel if we complain about it and don't buy new phones they will need to lower their prices a bit for future releases. But most people can't wait for the latest next best thing and cannot go without the next upgrade even if some parts are a downgrade.",

Unfortunately, grants rarely take into account data storage and retention. \n\n>Also if your backup is just an online duplicate in the same building it doesn't do anything in case of fire, electrical surge, or ransomware.\n\nI understand all of these and I've mitigated them to the best of my ability and resources. Simply put, there are limits to how much I can do and the rest are risks I've communicated. \n\nFire and electrical surge are unlikely. Both are on power filtering battery backups hooked into on the universities redundant power circuit and it's unlikely a power surge would manage to get through all of that on isolated circuits and go so far as to irreparably damage the hard drives (best it might kill the computer power supply). \n\nFire is unlikely to take out both. It's a massive and relatively new building and the wings are completely isolated from each other with multiple layers of fire breaks. It's not a continuous linear building. If a fire manages to take out both servers, that will be the least of our worries given that we'll have also lost hundreds of independant academic labs, an insurmountable number of irreplaceable research equipment and biological samples including cells lines and bacterial strains, and hundreds of millions of dollars in lab equipment. The data loss for our single lab at that point would just be a footnote and we'd functionally be shut down anyways. Offsite or a different building unfortunately isn't an option. But again, it would take deliberate action combined with a complete breakdown of fire suppression efforts to have both servers lost in a fire (famous last words a la Titanic I know).\n\nRansomware is an issue, but it's not a simple 1:1 copy, rather the backup is encrypted immutable snapshots on different underlying platforms. While I could see the server being hit by ransomware, it would more likely take a targeted attack to take out both systems which is also very unlikely. \n\nAs I said though, there are definitely a lot of flaws here, but I don't have the ability for a perfect solution, and my PI is well aware of the issues but is also powerless to force the institution to help adopt a better solution. Best I can do is my best to mitigate them.",

These are NAS and small servers oriented products, so they think that the EU has lower deployment of those than the US and that would be fair to assume, although pretty questionable. But smaller than the UK, with a much smaller population and an economy that's less healthy than both the EU and the US?

              "body": "The investment into startup is kinda a flawed metric: London is the one of the world capitals of banking and therefore a ton of money flows through it. But you need to look where those capitals go: if a startup get a billion pounds in fundings in London but they're mostly spent in India to gain market share, that money is counted as staying into the UK while in reality is going abroad. It's tricky to get a fair accounting in a reality so extreme like London.\n\n\nBut the UK economy being healthier than the EU? Man, that's just not what's happening: its economy is basically stagnant since 2007 (+8.1% growth) while the EU grew 50% than the UK more even with a country in default and 2 the risked it (+12.6%). Germany in the same period grew 19% and France (which is the worrying one) only 3.5%, but Poland grew 47%, the Netherlands 17.6% and Ireland (same problem as the UK though) 109%. The one default, Greece, is sitting at -33%. The two that risked it are also pretty bad, but Spain (-3.2%) seems to be have recovered and the real disaster is Italy because its gdp still has not recovered from 2008 (-6.4%) even if it was not hit by the crisis that bad: its economy is just slowly withering due much more systemic problems and it still is the third largest EU economy.\n\n\nSo no, the UK economy is not in the drain yet, but it's not as healthy as EU and it is much, much less healthy since they left the EU...",
