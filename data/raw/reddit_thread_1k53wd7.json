Browser only supports max 1080p. Just to double-check, Godzilla Minus One have 4K and HDR10+ on my Samsung TV Netflix app, but not on both Edge browser and Windows Netflix app.\n\nBut even disregarding everything.... both Nvidia Shield and Apple TV took up HDMI slot. If you have your PC connected to the DisplayPort, PS5 to HDMI, and Switch to the other HDMI, you now run out of HDMI slot.

Most people here seems to not be aware of the quality reduction, either its because they do not notice, or they never experienced actual 4K.\n\nTbf, this is probably because the rest of specs are.... not great. 45\" Curved WQHD OLED in 2025? When 42\" and 48\" Flat OLED exist? I don't know who is this for. I guess that's why they promote the WebOS to try to slot it as Smart Monitor. In contrast, not much people even know that Samsung's G80SD even have Samsung Smart TV things inside them, because its more like a footnote in their feature list instead. They don't even tag it as Smart Monitor despite it probably qualifies as such and Samsung also produce Smart Monitor.\n\n....And now that I think about it, you do not need 4K too for this. Its only WQHD.",

And these specs are fine lol, you mention 42\" and 48\" already being a thing but I guess you fail to realise 45 is literally in the middle of both of those. Not a huge difference. 1440 isnt terrible either, this seems to be a middle of the road gaming monitor with some smart features.

      "body": "Smart TV's were a great idea until advertising absolutely everywhere became popular. I got a TCL Roku TV about 7 years ago and noticed a huge increase in ads during COVID. Enough of them that it prompted me to factory reset the TV and only use it as another monitor and connection to my stereo. Every update brought more ads that slowed it down more. Ads for the background, ads on the right side, ads at the bottom, briefly even pop-up ads when I turned it on. I have a theory that smart TV's prompted streaming services to seek ad revenue because they knew the only way around ads would be special ad-free memberships. 7 years later, there's ads everywhere and the \"correct\" way to bypass is membership for fewer ads. YouTube even has ads if you pay for the \"ad-free membership\" now.\n\nIf LG can promise NO ADS in the UI, seems like a good idea. But because I'm about 99.99% certain that's not gonna happen, seems like a bad idea.",
