It really sucks to hear I agree. It makes sense to pivot into a games as a service model, because they can\u2019t compete with PlayStation in the console market ever since the Xbox One launch was borked, last gen was a pivotal generation. \nThink about it. Most other entertainment media is a service now like music or tv/movies. Have you seen how profitable that is? Have you seen Netflix\u2019s stock price? Amazon? (who makes most of its money from AWS)\n\nWhy the hell wouldn\u2019t they?\nThe console wars are dead, if they can\u2019t trade blows with PlayStation they can think towards the future. \nWith this move they may even change the landscape of gaming.\n\nHere are the pros:\n\n>save costs on hardware R&D\nConsoles are just PCs anyways, all of the custom proprietary stuff is either 1. There to make more money from the console like storage expansion or 2. Security and DRM 3. A nice looking case and cooling that fits. None of this is necessary for computers in a data center. (And Microsoft already has lots of those)\n\n>Physical media costs money to make (we won\u2019t see the savings gotta keep the shareholders happy)\n\n>More control over games\nAs people get used to the idea of streaming games I feel like eventually there will be less and less game releases to own. (How many people do you know who play most of their games on gamepass?) Eventually this will trickle down to PC gaming (To maintain windows dominance and keep games from other platforms, we know the steamdeck is a thorn in Microsoft\u2019s side)\n\nCons: \n\n>Crying fans\nTime and time again corporations have proven they don\u2019t give a fuck about their old fans, sure if you cry hard enough about a controversial change they\u2019ll act like they care until you forget, then they\u2019ll do it anyways. \nDo you think they care about their legacy? The young profitable playerbase doesn\u2019t know the legacy and I doubt they care. \n\nAnyway I\u2019ve been typing too long need to get back to work. \n\nIn the future you will own nothing and be happy.",
