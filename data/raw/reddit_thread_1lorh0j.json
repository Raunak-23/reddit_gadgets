Having money sets you up for future success if you take advantage of it. \n\nFor example my parents used their wealth to allow me to do things like travel the world and apprentice under top chefs in different countries. Instead of sitting at home doing nothing I was able to continuously refine my education because I had the money for it and didn't need to work just to cover bills. \n\nMy husband's job is more about innate talent. Hedge funds are one of the few jobs that are pretty much meritocracies. You might be able to get an interview with the top fund because of connections but that's about all it can get you. Maybe some fun would hire you just for the connection but you'll never climb above a low level position. Interestingly enough, my husband's specific job being wealthy actually made it more difficult to get hired. As a rule of thumb his boss typically does not hire people who come from money. Says it makes them lazy unless motivated because they have a backup.",

Signing a check got me there, but it's not like signing a check is going to wake me up at 5:00 a.m. to work 12 hour days under some random chef for a month for moving to another part of the country to repeat the process to learn a different technique or culinary skill.\n\nFor example it's because of my family's wealth I was able to aggressively pursue my education. I have two bachelor's degrees, I have an MBA, and I have a PhD. No matter how big of a check you write you can't just magically implant that knowledge into someone and hand them the degrees. \n\nI always find it interesting when people do believe that such as yourself because if that was the case you would see a lot more successful people that come from money. It would be basically unheard of for some wealthy child to be a failure if all you need to do is sign a check to be successful. \n\nSomeone who doesn't have to work isn't necessarily going to be any worse. But it does provide unique motivation knowing that if you fail, if you decide to take a weekend off, if you slack off and get fired it's the end of your livelihood. When your boss knows you have no plan B it provides them with a unique opportunity to exploit you. They know you're not willing to go back to poverty.",

If they are smart enough to drive it, they can probably watch a LPL video on how to remove a wheel lock), I'm done with Hyundai/Kia.\n\nSome examples. AC in that car sucks at the best of times, and there is a hose that constantly leaks in the system, no real fix that I have found. Replaced that hose several times each time I recharge it.\n\nHas one of those stupid crush washers that you need to buy every time you do an oil change. Fixed that with a Fumoto Valve after a shop I sent it into reused the old washer.\n\nThere was a recall that was done YEARS too late where brake fluid could leak onto the fusebox, causing an engine bay fire. Dealer gave me way too much shit trying to get that one fixed. Kept trying to buy my car and sell me a new shitbox.\n\nThe Keyfob battery died. I don't drive all that much. A few times a week. Apparently if you leave the keyfob too long without power, it loses it's programming to the car. Most cars from that era, this would be an easy fix by either me or a locksmith. NOPE. $700 at the dealer for a new keyfob programmed to the car.\n\nThe Polarization filter on the display in the car peeled off the display, making it impossible to use. This was thankfully an easy fix with a cheap Android Auto/Carplay Head Unit kit. Was about $300 and a few days of work to fix.\n\nClutch went out in the car. To get a factory clutch/Flywheel/pressure plate kit was several thousand dollars. I ended up going with an Aftermarket Clutch kit for about $600 and threw it in myself. The new clutch is a performance street/strip clutch and is kinda a PITA to drive, but its way better than spending a good portion of what the car is worth on a new clutch.",

      "body": "I personally don\u2019t really understand all the hate for CarPlay. It\u2019s one less system to configure and for the vast majority of OEM infotainment systems Apple does a much better job with the interface. It certainly has come a long way and can still improve but I thoroughly much prefer CarPlay over my cars system (Subaru). Same is true for basically any rental, in fact if you rent cars often CarPlay is a dream come true. Just hop in and go; no configuration needed and all your stuff is right on screen how you want it (unless you want it to work wirelessly then you have to figure out how to connect it up).\n\nThe only argument I could get behind for CarPlay being \u201cbad\u201d is how it\u2019s consolidates the whole market into one system. No originality and no competition.",
