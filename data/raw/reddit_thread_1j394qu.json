The solar panel working even at 1% means that it works and you can claim that your machine is solar powered, Then add in that the increase battery hours that they claim is likely under perfect indoor conditions, excuse me if I bullshit on this.\n\nBut also if you are inside where it supposedly gives you 1 extra hour of battery use, couldn't you just plug it into the outlet?\n\nThis ONLY makes sense outside, but then also it DOESN'T make sense outside because who is using their laptop outside for that long to make this worth it?\n\nI will believe it when someone that isn't paid by Lenovo gives me numbers.",
