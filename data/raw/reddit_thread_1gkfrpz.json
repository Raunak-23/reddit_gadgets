But I really think you should be able to think of these things yourself.\n\nHaving marginal, barely noticeable upgrades year over year because there's no competition, and thus no incentive to improve. Having the bare minimum of software support - Apple in this regard has been really good in the past, providing software updates to their phones many years after release. Most android companies used to provide only 2 or 3 years, though that has changed recently. Samsung and Google both promised 7 years on their latest phones. Again, just because I praised Apple doesn't mean it's a good company. They lost the lawsuit to open up their phones to 3rd party app stores, and only followed through on doing that in European countries, where said law applies. Android on the other hand is very open about 3rd party stores and app installation in general. But while they do have that, there's privacy concerns on android phones (though I'm not too well versed in this as I haven't done much research).\n\nThere's tons more, and going through them all one by one would take all day.",

Hence the question. Simple.\n\nNothing you mentioned is screwing the average folk though? I mean, it's more of a question about preference rather than screwing people over. \n\nTech has gotten so far that any minimal advancement requires more and more power from something and somebody else. It's not Apple specific nor is it phones specific either. It's everywhere. Diminishing returns. \n\nWhen it comes to 3rd party apps, as a lifelong Apple user, I was and am against it. Mainly because it gets messy, introduces security risks and essentially it lessens the value, security, comfort (etc) of a closed system. \nImagine a private school with \"strict\" rules. They set the rules for everything - teachers, students, what not. That means that they dictate the \"level of education\" there. Now if that school goes public, it most probably will lose at least some of this \"high level\". \n\nSo the TLDR is that you did not give a single example of Apple screwing the average person.",

                                                  "body": "Fair enough about the security risk of the 3rd party apps and stores, but I believe consumers should have the freedom to take such risks if they want. Just having the ability to do it doesn't mean it'll immediately allow hackers access to your phone. So if I want to download a random app from a sketchy looking site, I should have the ability to. The consequences of that should fall entirely on me, yes, but I still want to be able to do it. It also opens the market to other companies/people, loosening Apple's grip on their software market. I'm an iPhone user too, but not being able to install 3rd party apps, or older versions of apps (which is somewhat important to me), is really annoying. They don't even allow 3rd party browsers on iOS and iPadOS. Every browser is just a copy of Safari with a different skin. Not being able to run my Firefox plugins on my iPad pro really makes it annoying to browse the web on. Plus, they're already allowing it in the EU. Region locking such a thing, that is based purely on software, shows that they don't want *anyone* to be able to do it. And that they're only allowing the few people that they are because they are being forced to.\n\nAlso, I don't know what you mean when you say that my take is extreme. Would appreciate it if you explained yourself there.\n\nAnd as for the tech improvement statement, you're right. But Apple makes their own chips (which, might I add, are super super powerful. I know their m4 chips in their iPads trade blows with desktop level CPUs), so they don't really have to really on other companies like android companies do. But again, I do understand the diminishing returns for these things. So you have a very good point. But without competition, they would undoubtedly stagger, as Intel did with their chips until AMD came out with Ryzen. Yes it's comparing apples to oranges but the point still remains that without competition, they would have no reason to improve.\n\nIf you want a specific example of Apple screwing over it's customers, I don't remember exactly what it currently is, but buying a Mac and the same mac with more memory + storage will change the price by 2x. So if you want 32gb ram + 1tb storage, that would cost the same as buying two units with 16gb ram + 509gb storage. But you won't be getting the cpu and the other components, obviously. Again, I don't know the details of this but I saw a post on the mac subreddit (I believe) a few days ago. Just in general, limiting users and then charging ridiculous prices for upgrades that would otherwise be really cheap (or at least cheaper).",

But at launch, you can trade in a 7+ y/o Samsung for $500 even if it's broken.\n\n\nI actually bought the s24u on launch but it was because Samsung offers so many discounts and trade in bonuses. Paid about 60% of the MSRP. That goes back to my original comment. Apple offers very poor trade in offers and the price is either MSRP or their lower educational price. When people buy, they're paying much more for the iPhone.\n\n\nRe: cameras, it depends on the releases. S23u and S24u are basically the same. The improvement is incremental if you go for the same tier of phone. But if you go up (from a base to a plus, or plus to ultra), there are more cameras and sensors.",

Interestingly, I saw some data that they are pulling more people from Apple than other Android platforms (other than current Pixel Owners, who generally tend to stick with Pixels).\n\nPart of the issue is the optics. You sell a cheaper phone, people will believe it's a cheaper product. Pixel never was. Heck even the basic non-pro Pixels have nearly the same hardware under the hood as the top end models. Heck even the Pixel A series had basically the same hardware as the mainline phones. Now they have a price and design that matches the other flagships, and boom. They got sales. And knowing Pixel Owner retention, they are likely to make lots of loyal pixel customers.\n\n*I am a bit biased. I'm typing this on my Pixel 7 (not Pro) that is being replaced with a Pro XL later this week. I've been on Pixel since the Pixel 3A. Upgraded now not because I wanted a new phone but because I wanted to get a decent trade in value and move on to a phone with 7 years of security updates.",
