Your quite strange and abnormal level of anger is almost tangible through your comment, but the fact of the matter is that there is really nothing here for you to be mad about other than a perceived challenge to your ego. Your ego is clearly highly fragile. The fact of the matter is that the other commenter was communicating with you respectfully the entire time, the \"trying to condescend me\" thing is just your narcissistic delusion, I don't think they were being condescending whatsoever. They didn't say anything that could even slightly be considered condescending until after you were condescending and insulting first. You should take a good, hard look in a mirror.",

That's the common element between older software and modern software.\n\nModern homebrew releases on these older home computers have the benefit of building on the ideas and mechanics we've collectively worked on for 40+ years at this point. The games released in the late 70s and 80s are obviously less likely to have the refinement of anything coming later.\n\nBut those older, unrefined games ARE the games from the 1st and 2nd generation. I don't think the homebrew scene 47 years later has any impact on that fact.",

I believe a good percentage of adults would like to relive part, if not all of their childhood whether they had a video game console or not (if nothing else...maybe do things differently).  IMO, that's not an Earth-shattering take., but that's not me.  Like I said, at the time, since home video games were a relatively new thing, it was kinda fun because that's all we knew.  A block with a line that's supposed to resemble a tank and you have to get past obstacles to shoot at the other player was ok but it wasn't anything special.  I don't think it warrants to have the game on a watch but that...just...me.\n\nIf you want to play Atari 2400 Tank, Pitfall (are Activision games on there as well?), or the janky version of Pac-Man on a watch, please have at it.  I'm in therapy for many things.  Wanting to relive my childhood ain't one of them.",

In fact the bug isn't even mentioned anywhere in the page so I assume it wasn't addressed.\n\nThat bug is this:\n\n_After you exit a pit and E.T's neck un-extends, E.T. will shift downward by one pixel.  If you happen to have exited a pit from above, **you will fall right back in immediately** due to the downward shift causing a collision._\n\nI know I have to give a lot of leeway to the folks he mercifully refers to as \"novices\" but as a 7 year old kid I frankly had zero difficulty navigating the game's quirks, including that bug.  Yet I can definitely imagine a lot of players simply not \"getting\" what's going on, missing the fact that E.T. is shifting down and then colliding back into the pit again.\n\nOn the other hand, he is _very correct_ to point out that _E.T._ was in fact a trailblazing game.  It's actually one of the top 10 or 15 games ever released on the console.  The bad rap the game has is largely the result of a cumulative series of circumstances, most particularly some fairly modern scapegoating done for entertainment.",
