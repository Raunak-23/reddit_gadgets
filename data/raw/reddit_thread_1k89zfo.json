That's the stock of goods that is supposed to come 3-6 months later based on each store's projection on when they will need goods. Think of COVID shortage, except self-inflicted now. \n\nAnd the worst thing is that, nobody knows how to price things right now, because the rates might change again, but if its pre-order then you will need to honor the prices you set or else you are just cheating customers.

They will just double the price, and expect customer to just deal with it.\n\nThe bigger problem is that.... Companies do not expect that customers will even be willing to buy and pay for the product, even if they ship it to US and pay the tariff cost. Nobody will pay 700$ for something like Hyte Y70. Customers will just not spend instead, so Hyte will be losing money on those cases they have paid upfront to import to US, and also needing to pay the warehousing cost. Stockpiling is not free. \n\nAnd the problem with the current tariff implementation is that, nobody really knows what the end goal is. If its bringing manufacturing back, then it will need to stay for long while because nobody setup factory and supply chain in a year or 2. If its punishing countries and extracting favorable deals (so maybe just wanting China or other countries to buy more stuffs), then tariff might not be in place for long. If the goal is to crash the US economy intentionally to refinance debts (as I recently heard some ppl were saying), then the tariff might be in place for long time too.... Each reasoning will make companies move in different way and since nobody knows, the only option for company is to just stand still, hoard as much cashflow as possible to sustain business, sold the remaining inventory and hope that they do not need to close shops 3-6 months later when they have nothing to sell.",

In fact I would be more interested in buying a locally sourced 3d or metal printed case from some kids upstart anyways. Still sucks that the tarrifs are already having an affect though. Seriously if you haven't already start buying new tires, brake pads, medical equipment, soldering tips and important things you're going to need for the next few years asap as those items are going to become scarce soon! Basically anything that they didn't have in the last of us.",
