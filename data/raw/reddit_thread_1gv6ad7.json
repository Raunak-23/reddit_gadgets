The left trackpad is not a good Dpad whatsoever, it can be functional but it is just not at all good feeling as a Dpad, I couldn't tell you specifically why, lots of factors just feel off like the general size, the \"click weight\" of it, the inside curve isn't how I interact with Dpads....it's just \"off\". It has the ridged cross in it that looks like a DPAD but it's more useful for use as an analogue stick tbh. \n\nThey could have leaned harder into the\"trackpad imitating analogue functionality\" thing by replacing the left analogue stick with a DPAD (or 4 additional \"directional face\" buttons like the Switch joycons).\n\nBut for stuff where Dpad isn't a big factor, it's a genuinely phenomenally flexible device, lots of community control setups for many games, and it's ultra customizable with the provides interface. \n\nSo there are many games that would be considered unplayable on controllers, which become very conveniently playable on Steam Controller. E.g. Civilization, Europa Universalis etc type games with heavy cursor input. But it's also awesome for many other kinds of games.",

Maybe I\u2019m thinking of the wrong games, but for the games I mentioned it\u2019s just the view direction and i find it difficult to understand how a track pad can somehow be better than the intuitive thumb stick\n\nOr is the answer that it\u2019s more for games like civilization because you can allow for mouse pointer control, and it\u2019s the same or not much better for COD/Halo etc? In this case I suppose that makes sense if you really want to use a controller instead of a precise mouse.",

Then underneath there is a left analogue stick and right side face buttons.\n\nThey have advanced haptics, so you can literally just use them exactly like an analogue stick if you want (just slide your thumb along the pad in the direction you want)\n\nIf you want to use it for cursor control based games like RTS games etc, that's also available with a \"trackball\" like feel. \n\nThe pads can also be clicked.\n\nYou can also use hybrids for games where precise aiming can be a factor as well as general viewlook.  So e.g. Lots of third person adventure games where there are some aim based weapons. In general it is great for shooters when you are not trying to be competitive with M+KB users, for me playing shooters with just analogue sticks is a HORRIBLE experience cuz I'm a mouse user generally. The Steam Controller bridges the gap. This is partly why it is so great for MGSV actually.",

It can only say \"accelerate the pointer in this direction\".\n\nThis is why console FPS games provide ample subtle aim assistance methods like \"sticky crosshair\", \"magnet bullets\" and so on. Halo series actually pioneered the application of many of these tricks.\n\nIn practice with these techniques you can still have quite a fun experience. However on PC most of these controller aim assists usually aren't present even if you decide to use a controller so it just ends up being a frustrating exercise in using raw analogue input, which is just not so good.",

I personally find it more responsive that way. \n\nHell, some games I swap the touchpad/D pad for the left joystick so I have twin touchpads and then map the dpad controls to the left joystick like a directional selection.

I have a GW2 layout that works perfectly alone but once you get into WvW, world bosses, raids and even some fractals it becomes completely unplayable.\n\nSteam Input needs massive improvements before it can completely replace the need for more physical inputs.",

Let's say you want to use \"Menu\" (can be anything) for screenshots.\n- Go to the Menu button and click Extra Button and choose the Take Screenshots button\n- In the settings for the button (gear icon), click the one that says Regular Click (or something), and switch that to Button Chord.\n- Then go to the settings of the button again and there should be one that says \"button chord\" to None. You can change this to anything, in this example let's say you use Left Trigger.\n\nNow, if you want to take screenshots, you can hold down left trigger, wait for the Cassette Beasts Fusion to come up, and then click the Menu button to take the screenshot.\n\nThis is definitely a bit more cumbersome, but having button chords and action sets opens up a lot more inputs.\n\nHope that helps!

If I'm going to drop $60+ on a controller, I'd like to be able to use it for multiple things. I have a Steam Controller and it kinda feels like the shitty MadCatz controller you give to your friend when he comes over. I think it could be better, it's kind of a \"worst of both worlds\" situation.\u00a0\n\n\nPersonally, I don't see why it has to be one or the other. There's gotta be a way to make it work. The Steam Deck has both, which you might not think is ideal, but a future Steam Controller isn't as limited to that \"handheld\" form factor as the Steam Deck is. I think there's potential.",

With an ARM SoC and games really optimised with its SDK it may reach that level of performance with the stricter wattage restrictions Nintendo usually put in place.\n\nif it gets strong third party supports with games like Elden Ring, Fantazio, Armored Core, Dragon Quest XII I think I can easily wait for a SD2.\n\nI really cannot imagine Nintendo betting the next 7-8 years on a console that would already be struggling versus a 2022 Steam Deck, but who knows.\n\nSD2 it will probably leverage RDNA 4, FSR 4 with AI-assisted upscaling (already officialised and will be really focused on handhelds performance per AMD statements), faster & more ram etc. So a really generational uplift versus SD and more complimentary of a switch 2.",

The market is moving really fast.\n\nIt may push Valve to be slightly quicker this time around, it's a market they are leading for now and deservedly so.",

          "body": "This generation of VR device has all of its naming themed around Blade Runner. Sort of like how all of the parts of the steam deck internally had final fantasy references for parts (sepheroth, aerith, etc). For the headset so far the device is code named \"deckard\" which is the name of the protagonist of blade runner, and \"roy\" is another character who has a famous line \"like tears in the rain\". The article writer is trying to say its no roy from final fantasy, its roy from blade runner.",

I don't blame them for not rocking that boat, but the fact of the matter is that it's not optimally ergonomic and I know from experience that my left thumb can't handle that position as well as it does the spot where the thumb rests naturally.  Even Nintendo threw in the towel on this item, giving up their precious symmetry in favor of the blunt ergonomics.\n\nOtherwise I do quite like the PS5 pad.  They finally moved solidly away from the more legacy angles and the silhouette is effectively an Xbox pad.  The top buttons are also much more to my liking than anything since the 360 pad.\n\n> There are tons of affordable 3rd party controllers with extra buttons\n\nI've tried many.  There's a reason I went way the hell out of my way to mention third party in my OP.  The quality isn't \"low\" in the sense that _this is the pad you hand to your younger brother_ but it is always, invariably, below the standard you get from actual console makers.  And this is important because I'm even picky enough to critique the best that's available.  The XSX pad, for example, creaks too much when you twist it\u2014a problem the 360 pad never had (but all Sony pads have shared).\n\n> What is it about a valve controller specifically that you think would be better than all of these options?\n\nI'm in it for the possibility that a company I can potentially trust to create a quality product may magically solve all my problems for me.",
