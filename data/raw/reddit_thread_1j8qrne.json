Bedroom producers and semi professionals wouldn't carry around hard drives like this because a single drive is significantly slower than SSDs/nvme without a proper raid setup. And on top of all of that unless you're a professional composer who needs massive sample libraries of every single instrument you won't run into space issues on consumer grade storage solutions.

I could shuck 4 of those and throw them in an OWC thunderbolt dock off Amazon for $200 less, and it'd have 8TB shy of double the space (vs the 52TB).\n\nAlso, none of these are really NAS at all unless they're connected to an always on machine and provisioned for network access.

They also are more likely to have a SAS option. \n\nWhen I'm buying disks I look at CMR vs. SMR and warranty period. If I'm going with a brand or series that's new to me I'll check the Backblaze drive stats and see what the reliability has been. That said, for datacenter operations we are insulated from absolute failure rates because nobody's running serious storage as a RAID-0. There are massive redundancies and hot spares. I have ~2PB of storage that's all ZFS mirror units that get rebuilt with a spare immediately upon a drive failing out of the array. Out of ~200 disks I get an actual RMA-worthy disk failure once every few months.",
