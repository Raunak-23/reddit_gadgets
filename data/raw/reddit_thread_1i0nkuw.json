Very few people nowadays have both an Xbox and a PlayStation but many many people have one of them and a switch. Same with PC gamers, if they have a PC to play games most people don\u2019t also have an Xbox or PlayStation, but they likely have a switch.\n\nSometimes people will still get both for console exclusives but nowadays that\u2019s mostly only PlayStation who still refuses to release on PC, but I doubt that\u2019s a high percentage.",
