      "body": "From the article: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman last month reported that the new Apple TV and the new HomePod mini will be equipped with Apple's own combined Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. Gurman said the chip supports Wi-Fi 6E, so that could end up being a key upgrade for both devices. Wi-Fi 6E extends the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 to the 6 GHz band, enabling faster wireless speeds and reduced signal interference with a compatible router.\n\nThe current Apple TV from October 2022 supports Wi-Fi 6, and the upgrade to Wi-Fi 6E seems likely. It is unclear if the Wi-Fi 6E capability will be enabled in the next HomePod mini, however, as Apple has generally kept its HomePod speakers on older Wi-Fi versions. For example, the current HomePod mini supports outdated Wi-Fi 4.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the next Apple TV is also expected to be equipped with a newer A-series chip for faster performance. The current Apple TV is equipped with the A15 Bionic chip that debuted in the iPhone 13 models in 2021. Apple has released several newer A-series chips since then, including the A16 Bionic, A17 Pro, A18, and A18 Pro.\n\n\nThe next Apple TV could have lower pricing. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that the next model could have a sub-$100 starting price. In the U.S., the current Apple TV is available with 64GB or 128GB of storage for $129 and $149, respectively.\n\nNo major design changes have been rumored for the next Apple TV, but Gurman said Apple has considered adding a built-in camera to a future model. tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.",

                      "body": "> don\u2019t want to manage that many SKUs\n\nI\u2019ve been gone from Apple for more than 20 years now, but I was there when they were simplifying their lineup coming out of the PowerMac / Performa / etc era and into G3, iMac, iBook era. This is close to the mark but not quite it.\n\nApple meticulously reviews usage down to the feature level. They know how many people use different ports on their computers. How many people perform certain kinds of upgrades. And they know how much it costs them to engineer and manufacture those features.\n\nI was there when they decided that internal PCI expansion ports were a \u201cpro\u201d feature and it really bothered me. But when presented with the data it was hard to object - they could show that like 95% of people never installed PCI cards, and even those who do, 95% wouldn\u2019t install one after initial purchase of the computer. And they\u2019d look at engineering design and manufacturing cost and be able to put a body count together with a number; \u201c100k people paid an extra $150 each for this computer so that 100 of them could install a PCI cards 2 years later.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t there for the soldered in RAM era, but I 100% guarantee this is what happened. It sucks, I hate not being able to upgrade my RAM, but I bet that in the grand scheme of things they realized that a bazillion people who\u2019d never do that were paying extra for me to have that ability.\n\nWhich is all to say, I don\u2019t think Apple is necessarily trying to reduce SKUs just because. But they know they\u2019ll sell say 300k of them total, and it won\u2019t be an interesting revenue stream worth all the effort needed to boot up the manufacturing chain for it.",
