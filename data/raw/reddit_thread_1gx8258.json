Thats why specific training is required. also, turning people and bathing them especially when they\u2019re bedbound requires trained medical professionals especially when many of these patients have sacral wounds and ulcers at various stages. They won\u2019t let a volunteer do any of those things. That\u2019s why I said just be a CNA. At the wage they pay CNAs it\u2019s basically volunteering which is super sad.\n\nYou don\u2019t need extra schooling to be a CNA most places will train you on the job but they just can\u2019t have a well meaning volunteer helping a patient to the bath room and both of them falling or something. that\u2019s a huge liability as most senior falls result in broken hips, brain bleeds, etc and will drastically decrease quality of life or even shorten it tremendously.",

The amount of effort it would take to move a patient from bed into this machine, even via hoyer, to clean an entire patient, then move them back over would be a lot more work than a standard bed bath. It would move a lot slower too, and time is money with current patient ratios in the US. Not to mention, this would need to be heavily sanitized between every patient to minimize risk of cross contamination. Going back to my hoyer comment, the pad would then be wet and could lead to skin break down if not removed and replaced with a new one afterwards. In which case, if you\u2019re already doing that, you may as well just hand wash them while you\u2019re at it.",
