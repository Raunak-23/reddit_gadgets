      "body": "From the article: It's not like Nvidia's RTX 5000 series needs any more negative press, but here we are again. Igor Wallossek of Igor's Lab has discovered a problem that appears to be present in most Blackwell AIB partner cards: local hotspots at the rear of the PCBs. This could potentially lead to the cards being damaged over time due to heavy use.\n\nDuring a sustained \"torture loop\" on a PNY RTX 5070 OC and Palit RTX 5080 Gaming Pro OC, Wallossek recorded temperature spikes in the power delivery areas of the cards. The RTX 5070 reached 107 \u00b0C while the GPU core sat at a much cooler 70\u00b0C, and the RTX 5080 Gaming Pro OC peaked at 80.5\u00b0C.",

They were all a few hundred dollars more expensive than a console though (and one was 4-500 more because I splashed out). \n\nWhich was my really long winded way of saying PC\u2019s are usually as reliable as consoles, unless you buy stupid shit. \n\nAlthough my n64 and GameCube also still run without any problems, and my PC\u2019s from those era\u2019s are in a recycling yard, sooo\u2026..",

              "body": "\"Way better\" is a bit of a stretch. As someone who had a 4090 and now an OC 9070xt, it's not a huge difference between the 5080 and stock 9070xt beyond numbers on some bar graphs (13-20% according to TPU). If the 9070xt gets 80fps in a game, then the 5080 would average from 90-96 in the same game.  That's not really a \"way better\" experience.  I'm not sure most people would even the see the difference. *Shrug*\n\nDLSS and FSR4 are similar with a nod to 4 being marginally better than FSR4 and FSR4 marginally better than DLSS3 according to the comparison content recently published. At this level, I'm not sure you need it. These cards are powerful enough. Frame gen shouldn't be necessary either, and both are capable. I'm sensitive to the visual downgrade of upscaling and framegen, though, so there's that.\n\nRay tracing is sadly only good in a handful of games. HUB did a great video on this a few months back. Nvidia is better, but I'm not sure if spending almost double for a marginally faster 5080 is worth it for most... Just to have better RT in a few games.  And that's discounting the awful power design, driver issues, retailer scalping, and other issues plaguing the 50 series. But if someone is dead set on RT, then Nvidia is still better, but AMD is at least capable now.  Cheers!",

You are right a 5080 is powerful enough in raster that it doesnt matter. Dlss 3 looks decent but transformer is much more clean and better than fsr 4. Combine with path tracing, hdr, and a 4k oled and you will have an image that is almost lifelike. And idk what you are talking about marginally better, dlss 4 solves a ton of issues from dlss 3. If you get a 5080 and aren't playing in 4k you are wasting your money. Frame gen will allow you to do 240hz 4k on all max setting so don't know why you are discounting that. Amd can't compete with these feature sets so if you have money the 5080 is the way to go.",
