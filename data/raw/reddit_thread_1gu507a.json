Then, even thinking back to my first system, the NES, and comparing it to Final Fantasy 7. \n\nThe jump was huge, and it made it so obvious. The tech was so advanced that the genres changed, new genres were suddenly popping up left and right because of 3D.\n\n I was thinking about this around 98 (I was a little late to the psone, but also, that's when the tech of the psone was really seeming to get pushed more. Companies were figuring out what they could really do with it)\n\nThat's just 14 years. It's insane to me. Clearly games today look leagues better than from 14 years ago. But it doesn't feel like as big of a jump only because when I was a kid it was such a *huge* jump, that just by virtue of the tech it opened the doors for tons of new genres, that are core genres to this day. There are games today where you see someone make a fake psone demake video, and you see how it could work, but when someone does a 2D demake, it's great, but something feels lost from the modern game then in my opinion. \n\nIt must kinda be how people felt who saw the rise of radio, to TV, to color TV. It changed the way things were done and the genres people consumed for entertainment.",

Apart from maybe things like Ray Tracing, there have barely been any major leaps in the last decade compared to all the 4(?) decades before that.",

A refund policy that if you open the game for 1 second, you're ineligible for a refund.\n\nWhy would gamers want that?

                                      "body": ">Exclusives sell console. If your console has no exclusive games. People won't buy it\n\nThat's what I mean by \"obsolete\". That was 100% true in the days of 360/PS3 all the way back to NES/Genesis, but Xbox thinks that's not true anymore. Everything Xbox makes is on gamepass so PC players can play it there, and Xbox players can play it on Xbox, eventually phones will be able to play most of everything too. COD will sell xboxs solely on the fact you don't have to purchase it.\n\nIt really comes down to, do you want to play on PC or console, all the games are there regardless, but it matters what your tastes are. I wouldn't be surprised if next gen, Xbox comes out with a console thats significantly cheaper than the PS6 and the whole selling point will be as a gamepass box. Who knows if that will work but I'd much rather prefer being able to play any game anywhere and find whatever deal or situation suits me, than being locked into whatever Sony or Nintendo thinks is best ($$$$). PC is the place to be right now and that's specifically because everything is on there, there is no walled garden.\n\nI don't think walled gardens are going to last much longer, Goolge might be anti trusted to hell, Apple is being forced to tear down their wall on the app store, I don't think gaming is far behind, if on player sentiment, rather than regulation.\n\nI mean, look at streaming. People HATE that they have to have 5 subscriptions to watch the content they want, the walled gardens is a losing proposition.",

I for example became team xbox this gen solely because these fucks bought Bethesda and made Starfield exclusive meanwhile Sony's games were boring at the time. Fast forward to now, Xbox gave up, Sony's game line up is still shit but atleast we got Stellarblade and Spider man 2. I have motivations to buy the console because why not?\n\n\nI'd never buy Xbox if I knew that its games will be released on PS5. \n\n\nSame with Switch. People buy switch because its a unique console with unique games. It wouldn't sell as well without Mario and Zelda.\n\n\nExclusivity breeds competition and that makes gaming evolve. If we only have one console. Gaming would stagnate.",

Call of Duty has to optimize shaders ever once in a while, better on BO6 so far, but my experience in Cold War was horrendous, needing to boot the game 30 minutes before I play just in case shaders decide to compile.\n\n\nAnd don't forget no mans sky, horrible release turned beautiful game and is a passion project at this point.\n\n\nDragonball Sparking Zero, the over priced mess that is right now and constant complaints about it being unbalanced. Mechanics aren't polished, it was half baked and missing a bunch of features from previous titles all in favor of online toxic gameplay.\n\n\nGaming is no longer casual or fun for the most part. It feels like a chore at times.",

Upscaling tech is just a shit show right now, honestly.  This is kind of why I said in the past that, to the malais of some hardcore tech redditors in another sub, this shit isn't going to be sustainable/workable unless there's a solid, non-hardware locked (non-specific) implementation that's easy to use and pretty much universal.\n\nEven DLSS cannot claim this.  It often requires help by Nvidia to do well/right and requires their specific hardware to work.  AMD is closer, in that it's universal and apparently easier to implement, but doesn't take advantage of AI hardware to help it when it could (it should honestly have two modes for better compatibility AND explicit use of hardware).  And as such it often looks god awful in some way or another.  And XeSS... I mean, it's cool and looks good in the few times I've seen it.  But apparently not really performant enough and still requires AI hardware only.  I suppose in future, it could replace AMD's solution when every single GPU has enough AI powered components to make good use of it and no one is on pre-AI compatible GPUs?  Maybe?\n\nBut regardless, it's a fucking mess right now, for devs and for everyone else who has to play games with this crap required.  I think we're past the \"devs need to do better\" thing.  At a certain point, if it's a large enough problem you just gotta accept facts that people aren't going to \"get better at it\" and instead we probably just have to improve the tech to be easier to use.  If it's this bad, we can call people lazy and get upset all day... but at a certain point, we might just need to make the shit simpler to use while still getting most/all of the benefits.  Otherwise this is just going to keep being a problem.",

By contrash, video games are usually 1 sample per pixel, and they benefit way more from going from 2K to 4K as a result, since you're literally quadrupling the amount of samples you have on the screen.

The monitor itself is refreshing 2x as often but the number of frames remains the same. It's just showing each frame twice. Your eye will still perceive that as a single frame. Any suggestion otherwise is snake oil.\n\nWhere you *do* see benefits is when the frame-time does *not* line up evenly. For example, if your game is locked to *40fps* instead of 60. As 40 doesn't divide evenly into 60, you have a monitor refreshing every 16 milliseconds but the game only providing new frames every 25 milliseconds. Anytime those don't line up, you end up with frames lingering a little too long, and then suddenly changing too quickly. This gets perceived as stutter.\n\nIn that situation, a 120hz monitor *would* make the game feel smoother as it's evenly divisible by 40, so each frame can be delivered on time with no skipped frames. This is also the case for a 240hz monitor, which would appear smoother than 60hz but provide no perceivable benefit over a 120hz monitor. And if somehow you had a 40hz monitor, it would also look identical.\n\nBut as we were talking about 60fps earlier, no, there would be no perceivable difference between a 60hz monitor and a 120 or even 240 hz monitor, assuming a locked frame rate with even pacing.",

The hz is a measurement of how often the screen itself is able to display a new frame.\n\nIf there is no new frame to display when the monitor checks for a new frame, it will not display a new frame. The pixels on the screen remain exactly the same.\n\nYour statements on clarity of motion are absolutely true at higher FPS. At its core, motion on a screen is an illusion that occurs when you see hundreds of still images in succession. The more frames, the smoother and clearer the motion appears.\n\nThe monitor's job is just to display those frames without getting in the way. If your game is only sending a new frame every 16 milliseconds, that's all your monitor is going to be able to display. A low-end monitor can act as bottleneck by *not* displaying those frames as I described above with a 40fps game example, or more simply, if your game is sending a new frame every 8 milliseconds (120fps) but your monitor can only *display* a new frame every 16 milliseconds (60hz) you will literally not see half the frames you're supposed to. You're losing half your frame data and it'll look significantly less smooth by comparison.\n\nBut a 120hz monitor running a 60fps game is still just displaying a new frame every 16 milliseconds because that's all the game is sending to it. Your 120hz monitor is not generating new frames. It's not adding new pixels. It's not adding new information at all. It's displaying the exact same frames at the exact same time as a 60hz or 240hz monitor would with a 60fps game, because those are the only frames the game is sending. The images on the screen are identical and being displayed at the same intervals. There is quite literally no difference with what you would see on the screen.\n\nEdit: This is also true of your Desktop at work. The reason a 120hz monitor looks smoother is because your operating system is ALSO rendering at 120fps. If it wasn't, you wouldn't see a difference.",

If your rig can render a game at 80fps, a 120Hz display will have a staggered 1 2 1 2 number of refreshes with each frame, and would look better simply capping the fps to 60. A 240Hz display can simply display 3 refreshes per frame, which is why all the new refresh rates are multiplies of the 24Hz movie standard.",
