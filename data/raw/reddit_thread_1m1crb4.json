Stick drift isn't nearly as much of a problem with Xbox controllers as with joycons.",

Great value though. They've also improved over time. My first 8-bit due controller had a mechanical failure that I would put down to poor build quality, but newer models show substantial thought went into the redesigns.\n\nAnd as far as y'all effect goes, we're now 2 generations of technology ahead of that (remember, we had hall effect sticks in the '90s and they've never gone out of fashion in the flight Sim market). TMR replaced Hall Effect and now If you manufacturers are trying \" capacitative\" sticks, in both cases, the most substantial improvement is exactly what you're discussing, regaining the accuracy of a friction-based device without the fragility.\n\nEven when the first parties do catch up in technology. However, they still always charge you that brand premium, so it's never going to be a decent value proposition.",

That's me early adopting/trying the capacitative tech, though, so I can't actually make a recommendation there. (I also got the KingKong2, the 1st modern controller that repopularized hall effect and that was not a smooth day 1 experience, though they improved it on software updates. As you say, just because it's hall effect doesn't necessarily mean it's superior).\n\nAs a more direct Xbox controller upgrade, I'd recommend looking at the GameSir [G7 Pro](https://gamesir.com/products/gamesir-g7-pro?variant=45081456869610&country=US&currency=USD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22689711499&gbraid=0AAAAAqORvwtcKaFntjb8qjQoodPfq0prV&gclid=CjwKCAjwvuLDBhAOEiwAPtF0VmwSSamHp5Ai82YlNWZrr_MLArqAyspgPAXjEDI5_Vbl8r3kydhaEBoC-dMQAvD_BwE).
