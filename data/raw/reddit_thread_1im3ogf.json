Then I needed a new PSU(because new GPU requires more power), and now I still need to get a better screen before I even think about the GPU...\n\nThese upgrades are like an avalanche.

If you buy an expensive BMW or Mercedes and start modding it, do you think you\u2019ll still get support? High-end products usually come with robust warranty policies, but they\u2019re also extremely strict when it comes to user modifications and knowledge.\n\nIf you have a 5090, you\u2019re already running top-of-the-line hardware, CPU, RAM, PSU, everything. At that point, you have a state-of-the-art computer that costs more than some countries yearly wages.\n\nThe 5090 is a real high-end luxury item that only wealthy people can afford. That\u2019s just how it is. If you can afford it then you can probably afford to either pay someone to set it up for you or just experiment with it yourself.\n\nIt's not that big of a deal. Corporations don't have such thing as \"best customers\" they just have customers and repeating customers. You are not friends, you are simply buying some product from Multinational corporation. If your warranty is valid, that's cool if not then it's your problem.",

The product itself is fine.** This post clearly shows that they used third-party components that weren\u2019t compatible with the build.\n\nThink about it this way: you buy an expensive, high-performance car and decide to install Nitro to make it go faster. But you hook it up wrong, and now your entire car is bricked. Whose fault is it?\n\n* The car manufacturer?\n* The Nitro manufacturer?\n* Or the user who voided the warranty by using unsupported parts?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly how it works. If you experiment with something you don\u2019t understand, you take the risk of breaking it. It doesn\u2019t matter how much it costs.\n\nBut it\u2019s worth noting...super expensive toys like these are usually not bought by people who actually *need* them.

And there was no safety that prevented the card from turning on with improperly plugged in cables, and that safety was added to later cards.\n\nThey've also been gradually removing the safety feature of having isolated power rails, so any issue that causes power to flow in an unbalanced way, will not just cause a shutdown of the card, but will cause things to melt.\n\nImagine that a car manufacturer suddenly stops adding ABS and seat belts to their cars.

He has thermal imaging to show how after 1 minute of load on his own 5090, two individual cables reached 120 degrees celsius while the GPU was only pulling 575W. In his test, a single wire of the cable was drawing 23 amps, which obviously will fail if left to continue, OEM or third-party cable.\n\nIt's a great video and worth a watch, and while it doesn't validate all third-party cables he even calls for a re-examination of the Cablemod 12vhpwr debacle and whether or not the blame was wrongly placed on them.",

Judging from the size of wire it is maybe 18 or 16 gage and if it\u2019s 16 gage that\u2019s good for 13A free air at 30 degrees C so by the time it\u2019s derated probably 10A which is 120w at 12v. Like you I don\u2019t think I would want to put that much current constantly though a cable like that because at 600w it\u2019s basically maxed out for continuous draw, the heat could loosen pins over time and just create more heat and melt like we see it. I\u2019m not a big electronics guy tho so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 6 + pins and 6 - pins with each pin carrying 100 watts. I think PCI slot can output some small amount of wattage also.",

You probably would call those people foolish and not think that we need to make key connectors out of titanium or something, right? At some point, they did it to themselves, yes?\n\nIn this case, engineers specified *and provided* a cable rated for the current draw. Instead of living with the \u2018extra\u2019 length, and tying it off like in 90% of regular room-temperature PC cases, or buying a new cable assembly rated for 50+ amps, some person chose to get the cheapest/prettiest alternative *and it could not perform the task*.\n\nSomeone knowledgeable enough to be dangerous threaded the needle. They didn\u2019t do anything stupid enough to cause a short, which would\u2019ve blown a fuse or tripped the breaker specified (and inspected) by building codes, the national electrical code, etc. Instead, they managed to find a high enough, steady-state current draw to make things very hot, but without hitting the threshold of a safety system.

It may go to show that the cables need more specific standards to be called \"compliant\".  The key problem with the 12+4 pin connector specs is the cable is permitting a total of 50+ amps over all the wires, but each wire has an individual limit of 9 to 10 amps, and there is nothing to ensure load balancing.  Without load balancing, the 6 +12v and 6 ground wires require a very tight tolerance on conductivity so the... (675 Watts / 12 volts =) 56.26 amps is split so one wire is not conducting over 10 amps.  That amp restriction is based on how much heat radiates from the wires and connectors for conducting that much power, and you are looking at 9.375 amps per +12v wire when perfectly divided (the imaginary ideal world).\n\nIf the cable compliance does not require tight resistance tolerances between each wire, the specifications are not safe, and that really is not the 3rd party cable maker's fault.",

          "body": "On top of that, what you laid out is also the *upper limit* of the specification. The fact that they are trying to push the spec to it's maximum limit is also a big problem here. If you've only got 6 connections rated for 9-10A each, that's a max throughput of 54-60A under ideal circumstances. Which doesn't leave a lot of room for error when you're playing with 56.26A.\n\nIt really *should* be a 12+8 or 12+2x4 connection so you can spread that load accross 8 lines instead of 6. That way you don't risk a fire if there's a slightly loose connection, or if one of the 12V lines fails outright. After all 10A is the *theoretical* maximum, actual max is going to be somewhere between 9A and 10A, so good design would be to stay well below 9A per line. But oh no, that would cost a whole $0.50 more for an extra connector, and we can't have that /s.\n\nBut you are correct that proper load balancing & fault detection also need to be present, and it is definately not the 3rd party cable manufacturers fault.",

              "body": "Technically, there is no maximum.  It is just as more amps flow, the higher resistance areas like connectors radiate more heat and start to glow like a light bulb.  Those safety specs are a point where the heat radiated is still \"tolerable\".\n\nAs for 12+8, the \"+4\" are \"sense\" pins meant to \"communicate\" to an end device what the power supply offers.  Only 2 pins are used to inform \"max amps\".  I am assuming the other 2 are reserved for voltage, expecting that in later generations we will have power supplies supporting higher voltage to deliver more watts safer than pumping amps.  The problem with using higher voltage right now is adapting multiple 12v connectors to higher voltage is more costly and complicated than just combining multiple 12v lines to provide more amps.  We need PSU manufacturers to agree to and start releasing higher voltage power supplies.\n\nReally, I think the connectors should just change out differently, like utilize 10 gauge wire and connectors instead of stacking more 18 gauge wires.  Making the 12+4 connector smaller to fit the profile of an PCIe 8-pin connector was very incompetent.  There should be a landscape penalty per watt, either way.",

Otherwise the only safe/sensible thing to do will be to either bolt a dedicated PSU directly onto the GPU, or ship a proprietary PSU that's got a dedicated cable for the GPU.",

The issue then is the terminal resistance is far enough out of spec that the 9A load is enough to cause thermal run-away. That resistance could be a manufacturing defect in the terminal (thin base material, wrong alloy used with higher resistance or inadequate spring tension, improper material shaping, wrong plating, etc.) or the cable manufacturer's terminal crimping process could be the problem, resulting in inadequate clamping force between the wire and terminal. Barring the effects of contaminates in the joint, a good mechanical connection is a good electrical connection.\n\nLoad balancing (individual current sources) + terminal resistance could explain why there's two burnt terminals on the PSU but only one on the GPU.",

I'm a little surprised nobody has gone R/C-hobby on this ish and slapped an XT60 and some 8-gauge wet noodle wire in there.  \nKeep in mind we're talking much lower voltages than mains. Computer PSUs do a good job of efficiently converting wattage (volts * amps) from mains AC to the low voltage DC consumed by the computer components. That's where the \"80 Plus\" certification gets its name - certified power supplies are at least 80% efficient at doing that conversion across their whole operating range.  \nWorking backwards (someone quoted the actual max wattage above, but here it is rounded), 56A * 12V = 672W of DC power (spec was 675 I think?). If we assume the conversion from mains power was 80% efficient, we need to add 25% to that (multiply by 4/5 to go from mains to DC, 5/4 to go back), for up to 840W of mains power driving just the graphics card. On 240V AC mains, that's 840W / 240V = 3.5A at the breaker panel. So an 80 Plus PSU draws (at most) 3.5A of mains AC to produce 56A of 12V DC.",
