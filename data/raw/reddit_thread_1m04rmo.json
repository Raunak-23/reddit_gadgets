          "body": "Canon have always segmented their market and deliberately made any non-35mm-sensor cameras badly inferior to their full sized bodies. \n\nThey didn't seem to realise that there's a lot of people who want compact bodies that are packed with cutting edge features. Hence OMD and the OM1 unit with the micro four thirds sensor. Or to some extent Sony and the A6700 with APSc sensor.",
