FaceID will never deliver that. \n\nMoreover, FaceID stores user\u2019s facial biometric data which can be used by governmental agencies and corporations to track the user in real time by use of CCTV streams. Authoritarian governments do that. TouchID stores fingerprint and it can\u2019t be used to track and chase individuals in real time. And all data that is produced IS accessible by any government regardless of the technology used.\n\nReasons can be populated. Those who have the reasons need the TouchID. It doesn\u2019t hurt FaceID. TouchID tech is cheap and won\u2019t make iPhone more expensive. So, \u201cbeing against TouchID\u201d is not a logical position in the interest of customers.",
