I literally had a friend ask me for graphics card recommendations with a budget of about 550 USD. This was about the same time the 6800XT dropped to about 500 USD, so I'm like this is a no brainer recommendation. I did talk about how drivers haven't been an issue for nearly a decade and how my 6800XT and Vega64 have both been rock solid. The prat told me it sounds great, the advice is appreciated, and....bought a 4060Ti 16GB before the price on those dropped. Because it wasn't AMD and it \"fit the budget\".",

Even AMD only supports a socket for 4-5 years, so at best you could buy a system when the socket was new, then buy the last gen of CPU for that socket even if the upgrade happened 6-7 years later.\n\nIf you only buy new parts at the point you're always building an entirely new system, simply look for whatever has the best bang for the buck for your use-case. If you're still on AM4, the 5800X3D is still quite a good gaming CPU. If you're on Intel, then likely you need a full upgrade regardless, because they only tend to support 2-3 years at a time.",

For you to jump to the 7800X3D or 9800X3D. For PSU you'd probably want at least a 650W.\n\nSocket AM5 that the 7800X3D and 9800X3D are on they say will be supported through at least 2027.\n\nIf you're relatively content with the PS5, I'd probably simply drop in the 5800X3D into your current system and call it a day. If you're using the stock cooler with the 2600, I would buy a new one for the 5800. Something like the Peerless Assassin 140mm are very solid cheap air coolers that should do a decent job.",

So they merely deactivated them and sold the 5600 as a 6 core instead of 8 core CPU.\n\nI would update the bios just to make sure, but it shouldn't have issues with the new one.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/13e8y91/big_bios_leap_ryzen_2600x_to_5800x3d_on_b450/\n\nAs far as if it's worth it: Everything else being equal, it appears to be broadly a doubling of FPS for most games looking through the various benchmarks in that GN video.

And all of that is true, but it doesn't change the fact that everything else is better on AMD, and the 3d cache literally exists to make it irrelevant.\n\nThere really is no limit to their fudging. They are pointing to a number that has been made irrelevant years ago as the sole contributor to gaming performance",

(and that's a game a lot of PC gamers will care about).\n\nMy partner has the exact same PC spec as me, except for a 7800x3d (I have a 13700k) and the difference was non-trivial. So 9800x3d vs 13600k sounds like a bad move.\n\nI've been an intel shill ever since I stopped using my Athlon to heat up my bedroom back in the days, and I just can't anymore.",

                  "body": ">why are you gaming at 1080 and not taking advantage of the massive fidelity boost with 2k or 4k and high refresh rate monitors\n\nHigh refresh rate is often a scenario where CPU bottlenecks become an issue, since it doesn't matter how fast your GPU can render a frame if your CPU isn't able to prepare frames quickly enough to hit the low frame time targets. If you've got a beefy GPU and only 2~3ms of each frame is render, but the CPU takes 12ms to prepare it, you're not going to be able to make the jump from 60Hz to 120Hz and beyond without upgrading the CPU that's bottlenecking the system. \n\nCPU tests are conducted at lower resolutions because it puts the system in a scenario where this is true - a high end GPU will crank through a low resolution frame in a short millisecond or two while the bulk of the work falls on the CPU and in a like-for-like comparison that allows us to see how two CPUs perform relative to one another. \n\nThat doesn't mean this *only* happens at low resolutions though, it depends entirely on the game (and scene) in question. Counter-Strike 2 is going to be a lot easier to CPU bottleneck at 4k than Alan Wake 2, because the GPU isn't particularly stressed doing 4k renders in the former.",
