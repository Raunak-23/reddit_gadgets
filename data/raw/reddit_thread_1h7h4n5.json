      "body": "\"Forebode\" is the wrong word here because it suggests a negative or ominous sign. To \"forebode\" something means to give a warning or indication of impending trouble, doom, or misfortune. In other words, it implies that what is being predicted is bad news.\n\nIn the context of a headline about a new Apple device, there\u2019s no indication that the 18-inch foldable device is something negative. The sentence is simply trying to indicate that the display roadmap predicts or foreshadows the launch of the device in 2028.\n\n\"Foretell,\" on the other hand, is the correct choice because it means to predict or announce something before it happens\u2014without the negative connotation. By using \"foretell,\" the headline would convey that Apple\u2019s display plans are indicating or forecasting the future release of this product, which is a more neutral and appropriate meaning for the situation.",
