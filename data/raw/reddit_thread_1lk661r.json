It is not that extreme nowadays, however this became a goal for big investors. Multiply money first, everything else after. This includes a company cutting their own meat to generate as big profits as possible, many times costing the company their brand name, trust and sometimes its own existence.\n\nThis appears in very different patterns: sometimes a board of shareholders will point a CEO that specializes in extracting every possible penny and then leave the ashes behind - sometimes the board wants the company to look good, as a result every decision is made to make a short time profit so it can look good on the public report every X amount of time.\n\nTo know more, just google Ford vs. Dodge. First result, wikipedia.\n\nRegarding the laws, i might have gotten way too much happy on the wording. Sorry for that. No law itself will say clearly \"u must enshitiffy\". That makes no sense, things at this scale are made as confusing and hidden as possible.\n\nSEC regulates companies such that if a company doesn't focus on its big shareholders, they might get sued. Blackrock sueing United is one example where they took a somewhat innocent regulation (one that says they must disclose their goals and strategy) and went full blast on the lawsuit just because United started treating their customers a little tiny bit better.\n\n\nIn the end, this very much can be summarized on \"big shareholder has priority over anyone else - including the company, and its customers\". The pain starts when this (or those) big shareholder(s) dont really care, as is what happens on most investment companies.",
