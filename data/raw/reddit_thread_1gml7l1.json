I have to buy extra \u201cattachments\u201d to make it work. I am honestly surprised they threw in a \u201cfree\u201d controller at this point. The fact I can\u2019t even watch movies on the \u201cpro\u201d variant is a joke.\n\nTheir target market wants the disc drive, so why remove it?",

Personally I haven't used an optical disk for anything for at least 10 years. The main use case seems to be people who want to save a few $ via 2nd hand games. Probably even less intersection with the target  market for PS5 Pro.",

A disc includes the game itself, and all you need beyond that is to download any updates. You can't expect everyone globally to have a fast, easily available and cheap or even reasonably priced internet connection to just install multiple 70-120GB games whenever they like. It will take time (customer annoyance), affect data plans that are not unlimited, the above limitations are also a considerable factor etc. \n\nAnd then there's also the issue of owning a physical copy of something that may eventually not be available online anymore - and that you can find various ways of making it work without an internet connection if that point is reached.",

And it is because something sinister brewed in the background.\n\nI have seen all sides of the argument for, against, and even trade offs on gaming. But it boils down to money. If you follow the money you will see why things are going this way. It's not just the development, you have to remember security as well. Gaming is becoming a service because of security. Don't believe me? Bad actors are starting to infiltrate mods and cheats. Be careful what you do with your games from now on. You really do not know who to trust anymore. Features like unreal tournament 3, where they allowed custom maps to be put onto consoles (PS3, 360), will become a huge risk in the future. We have seen arbitrary code execution happen in videogames.\n\nI truly do believe that physical copies will be rendered a huge risk in the very near future as their code, as is, will be exploited. I would say the speed running community, if it gets bad enough, will be the most vulnerable victims in the very near future.\n\nI used to think that video games were a safe haven from hacks.

Just the thought of changing games by getting off the couch and dealing with a cd not to mention putting away/storing them is the most needless annoying thing I can think of when it comes to gaming.\n\nWhen ps5 was first released I bought a few physical games that were on sale, now after a few moves I have no idea where they are. If they were digital I would still have access to them. Never again will I buy physical media, would rather pay more for digital and make everything more convenient.",
