This whole idea of \"well, if your card is two generations old, this marginal upgrade from last gen might be worth it\" breaks down at the point that you realize you could've just upgraded at the end of last gen for almost the same performance uplift at a lower price.\n\nIt's the same nonsense that people are using to try and justify the desktop versions of the 5000 series. For what a 5000 series card costs you now in practice, you could've gotten a super version of a higher tier model a year ago and gotten better performance while also having it for an extra year.\n\nThey're just not good products at their price points.

Mine (a 2022 Dell XPS Plus 13inch with an i7 1260P) \"likes\" having the GPU connected at boot, as sometimes the plug and play doesn't wake up the nvidia driver and it doesn't recognize the GPU. Bitlocker throws a fit when it detects it because you've changed your \"internal\" devices. But once that is done, then it treats regularly. It keeps using the laptop's internal gpu (the processor igpu) for the window manager and less demanding applications, and then it uses the eGPU for games once you launch one.\n\nYou get a bit of a performance penalty because it can't carry the full 16 PCI-E lanes, but I can still get 60 fps of 4k (FFXIV) on my display with a 4070S on high settings.\n\nYou can get a bit more performance if you connect an external display directly on the gpu, as then the gpu doesn't have to send an image signal back through the same thunderbolt cable, but I've never played anything demanding enough to notice the difference. Plus, I use it when I travel so I only carry the laptop and the egpu.\n\nI'd say that overall it's a *bit* of a trouble (and you have to carry the darn thing too), but for my use case, I vastly prefer that than being stuck with a heavier gaming laptop all the time. Plus that means I can keep an older laptop and then \"hand down\" a GPU from my desktop to the enclosure. (The 5090 won't fit in it though, so the 4070S will probably be there for a while).",

Which would, with some tweaking, put you on a 150W budget with an old 2070rtx, for example. \n\nAnd then basically beat the tdp budget of a razer, as well as get more performance out of it for games. It would be as mobile, and it would be a laptop that wouldn't weigh a ton when you're not gaming. Etc, etc.\n\nWe could have that right now. But the industry wants to sell underclocked Intel chips with new rtx chipsets for 4k dollars. So that's what we're all reviewing. And sadly, it's what people genuinely think is reasonable to expect will be where the best performance is.\n\nBasically: unless you're a shill for useless products that genuinely make no sense to own - you don't matter in the tech sphere.\n\nAnd you chose this yourselves.",

              "body": "I chose to mention the 2070rtx because it is scoring about the same 3dmark score as the 4090 mobile does in lab-tests. \n\nI.e., when lifting the restrictions of watt in a theoretical, physically unattainable, scenario where the laptop-psu can deliver more than 175W and vent the heat - while also then throttling the cpu so that it'll only ever use less than 25W, without reduction in score -- then the 4090 mobile can score somewhat close in a practically useful performance-scenario to a soon decade old graphics card, that barely draws more power.\n\nBut you know best, don't you! And surely DLASS and frame-generation is going to magically improve the visual fidelity - on a rig that still does not have enough graphics grunt to avoid frame-dips when putting on the full shader budget.\n\nSpend your money however you want - but you can take the idea that it's somehow either a) a reasonable purchase, b) a technically impressive solution, c) a practical solution for gaming, c) a reasonably tweaked solution for an attainable tdp-budget goal - and just toss it down the drain along with your 5k dollars.\n\nBecause this bullshit - that you along with every kind of technical analphabet-press going on out there - is driving an industry that doesn't just produce bad products - it drives the industry that *could* produce good products to either not produce them at all. Or to tweak the other products in a way that targets unattainable performance/watt goals.\n\nSo I'm sitting here, for example, on a small laptop that - exactly like these \"gaming\" laptops - have been tweaked to have burst-performance so high that the entire thing throttles after 2 minutes of running. Regardless of load, it just throttles. I have graphite pads and liquid metal, custom cooling fans and ribs - and it's completely useless. Because the manufacturer is mandated to put in tweaks that make the WMI-score look good, and that has a peak on the synthetic marks that make the total result skewed upwards.\n\nIt's 100% useless - in fact even worse, it's detrimental - to gaming performance. \n\nBut you guys know best, don't you! Surely bigger numbers and better! And surely having a million cores on a graphics card that aren't used for 99% of the running time - is superb, on account of how someone, some day, are going to write CUDA code that puts cpu-routines and the final peak of 9999xsuper-sampling, temporally anti-aliased buffer-copy that moves the pixel-colours back and forth till everything is a superb blur of content that you can't recognize from the frontbuffer any more -- surely will make this bullshit product better for \"gamers\".\n\nStupidity. Organised stupidity to the point of mass delusion.\n\nBut surely Forbes little nepotistic son knows best, right? Surely Richard Leadbetter at Eurogamer, who literally works for Microsoft and any other company that offers \"insider scoops, whether he gets paid for it or not, while having so little technical understanding that he's physically incapable of questioning anything his sources dump in his inbox - surely they can be trusted, right! \"Straight from the source\", as one said, about Intel's whitepapers and the blogs that parrot them. Surely they must be giving me sound purchasing advice! /s",
