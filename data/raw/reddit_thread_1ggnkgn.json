The media coverage of those games aren't subjective.\n\nTo pretend the exclusivity is some sort of subjective playing field is being a liar.\n\nBesides even among the lovers of the console.

It's so bad it doesn't compete. \n\nIt does a lot of great things, is a beautiful device, that brings nostalgia to people and they love. Like it's handeld design turned into art. Again I don't have a playdate, but I have bought things equally stupid. The market, the end goal, is the equivalent of selling you the boutique experience of a new retro handheld. The device it's trash; but it's pretty nostalgic, a work of art etc.",

It was never going to sell very well but the specific people who wanted something like this will write rave reviews and treasure these because this type of thing doesn't come out very often on account of how they go against any rational sense for a normal person to buy on value.\n\nA better comparison is like saying a Miata is worse than a Model 3 because a Miata is slower, has worse interior materials, has worse technology, costs more in gas, and has less space than a Model 3 (going by used prices I think they're pretty comparable in price right now). The people who buy Miatas don't care about any of those things because the Miata is a very targeted product for a specific audience and the lack of practicality of one is irrelevant to their decision to get one.",
