It is a beautiful thing to allow that acvess for anyone without the ability to communicate, but then the dark side of it is real too.. and it is one that will be used by the so called dark side for horrible atrocities against peoples, and even more so, spiritual realm. Which may me taught to be a crazy concept, but it really ia real. Not a control idea for instilling fear to have poqer over others. We all are in the midst of something bigger than the headlines, or just one or two articles. Science is beautiful, it, like religion, has gone to the point where, if qe arent allowed to know our real purpose as human beings on this planet, it may be too late. I only want the best for everyone, not just the select few who are really good at seeing the puzzle and running with said advancements of our intellect, toward greed and destruction of all who would oppose them.
