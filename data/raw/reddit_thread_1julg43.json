The drones themselves are small and fast, so would be hard for a pilot to see visually, jeopardizing pilot safety.   I know the paramotor community, which flies under FAR 103, was particularly upset over it as paramotors aren't fast or agile, don't typically carry transponders either, and operate at low altitudes too so would be in some of the higher risk from the propsed rules",
