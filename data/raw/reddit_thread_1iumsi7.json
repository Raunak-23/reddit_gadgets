There are significant amounts of downtime in between.\n\nThey will never be able to build enough bridges etc... to solve traffic.  Bridges/roads require a huge amount of investment, time, and negotiations, and often, they are just cancelled.

I still wonder what concept they are trying to proof though since this seems to be vastly different from what they're trying do. Couldn't they just test an actual prototype (given that they have one) on private property like in a factory hall or something? The only thing that this seems to proof is that a few interconnected drones with an extremely light load can take off vertically, fly a few meters and land and i feel like i've seen that years ago. But i'm no expert so i'm honestly curious how this is worth a message.",

                  "body": "So, in the US regardless if you are on private property or not, you\u2019re on part of the National Airspace System, so you have to abide by the FAA rules regardless (whether it be drones, manned aircraft, rockets, balloons, etc) so even if they wanted to make a full-size version and test it on their property, it would still require them to obtain an \u201cexperimental\u201d airworthiness certificate. That process is somewhat complicated but it isn\u2019t that bad, as amateur homebuilders often go that route, but it is a lot more work than just not getting an airworthiness certificate, which is what you can do with an ultralight. Furthermore, if you certify an airplane as experimental, you can do more with it BUT it must be flown as an ultralight.\n\n\nSo, for this product, the ultralight has two advantages.\n\n1) It\u2019s cheaper, and quicker, so they really can just throw it together real quick to see if it even works. If the concept does, then they can put the work towards building a fully operational (larger) aircraft.\n\n2) An ultralight does not require the operator to have a pilot\u2019s license, so in that aspect it is a much true \u201cflying car.\u201d If it was any larger and NOT an ultralight, it really wouldn\u2019t be a flying car anymore as the operator would need a pilot\u2019s license. So it\u2019s just an airplane at that point.\n\nAlso, if they are short on funding and a small company, the ultralight prototype is a great way to show it can be done without going completely broke.\n\n\n\nAs for drones, this is borrowing drone technology for the manned space; which is great, but a manned drone is no longer a drone. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s nothing particularly groundbreaking, it just sounds like nerds having fun. Which, I don\u2019t know the size of the company, but if it is just a few people getting together to build this, and not something done by a large aerospace company, it is a pretty impressive feat.\u00a0",

And if it was designed to pass the crash tests, it would be too heavy to fly.  Look at small airplanes, and how thin their structures and exteriors are.
