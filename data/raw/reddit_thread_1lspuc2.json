I don\u2019t do much video, so I am not able to comment on it.",

Being in a particular mental headspace and feeling like you're a photographer has value.\n\nThe big question is how much time do you have to learn your gear? Hobbyist level cameras require you to manage light levels and focus, both items that smart phones and consumer point-and-shoots handle automatically.\n\nIf I was grabbing a camera to shoot at farmer's markets, I would want something that brings a particular style. Fujifilm cameras are great at getting a pleasant ascetic straight from in-camera jpgs. With an X-M5 body and a XF 16-50mm lens you'll have a great platform to learn and build from and resale value if you decide to jump ship.\n\nIf you were going to be shooting moving subjects or needed more detail for your buck I'd point you elsewhere, but a famers market sounds like a place where the warm fuji color profiles would shine.",

There is also the Fuji xt30/xt30ii which are sub 1k cameras, has a good lens selection. But both Nikon and Fuji lack ibis. \n\nThere are micro four thirds cameras like the om5 series which has a lot of tech and really good features like Ibis and computational photography. There's the Lumix g100d for 500 and the g97 for 800ish? M43 I would say has a matured and cheap lens lineup.\n\nI would recommend you look on/ask each of the camera brand subreddits \n\nr/sonyalpha \n\nr/lumix\n\nr/fujifilm\n\nr/nikon\n\n\nI use the Lumix gx9. While I enjoy taking photos with it and I have really good prime lenses. To me, Panasonic doesn't care much about m4/3. The autofocus is acceptable for shooting photos but terrible for video and I shoot manual in that case.\n\nI think your best bang for the buck would be going with a used camera body and used lens.",

They take much better pictures than phones, especially in low-light conditions and offer a great way to get into photography.\n\nExamples: Canon G7X, Ricoh GR3, Sony RX100, the new Canon Powershot V1 (especially if video is important).",
