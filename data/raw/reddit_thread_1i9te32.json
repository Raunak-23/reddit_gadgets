But that is by throwing extra cores at the problem and there aren't many workloads that max out all those 8 cores (and still plenty of workloads that barely touch two cores).\n\nWe all know benchmarks aren't a perfect comparison, but it is the best we have to go on for a quick comparison.\n\nOn Geekbench 6 multi-core we've got the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 devices at around 6,700. The iPhone 16 is at around 8,500.\n\nSo Apple are still 27% ahead there, even with two fewer cores.\n\nIf you look at single core you have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 devices around 2,100 and the iPhone 16 at 3,300.\n\nSo on single core Apple is still 57% faster. And they'll also be around the same amount faster on 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cores.\n\nSingle core is still the more important metric to compare to see how fast devices will actually be to use.\n\nHowever...\n\nI note the Oppo Find X8 Pro with its MediaTek Dimensity 9400 chipset. The iPhone is only 26% ahead of it in single core and it is pretty much level on multi-core (with 8 cores).\n\nAnd it does look like the Qualcomm side is going to make a bigger leap in 2025 than normal, with a single core score of around 3,100. That would be very nearly caught up with last year's iPhone, so things definitely have changed from two or three years ago. Will be interesting to see how much of a leap Apple makes in 2025 (I suspect not as much as Qualcomm/MediaTek have in the last couple of years).\n\nAnd yes, a significant part of those leaps on both sides are down to TSMC's manufacturing tiers, rather than Apple/Qualcomm/MediaTek's CPU designs.\n\nI probably overplayed my hand with \"still way ahead\", let's pretend I said \"still ahead\".\n\nHowever the claim I was countering was iPhones have \"MUCH lower hardware spec\", with the implication that over multiple generations games were only faster on iPhones because on Android the aren't \"optimised\" enough or they are being held back by having to run on low end Android devices as well. When the truth is if games were running faster on iPhones over the years it was mainly because the iPhone hardware was much faster than the Android side.",

If they thought lots of people would buy it, they'd make it.\n\nThere are phones like you are describing on the Android side. But they a pretty niche and you don't see many people using them even though they are available (most of the people I see with them are tradespeople, because the phones tend to also be designed to cope with abuse). So the truth is, the market for big arse heavy phones just isn't big enough for companies like Apple to target.",

Ai is literally a drop in the bucket in comparison. \n\n>Even so, those industries provide things we actually use... Chatgpt and AI art is used for novelties and replacing jobs.\n\nWell to be pedantic, we don't *need* dairy milk, we want the luxury of it. Same with beef, the ratios of water consumption are 7:1 for beef vs 2.5:1 for poultry. We don't *need* beef, we could absolutely survive just eating chicken and it would be the correct environmental decision. But we want the luxury of eating it.\n\nSo since we're speaking about luxuries and novelties either way, I see no argument here for limiting or eliminating ai usage when we allow so many other forms of wasting water. Like I said, at least ai is technically recycling that water.",

The problem is that companies are forcing AI into every crevice it doesn't belong.\n\nFor example, I'm using AI at work, to write code and scripts and it turned something that would normally take a week into something I can do in an hour. Meanwhile, Apple is using AI to generate Memoji's and cartoon images. Why would they think that was ever going to be popular?\n\nAnother example, I have a rambling mind and its difficult for me come up with a structure for my thoughts to put on paper, whether its for a project proposal, research, etc. I use AI to come up with a template/format to use where I can then fill in the blanks. Apple has a AI email editor where you compose an email and then use AI to re-write it for you. \n\nIts just not seamless, it feels forced.",

      "body": "I have not yet had the opportunity to evaluate Apple's AI capabilities, but my experiences with Samsung's Bixby and Google's AI tools have been underwhelming.\n\nI recently tested Google AI's ability by asking it to \"locate a nearby Italian restaurant with good pasta and navigate me there\". Instead of providing accurate directions, it directed me to a newspaper office that had a review of a restaurant located two hours away, which was entirely unhelpful.\n\nSimilarly, when I used Bixby to set a timer for four hours, it initially responded that it couldn\u2019t complete the task. After repeating the request, it managed to perform the action but without explanation for the initial failure. Additionally, the voice-to-text functionality consistently introduces errors. For instance, when I instructed it to \"text my wife and ask her what she wants for dinner,\" it misinterpreted the request and sent the exact phrase \"ask her what she wants for dinner,\" failing to capture the intended meaning.\n\nWhile I am optimistic about the potential of AI and its long-term benefits, these repeated inefficiencies undermine its value. If I must continually verify and correct its output, the time investment outweighs any convenience it may offer. At that point, it becomes simpler to complete the task manually.\n\nThat said, AI is undoubtedly improving, and I remain hopeful that advancements in 2025 and beyond will deliver a more reliable and seamless user experience. However, the current capabilities do not justify the considerable hype surrounding its utility at present. I feel we are [somewhere just before the first peak](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg) on the hype train.",
