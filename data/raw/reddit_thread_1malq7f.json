And it's also incredibly beginner friendly with tons of stuff out of the box, compared to, say, Unity, which is barebones without buying ton of modules from market. The only reason Unity games don't stutter because there is nothing there.. But lazy devs don't optimize their games(which is rather easy, untill you want to optimize to the limit, so your game can run on mobiles and such), either because they are bad devs or their managers decide that optimizations is not important, better push release faster and grab some money. And UE gets a bad rep because of them.",
