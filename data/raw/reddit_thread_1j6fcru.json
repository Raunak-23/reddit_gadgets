It\u2019s terribly surprising that Sony could pivot to support WiFi 6 within a year of its release for the PS5, but Nintendo couldn\u2019t switch to 6E five years after its release\u2026\n\nI normally give companies a break for opting for 6 chips over 6E chips since adoption of 6Ghz routers isn\u2019t *huge* yet\u2026 but it\u2019s growing.  Even Verizon\u2019s default home router offers it.  With the original Switch now in its 8th year of life, this seems very shortsighted of Nintendo.\n\nEspecially after all the efforts of Nintendo to support \u201cCloud versions\u201d of titles on the Switch, I am so surprised that supporting 6Ghz wasn\u2019t a major goal for streaming purposes.",

So only  smaller subset of users would actually use it.\n2. 6E\u2019s main benefit is that it uses 6GHz band which gives much faster speeds (and less congestion), but at a much shorter range (a problem for a handled device). Those speeds are most likely not necessary for a switch since gaming uses very little bandwidth, and the only thing that would be faster is downloading games, which are limited by the speed of the SD card or slow internal storage anyways.\n\nSo I\u2019d say very little benefit for very few people.

          "body": "Wifi 7 is overkill for most people, plain and simple. Remember most people are getting <300mbps anyways from their ISP. 10 gig internal networking will never be your bottleneck in that regard. \n\nWifi 6 could also be argued as pretty overkill for the majority of households as well, but is getting more necessary for the additional bandwidth for multiple devices streaming on Wi-Fi at the same time, as well as IoT devices. WiFi 6 and 6e will be more than enough for most families going into the future. The best application for wifi 7 is going to be in enterprise deployments.",
