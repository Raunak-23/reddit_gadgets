We do have a word we use a lot and it sounds like PISS just with one S and it literally means piss off to the cat. They understand that one and bolt lol. They like and abuse my outdoor furniture too much.\n\nThey're not my cats btw, they may be street may be neighbours(we let cats roam, they're native here for 1000s yrs so no invasive species). Haven't had a cat in years and those were rescues like they lost their mom and were wailing babies, but they mysteriously \"ran away\" once I was gone for studies in an another country. \n\nI may keep the next rescue though but I hope it's not a cable eater like one I had. \n\nOther then that I tolerate them and tell them to piss off, they still like my yard and god forbid if there's a box. My sister once made a mistake of feeding them, they knew exactly when lunchtime is and stood with sad eyes and that baby cry they do, little grifters all of them.",

You will have streaming for that, and hopefully households get equipped with great lines for streaming.\n\nI've already been living the Ally+GFN life and I love it. I can play in 4k120 on my TV, I can play in 120 on my bed, or I can play indie games(and everything older from PC) locally on the go.",

                  "body": "While it is true that ARM-based SoCs tend to have a (slightly) better power efficiency than X86-64 CPUs (though both AMD and Intel claim that their current offerings beat Apple's and Qualcomm's ARM chips), many of the reasons why Apple's M chips saw such a massive increase in power efficiency don't apply to the Switch.\n\n- Apple is willing to pay extra to ensure that is own processors are made in the latest process nodes, i.e. the most advanced manufacturing methods offered on the market. When the Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max launched, they were made in a smaller process node (i.e. 5 nm) than contemporary desktop/laptop x86 CPUs. That alone provided a massive boost in power efficiency (TSMC claimed a 30% reduction going from 7 nm to 5 nm)\n\n- Apple's latop/desktop class M chips (i.e. M* Pro and M* Max) are massive and in regards to processors, size matters. E.g. the Apple M2 Max has a die area of ~510 mm\u00b2, the M2 Pro has a die area of ~288 mm\u00b2. The newer M3 Pro/Max and M4 Pro/Max models are similar sized, with the M4 Max  supposeldy being larger than 400 mm\u00b2. Compared to this a current Strix Point APU from AMD has a die area of 232.5 mm\u00b2.\n\n- The M* Pro/Max chips from Apple are always paired with fast memory and offer a relatively high bandwidth due to their memory controllers. The memory controller of a desktop x86 CPU might allow a bandwidth in the area of 200 GB/s at most; e.g. for a Ryzen 9 7950X the hypothetical maximum is 96 GB/s (effectively it is less than 80 GB/s even with the fastest DDR5 memory). The Apple M4 Pro meanwhile has a theoretical memory bandwidth of up to 273 GB/s. The larger cache and the higher bandwidth lead to less time spent waiting for cache hits, i.e. less time that computations have to wait (consuming energy) without providing performance\n\n- Last but not least, there is a sweetspot for power efficiency for every processor; i.e. a clock speed/voltage beyond which the power consumption increases more than the gain in performance. Due to the tight competition on the laptop & desktop market, many x86 CPUs are often clocked beyond that point.\n\nFor the Switch and Switch 2, only the last aspect matters (to some degree). Nintendo is not willing to pay extra for smaller process nodes, larger chips or fast memory. The company wants to keep production costs down and hence relies on slightly customized, older off-the-shelf designs from Nvidia. Likewise, Sony is unlikely to pay the extra costs required to copy Apple's massive power efficiency gains.",

I wouldn't want to use my phone as my primary gaming device because I wouldn't want it interrupting me when a call or message came in while gaming, nor would I want it muting all incoming communications while I play.

If that\u2019s true, a significant upgrade to the PS5 becomes more attainable. If gains between console generations are becoming less pronounced and development times are going up, the simplest solution is for Sony to adapt and prolong the timeframe of the PS5 to allow technological progress sufficient for a generational leap.",
