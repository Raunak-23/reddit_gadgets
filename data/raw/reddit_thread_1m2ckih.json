In the US it\u2019s about the \u201cfreedom to\u201d decide for yourself what medical care you receive based on your own personal wealth/means.\n\nGun control is about the \u201cfreedom from\u201d gun violence vs the \u201cfreedom to\u201d own and use a firearm on another person.\n\nFree speech is \u201cfreedom from\u201d abuse/hate speech/racism vs \u201cfreedom to\u201d say what you want without restriction.\n\nThis extends to private businesses and companies where the government in the US is minded to protect the rights of the company to do what it wants in the pursuit of business/success. In Europe, companies are more restricted in the interest of ensuring citizens are \u201cfree from\u201d corporate overreach and abuse.\n\nThere are merits to both sides and bad implications of the government leaning too far in one direction.",

That's because I paid for a smart thermostat, not a dumb one. \n\nDisabling online services can be anything they (Nintendo) wants. That means they can ban you from playing Splatoon online, ban you from all Nintendo game servers, ban you from using the E-shop or straight up ban you from all online services completely, including firmware updates.\n\nSo when we say online services like it's some innocuous thing, you have to understand that these devices are going the route of not having anything 'physical' but the bare hardware itself. It's all online services. \n\nRetail games are even increasingly shipping with no actual physical medium, just stubs and code for you to download the actual game from their (in this case, Nintendo's, but all console manufacturers are the same) own official, proprietary and mandatory online shop.\n\nSo, no physical mediums + the legal authority to not allow you access to anything online + the legal backing to make even side-loading software updates illegal if they wish (because it's illegal to reverse engineer any proprietary DRM measures) and they can make your console a paper weight with a screen whenever they want by just disabling online services. \n\nThis is the point. They can be benevolent and not brick your device, sure. But they have also put themselves, purposefully, in the position that they can decide unilaterally whatever level of functions of your device they want to disable remotely at any time. **Any of them**, from annoyance to full brick.\n\nYou don't even get to have a device that can run your current physical games either, because they already have DRM measures on their physical games too, so they can know if your device is banned and stop you from booting your game. \n\nYou also can't disable those DRM measures, because it's illegal. You can't put custom firmware to bypass them, it's illegal. The people who bypass those measures in the hacker scene? All doing illegal shit. \n\nNintendo, Sony, Microsoft hold all the cards with their consoles. They can brick them whenever. They just haven't done it to you so far. \n\nBut sure it won't literally disable the screen and splash logo. I'm sure consumers who spent 600$ on a console really wanted a Brand logo splash screen simulator with some dead menus.",

So this kinda is a Nintendo thing\u2026 \n\nI'd agree that it's a Nintendo thing, just not in the way you're implying. \n\nSony and MS will both ban you if you get caught online played pirated games and/or using a modified console. The publicly accessible exploits for these consoles generally require you to be on an outdated firmware and require a bit of effort/understanding to install. The people that are willing to put in the effort to successfully mod their consoles using these exploits are generally smart enough to understand  what they're getting themselves into, avoid doing anything that will lead to a ban, and don't try to pretend they're a victim if they do get banned as a direct result of their own actions. Many of these mods leave the console in a state where it's impossible to go online in the first place and/or go out of their way to prevent the console from going online anyway.\n\nOTOH, anyone with enough money for a mig cart and two braincells to rub together can pirate games on a Switch and go online without having to really understand what they're doing.

Sony and Microsoft both do this, it's not new. it's the pirates fault, they know they are pirating, pirating has consequences. nintendo is not the big bad these children are making them out to be. nintendo has the right and the obligation to developers to protect their platform from pirates, hackers and thieves else no one would develop for the platform. it's not nintendo is bad, it's that they all do it so stop singling out nintendo",

It didn't help that they also nominally understand not to be complete pieces of shit when it comes to many privacy concerns but were and are still some of the leading producers of unnecessary e-waste with their insistence on their dumbfuck walled garden approach. \n\nThey were more brazen than many others who did similar anti consumer practices but just didn't come out to defend themselves and opted to lay low and point at Apple instead.\n\nThis beautifully parallels Nintendo. All console manufacturers are going digital first, closed ecosystem with complete control over your device. But Nintendo is the first one to release one recently, boast about how locked down it is, while also being very recently involved in taking down emulators and fan events through legal notice. People are already primed to hate Nintendo but they're really not that different from the other manufacturers in their space. Just slightly more litigious and out of touch.",

Here: \n\n> If Nintendo is \"Evil\" there is ~~literally not~~ barely a single ~~dev~~ big publisher out there who is \"good\" then.\n\nNintendo makes good games and has good game dev teams. They don't make the consoles, they don't publish the games, they don't handle marketing, they don't make the web services or the shop. That's other dev departments, marketing and the executives.\n\nThe problem never was and never has been with the studios. Some are shitty (*cough* Blizzard *cough*) but the publishers are almost always in need of a sanitary cordon for the sheer greed and desire for control that exudes out of them like a toxic miasma.\n\n> not the numerous devs/publishers pumping out gacha games or insane predatory tactics with microtransactions.\n\nYou mean scams and gambling? That's the kind of scum that almost doesn't even need constructive criticism. They need jail and fines. Those publishers aren't even worthy of being in the same conversation as anti consumer behaviour, those are just third rate petty criminals.\n\n> And while I can agree that Nintendo has forcefully done bad things, \n\nSo you're going to chastise them for the shit they did wrong then right? Not proceed to defend them, right? \n\n> they are by no means the worst dev/publisher in the industry.\n\nIf not being the worst is the bar before we start substantively criticizing shitty behaviour I guess we can all lie and steal as long as a single murderer still exists on this earth, right?\n\nThey don't get a wink and a wave for being less shitty than dog-shit. They do creatively stupid bad shit. They give other people creative shit ideas to also do. They don't get a pass.\n\n> They first and foremost make good, fun, complete games without being littered with microtransactions, \n\nThey don't. As a business they primarily make proprietary gaming platforms and merchandise. The games are the vehicle for those platforms and merchandise to make money. \n\nThe games are good. Again, first party Nintendo game studios are not the problem here. Their platforms are the problem. Their publishing arm is the problem. \n\nWhen you have a good hearted guy come do landscaping for you with shit tools and a shit schedule and goes above and beyond to provide a decent service just for his boss at the landscaping company to overcharge you and tell you to eat it, is it the labourer's fault you're getting screwed?\n\n> You might as well just quit gaming if that's your opinion.\n\nYou do know that there's an entire world of videogames, old and new, in a million different platforms, from a million different publishers, besides console exclusive first party games, right?\n\n> which is already infinitely better than 99% of the industry. \n\nOnly if by industry you close your eyes and forget anything exists but EA, Ubisoft, Sony and Microsoft. That's ironically much closer to 1% of the industry than 99%.\n\nEven middling publishers like Atlus ship an amount of games in parity with those big names. This sounds more like you saying if Marvel is shit than the whole movie industry must be shit when there's more movies coming out of France in one film festival then the entire Marvel catalog.",

That hasn't been proven with durability testing yet, and Nintendo DID state they redesigned the analogs, so they should at least be better than before. Also, the magnetic rail to attach the joycons might interfere with the EM-way Hall effect functions, so it might not have been an option at all.",

Sampling bias.\n\n> No console maker has a Hall-effect controller. Not even the $200 Sony and Xbox ones. And you can also buy from a range of quality 3rd party controllers that DO have those things: So buy those instead of more 1st party ones.\n\nThey (first party controllers) all suck. It's mostly agreed by everyone who plays for more than an hour a week. The issue there is simple. They all have easily fixable, or straight up better options, but all chose to brand their shittiest, cheapest manufacturing option for the maximum accepted consumer price, e-waste be damned, just for a tiny bit bigger margin and more replacement purchases. Scummy behaviour. \n\n> It's similar to the issue with the game key carts: The alternative was not having it and companies just shipping cases with DL codes in them\n\nNo. No it wasn't the alternative. There were, in fact, a million alternatives. 128gb of consumer grade flash storage retails for 10$. For a big ass company, bulk buying even 256gb of flash storage (we're talking USB pen or even micro SD card size) might be as low as a $1 per unit, maybe less. \n\nThey purposefully designed a shitty cartridge to keep in line with their brand designs going back to the Gameboy, instead of worrying about how big third party games might get, and supporting third party developers. This is further evidenced by their complete lack of store curation and discoverability features on the shop, which shows they never thought too much, or too far beyond their own first party titles. Pure style and quirky design over actual consideration for good hardware design principles. They could have literally just had you plug in usb storage. Any third rate Chinese handheld can do it. \n\n> Yet people were treating it like the opposite: That Nintendo is Enabling publishers to shirk consumers. And even if that were the case: Be mad at the publishers that do that instead of mad at the console maker.\n\nThey were enabling publishers (and Nintendo is also a publisher). In this case, most likely, by pure negligence or incompetence. Doesn't make it better. If you went to the trouble of buying a full price physical medium, you did not pay for a license to a digital key to a digital store, you paid for a license to reproduce content from a physical medium. \n\nI wouldn't accept that bullshit when buying a Blu-ray or DVD of a movie or a music CD, I don't want an iTunes store digital key or a paramount plus digital download license. That's bullshit and you know it. They know it too. \n\nThe whole argument of resale goes out the window too because when they discontinue the switch e-shop, like they did for the 3ds guess what a digital key gets you? Nothing. Dead link. Worthless. And worst, legal.\n\nContrast that with going right now to any store, and you can still buy a second hand vinyl of an LP from the 50s. You can still buy a working PS1 CD of your favourite 90s game. See the difference? \n\n> Mad at Nintendo for reserving the right to sell a game at $80 MSRP\n\nAs they should. You should too. Or are you happy every time you go to the grocery store and food is more expensive? You can always downgrade to horse feed if you don't have the money for anything better.\n\n> bc ppl say other companies will follow suit: Yeah well, if their shit isn't worth 80 then it's going to fail. Don't buy it. That's not Nintendo's fault even if they are greedy for asking for 80.\n\nThey're being predatory and greedy. That's a problem. It's a problem regardless of whether you have options. Again, if they face no backlash for that behaviour what stops them from continuing down that road when they have every incentive to do so? \n\nThis market bullshit also doesn't work when they have IP monopolies. If you want to see a new Mario game, it has to be Nintendo green lighting it. Period. And it will be at whatever price they want it to be. So you have to simply accept that if a company decides to shoot themselves in the foot, you lose any characters, narratives and stories you are attached to.\n\nIs that the end of the world? No. But we're social creatures who communicate through stories, games and narrative and attach emotional depth to them. These companies, as well as most others that deal with cultural IPs know it and manipulate people through their monopolies to boost their profits and revenue astronomically. That's also incredibly scummy and unnecessary. Nintendo has the most profitable IPs in modern history, on par only with Minecraft. They are just being excessively greedy. \n\n> Not to mention they're offering a complete polished experience without cash shops and MTX, but you'd think they were just as bad as COD with how people have been acting.\n\nThat's not out of the goodness of their hearts. They are a Japanese company known for being kid friendly. Part of their entire appeal and brand name is built around selling their games for kids, kids friendly merchandise and even amusement park experiences (sort of like Disney) and their domestic presence is very important to them. Mario is sort of like a Japanese equivalent to Mickey Mouse in that respect. In Japan, it would be a big cultural no-no for Mario to shove credit card pop-ups for an 8 year old. That would be a mass-resign in shame moment.\n\nThe biggest problem is, like Disney, part of that 'polished' experience is wrestling control away from the user as much as possible. They actively want to curtail your consumer rights, as much as possible, and completely lock you in their guard rails experience, lest a modder decide to release a custom firmware to mod Princess Peach with her tits out and post it somewhere and 'ruin their reputation'. \n\nThey don't want you to own your device, because people might think something you did of your own accord might have something to do with them and their brands. That kind of need for brand control is just fundamentally incompatible with consumer rights and free speech. That irks a lot of people. Deservedly so.\n\nIt's your right to be as much of a pain in Nintendo's ass as you want with your own console and it's your right to draw and post as much Bowser gay porn as you wish. They don't get a pass for being scummy fucks just because Mario Kart is a fun game.",

You would be over $5 just for the cost of the flash memory alone on a 64gb card (the smallest size being sold to Sw2 devs), let alone licensing fees and other costs on the BoM.\n\nThe 32GB Switch carts cost developers a little over $20USD around 5 years ago, I'm not sure what it is now. And those were UHS-I cards aka 90-100MB/sec Read. That is significantly slower than even most HDDs these days. They make some now that get close to 200MB/sec in UHS-1 but the price goes up a bit for those.\n\nUHS-2 cards are much more expensive, in the range of the mSD Express cards used for the extra storage slot, and cap out at 300MB/sec. CFast isn't really feasible since that format is much larger than an SDcard.\n\n>That's not out of the goodness of their hearts. They are a Japanese company known for being kid friendly.

Most companies are happy to shovel complete garbage at kids, because they are less discerning. There are tons of kids games from other companies on consoles and PC that are complete trash as well. That you completely handwave them polishing their releases in the face of an industry that most often does NOT, shows clear bias which once again undercuts your argument. Also, have you been to a Disney park lately? They monetize the shit out of the experience now: It costs extra for everything.",

The OG Switch had all kinds of failsafes to prevent firmware rollbacks and custom firmware installation, as well as banning anyone who went online while running it. The folks who were doing it got around all of that very easily by creating partitions with custom firmware and keeping a basic installation of official firmware if they wanted to play online, or ya know, they just didn't play online at all. They also had easy to use software to manually download updates and install them to the system without ever having to connect to official servers.\n\nOnce someone cracks the Switch 2, there will be similar workarounds, so you won't ever *need* to connect to Nintendo and risk having your console bricked, and even if you fuck up and get yourself banned from their online service? Oh no, boo hoo. Guess I'll just have to do it myself now. They won't be locking you out of anything, and you'll be free to install whatever homebrew you desire. The threat of being cut off from the servers is only an issue right now because we don't have homebrew running that would allow us to circumvent that problem. It's the threat of actual bricking that makes this such a huge issue, and if they start leveraging it, whatever the reason, it's completely unacceptable.",

It's just statistics. You will be a minority in something at some point, and then you'll want the basic protections you dismiss right now. \n\n> To be fair,\n\nYou are not being fair, you're being agreeable towards a company that is doing something that should be illegal. Regardless of whether the primary use for a device is crime, you don't get to decide what people do with what you sell them retroactively.\n\nA leaf grinder is primarily used to grind weed. The manufacturers are not and should not be responsible for policing what people do with their leaf grinders. This is evidenced by the fact that they are not liable when people are caught grinding weed with them. \n\nSimilarly, here, Nintendo as the gaming platform provider, are not liable for anything people do when they pirate games on it. No developer gets to sue Nintendo because people pirated their game on a switch. \n\nThus, Nintendo also doesn't get to lock basic functionality of your device (which includes their proprietary online services, **because they purposefully offer no alternative to them**) because you pirate games on it. Neither would they get to do it if you used custom firmware on a switch to control drones to bomb a hospital. No matter how heinous the crime is it's not their responsibility if it's not supported as part of your contract of purchase. \n\nThey just want their cake and eat it too because they are also a games publisher, so they want to unilaterally ban you to keep their bottom line as a publisher.

While obviously 1000 instances of the same serial number online is almost definitely going to have pirates included, you could reasonably spoof or clone your own serial number multiple times. Why you'd want to do so? Who knows, but fucking with your devices can be fun. Not necessarily piracy. Even so, piracy should not disable key features of your device, it should disable key features of the game in question. This heavy ban approach is shitty no matter how you slice it.",

So if you buy 2nd hand, you gotta make sure you have solid proof to get unbanned with. The ones ive read about so far all had to provide proof of buying the game from someone on FB marketplace/craigslist/etc. Dunno what you'd do if a friend just loaned you old games or something.

In both cases, this refers to Nintendo's copyrighted software, which can be necessary for the device to function.\n\nCorporations cannot take your physical devices from you, neither in the USA nor in the EU.

What legitimate and legal reason do you have for making a Switch 2 backup right now? Emulators don't yet exist and if your Switch 2 were to break it is most likely covered under warranty. Once the Switch 2 matures it is highly probable that you will be able to make backups via a new exploit, I actually think manufacturers should provide consumers with the means to do this for discontinued hardware, but that is unlikely to ever happen.",

                                      "body": "I suppose it's moreso how things are portrayed that makes us make an inherent assumption that due to traditional goods and value in what is physical, that make us have this inherent assumption that stealing is worst than counterfeiting.\n\nThough to be clear I'm moreso referring to the results of the act itself with relation to the owner of the original.\n\nThe thought process being that when it comes to physical goods, stealing itself deprived the owner of the physical goods itself, and thereby causes more damage than if someone were to create a counterfeit and indirectly creates loss of sales for the owner.\n\nThis was my inital thought process and one that I believe many hold, though it is true that it can be worst, since if something is counterfeited even if the owner were to make more the damage is still done from the loss in value in counterfeiting.\n\nI am ignoring the process as to how the act is done though. Since as ya mentioned, it could slavery that allows the counterfeit to happen, or maybe the person themselves made it with their own effort copying the design.\n\nSlavery in the scenario ya mention I would consider it a separate offense. If someone were to steal something for example, and were to kill someone in the process of stealing something, I would consider a separate offense to determine and differentiate the average thief who stole something without harming others physically.\n\nBeing a programme, however. It has its pros of being close to impossible to steal/deprive the owner of the programme itself, but is also extremely easy to counterfeit in its exact form with little to no limitations. \n\nThere is a high cost of production of said programme, but distribution itself cost little to no amount of cost, making its true values tied solely to intangible means. However that also means that unlike a physical item where there is some cost for its materials or tangible form, being reliant solely on its intangible value means that it can become worthless and the owner be left with \"nothing\" similar to stealing. \n\nA physical item that was counterfeited, has to some extent be sold at a price that recoups initial cost.  It would also take some time to develop and have its effect of reducing the value of the original owner be at a much slower rate.\n\nHowever as a programme, that cost in terms of money and time is close to neglible,  which is why it is able to be \"resold\" for free or close to free (many piracy sites do sell them at a cost or via ad revenue), thereby drastically reducing the value of the owners product more and therefore \"more immoral\" so to speak imo since it negatively impacts the owner more drastically compared to traditional countefeiting.",

Europe relies on a relatively high GDP per capita to act as an attractive market to foreign firms and use that leverage to enact regulations, but those same regulations cut their legs out from under them as the European economy (in total and per capita) falls further and further behind.
