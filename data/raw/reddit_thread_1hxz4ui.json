It might not be useful to you now, but later down the road it could be.  \n\nAlso innovation leads to the evolution of that tech.  Sure it's vertical here.  Maybe down the line that helps them evolve the tech to increase width.  Then combining the two could make a rollable and foldable screen.  You can fold it to 1/4 then size as a phone, then unfold it to be a full on laptop/tablet.  \n\nOr imagine those curved screens like we have now, but now it can curve from the top and sides, giving you a screen that displays a bit overhead like a half dome.  Talk about a wild immersive experience for gaming.",

This is not my view but I can give one example: It used to be the norm for browsers to have the file/edit/history toolbar at the top and not a sidebar like in most browsers. Now only Firefox afaik has this option. It's a simple preference but for many people it's hard to adjust to these things and minor things annoy them especially for people on the autism spectrum. So when the industry stops offering these things we are left with no alternative for the way we like things.",

That potential problems only affect that particular piece of hardware.  \n\nAlso like I said you don't have to buy it.  While a browser you need to use for the Internet....a browser isn't also a new innovated piece of software.  \n\nAlso your counterpoint is about an aspect of the browser, but not the browser in its entirety. \n\nYou probably agree a browser it's great, but you have differing preference.\n\nWhat I'm talking about is akin to the browser and not an aspect of the browser.  \n\nLike your argument would be like I don't want a screen that rolls vertically, I prefer a screen that rolls horizontal.  But you agree having a rolling screen regardless is a good thing.  If that makes sense.  Sorry for the lengthy reply, got carried away lol",

But you wouldn't not invent the touchscreen on the premise you might not like it.  You still invent the thing and try it out.  If it seems good you push it out to market, then consumers will dictate its staying power by either buying it or not.  Then you try and fix the issue that crop up from mass production and improve on the tech.  \n\nI highly doubt this is going to somehow replace all laptop screens. That's unfortunate your touchscreen is like that, but that sounds like a bug.  I don't have a problem with the touch screen and my fingers aren't small.   Not all touch screens are equal either.",
