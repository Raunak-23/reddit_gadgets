So you cannot just buy and then rent your copy to people for money. You can lend them, you can sell them but not rent them.\n\n\nThis was attempted in the US also but Nintendo lost the case (IDK the details but the Judge sided with the rental business) and the only thing Nintendo succeeded on doing is suing Blockbuster for distribution of copyrighted material (manuals were reprinted and given to customers which is what violated the law) so Blockbuster had to start drawing their own manuals.",

Shutting down rom sites (piracy), Yuzu (Promotion of piracy), Bowser guy (He did same thing as the Japanese guy in the article, sold pirated material) and Etika Joy Cons (Bad taste because they were made in memory but it turned out to be a scam anyway).\n\nHonorable mentions is them buying the distribution rights to Super Hornio Bros porn movies to end it because it damaged Super Mario brand. Only Part 2 is recovered with Part 1 still being lost so technically Nintendo owns porn movies.  \n\n\nI think the only time Nintnedo is truly evil is NSO replacing Virtual Console and Youtube Partners thing they used to do.  I still miss Virtual Console:( NSO sucks ass and I hate those who defend the dumb gamepass scheme that they did with old games.",
