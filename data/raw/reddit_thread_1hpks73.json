They can sell you the TV cheaply because they make it back on ads.\n\nThey are incentivized to lower your buy-in price to sell more units. Because that means more ad revenue. But in the end you're saving hundreds or thousands of dollars on the TV compared to what a non-ad TV would charge.\n\nAnd again, you have the option of *NOT* connecting it to the internet. These TVs have HDMI ports. Hook up an old computer to use as a streaming station. If you're more tech-savvy you can block the ad traffic at your router, or get a pi-Hole.\n\nIt's similar to the PS3. Sony sold the PS3 at a loss. They lost money for every PS3 sold. But what they were doing was putting Blu-Ray players into homes, cheaply. And then they made it back on Blu-Ray licensing because in the battle of HD-DVD v. Blu-Ray, well, people bought PS3's just to use as Blu-Ray players. \n\nIn a similar move, Roku is selling their TVs at lower profit margins than other companies, and betting they will make it back serving ads. I don't see this as a bad thing. People can afford better luxuries at lower prices. And with a bare minimum effort can completely avoid the ads.\n\nHere, I'll give you proof.\n\n* Samsung 4k 75\" UHD Smart TV\n * $798.00 on Amazon\n* Samsung 4k 75\" UHD Commercial Signage Display (aka \"Dumb\" TV)\n * $1,494.28 on Amazon\n\n\nIt's the same fucking thing. But one is \"Smart\" and presumably has ads. The other does not. You can buy the TV without ads, but are you willing to pay for it? Survey says, No.",

Laws also include things like banning asbestos and lead in many products, the level of contamination in engine exhaust, what frequencies wireless communication can use.\n\nAnd guess what? These laws work. We're not putting asbestos and lead pipes in buildings anymore. Automobile manufacturers have to meet exhaust and efficiency standards. Cell phone services aren't knocking each other offline due to competing over the same bands.\n\nWe can absolutely ban companies shoving manipulative advertising into every inch of our goddamn lives. And it'll work. Because laws and regulations work, despite what right-wing ideologues want you to believe.

Quotes around that because there are always going to be ways around it.\n\n>Most people aren't willing to go through \"all that hassle\" though.\n\nI personally think setting up a TV with the often slow and laggy UI and onscreen keyboard is more of a hassle. No idea why people are willing to tolerate that, but can't be bothered to use a dongle.",

There is definitely built in obsolescence in modern day Appliances because of the connected features. They have become as much computer as they are machine. Circuit boards go and can be hard to replace or install without a tech, making the repair less appealing than just replacing the unit.  This is why I have held onto the 2006 whirlpool appliances that came with my house. They have been pretty damn reliable and when something does go, finding parts are easy and the repairs are simple. Contrast with my mother in law that has gone through a Samsung washer/dryer, an oven, and a dishwasher that all came new with her house in 2017.  I should mention I use to sell appliances and TVs, was the supervisor at a Best Buy for those departments and the biggest thing that kills these new appliances is power surges. And where I lived and worked was an older and more affluent area. Baby boomers would have a brand new house constructed only to completely remodel and replace the appliances a few years later. There was a lot of keeping up with the Jones\u2019 mentality.",

All I see is the weather and a clock on the screensaver.\n\nAn LCD screen on a microwave oven is still freaking weird though, don't get me wrong, just like the fridges with tablets on them.
