The gist is that it becomes trivially easy to watch what anybody is doing at any time, and they'd have to be watching you in order to know you were doing it. Celebrities, government officials, your neighbor's teenage daughter, whatever. Privacy is abolished within the space of a few years, and governments can't really police it effectively. \n\nPeople start taking precautions. Masks, showering in the dark, bulky clothes, etc. One of the precautions is a sort of screen-cloth mask that lets you project different faces. The point is to make you as anonymous as possible, and to change it up randomly to make tracking harder.\n\nAnd that's *before* they develop the ability to look back in time with the same fidelity, to see what people did before they realized they could be seen.",
