The CPU is clearly faster too, with the 12 now seeming far less responsive in the UI. Honestly, just getting the responsiveness back was huge for me. \n\nFinally moving to USB-C for charging was really nice too. We\u2019re slowly retiring our lightning charging cables, so it\u2019ll be nice to have one cable type around. One complaint about Apple\u2019s USB-C connector though is that it seems far less reliable at data with abuse. Wife and I both use it for CarPlay in our cars, and after a month or so, the connection will be prone to disconnects with moving the phone around. I\u2019ve tried a few different cable brands without improving reliability. It\u2019s weird because the cable won\u2019t feel more loose, but replacing with a new cable fixes things for a while. And don\u2019t see the same issue when just charging via cable at night.",

A flagship that would typically cost $800+ in the US might cost anywhere between $400-$600 in China.\n\nFor being a \"free market\" country, there's actually very little competition in the US when it comes to smartphones and consumer electronics in general.",

Some OEMs like Meizu and ZTE fall a little short when it comes to software, but Vivo and Huawei all have very good software at least to me. Both have Android skins that sort of shamelessly resemble iOS but functionally they're fantastic and that's all that really matters IMO.

The Huawei Pura 70 Ultra 1TB is over $1,500 (dollars) *in China* now. That's not the export price, that's in the domestic Chinese market.\n\nThe first few generations of Xiaomi and OnePlus we're absolute steals for the price. Truly excellent specs for ~400. Camera quality was a step behind, but it was more than forgivable for the price.\n\nIn about 2018 however, Chinese smartphone manufacturers finally turned the pricing corner they had been so impatiently waiting to turn.\n\nThe biggest/best Chinese manufacturers finally bumped pricing up to pretty much match Apple and Samsung.",

The Find X8 Pro costs $745 for the 12/256 variant domestically while the S25+ costs $1K for the same configuration except the cameras are arguably worse and the battery is smaller. \n\nThis doesn't take into account flagship killers, though. Redmi K80 Pro would be considered a flagship here in the states and given its specs you'd expect it to be priced at $700-$800 or even more, but it costs about $500 for the 12/256 variant domestically. The same goes for the Vivo S20 Pro, except that's a bit cheaper at $470 for the 12/256 variant. Honor GT Pro comes with the same SOC as the S25U, decent cameras, ultrasonic fingerprint reader, IP69 rating and a 7200mAh battery with 90W charging yet it costs about $500 for the 12/256 variant. For reference, the Galaxy A56 and Pixel 9a both cost $500 yet they don't even come remotely close to what Chinese OEMs can give you for the same price.",

And - variously - onboard mic arrays that embarrass everything on the apple lineup.\n\niphones still obviously have better / more energy efficient chipsets - sort of - though that\u2019s almost completely irrelevant given that smartphone processor performance is total overkill, has been for some time, and those phones all have onboard AI processing too, just a generation or so behind apple. The one actual differentiator I could maybe think of is the lidar sensor. Though I could be off base on that. And the iphones specifically need a bunch of stuff for faceid b/c apple killed off touchid and never implemented in / under screen fingerprint readers\u2026 which all of those chinese android phones have.\n\nThe reasons for all of this should be downright obvious: apple operates with extremely high margins; chinese manufacturers are operating at cutthroat competition with very low (but not zero) matgins.\n\nApple chips and ios aside, all of those phones are often using near identical components, and the chinese phones have outright better hardware components (if not necessarily software) at the same / similar pricepoints.\n\nAnd this is just talking about flagships; the difference in price vs hardware for \u201cbudget\u201d apple phones like the SE or 16e is pretty severe.\n\nMore or less checks out if you just project that eg 50%+ of an iphone\u2019s cost is margins (note that I\u2019m potentially being very kind to apple with that guesstimate); and apple still to its credit has at least some advantages from large contracts, quality control, and economies of scale.\n\nIf of course you aren\u2019t buying a new phone for camera upgrades or what have you, there is pretty much zero reason to upgrade on the apple side of things, if you\u2019re using a phone released more or less anytime within the last 5+ years. Sans maybe eventually planned obsolescence / OS upgrade lockout, resale value falling off a cliff b/c of that, or what have you.\n\nOfc w/ tarrifs *at +147%* those iphones + samsungs + pixels might look like a \u201cgood\u201d deal. But outside of that\u2026 yeah, one doesn\u2019t exactly have to speculate much why that and an openly adversarial US president is not too surprisingly causing apple\u2019s chinese iphone sales to fall off a cliff. And presumably indian, plausibly EU (insofar as apple sales even exist / are widely prevalent there anyways) as well.\n\nBear in mind that many of those chinese phones only recently released (ish) while current iphone flagships did not\u2026 but this has been an ongoing trend for a while at this point. And nevermind yes the pixel, samsung etc.",
