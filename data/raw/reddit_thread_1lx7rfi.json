                          "body": "There are lots of implementations for solar and battery monitoring and control. The key is you need to plan it out ahead of time when you purchase and install it so that you use components that are compatible. Lots of people route all of that through HA though, to the point where it's actually part of the core implementation of HA. There are a ton of options for this one with setups that just monitor, to setups that have full control. I wouldn't know where to start because it would depend on your system and what you have installed already but google will be your friend in this one. \n\nRoboMowers is not one that you'll find good support for - that you got me. Seems like the Husqvarna ones can be monitored and controlled trough HA, but you still need to connect to their cloud service. Robomowers though are still pretty new and aren't all that common yet, so I expect eventually there will be some local only options. \n\nLarge appliances are somewhat hit and miss. Lots of them integrate but need the cloud as a middleman, and there are some active projects designed around eliminating the cloud component but I haven't tried them to see how well they work and those I wouldn't categorize as easy (as per my original comment). It also depends on what you're looking for. If it's power monitoring and the ability to cut power in an emergency, there are lots of options. If it's the smart features that came with the appliance, you won't find much for completely local control - as the cloud is often still needed as a middleman. You'll be able to route them and control them from HA, but you will still be reliant on the cloud. \n\nI guess I should say my original comment was more aimed at the smart devices on the same level as what was being discontinued with Belkin. More about the smaller iot devices like switches, sensors, alarms, cameras etc. Appliances are an issue, and niche things like the robomowers will take time before there are local only options (and I would say that is still niche because it's relatively new and doesn't have a ton of adoption- though I doubt it will be forever). Personally I don't see a use for a lot of the smart features in appliances. I see them as a security vulnerability, and if I'm cooking I'm in the kitchen so being able to control it from my phone is somewhat of a gimmick. I've looked into them from time to time and never seen anything of much interest, and most people who have ones with smart features in my experience rarely use the smart features. For example my dishwasher has smart features, but I never use them and they really offer me nothing of value so I've just ignored them. If anything it's more of an annoyance because a few things that should just be a simple button or indicator are only available through the app. About the only things that are good is the ability to see if something was left on, or if a door is open etc, and all of that can be implemented externally in other ways.",

Ecoflow for my solar & batteries because cost was a bigger factor than local when I bought them. ChargePoint for my EV chargers, same reason. \n\nThe dishwasher is a Bosch, which seems to be a Matter-friendly company. I hope they\u2019ll do Matter as an update, but as you say, kitchen devices aren\u2019t must-have for IoT so I\u2019m not going to be devastated if I don\u2019t get it.  \n\nDon\u2019t have the smart robomower, oven, or microwave right not BECAUSE I\u2019m making local control a non-negotiable. I could maybe try to use my circuit monitoring to tell if the oven is pre-heated, but it takes quite a bit of trial & error to tune the alerts. Matter connectivity would just make it all easier.",

Whether it's someone on github writing the code, or someone in their own company, the landscape doesn't change because the licensing fee has already been paid for that device. Basically, as long as it's not being used for a new device then it wouldn't necessarily violate the spirit of the licensing agreement and no harm comes to those to own the licence, and the law could effectively just take that into account. It might violate some current agreements the way they're currently written, but the law could just require that this be an option and therefore any clauses that prevent it are null and void.  \n\nMore importantly, they don't need to fully open-source all the code and firmware. Rather they just need to implement some sort of open protocol that lets another server control the device. Lots of smart devices already do this, where the firmware is proprietary, but it's implemented in such a way that it can be paired/controlled with any server and isn't limited to the manufactures cloud provider.  Basically, you don't need to give people the ability to write their own firmware, rather you just need to let people continue to use the device using their own server instead of the cloud provider if they're so motivated. \n\nIt essentially needs to be how old software was handled (before everything was a subscription service). You didn't lose access to the software, rather it just stopped receiving updates. If you wanted to keep using it that was up to you, and there might be inherent risks due to security flaws, but you weren't denied anything. Eventually it would stop working because it was incompatible with the current OS, but usually by then the software was so old that few people were using it anymore, and those that did want to still use it could usually set up a VM to run it.",

The only models that will continue to work after that date are those that have been configured through Apple HomeKit.\n\nThe news was shared in an email to customers and on Belkin\u2019s website, and confirms that from next February onwards, \u201cAny features that rely on cloud connectivity, including remote access and voice assistant integrations, will no longer work.\u201d The company will also stop providing technical support and troubleshooting assistance after that date, and the Wemo app will no longer receive updates.\n\nSome Wemo devices will continue to work. Three Wemo products (SKUs WLS0503, WSC010, WSP100) based on the Thread protocol, and its video doorbell (WDC010) will work as normal through HomeKit. Other Wemo products that are compatible with HomeKit will also carry on working through the Apple network so long as they\u2019re configured before January 31st.\n\nBelkin says that if your Wemo product is still under warranty when support ends, you may be eligible for a \u201cpartial refund,\u201d though it won\u2019t begin processing those refunds before that date.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t come as a total surprise. Belkin backed away from its support of the Matter smart home standard in 2023, announcing it would \u201ctake a big step back, regroup, and rethink\u201d its approach to smart home hardware. It hasn\u2019t released any new Wemo products since then.",

This effectively means the product will become unusable for its intended purpose.\n\nUnder the Consumer Rights Act 2015, products must be:\n\n\\- Of satisfactory quality\n\n\\- Fit for purpose\n\n\\- Last for a reasonable length of time\n\nA smart home device that becomes non-functional due to manufacturer-imposed software discontinuation does not meet these requirements, particularly the \"reasonable length of time\" provision. The Act provides consumer protection for up to 6 years in England and Wales (5 years in Scotland), and I believe this premature end of service represents a breach of these statutory rights.\n\nWhile I understand this situation stems from Belkin's decision rather than yours as the retailer, under UK consumer law, my contract is with you as the seller, and you are responsible for ensuring products meet their statutory requirements.\n\nI therefore request a full refund of the purchase price of \\[amount\\]. I have attached a copy of my receipt for your reference.\n\nI look forward to your response within 14 days.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\\[Your name\\]\n\nEncl: Copy of receipt",

The product will become non-functional on January 31, 2026, due to Belkin's discontinuation of essential services\n\n2. This breaches my statutory rights under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, specifically:\n\n   \\- The requirement for goods to be fit for purpose\n\n   \\- The requirement for goods to last a reasonable time\n\n3.
