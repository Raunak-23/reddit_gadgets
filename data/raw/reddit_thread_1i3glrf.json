      "body": "From the article: The Apple Watch has been credited with saving another life, with a man crediting the device for summoning help after his car crashed, leaving him submerged upside down in a pool.\n\nOn December 16, Brent Hill of Easthampton, MA was driving his car home but felt nauseous behind the wheel. While he doesn't remember what happened next due to blacking out, his Apple Watch stepped in to help in the following moments.\n\nCamera footage from a neighbor shows Hill's car accelerating into their garage and into the neighbor's swimming pool, landing upside down, [reports](https://www.westernmassnews.com/2025/01/16/easthampton-man-credits-apple-watch-helping-save-his-life/) WesternMassNews.\n\nIt is assumed that Hill's weight shifted after he blacked out, placing more weight on the accelerator.\n\n\"I didn't know any of this was going on,\" Hill admits.\n\n\"When I saw the footage of my car careening down the street and crashing, I was shocked because of how fast I was going.\"\n\nThe next memory Hill has of the misadventure is regaining consciousness thanks to a small voice speaking to him. Apple Watch Crash Detection called emergency services automatically, and an operator was trying to speak to him.\n\n\"If emergency services had not contacted me through that watch and just coached me through that, there's no way I would've got out of there,\" he adds.\n\nWithin minutes, responders arrived to rescue him. He could barely hear any of the people outside the car, but the Apple Watch voice helped him.",

For crashes I believe it differentiates that from falling based on GPS movement. If you don\u2019t clear the notification letting it know you\u2019re all good then it will automatically call emergency services.",

      "body": "I took a hard fall and was briefly knocked out. When I came to a voice on my Apple Watch said \u201cthis is EMS, do need assistance?\u201d. I answered that I fell and was bleeding. An ambulance showed up a few minutes later. My location was known. While the EMS guy was putting a compression bandage on my forehead he said \u201cyour watch is talking to you \u201c. My Watch contacted my husband and he was patched thru. I told him what happened and I was carted off to the ER. Apparently I set him up as my emergency contact when I got the watch. I was really grateful I had this watch on. The only downside is if I bump my arm on something hard it will vibrate and ask if I need 911. It gives a certain amount of time before it calls 911, so you have to press the I\u2019m OK prompt.",
