Everything except for GameCube/Wii runs in a different environment(? not sure the verbage) though, doesn't it? Like Wii U to play Wii you enter a specific Wii mode, 3DS seems to also go into some sort of DS mode.\n\nWii/GameCube seems like the best comparison with their extremely similar hardware, and I was just reading that apparently the Wii would underclock when playing GCN \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but that also meant if booting up GCN through Nintendont or something you could actually still benefit from the overclocked hardware. I'd be a little surprised if they did the same here, just seems to be a very outdated practice, though I guess that can maybe even be expected sometimes when coming to Nintendo lol.",

The system launches on June 5th.\n\nThe device has a 7.9-inch screen, but it\u2019s still 13.99mm thick, like the first Switch. The LCD screen has a 1080p resolution, and supports HDR and up to a 120fps refresh rate.\n\nThe Joy-Con controllers are bigger, too, and as hinted at, they can be used similarly to a mouse. (Though a footnote says that mouse mode will only work with compatible games.) And they stay connected to the Switch 2 via magnets.\n\nIt has 256GB of internal storage, up from 32GB on the first Switch. As shown in the Switch 2\u2019s initial reveal trailer, it also has two USB-C ports for connecting accessories and for charging.\n\nWhen using the dock, you can play games at up to 4K resolution at 60fps. The dock also has a fan to keep the system cool.\n\nThe new C button can also be used to activate a chat menu that lets you access controls like muting your voice during the Discord-like \u201cGameChat\u201d calls.\n\nTo help users better understand the features of the Switch 2, Nintendo will also be releasing a Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour paid digital game that will be available on launch day.\n\nThe game cards for the Switch 2 will be red, a change from the black cards for the original Switch. The system also supports MicroSD Express cards, but original MicroSD cards for the Switch are not compatible.",

Games seem to be given Steam Deck Verified at random. I've had many with it run badly, constantly crashing, while others without it work great. You basically have to tinker with the graphics settings of every single game (sometimes to a massive degree) to get them running decently. My TV often doesn't recognize it when it's docked, leaving me to unplug the HDMI cables and power cable in the dock a few times until it works. It can be pretty finicky, and ease of use isn't great for kids.\n\nThe Switch (and Switch 2 I'm sure) is essentially plug and play. Any AAA game you buy for it should work. Menus UI is simple and easy to understand whether you're 8 or 80. If I handed my Steam Deck loaded up with a ton of games to my 70 year old mother and told her to start up a specific game, she'd have it sorted in 5 minutes or less. Ask her to boot up a specific game on the Steam Deck? That's going to take a little longer without help. And then you get all the Nintendo first party exclusives as well. Literally take it in and out of the dock while you're playing a game and it just works seamlessly. Not to mention that it essentially comes with two separate controllers built in, and for $100 cheaper than the cheapest OLED Steam Deck.\n\nI love my Steam Deck, but I wouldn't recommend it over the Switch 2 for a family looking to buy something for their little kids or more casual gamers, which is Nintendo's core audience.",

The general question people are asking is if their games are going to be in 4k and looking like 4k. 99.9% of console gamers are not pixel watchers trying to see where the flaws of upscaling (which on higher end software is basically nonexistent). They\u2019re just asking if their games are gonna run in 4k in a general sense.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think the variance in, say, 1440p>4k vs like 1290p>4k even on low end upscaling technology (eg FSR) is some massive difference to the average person that they need to educate themselves on which resolution is being upscaled from. The type of upscaling software being used probably has a much larger effect than 1440p vs 1290 (insert whatever numbers).",

To me at least. it looks 'good', but not 'omg wow' good. 4k or 120fps is great, but it's not particularly impressive for Switch 2 to run a 'PS3.2'-level game at higher resolution and/or framerate.

But the Switch absolutely destroys it when it comes to how streamlined everything is. Plug and play, and everything just works with zero hiccups.\n\nMeanwhile, the Steam Deck has its issues. Steam's Steam Deck Verified certification is a total crapshoot. I still often get verified titles playing like ass and crashing, while stuff without the certification works fine. You often have to change the graphic settings for each individual game in order to get it working correctly. Hell, even docking it can be a pain in the ass, with my TV not recognizing it, with the fix being to just un-plug/re-plug the HDMI and dock power cord repeatedly until it works. \n\nThe UI is a lot more difficult to navigate in comparison as well. My 6 year old nephew and 70 year old mother can use a Switch with zero help whatsoever. It's plug and play. No fidgeting with graphics settings and options, just put the cartridge in or download the digital copy and it just works. My nephew and mother would be lost trying to get my Steam Deck figured out. It's two completely separate audiences. And if Elden Ring or Cyberpunk 2077 run even passably on Switch 2, it's a lot closer to the Steam Deck performance-wise than people realize.",

If either a 6 or 70 year old can't use that without help then god bless them.\n\nIf performance is comparable, nintendo is charging more to be locked into their platform with higher cost games and a smaller library of games, all so you can play their exclusives on the same control-scheme.",

We were paying \u00a370 for n64 games in '95! Nintendo often releases GOTY titles and could charge \u00a380 per game. The games are STILL worth it imo. Things cost money. Find a better job, work harder towards your goal and/or vote someone in that isnt going to tariff the world. I've waited to finish ToTK as it was brutal at 25fps. The, what looks like 60, upgrade honestly brought a tear to my eye. The only thing that held back the presentation was no new Mario but we can't always get what we want. Apart from that it was stellar. And this is coming from a pc gamer/ps5 who just bought a 5080 so will be catching up on pcvr and the rest for a while yet. New Mario would have been an instant day 1 for me.",

ONLY when the screens are on an order of about 30-40% dimmer due to mostly solid black pixels does it start to edge out LCD. You of course can look this up, but you remain willfully ignorant.",

There are some games 'modified' to play at lower firmware but I've never tried it enough to know of it causes issues or not during playthroughs. If it's anything like say, PS4. It might be you're locked to a firmware and cannot play games that surpass it's firmware requirements. Anyone who hacks the switch has it good. Nintendo fumbled hard and it took only a year to be found with good documentation of the GPU used pre-existing.\n\nSure it took over 4 years for the first piece of homebrew for the 3DS to appear. For all we know, it could be they somehow messed up and ones found fast. Could be several years. Unfortunately, companies typically pay a lot for reported exploits to their devices which more often encourages those who hunt them to report them in the first hand.\n\nA most recent exploit I've heard of (pardon me going off topic) is the xbox360 via hijacking the hypervisor in a game. This was reported but that console is so old, Microsoft clearly don't care.\n\nHonestly, in this state of things I'd recommend anyone just find a used switch that's exploitable over the switch 2 if they can handle games at lower res/30fps. If they truly want to go the 'route' of anti-nintendo. Nintendo seems to be making games for switch still, for who knows how long. Tomodachi for the switch comes out 2026. So we can expect generosity from them for the switch still and to not immediately abandon it in June.\n\nTo conclude to this though. We won't have it as good as on the switch and even if something does appear down the line it's likely going to be limited in its firmware and therefore titles that can be ran. Even so, I could be entirely wrong. We may never get an exploit at all, if not for several years.\n\nFor those who can afford it. Put a console in the attic and cross your fingers that years from now someone finds an exploit. Even so, it does not mean immediate access to everything.",

I mean, thousands of awesome playing hours, for $60?

Then there's games like The Last of Us Part 1, where all the level design, assets, music, MoCap, voice acting, story, etc. were already completed back in 2013, yet it was still released at $70",

What have I misinterpreted? \n\nIn case it was not clear, I am saying that the inflation-adjusted price of games in 1996 would be $125 today, and they instead still cost $60. I can't think of many items that have kept the exact same price tag across thirty years. E.g., milk has gone from ~$2.50/gal to $4/gal (2022),  bacon went from $2.50/lb to $7.30, etc. Usually inflation causes prices to increase in kind, and games have not followed that trend. Thus, they have become effectively cheaper over time. \n\nTo state the obvious, this doesn't mean I support prices going up. I fucking *love* that they've stayed the same all this time.",

The switch \u201cdock\u201d is essentially a $5 Amazon adapter with HDMI 2.0 (not 2.1, as is obvious by their omission of 4k/120 support when docked) thrown into $5 of Nintendo grade poor quality plastic. Nintendo does not include a case for their fragile dogshit either, while Steam includes a VERY high quality one even with refurbished units.

Also good luck with the drift, nobody complaining about that on any other modern device but apparently Nintendumb wants to sell $70 of garbage repetitively.

God forbid a game updates and breaks compatibility (See most EA games that use the EA app). \n\nJust for an example, try to get the world\u2019s most popular games: Fortnite, Call of Duty, or Minecraft running on the device\u2026",

In 2024 alone, Microsoft closed Tango Gameworks (Ghostwire: Tokyo), and Arkane Austin (Dishonoured, Deathloop, Prey, Redfall). Sony dropped Firewalk (Concord). Warner Bros shut down three studios. Bungie layed off 220 staff. And then you get Ubisoft, who's one of the oldest (1986) and largest (19,000 employees across 45 studios) developers in the business, and all their financial issues at the moment.\n\nSpiderman 2 had a development cost of $350 million USD. Even Breath of the Wild, a considerably less complex title in comparison had an estimated development budget of around $120 million. The industry has been extremely volatile as far as job security goes. Anyone with a rough idea of how the industry has grown to have larger budgets than blockbuster movies with even larger failures if they flop could see the price increases coming a mile away.",

Nintendo doesn\u2019t sell their consoles at a loss. Tossing in an OLED VRR display is going to affect price there\u2019s an almost zero percent chance Nintendo can get that device out the door for the $449 (US MSRP) unless they\u2019re selling at a loss.\n\nBy the time 3-4 years rolls around which is on par for a midgen refresh not only will these displays likely have more than adequate supply they\u2019ll be significantly cheaper for Nintendo. Which brings it back to it\u2019s an easy midgen refresh. Switch 1 OLED showed them that consumers will happily buy a product even if it\u2019s lacking a feature they might want and then spend more to double dip or have those that didn\u2019t buy, buy in for a larger cost when that one comes out.",

Nintendo really does work a bit of magic over there.\n\nIt's not so much magic - this is the advantage gained from what is effectively a mobile SoC. The Tegra X1 in the Switch is based on the ARMv8 architecture, and ARM architecture chips (as well as RISC chips in general) tend to be very power efficient. Good power efficiency means less thermals to deal with (which means less weight used to manage thermals) and better battery life. You can see where the tradeoffs are with the Deck choosing to prioritize compatibility and performance.",

You are right now, but using old examples like those isn't convincing when there's proof of game companies changing up their historically consistent models.\n\nAlso, \"blind doomerism?\" I think I have the right to be doomer when they revealed the game near the beginning of the Switch 1's life only for it to be actually released at the end of its life. 8 years... I know it's not Nintendo's fault, but you're asking a lot for people not to be doom and gloom when something like that happens and it's only natural to be concerned about being screwed over again.",
