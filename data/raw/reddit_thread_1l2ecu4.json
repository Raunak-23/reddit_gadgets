What i wanted was polyphonic ringtones, i think mostly japanese phones had that. Then color but backlit color was a real luxury (ala gameboy color had no backlight, can you imagine!!). Razr became peak fliphone and was like $500 which was nuts when most phones were free. I return it after the HTC Blue Angel branded SX66 came out as it was one of the first slide phones running Windows CE of some form and has Wifi AND bluetooth on a phone! My last windows phone was the HTC Diamond which had GPS ! Back then gps was always a monthly cost feature similar to how every text cost a few cents. Can you imagine if thats still the case?",

          "body": "Honestly, if you managed to grab a Switch before they did the small hardware revision (referred to as Mariko), it was incredibly easy to \"jailbreak\" it and put custom firmware on it. I did so and I have literally *thousands* of retro games playable on it via emulators, ranging from all the way back to the OG NES up to PS1, N64, and PSP. Given, hardware limitations mean that some of the PS1 stuff can get a *bit* laggy from time to time if it features intense 3D animations and lots of particle effects, but that's a small price to pay for Legend of Dragoon on the go with a screen the size of the Switch, plus the entire Switch library itself.\n\nThese dedicated retro handhelds tend to have smaller screens, or dedicate themselves to replicating a specific retro handheld, like that one that's basically \"What if we just remade the Gameboy in 2022\", and those factors just put me off. If I'm going to drop money on a device dedicated to playing video games on the go, I want something with a big screen and the processing power to play whatever I want on it, within reason of course.\n\nThis thing having a 4:3 screen means modern stuff with widescreen support is basically DOA, and while it boasts that I could play PS2/Wii/Dreamcast games, on a screen that small, UIs that were designed to be viewed on a television are going to be difficult to read/navigate. Honestly, the Steam Deck is about as close to an ideal portable gaming machine as I've seen, but I know it has it's own limitations, and the larger form factor/weight makes it a bit less portable than the Switch, so neither is exactly perfect. Plus, ya know, kinda hard to get your hands on a Steam Deck.\n\nOverall, a hacked Switch is my sweet spot at the moment, but if we get a revised Steam Deck, or something similar to it with a bit more power and a bit smaller, that might hit peak for me. Basically, if we land a handheld PC that's capable of running PS3 emulation and has a nice sized screen, that's all I'll ever want for retro gaming on the go, especially if it can dock to be playable via TV as well, so I can resume my gaming when I get home.\n\nTL;DR: These bespoke retro handhelds tend to be way too pricey and far too narrowly focused. Hacked Switch does it great right now, and Steam Deck is almost perfect, but needs another pass for more power and less size to get there.",

      "body": "From the article: Anbernic is used to playing on our nostalgia, and to be honest, that strategy seems to be working. Just last month, the company released its Anbernic RG34XXSP, which is a Game Boy Advance SP-like retro handheld that somehow crams your love for Game Boys and the GameCube into one (very affordable) gadget. My millennial lust for gaming nostalgia is tingling just thinking about it. Now, Anbernic is taking that same strategy and applying it toward another retro gadget you may not have had on your retro gaming bingo card\u20142000s-era sliding phones.\n\nAnbernic\u2019s RG Slide is the company\u2019s newest handheld in a very long stream of handhelds that somehow seems to be getting longer and longer. The slide has a TPS IPS screen that comes in a 4:3 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1,280 x 960 pixels. The display, unlike my iPhone 13, supports a 120Hz refresh rate, has a contrast ratio of 1200:1, and has a max brightness of up to 500 nits. Emulation-wise, Anbernic says this sliding handheld will be able to play PS2, Wii, GameCube, and Dreamcast games at a 640 x 480 resolution. It\u2019ll also emulate PS1 and N64 games at a 320 x 240 resolution.\n\nI think the headlining feature of this handheld isn\u2019t what it emulates or how good or bad the screen is\u2014 it\u2019s the form factor. The RG Slide, as you may have guessed from the name, has a sliding screen that pushes up to reveal two thumbsticks, a D-pad, ABXY buttons, and a start and select button in the middle. That design might be evocative of a couple of things, but for me, it has 2000s-era phones written all over it. Yes, it\u2019s also got big Xperia Play energy\u2014Sony\u2019s gaming-centric smartphone from 2011\u2014but my mind goes back even further to the days of sliding phones from LG or Nokia. What I would pay to slide open my LG Shine Slide one last time\u2026",
