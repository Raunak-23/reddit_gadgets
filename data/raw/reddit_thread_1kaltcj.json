They all have the same logic. \n\nBack in 2010 I talked to a farmer in Ohio, who insisted that all the manufacturing should come back to the US. I asked him how much he was willing to pay for his cheap stuff, and he was silent. Then I said, even if manufacturing were to leave china, it would go to an even cheaper country like Vietnam or Bangladesh. Silence. I'm sure deep down he understood all of it. Otherwise he'd have a come back.\n\nThey knew even back then it wasn't gonna happen. But it's harder to admit they were wrong. Especially now that we got a liar in chief with a loudspeaker.",

Not the excess getting their stock packages of millions for \u201cgood performance\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd before anyone even says what I said is impossible, yes it is.

That's why they thought \"well, just move that factory to US. Problem solved\". They do not know or never thought of how many specialization happening in the industry to produce each individual components efficiently, and how all those specialized factory popping-up close to each other that enable efficient production of an iphone. The screw factory is located near to the metal stamping factory which is also clustered near the assembly plant. You need to relocate ALL of that thing to produce it fully domestically.\n\nAnd another factor of \"why China\" is that because China is the producing not just for US but also the entire world, the individual cost of each things got driven way down across the entire industry purely because of economy of scale. Given the rest of the world still want Chinese products, US manufacturer will produce literally only for US which will drove the cost so much up, that maybe even chinese products + tariff is STILL cheaper than US-made product, essentially making entire tariff purely about taxing US citizens, without moving the production to US at all.",

Maybe at $11-13/hr they get applicants, but perhaps not who they'd need to do intricate work.  And even at $15... well supply and demand curves might say that such a thing is pushing up wages for them and others doing similar work, so maybe it ends up being $17/hr.\n\nAnd then figure in the costs of benefits they'd have to offer and the difference probably ends up being $20-25/hr.\n\nIt'd be that they say, \"there are 7 man-hours of manual labor in every device, which adds $160 to our costs,\" and then the cost of the device would go up to compensate.  And it'd probably be even more once you figure in the extra costs involved since now their part suppliers and such are on the other side of the world, rather than the other side of the street, and that'll go to +$200.\n\nAnd then, when Samsung and others don't build US factories, incurring similar cost increases, they'll either keep their prices the same and take away market share from Apple, or they'll also raise their prices by a similar amount and just be more profitable than they were before.",

Many machines are sourced from Germany and shipped to Asia today or could be shipped to the US. Some machines can be made in the US or find used equipment to install while they are waiting on tooling.\n\nA local high-end audio company I know of, and have witnessed their facility production, can do all the electronic pick and place surface mount boards used in the typical phones. And they are not the highest tech that could be found around say Texas cities.\n\nRetooling is a big expense, certainly (but a phone is smaller than retooling car parts).  Apple has more cash reserves than any company (nearly to the extreme of being an old 1980s Leveraged Buyout target). They may need to downgrade a few things \"it's thicker, so you don't lose it!\" that can use a marketing solution, or a price reduction. Or programming efficiency improvements so battery life is extended (fewer ads or spyware). But they can also quickly make the next version better once the Made In America-1 version has launched.\n\nStarlink has discussed building a phone. This would be perfect timing to produce a Made In America Starlink phone, cheaper than Apple, with better nationwide satellite coverage. Then Apple would be in quite a dire situation, trying to sell $3k imported phones against $500 MIA phones that have better signal performance and faster internet speed.   \n\nApple could make the move if they really wanted to, but they are too busy playing politics and throwing around excuses, instead of bringing jobs to the US.\n\n.",

Since the early 2000s Apple has stategically taken US profits and invested them into China/elsewhere to lower costs of manufacturing.

But Apple chose its own crop of suppliers and helped them grow into \"manufacturing superstars,\" according to supply chain expert Lin Xueping.\"\n\nThe idea that Apple moved soly because there was no one to manufacture: i think is a short sighed POV because it releases the decisions made by boards all over the country.

Even accounting for that, my estimates show that the increased production cost would be around 100 on the low end, and 200 at the high hand, that sounds significant, but the average phone costs a 1000 bux, and has a manufacturing cost of like 400-500 bux in China per today. While that sounds significant, Apple could easily absorb those fcosts without it dramatically hurting their bottom line.  \nApple sells what, 220 million iPhones last year. So even if moving manufacturing to the US required a 5 billion dollar investment in automation and factory setup. Apple would earn that back in half a year, a year tops, even if it absorbed all the additional costs perunit, rather then passing it on the consumer. The idea that a US assembled iPhone would cost 3.5k is absurdly inflated.  \nSure, the global iPhone supply chain is somewhat complex, with 700 component sites in 28 countries, and China remains central due to the manufacturing being local to many of them, as well as their shipping being incredible low. But automation reduces reliance on cheap labor, and apple already uses US made components such as the Face ID lasers, and the display glass. And wiith some stratetgic investment, apple could Easily do a final assembly in the US, using robots for the bulk of the labor, and ship in components, cause that is basically what tesla does, like sure, iphone got 700+ components, but a tesla got 10000+ components, with 400 suppliers in china alone, and imports from over 20 different countries, and like half is US/Canada/Mexico produced components.",
