Using a phone is optional over a tablet and many newer ones have a dedicated remote.  Users can submit content, but beyond that having millions of drones streaming 2-4k content to servers in China just isn't feasible at this time.  Even the best ones they sell aren't going to reveal anything new unless they are purposely flying over restricted areas and that's more of a user problem than a drone made by a Chinese company.  May just be unclear on what the perceived security risk is.",
