The difference is that job markets != goods markets != securities markets.\n\nYou have to have evidence to show to the public or administrative bodies that regulations upon your company are working as intended or not.\n\nAdditionally, let\u2019s recall Apple attempted to manufacture Mac Pros in the US and found that even labor / skilling isn\u2019t necessarily the biggest issue but that the US is such a huge country with long distances for suppliers that it would be a huge problem while in China with its urban manufacturing model you have lots of options for suppliers for so many parts across different cities. This took China decades and decades to reach this state even with its well known underhanded and morally dubious methods while in the US we can\u2019t even manufacture most weapons of war cost-effectively with our stupidly over-funded DoD (read: the de facto US federal jobs program).\n\nSo my supposition is that if we instantly disbanded our DoD, had zero need for new human labor and shoved ALL that defense money (read: debt) into more consumer goods manufacturing _maybe_ we would have something viable for manufacturing a broader range of goods in like 13+ years in the US.",

I looked some time ago and the cost of simple button down shirts and jeans were significantly higher than the stuff made overseas. And I'm not talking about some fancy 1000% marked up brand either. Maybe it's a bit better but haven't looked in years.\n\nSo ya people do want to buy American but the cost is too high. And to expect people to stick to that principle, especially now, is insane. Everything is getting too expensive so you have to cut costs where you can.",

                      "body": "Let's fix your example. The original scenario was Chinese - $129, US - $239. You're saying if instead it was China - $129, US - $139, more people would be willing to buy American. But they already have the opportunity to do that. American manufacturing is just much more expensive due largely to stricter labor laws. If American companies wanted to compete at that price, they would. Since they can't, a tariff jacks up the price of the foreign-made item so that the American price becomes competitive.\n\nIn short, you would be looking at China - $316 (that's the original price plus 145% tariff), US - $316 because guess what: there's no incentive for a US company to offer it for substantially lower than the competition.\n\nNow, the China tariff has just been dropped to 30% for a time, which would make the price $168, still $30 more than your pie-in-the-sky estimate. But the more broad point to make here is that with this completely unhinged and random assignment of tariffs, no company is going to make hard plans to move manufacturing into the US right now, even if they pretend they're thinking about it for PR. And even if they do, it's not going to be a slightly higher price than before. It will be a lot more expensive.\n\nTo help illustrate the chaos of all of this a little better, consider a Chinese company staring down the barrel of a 145% tariff. That's so unbelievably high that they're going to start looking into moving operations to another country with lower tariffs such as Vietnam (46%) or Thailand (36%). And then a month later, Trump backs down and changes the China tariff to 30%. Well now it doesn't make any sense to move to those two countries after all, since it will be more expensive now. And when supply chain shifts like this take on the order of several years to complete, and Trump is tweeting changes from the toilet at 3am every other day, it's completely impossible to make plans like that.\n\nAnd furthermore, to circle back to shower heads again, *even if* a company builds a factory here in the US, almost every single good requires parts and resources that aren't found in the US. And when those parts and resources get imported, they get charged the requisite tariff. So it's not even simply a matter of building a facility here. It's straight up not possible to source everything domestically, so prices will still rise.\n\nHopefully you're starting to get the picture here. These tariffs, combined with the nature of their implementation, is the equivalent of a crazy person on the subway swinging a bag of piss around. Totally unpredictable and making a fucking mess of everything. And people here are still clapping for him and calling him a genius.",

People will only buy Sony because they think competition doesn\u2019t even come close. I\u2019m sorry but the price point for Sony products are ridiculous. Sony treats Japan like shit because Sony doesn\u2019t care about Japanese market. People literally cannot afford Sony TV. Sony only cares about its bread and butter and that is America. This is the main reason why Sony will make enemy with the entire world for America. Sony makes insane amount of revenue from America that it doesn\u2019t care about rest of the world.
