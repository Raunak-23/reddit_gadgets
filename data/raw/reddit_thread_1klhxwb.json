It's pretty easy to demonstrate that the human eye can still detect improvements as high as 10000hz in specific scenarios. You can do it yourself with an arduino and a LED - make the LED blink at a few kHz and shake it about and you'll see it flickering. Once you see it you'll never unsee - you'll start spotting car headlights flickering at their PWM frequency as they drive past",

The slight improvement in input latency won't really be immediately noticable, but rather only showing itself in aggregate when comparing how well you did against others with low latencies.\n\nI would argue shadows tend to help, at least where dynamic shadows are a thing, seeing a players shadow appear on a wall prior to them coming around the corner can be strongly helpful. \n\nMany games are only a bit less pretty when at medium or low settings, but tend to perform much much better than ultra.\n\nUltra is a preset that tends to be made such that halo-tier or high-end *next generation* cards are required to run the game at >=60fps. \n\nSo running a modern game at Ultra or even high, and also desiring high framerates, would seem to be conflicting objectives. And it would seem they are likely to be conflicting objectives for the foreseeable future.",

What is happening is that every fps doubling halves the minimum input lag. The issue is that basically every system has a certain amount of input lag meaning that above 120 the difference becomes very slight. Also, halving 16.7 ms to 8.3 going from 30 to 60 is much bigger than 60 to 120 and especially even further. Frame times too. That is not however completely pointless. It just means that the benefits are much less significant than lower end jumps.",

If your eye is moving at all while its being exposed, the image is blurring, just like how camera shake causes blur on a camera proportional to how long you leave the shutter open. We can fight this with black frame insertion to some extent but then your brightness drops, but raising your refresh rate lets you reduce this blur without a brightness reduction.",
