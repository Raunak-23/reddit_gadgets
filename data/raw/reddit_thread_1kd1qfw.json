With a jet engine, fuel tank, ducting system with control motors, frame, electricals, electronics, human interface, (none of which is present in those videos other than a frame, btw). It blows my mind that anyone sees these videos and believes it's real. The fuel tank would need to be much larger than the CGI videos suggest. Jet engines are very thirsty at low altitude, low speed flight. Small jet engines are even worse, because they're turbojet design rather than the more modern turbofan, to save space and weight. In the video, there is no thrust apparatus, no lift apparatus, no space within that body for a jet engine, no space for a fuel tank (unless the entire body is a fuel tank with nothing else in there), no air intake for the massive amount of air ingested by a jet engine. the frame looks like it would barely be strong enough to hold a grown man. \nA jet engine spinning several hundred thousand rpm generates a good amount of rotational inertia. You have to have an entire system designed into the vehicle to counteract rotational inertia (even more weight and space requirements), or you just flip over as soon as you leave the ground. There have been full-sized aircraft that struggled to deal with rotational inertia due to improper engineering, and that's even with massive flight surfaces (wings) giving it stability. The thing in these videos has NO flight surfaces. \nThe problems go on and on. This guy made a few AI-generated CGI videos and has been promoting it as real to get traffic to his socials. Don't fall for it. When someone makes claims of a paradigm shift gadget that turns everything on its head, it is not the time to suspend all disbelief and critical thinking.\n\nI have a small jet engine that generates 1000 lbs of thrust, which is likely too small for an application such as this. It weighs almost 300 lbs on its own, dry, sitting on the bench. It is also long enough that you'd see it stick out in front or behind the tiny body of the BS we see in those videos.\n\n2nd point, that number is assuming he MEANT to say 1/7th the weight of a superbike. Not the same thing as saying 7 times lighter, which is mathematically impossible.",

Name the model of these turbojets that weigh 40 lbs, and can lift a person, plus an entire vehicle, plus the amount of fuel you would need for more than 1 minute of flight, plus all the control motors and ducting you would need on a vehicle that you would not need on a human mounted system, given that a jetpack uses the humans own body as the thrust vectoring system (not how it works on an actual vehicle), etc, etc, etc. also.. the loooong list of other problems detailed. There ARE actually modern small jet engine jet packs that people can wear and 'fly'. Sort of. For 1 to 3 minutes before it runs out of fuel. There is a world of difference between a thing that a human can wear and hover around for a minute or two, and a vehicle that requires all the controls and ducting and higher thrust, and higher lift, and far, far more fuel, and rotational inertia countermeasure systems that a vehicle would need. personal aircraft. They're big and heavy, they're slow, they have 4 massive electric motors driving propellers or ducted fans, they have large fuel tanks or even larger batteries. You think this scam is real? Contact him and ask for a press call so you can film it in person. He won't do it. If he does, I have no problem paying my own way to fly to Italy and film it in person. I'll do it tomorrow. I wish it were real.. or even just remotely possible, but I'm not going to stop using critical thinking just because I want it to be real. That's just religion, lol.\n\nI'm not sure why you think I don't know about my own jet engine that I've rebuilt several times and have used to make speed runs on a motorcycle on the Bonneville salt flats, but I certainly never said I don't know the engine. It's not an anecdote. It's the entire aeronautical industry. \n\nA paradigm shift gadget that turns an entire industry on its head demands extreme proof. That's why when the Segway was invented, they held countless press calls and allowed everyone to film it. Every news outlet had their own videos. People were allowed to ride it, but that's just cherry on top. The cake is being allowed to film it, rather than shit websites being the only ones regurgitating the obvious CGI released by the \"inventor\".. a known scammer who stole money from investors on prior projects, and looks to be doing the same here. Try to find any real news outlet that has covered this thing and filmed it. By all means though, send him your retirement savings. I'm sure it'll work out. Who needs due diligence?",

The subject is too broad to help someone find one without knowing a lot about the intended project. If you're actually interested, rather than just trying for a gotcha, start googling. Mine is about 3 ft long, and is from an old aerial unmanned target drone commonly used for test purposes. I got it cheap from a private contracting firm while I worked on the White Sands Missile Range. It was one from their inventory that never got used when their contract ended, and the target drone model was deemed obsolete as tech advancements allowed a shift in target design to much, much cheaper design schemes. It was good for my use because there are many, many parts available for it online. It wasn't designed for longevity, but I use it for short, high speed salt-flat runs, so it's fine for me, and I can just rebuild it as necessary. I'm not going to say the brand or model number. There are many options and many brands to choose from if you're going to get into jet powered stuff. Hold onto your wallet, it's an expensive hobby.",

It is also literally missing things it needs. Things that you'd be able to see. Anyway, see the long (and incomplete) list of other reasons why this thing is not possibly real. Read the entirety of my breakdown comment within my own post about this thing, within the r/gadgets sub.",

And while it's getting better, AI is still easy to spot at this point. By all means though, if you think you can get AI to make something that looks even close to this, show me. There might be some kind of video trickery/editing to make this look better, but that's definitely a real physical thing with a real person on it. \nAgain, it probably flies for 5 minutes and is loud as hell, but it more than likely exists.",

It didn't actually hit the market.\n\nAnyway, aside from that, look at the differences. On the jetson one, there are lift systems right where they need to be. You can see the quadcopter motors and propellers. It's large, it's heavy, it has a very short range, it's realistic. This new thing, aside from the only video in existence being proven CGI, is entirely impossible from an engineering standpoint, AS he has presented it. The technology is there for sure, and has existed for decades, but it would be bigger and much heavier. The lift system would be visible, lol. You can't hide a VTOL lift system away while it operates. It literally must be where it can get intake air, and downward thrust ducting would be very visible. Jet engines consume WAAAAY more air than you could believe, so the intake and exhaust on this would be very visible and gaping. Even the F35, being a stealth jet costing hundreds of millions of dollars and being very large, has to have the VTOL system visible and obviously exposed while in use. The thing this guy presented is a thought exercise at best, another money-grab scam at worst. Given his track record, it's probably another scam. He just didn't bother to make a real vehicle to scam investors this time, electing rather to have AI make a CGI video of something that doesn't exist.",

Any configuration and orientation of the vehicle + pilot that imparts forward motion while falling arguably results in \"gliding\".  Albeit with a still-fatal end result.\n\nAnd I'll just self-counter-argue that by pointing to the Unpowered flight section of the Wikipedia article on [Flying and Gliding Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_and_gliding_animals#Unpowered), that defines gliding thusly:\n\n>Gliding flight: falling at an angle less than 45\u00b0 from the horizontal with lift from adapted\u00a0aerofoil membranes.\n\n... which is probably as good a definition as any.  And definitely rules out the vehicle above.",

      "body": "Battlestar Galactica had a brief sequel series in 1980.  People were pissed that the OG series had been cancelled so rapidly, so the network contacted the producer, and gave him the green light for the sequel series.\n\n...but no money for it.  The original series was far too expensive for a TV show, that's one of the main reasons it was canceled.  So the sequel nixed Apollo & Starbuck, recycled a lot of the effects, and even changed up the premise: Galactica had finally found Earth, and the crew was trying to figure out what to do next.\n\nSetting most of the action on contemporary Earth made budgetary sense.  Want to film a bar scene?  Go to a regular bar and film it.  Most of the \"costumes\" were off-the-rack regular clothes.  Cheap and easy.\n\nBut it wasn't like the Galactica bellied up to Earth and announced their presence.  They wanted to do some surveillance, so they sent a couple spies to the planet, to infiltrate modern American society.  They were given modern clothes, currency, and transportation that could help them blend in.  I think there was maybe a hint of Prime Directive going on, something like that.\n\nAnyway, and thanks for staying with me here, that transportation was pretty cool to 8-year old me.  Believe me, just a few years later, I was avidly catching as many episodes as I could of Knight Rider, Airwolf, Streethawk, Blue Thunder, Viper, and all the other shows based around cool vehicles.  But that sequel series?  That's where it started for me.\n\nBecause, and I can hardly believe I'm typing this, but it's totally true: Battlestar Galactica had flying motorcycles, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7CvyLCZtMg) is the receipt.  And believe me again: even 8-year old me looked at that and thought \"This is stupid, those guys are going to kill themselves.\"\n\nI remain convinced that the meager budget would have served the show much better had it been spent on Apollo & Starbuck, rather than a pair of stupid flying motorcycles.  Life lesson.",

It's all talking about \"lightweight carbon fiber\" and \"how you have a 360 view\" when a vehicle like this would be revolutionary from a technical engineering perspective. There is no direct discussion of the power system or how it's controlled other than \"proprietary stabilization\". The videos on the company's youtube channel are weirdly coordinated, and the website looks like something you would build in middle school computer class.\n\nI just don't believe this thing is real. I think this is someone trying to build it and generating investment interest or revenue, and frankly I don't think this type of vehicle is possible for someone to build currently. At least that size and as described.\n\nIt's too powerful and light, it would be incredibly unstable even with a very well-configured and powerful flight computer. If it truly has ONE jet engine and no spinning props (as the website claims) there is just no way you'd be able to have yaw control or reasonably slow down from 124mph without becoming unstable.\n\n\"With the real JetCat, data the calculus tips hard against feasibility: **the Airbike would guzzle roughly a gallon of Jet\u2011A per minute**, so any credible demo flight would need a sizeable, visible fuel tank and considerably more thrust than three P400s can deliver.\"   Revision of the most critical article reveals the fuel/power situation is actually worse than even they estimated.\n\nAnd regarding control:\n\n# Stopping from 124\u202fmph: the energy you must dump\n\n* **Drag alone won\u2019t do it.** Assuming a frontal area \\~0.5\u202fm\u00b2 and a bluff\u2011body drag coefficient \u22481.0, parasitic drag at 200\u202fkm/h (55\u202fm/s) is only \\~900\u202fN \u2248 **200\u202flbf**.\n* The claimed all\u2011up thrust is \\~300\u202flbf (three JetCat\u2011class turbines). To decelerate in, say, 6\u20138\u202fs you must pitch the bike back \u226535\u201140\u202f\u00b0 to vector most of that thrust rearwards, while still keeping enough vertical component to stay airborne. That demands a **large gimbal angle** and very fast flight\u2011computer corrections; nothing on the Airbike CAD images suggests such a mechanism.\n* Any miss\u2011timed pitch\u2011up at those speeds would torque\u2011roll the pilot into a flat spin, precisely because there is no tailplane or wing to stabilise the manoeuvre.\n\n  \nUnless Volonaut can point to:\n\n* **Twin or multi\u2011engine architecture** (or clearly visible reaction\u2011control jets) that create yaw authority in hover, **and**\n* A tested high\u2011deflection gimbal or air\u2011brake system able to vector 300\u2011plus\u202flbf of thrust rearwards for deceleration,\n\n\u2026the Airbike\u2019s single\u2011jet concept cannot satisfy even the first\u2011order physics of yaw control or safe high\u2011speed braking. Current footage and press\u2011kit renders show none of the hardware that serious VTOL builders use, scepticism is well\u2011founded.",
