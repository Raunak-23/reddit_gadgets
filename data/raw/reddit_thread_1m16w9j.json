When i use excel, i have to scroll which is annoying. \n\nHaving multiple apps open at once. \n\nIm guessing someone who does use a phone for business would benefit from this best. For normal folks, having better video ratio is not worth it.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, reading books/comics is amazinggg on a foldable phone. Not sure if a trifold would make it better. Probably not.",

It attempts to make a phone as ethically as possible, no exploitation etc. This includes environmental concerns. Its a modular phone meant to last and opening it to swap battery/parts is trivial.\nHowever I reasoned with myself that getting a used phone is quite good too, though I think it's the tech loving side of me that did most to push that argument as I got a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra, which is basically still a new phone. I dont have much beef with South Korea yet. \nI must say however that I've had very little use for its various fancy features so far",
