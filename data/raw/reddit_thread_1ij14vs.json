      "body": "Having a 3080 I knew I\u2019d be okay for a while, but looks like I\u2019m really going to be riding this card into the ground until I upgrade again. \n\nI\u2019d consider upgrading if the price OR performance made sense, but with the trend Nvidia\u2019s been following, I have a hard time paying 5090 money for a 5080 that has the performance of a card that should really be called a 5070. \n\nThe higher end of the enthusiast price bracket has been milked for every penny, and I have no idea how people can drop this kind of coin for such middling upgrades. \n\nDefinitely going to look hard at AMD when I do finally feel the need to upgrade, but at this rate I might just keep my PC until it dies and return to buying stuff on console first.",

          "body": "Yup, RTX 3080 is hitting the point where it still runs everything alright with some compromises, but it would be nice to upgrade and get stress-free high framerates on ultra settings again \\*if\\* there was a sensible upgrade option available.\n\nAnd while it is undeniable that RTX 5080 would be a big upgrade if you just solely look at the performance delta between 3080 -> 5080, everything else about the launch just feels scummy as hell. Pitiful generational increase from the last gen, even more pitiful availability, high prices, dubious amounts of VRAM, all that very much kills my enthusiasm for upgrading until it becomes a real necessity, not just a \"would be nice\" option.",

I'll be taking a hard look at AMD and especially Intel. Hopefully they come out with something slightly better than the B580 and the reviews are good. I know Intel is just being very consumer friendly as they try to gain market share and it's not going to last, but I'll consider them while the getting is still good.",

Therefore your aim is to sell all your stock at the maximum possible price\n\nWhy sell it for $2000 when you can sell it for $2400?\n\nUsually the risk is that another competitor comes in and sells theirs for less, but with astonishingly high barriers to entry so much of our tech industry has become a duopoly (at best) and thus there's not enough competition to force prices down\n\nAt the end of the day prices will always be set at what people will pay.

You don't have to pay a single red cent more than what you paid all those years ago.\n\nhttps://pcpartpicker.com/product/Yy6p99/xfx-radeon-rx-6650-xt-8-gb-speedster-swft-210-core-video-card-rx-665x8dfdr - Here you go bro, $300 dollar 6650XT. You can even play 1440p at good frames with this one.\n\nThere's no reason to be a martyr just because value is really bad right now compared to 5 to 10 years ago. Then again, Graphics demand is also shifting in a time of changing video game landscapes. Like you said, \"99%\" of the games you actually play run fine on an 8 year old card. Why is that? I think it's because so many games now are built for PC AND mobile (Fortnite, for instance), and a huge increase in good games made by small teams (Hollow Knight, for instance), that anyone who only plays just those basically needs the barebones minimum of GPUs. This, apparently, hasn't offset demand but it is interesting that there's a whole genre of players out there that basically never touch AAA games and thus haven't had an actual *need* for GPU upgrades in a long time.",

              "body": "That is a great chart. What that says to me is that in the past 6 years, gamers have decided the cost is becoming too expensive, and so they're keeping the cards they have as games have not needed to upgrade. I would love to see a larger chart to see if the past 5/6 years is a distinct change or if it was just a blip when everyone upgraded to a new card (1080/2070 to 3070/4070). I will say that this past few years, the trend seems to have changed, but for me, that indicates they are pricing themselves out of the GPU market for the average user.\n\nReally nice visual though!",

I asked chatGPT for actual numbers instead of percentages, let's have a look:\n\n\n\nNVIDIA's revenue from its Gaming and Data Center segments has evolved significantly between 2019 and 2024. Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n**Fiscal Year 2019:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $5.52 billion\n* **Data Center:** $2.93 billion\n\n**Fiscal Year 2020:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $5.52 billion\n* **Data Center:** $2.98 billion\n\n**Fiscal Year 2021:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $7.76 billion\n* **Data Center:** $6.70 billion\n\n**Fiscal Year 2022:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $12.46 billion\n* **Data Center:** $10.61 billion\n\n**Fiscal Year 2023:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $9.07 billion\n* **Data Center:** $15.01 billion\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024:**\n\n* **Gaming:** $10.4 billion\n* **Data Center:** $47.5 billion\n\n  \nSeems to me that the obvious answer is that the Gaming market barely moves, and look at the Data center, from 3B to 47B in 5 years.\n\n  \nSo, as I mentioned before, their bread and butter market is not the PC gaming anymore, and that's because the growth in AI, not because their GPU prices.",

We keep buying their shitty, unoptimized products and they laugh all the way to the bank with our money. They get paid; we get a product full of bugs and miserable frame rates.\n\nAnd who can blame them? Why would they spend the time and money to release a properly made and *complete* game when suckers out there will gladly pay $2500 USD on a card that can cover up their unoptimized garbage with AI frame generation? There's no motivation for them to do so.\n\nIf they actually released software that was finished, you could probably run most of these games on a 3080ti or a 4070. You don't need a 50-series card. Nobody does really. \n\nWe are literally paying software devs to be lazy and not do their jobs.\n\nI'm going to sound like a fossil now, but before the internet and 'day one patches'. game devs had to release a product that was completely done. There was no downloading patches to fix things. QA was actually a major job with significant implications; if you released more than one game with major issues, your studio died. Nobody bought your software, at all. But now? Just put a patch on the internet.\n\nYes, it's convenient for people. But it's made devs lazy, made GPU manufacturers laugh with glee as people pay outlandish prices for their products, and screwed customers.\n\nThe only way this is ever going to stop is if we as consumers say no more. Stop buying unnecessary hardware. Stop buying early access, bug-ridden games that only run at 20-30 FPS without frame gen. Tell them *no more*. \n\nUntil then, they'll keep screwing over the gamers because they can.",
