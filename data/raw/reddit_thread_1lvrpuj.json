Anyone who has experienced this in a Vision Pro knows that this is going to be a major part of how humans view video/photos in the future, but would I spend $3500 just for that? No chance. \n\nI *would* say that the best usecase is Apple's Persona avatars since it's worlds better than a videocall, but you need another person to have a Vision Pro so... unlikely.\n\nThis is really just a lot of setup for a future where Apple can provide a consistent stream of immersive experiences solo or communal in a more affordable sleeker form factor. Whoever cracks shared viewing of live volumetric sports is going to open themselves to a multi-billion dollar sub-market.",
