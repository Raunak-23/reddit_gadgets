When you can basically buy 2 laptops for the price of this one it makes very hard to justify the durability and repairability.\n\nThey need to have some quality redeeming features which they seem to have with the keyboard experience. Probably need to offer a better display, everything else seems to be more or less reasonable for this model goal.\n\nHopefully they get bigger and bigger and I can find it on my country",

I can do my gaming on GeForce now if I really want to. And browsing is fine on a chromebook. And they come in at 300 euro on sale sometimes. Right next week they opened the fw16 preorder... So yeah, I definitely am never gonna think about buying other brands, unless they can bring the same level of features.\n\nAnd if you use it for work, price really isn't the thing to look at.\n\nAbout the display... Yeee, on all 3, I hope there'll be a compatible oled. I'd pay another 1k or more for an oled/microled",

Since these are all standard parts it doesn't matter if the company goes out of business because the company doesn't make them. Is this not the better way to go about repairability, like it used to be when you could change out components at will and not have to rely on only one company to supply them? No shade meant, just asking the question to the community.",

The cards are also open, there's a project(I hope that isn't dead) that aims to make a dual type c card. I also have a pair of RGB input module matrices, that was made by a third party. (and to which the CEO themselves contributed by sending casings so the guy can build them easier)\n\nAnd all this with a factory supplied screwdriver, they ship with the laptop. I think even the boards are open sourced, so technically you could build one, but that's way outside my expertise to even think about...
