There are options to borrow one but it's not as easy as just having your own phone (you have to find place nearby or wait for them to send one, pay deposit or/and make formalities, chose right one etc.).\n\nWhile professionalists probably should just get their own device because of greater danger, multiple tourists don't expect having bigger troubles. My family's friends had situation like that where guy broke his leg pretty badly. Family of four, 2 kids +/- 12yo and his wife had to drag him for few KM, because there was no signal. Not very hard path but remote and abroad. No one expected bigger problems but things happen.\n\nI understand not using Twitter and not buying tesla, but there's still no real alternative to Starlink and it has potential to save lives.",

And only certain phones allow their bootloaders to be unlocked. \n\nI switched to Apple 6 months ago for my main daily driver phone for a much better overall experience after being android for most of my life. As well as a more secure out of the box experience compared to Android. Android is only really more secure when using a custom rom. I do still have and USE an android tablet with a custom rom (LineageOS). And I use Linux for most everything else, for all non-phone and non-tablets.\n\nI realized quickly and have heard for years, that for iOS, apps just work so dramatically better it\u2019s wild. So many less bugs, less weird crashing of apps, the UI is designed perfectly and updated more often for apps, password managers work so dramatically better, etc.\n\nAnd honestly, iMessage is so great, as the android messaging services are so fractured. I\u2019m forced to text with SMS most of the time on android, as many don\u2019t have rcs on on android, and even though apple enabled rcs, it doesn\u2019t work encrypted via rcs from apple to android or vice versa. The MAJORITY of people have iPhones in the US, so therefore the chance my messages can be encrypted is way higher on iPhone. And for whomever is on android, and that I can convince, I can message them through Signal (or less ideal WhatsApp/messenger)\n\nSo with a combination of Signal/Whatsapp and iMessage I can get 90% encryption, with very little SMS, with the rest being for mandatory bs verification codes or android folks I can\u2019t convince to use anything besides sms.\n\nThe best privacy feature is for sure the \u201cApp Tracking Transparency\u201d feature, which Google was SO upset about. You can just deny apps access to the rest of your phone/other apps. Semi-sandboxing them, which was normally only a feature for android custom roms (though custom roms are still way better as custom roms can fully sandbox with fully featured control over the sandboxed app). Google SAID they\u2019d be adding a comparable feature, they even launched a beta of it back in 2021-2022, then presumably abandoned it.\n\nSo PLAIN/VANILLA iOS as of now is just MORE SECURE across the board compared to a NON CUSTOM ROM Android phone.\n\nYou just should never use Apple cloud services if you care about privacy though. Use other cloud services or self host your own as best case. But besides Apple cloud services/storage, iOS is the better privacy option most of the time.",

Pretty useless device, even in London\n\nThis is a different thing, Apple along with all other manufacturers sell phones by area, iphones specifically have 3 versions of the same device that are sold, the US version, the International and the \"countries with specific requirements\" version. Each version uses different bands and frequencies for service, so your US iphone would have some different bands and frequencies than what they use  in the UK which would use the international phone. This is not a new thing, all phones have been sold in this way since the 90's. Usually there's one or two bands out of say 5 or 6 that are used everywhere but most of the time that's it which is why it was switching to satellite, otherwise you'd just have terrible service.",
