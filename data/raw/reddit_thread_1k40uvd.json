They claim high quality microswitches should last \"10 million clicks\" or other such numbers but they fail after just one year of regular gaming use. It's just lies about the specs and programmed obsolescence. They know very well that no matter if it's Omron or whatever other \"super high quality Japanese switch\" the common design of a little strip of copper inside a plastic cage is meant to fail from mechanical stress.\n\nIf you're lucky (that they didn't also design the mouse shell plastic to deform and cause other issues) and skilled (to do smd microsoldering) you can replace the switches, as they're inexpensive. But not everyone can, and not all mice are designed for this type of maintenance, particularly with non-primary switches.\n\nIt's the same problem we have with first party controller thumb-sticks drifting, and companies like Nintendo refusing to use hall-effect sensors to fix the issue permanently. If they wanted to, they could easily find a solution to make the mice last for over 10 years, but \"muh capitalism\" won't allow them to design something that won't be e-waste in a couple years. Pure greed.",
