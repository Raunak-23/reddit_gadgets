I think it\u2019s a situation where Nintendo is such a big company they can just afford the lawsuits this will inevitably cause and paying fines is cheaper than the damage they think people modding their games will cause.  \n\nTo be honest I\u2019m not sure why people still Stan Nintendo.

If the EULA infringes upon your rights as a consumer, it won't hold up in court, a judge would strike that down in a heartbeat. However, hiring a lawyer that could win a case against a superpower like Nintendo lawyers ain't gonna be cheap, certainly more expensive than buying a new console; it may be a slam dunk easy win, but it still costs money upfront to hire and keep the lawyer on retainer for the duration of the proceedings, and Nintendo has an infinite amount of money, so they can afford to keep dragging out the litigation, asking for continuances, wasting time through a myriad of tactics, and will attempt to outlast you to the point where you can no longer afford that lawyer, so the suit gets dropped.  You'd likely have to get a class action together so you could all sue at once with the same lawyer, as individually the financial burden would be too great",

I\u2019m genuinely not sure - just thinking out loud.\n\nI imagine Nintendo are at least partially motivated to not allow emulation due to them still profiting from selling access to retro games via NSO, so *maybe* an argument about monopolies could be made? Where I think that could get tricky, though, is the legal nature of game sales being a \u201clicense\u201d, and an argument that owning a GameCube game only gives you a license to play it on a GameCube, for example. Also, gaming as a medium being so new that every game would still be under some form of copyright.\n\nHowever, we already know that Nintendo can protect against piracy of Switch games due to them all having unique fingerprints that can be detected when played online. So, the next question would be whether full on bricking is even necessary.",

They've been paranoid about copyright since then, and the entire Sony piracy debacle, including Sony's servers hack, has pushed them even farther in the close-environment logic. The Switch, before being a portable computer, is just another old-school game console, a specialized hardware meant to do one and only one thing, which is how Nintendo managed to become and stay relevant for decades even when most of their competition died or moved on.\n\nValve was born in a culture of modding. Half-Life used a modified Quake engine, Team Fortress, Counter Strike and DotA were mods before being turned into stand-alone products, being into open content and users modifications is what made them successful in the first place, and with the Switch being as closed as it is, the more open they are, the better their product will look in comparison.",

It isn't really the important thing so I separated that out below. \n\nThe important thing: you are spinning the Steamdeck's greater hardware freedom as \"can buy games anywhere,\" while ignoring the fact that your notion of \"anywhere\" does not include offline. By and large that isn't an option for PC gaming at all anymore, thanks to Steam. \n\nAnd you are ignoring the benefit of independence that Nintendo's use of physical media gives to you. \n\n------------------------------------\n\nSteam users seem to have this idiosyncratic notion of what DRM is, which vilifies everyone except Steam. \n\nSteam doesn't support anything DRM-free, the only way that you can tell which games don't use Steamworks DRM is through third party lists of questionable accuracy. And there's no enforcement, so there's nothing to prevent DRM from being added after you \"buy\" the game. \n\nAlso, even if a game doesn't implement DRM, it very likely does link to other Steam libraries and so is not independent from Steam. Also, no Steam games come with installers and so if you're using Windows you need to be comfortable with making your own shortcuts and adding any registry entries that might be needed, and if you're using Linux or Mac then you need to know where all the files go.\n\nNo matter what definition of DRM you use, this is not in keeping with the spirit of what DRM-free means. California recently passed a law which encapsulates this notion very well, and Steam does not pass muster.",

And an additional wonderful domino effect of that would be that it would get rid of a huge chunk of shovelware on the eshop because there would be no money in a game whose entire business model is to trick you into buying it and then you not being able to get a refund for a piece of garbage.",

Why, some of them even had full games!\n\nNot surprised to hear about your experience with Breath of the Wild. Back here, the Legend of Zelda games were for rich kids and so on, then I just lost interest in the genre. This, though, was something else altogether.\n\nHmmm... a return policy, like Steam does, but perhaps a more permissive one? My reasoning here is similar to yours: give people enough time to refund products, with no explanation required, and not only would we be looking at less shovelware from what's intentionally a borderline scam, but also a slap to the face of the lot responsible for flops from those categories with lots of 'A's.",

It would technically be within their right to disable the firmware/software, rendering the hardware intact but without any application. They aren't coming to house to steal the system.\n\nTo run unauthorized software you need custom firmware/software to be able to do that in the first place. So once there is custom firmware there isn't anything Nintendo can really do by \"disabling firmware\". What they can do is add a kill switch though, adding a fuse that's blown on command. They do something similar to prevent downgrading to an older OS version. Intel does something similar to disable hardware features for their cheaper CPUs. Not sure if they will do that, but it is definitely possible to physically disable the device so that it won't run even with custom firmware/software.",

You can also play the best region version of the game with a translator patch. \n\nModern games may not emulate well while they work on the emulator and get the kinks out. Modern games may require beefy hardware you may not have. Emulation is for older games no longer sold.\n\nJust wait until ray tracing is added to older games.

      "body": "Not sure why Nintendo is opening themselves up for a mass class action lawsuit from every intend switch 2 owner in Europe later this year, see, under EU law, this is highly questionable, and I really dont know where to start, lets just start at the top, or bottom, so permanently disabling hardware would violate the EUs 'principe of proportionality' and basic ass consumer rights, which also includes ownership rights, and you can modify your switch 2 to your hearts content, as long as it's not primarily for piracy reasons, so being able to unlock hidden hardware limits, install a custom os, and even being able to play roms, would still be legal, as long as the intent is not piracy. And you can resell it as you want, at most Nintendo can block ya from online on that console, but that's it. Where was I, uh lets see, proportionality, consumer rights, ownership rights, then we got unfair terms, cause the eula does not include uh, I forgot, gimme a sec... unfair contract terms, so they can't brick your console without recourse or appeal, which means that Nintendo may be liable to pay for bricking your console, and with no appeal process... well, enuf said about that, ya also got the right to repair bit, which is very important atm, and eu law is very supportive of our right to repair, or even modify devices to our hearts content, now, while I mentioned it lacks an appeal process, this means it also lacks transparency, which breaches your right to effective remedy under eu law.  \nSO, while there are possible reasons where it could be a viable method, such as distributing priated games and whatnot, they could still not do it, but they could contact the relevant authorities, i.e police and whatnot, to confiscate it, you know a think called proportional enforcement response, like they can't Hasbro it and send the pinkertons after you. Another method would be bricking as a DRM feature, but uh, that would... Not hold up in court.  \nso yeah, tl;dr even if you agree, that new part of the EULA aint legally binding in the EU",

It's that simple, unreasonably represented products are not protected. There is no amount of fine print that is going to make a court side with a company that is trying to \"gotcha\" consumers. \n\nImagine big corp A is buying company from big corp B but they somehow miss fine print in the sale that says big corp A will surrender the company back to big corp B in 24 hours without receiving a return payment. Courts will consider it bad faith, unreasonable, predatory, etc etc etc. This is exactly why Disney backed off of pursuing the fine language from their streaming service saying you permanently wave the right to sue them at their physical locations by purchasing the streaming service. There is no judge in the US that is going to expect consumers to read fine print for terms and conditions of an online service for conditions not related to the streaming service. Judges also probably don't take corporations trying to dictate law through pressing \"agree\", with the expectation of a simple service in return, very well.",

But as far as I'm concerned, when they take one cent from you in exchange for the machine, it's yours to do whatever you want with. If you want to play it normally, that's your right with zero restrictions. If you want to throw it in a pool, that's your right with zero restrictions. If you want to mod it, that's your right with zero restrictions. When I buy a bike, the bike maker can't break the bike if I decide to use wheels from another company. Merely considering this kind of anti-consumer corporate abuse should be severely punished by the government with punitive fines.",

Sure, they are great games, but for every mario kart there is a crash team racing and for every zelda we have a dozen better games like soul reaver, alundra or vagrant story. Also, very little JRPGs for being a japanese console.\n\nIMHO Nintendo became a player in the console market when they allowed other titles to played on switch. before that... at least in my region they couldn't compete.",

The only people out there hacking and pirating Nintendo\u2019s games that this will affect will be the ones who are using the unauthorized online e-shop style downloader apps on their Switch. The ones who have it connected to the internet even though it\u2019s hacked and banned from Nintendo\u2019s online servers anyway. \n\nIf someone has a Switch that\u2019s hacked and they\u2019re getting the games via PC and manually transferring and installing while the Switch itself is never actually connected to the internet, they\u2019re not going to be able to stop that. They can\u2019t keep a lid on their IP\u2019s out there online as it is. They aren\u2019t able to stop any part of that process or connect to the machine to brick it because it\u2019s never connected to the internet.\n\nBut if they\u2019re out there using the e-shop style app, Nintendo can track traffic from sites they consider unauthorized to the Switches themselves and anyone found trafficking between their machine and the IP\u2019s they know are providing the games will be bricked via forced update. \n\nI wonder if we\u2019ll hear of a massive wave of bans of machines using those apps. The machines being connected to the internet is the only way they can brick them.",

It could me \"you can break it and it isn't our problem\", or \"if we find out, we are going to break your system\". Not entirely sure, but if it means the latter then I think there is a possible lawsuit here or ruling. I remember during the first days of Android cellphones a guy filed and won against Verizon wireless. His phone was paid off, he owned it and Verizon didn't wanted to provide the security codes so he can bring it to other network. After that, the FCC ruled that if the phone is paid off, then the owner is the person has the right to have the security codes to use the phone in other networks, and do what ever the person wants. Basically, if you buy a device, the device is yours amd you should be able to do what ever you want with it. I agreed banning the system from online access, black listing the user, or anything in Nintendo's server side. But automatically bricking the system is basically damaging the property of others.",

Successful encryption will cause this check to _fail,_ because the Korean key isn't supposed to be present on non-Korean Wiis at all, but typical methods of region-changing historically hadn't accounted for this, thus leaving the Korean key in place on formerly-Korean Wiis. In this kind of case, instead of booting, the Wii Menu will just crash to a screen that says \"Error 003: unauthorized device has been detected\". And because this happens every time the Wii Menu tries to boot, if you don't have anything you can run first, such as Priiloader, your Wii is basically screwed at that point.",

      "body": "It's pretty sad that Nintendo feels responsible enough for the use of their product that they'll brick your modded console, but they don't feel responsible enough to have fixed millions of their product with known and acknowledged stick drift due to cheap parts and bad engineering on Nintendo's part.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's interesting how support for the product and support for Nintendo itself are on differing scales. I also think all of these end-user agreements are null and void in a court of law because I don't have a witness or a lawyer present when \"signatures\" are being provided. Also, contracts work before you put the product in my hand. Once you've sold me the product, you have no right to tell me how I can use the product I have paid.for and is now In my possession. Nintendo wants to rewrite ownership laws. They're going to have a crazy hard time of changing a fundamentally rooted law in America",

The only semblance of a way for them to do something like this, is if they offer Switch 2's like cellphones in payment plans. \n\npaying for a switch 2 up front means the hardware and all software on it is yours to configure at will, disassemble, backup, modify. This would be an unlocked Switch 2. They have no legal bearing on actions taken with such devices. All they can do is block you from their online servers and never let you connect it to Nintendo owned infrastructure again.\n\nTo brick your shit, they need to sell a locked version that can only remain locked so long as the loan contract you agreed to hasn't been fully paid off. They could also just create a sub class of locked loaner devices with the express terms that you actually do not own it and are simply allowed to use it while you maintain your forever-rent contact. \n\nNo way in hell they're gonna do that. \n\nThis is super fluff BS from a company that says exactly these threats every release of a new console. There's always something they want you to believe is possible even though it definitely isn't. \n\nSame goes for game cartridges. You can pull that software out and copy it to your own premises to do whatever you want with it, so long as you neither distribute it to others, nor make a profit off of derivative works that include copies of any trademarked assets represented in the ROM data. That's all copyright or trademarked etc. \n\nA fun legal question I have is whether you can prove that a specific ROM copy is any different than any other of the same ROM (obviously you can't for basically all ROMs in existence today). If you can't distinguish between two copies of the same ROM, then distributing that exact ROM to someone who has proved to you that they own the cart already _should not be illegal in my 0 law background and very presumptive opinion._\n\nIf I happen to be making legal sense here, then I can imagine that all the archiving websites currently under legal fire from Nintendo can simply continue existing legally if they just require people to legally swear, in a stupid docusign or something, that they legally own the physical cart and are allowed to own copies of it's ROM. Distributing the ROM to a legal owner of the cartridge does not infringe on any company's bottom line. \n\nIdk. I'm just very passionate about this subject and find the laws around it fascinating. The laws aren't entirely concrete, and you can only use them based on how they worked out in previous trials. To actually find out what the law deems legal at any point, I'm pretty sure you'd have to actually sue and try to fight your case. Nintendo cannot inverse-class-action sue every person who acquires a copy of the ROM data that resides in their legally owned physical cart. I imagine. Idk",

Now my gaming laptop can run RPCS3 at 1.5x internal resolution, Dolphin at double resolution, and Citron (rip) runs most games flawlessly at 60 fps on 1080p.  The advances in dynarec and shader pipeline compilation and emulation has been astounding.
