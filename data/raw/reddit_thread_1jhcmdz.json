On top of the like 45 min wait, just to speak to the hostess, get a table after like an hour and a half wait (god we should have just gone somewhere else) They proceed to bring us the wrong orders multiple times. But the straw that broke the camels back was when the waiter \"accidentally\" spilled hot coffee all over my GF and when we complained the manager said we were lucky they were not charging us for the pot of coffee. When I complained to corporate they gave me no sort of apology and did not even see this as an issue. I was young and dumb so did not make nearly as big of a deal out of this as I should have. \n\nBut I have never and will never step foot inside one again, I will go hungry over eating there, I have literally sat out in the car as others have gone in to eat when it was the only open option. \n\nOnce a company is on my shit list they will never get a single cent from me, for Samsung I will even avoid products that contain Samsung parts. I will also do everything in my power to make sure no one I know gives them money.\n\n*edit to add* \n\nCause I want to give a shout out where a shout out is due, there is a local restaurant here called Aroma,  bit on the bougie side but I like that sort of thing, my friend got a tiny piece of plastic from a food package bag in one of his tacos, we informed the staff not to complain just let them know, They REFUSED to let us pay for either of our meals. Like would not even swipe my credit card refused, They are now the restaurant I recommend to everybody and will give them as much business as possible.",

Dad was already complaining left and right, but after it all he demanded the manager, gave a stern, but level headed explanation, though was actually incredibly intimidating when he was quiet angry. \n\nGave my dad a reusable, no expiration 10% coupon card, so at least by the end of things they tried to smooth it over for us, but it was maybe 20 years before adult me decided to check again.

Sometimes properties have a centralized cable or satellite rather than each device having its own box and all the remotes just RF to the central box.

I'd test with another peripheral and go to the local wally world to get a universal remote and program it to the tv, which would give you access to the tv's volume.

She bought new base model Samsung 32 inch, with Smart TV and flimsy build. After needing reboots and such occasionaly it also lasted a year before dying altogether. That was replaced with a fake \"Toshiba\" FireTV. While you have to access a burried setting to disable the TV from defaulting to Amazon Prime at startup rather than your last input and that setting reset itself once, its been reliable.\n\nMom's new condo came with 10 year old but high end Samsung front loader set. After a while one throws an error about the water level. Tech comes out, offers to fix it for many hundreds of dollars, but advises that its easy to fix and you can get the sensor on Amazon. So she does, but doesn't fix it. Figures out it works fine in a specific mode just not others, then it dies more, got replaced with a cheap top loader. Dryer holding out. Sadly my own set is also a Samsung front loader set because they were bought during Covid and pickings were slim, but even they show shines of quality that is cut out of the latest years, like the glass door.\n\nI hated many things about my Galaxy S9 despite my best attempts to like it, didn't deliver on any of its selling points, won't go further into that. Roommate bought a $600 gaming monitor with HDR. It needs a power replug every couple of days, I think it coincides with brownouts which happens often around here, but no other screen around here does that. They no longer are involved with making Renault-Nissan cars for the local Korean market, eliminating another interesting footnote. They have made decent laptops and Chromebooks in the past but they don't try hard enough and never nail the market. The only thing they still do right is SSD's.",

I bought a lot of Samsung stuff, and as I replaced them, I chose other brands.\n\nMy TV problem was that I purchased 80-something inch  TV on sale. It was in stock and was to be delivered within 2 weeks.\n\n2 weeks later, and it hasn't shipped. I call, they say they are working on it and to give them a week. I give them 2 weeks and it still hasn't moved. I call, they say it is out of stock. I asked to cancel, they said I could not because it already had been shipped. For the next month, it was both out of stock and shipped.\n\nI bought a different TV and had it delivered the same day. I called my credit card company to dispute the charge. They talk with Samsung, and Samsung ships a different TV immediately, making it so that in order to cancel, I need to refuse delivery.\n\nI refused delivery, and the mom & pop shipping company was livid at me for wasting their morning. Samsung then sat on my refund for over a week.\n\nIt was a pointless waste of time for everyone involved.",

If you need the modest brightness advantage of QLED for a room with glare and whatnot, all that means you are trading out image quality and viewing angles for brightness (and unsolicited dithering, since there are almost no LCD TVs that don't use it).\n\n* WOLED is right out, because luminance overshoot is a dealbreaker, and after half a decade+, they still haven't eliminated it, so it's evidently not going away.  Quite bluntly, there's an alternative panel type which just so happens to not have that issue, while also being brighter as a nice bonus.\n\n* Sony are the only real contenders here with their A95 series which are effectively just Sony's branded iteration of Samsung's display.  But for whatever reason, Samsung consistently edges Sony out on color reproduction/accuracy, HDR gradients and (probably the most obvious) gray uniformity, which actually translates to how much array artifacting you can see in sub-5 nits scenarios\u2014probably the only meaningful artifact QD-OLED has.  Sony also _never supports Freesync,_ like WTF!?  You pay a premium for the Sony tax but then have to put up with missing conveniences like that because, one supposes, Sony's engineering team lives by the philosophy that a minority utility means it can be excluded outright.  But I will give the A95 series the one W in that it at least supports Dolby Vision.\n\nAs for the question of\n\n> because the amount of weight each person assigns to those values differs,\n\nthat's why Rtings provides categories.  They know it; you know it; I know it.  They also, unambiguously, provide the category of \"best TV\", meaning in broad strokes that if your use case is broad, i.e. all else being equal, here is your TV that wins the most points in each.\n\nIf there's an argument to be made against Rtings' judgment then I'd be wanting to see another grading resource that does at least as comprehensive a job of detailing the ins and outs of every meaningful model on the market as they do.  It's not impossible\u2014there have certainly been facets of consideration that I've felt they could do better on.",

What you are instead pointing out is that an assessment can possess a trace of subjectivity.  But when one TV wins in 95% of categories, or even just in the majority of categories, you don't get to pretend that it isn't objectively the better TV.\n\nThe most subjective point of consideration when it comes to \"best TV\" is probably the A95x's Dolby Vision vs. Samsung's HDR10+, i.e. if you want dynamic metadata for Netflix or for Amazon Prime / AppleTV.  Sony could have easily won this item by including the _royalty free_ HDR10+ support alongside DV, but I already noted earlier that they seem to prefer to lock in to their own tune.

Is it the best? Or is it the best for the money? Well, how much money? If you've got $200, don't buy a Samsung. If you've got $2000, maybe buy a Samsung. If you've got $20,000, don't buy a Samsung. Given that, how can you say Samsung makes the best TV? If you can spend 10x less, why can't you spend 10x more? Bringing price into the equation massively changes the scope of your claim. Isn't that an important caveat?\n\nReally, my whole point is that what you're claiming as \"important objective qualities\" are an infinitesimal subset of things people actually care about when buying a TV. So how can you possibly claim one TV is \"best\"?\n\nYou're automatically rejecting all the things that most people who buy TVs think are important differences between TVs, so I'll be really specific using the kind of thing you're talking about. The LG C4 has greater colour accuracy than the S90D. What if colour accuracy is really important to me? Can you tell me, objectively, how much it should matter that the Samsung is worse, given it is better on other metrics?\n\nThere's no \"95% of categories\", or majority of categories, because not all categories are equal, the amount each one matters differs by the individual, and there are a virtually infinite number of them. \n\nLike, do you think there's an objectively best car? An objectively best house? An objectively best plane? You can't have things that vary on a million different qualities have an objective best.",

Like Rtings noted, if you simply measure the TV out of the box, it's going to be a little too blue.  All Samsungs do this, including QLEDs.\n* Again, _provided you care about color like you say,_ the difference in color gamut representation between the two models is vastly more important.  Do you want HDR or not?  I'm honestly surprised you brought up color at all.  Incidentally, if this is a sincere concern of yours, I strongly recommend an A/B at a brick and mortar so you can see for yourself.\n\n> Like, do you think there's an objectively best car? An objectively best house? An objectively best plane?\n\nStrawmen.  And maybe that's been your issue all along.  You have possibly internalized a false equivalency.  There can be and have been objectively best cameras, best CPUs, best GPUs etc.  Maybe I can even help you with this.  If you can't find a website whose goal is to compare competing products in a category and figure out which ones do their jobs better, whereupon they determine specimens that stand out as being head and shoulders above their competition, then consider it disqualified.  \"Cars\" for example is too broad and you'd never find an absolute winner\u2014although you perhaps could have in the early 20th century.  \"EVs\" on the other hand could definitely someday find a clear winner.",

And you ignored it entirely in your reply.",

That's not really a conversation of merit.  I can't help but imagine you find it _inconvenient_ that a site like Rtings quantifies the actual differences between TVs.  Please don't be surprised if they stubbornly continue to find the Samsung flagship QD-OLED to be the cream of the crop.  Though since Sony buys their panels from Samsung, it's not beyond conception that they could drop in all the QOL features they've been leaving out, narrow the gaps in WYSIWYG, and justify their Sony tax premium by actually edging out the Samsung for once.",

Sometimes I forget about that.\n\nDoesn't really affect my point, and it seems pretty obvious that you're ignoring the actual point, which is that when you can get TVs that are much cheaper, that aren't as good, and much more expensive TVs that are much better, the idea that Samsung makes \"the best TV\" becomes a farce.\n\nRespond to that point directly and I'll give you my much more exhaustive response to everything else.

You don't need to do a 5.1 or any surround setup. Any AV receiver will do Stereo just fine. 10 year old AV receivers are dirt cheap on Facebook marketplace and the like.\n\nWant something new and fancy with those wireless smart features? Get a modern AV receiver. Most people are not going to notice or care about the difference between a cheap Denon HEOS receiver like the S700 series, and one of the higher end AV receivers from Denon, Onkyo, Pioneer, etc.\n\nSo ARC amp or receiver, and a pair of bookshelf speakers, just upgrade the amp/receiver when you want to. Buy more speakers if you feel like expanding.\n\nSoundbars are a consumable electronics product. Speakers will last forever for almost anyone.",

In the rush to do so, they often had zero security at worst or vulnerable security libraries at best. Often, these companies don't even manage their IOT websites themselves and instead contract it out to random 3rd parties with questionable longevity. Over time new security vulnerabilities are discovered that might allow people to harvest your data or invade your network via the IOT device. So all those security libraries need to be updated, usually only if you've ever connected your device to the network.    \n  \nFor some products (e.g. voice assistants, smart TVs, network cams), the network access may be a main selling feature or part of the product's function. The soundbar, for example, can connect to your Alexa, Apple airplay, Google Home, and Chromecast. So you can use the sound bar for voice assistant or online music playing. Samsung will likely maintain the software and licenses to these services over time to maintain their function or add additional services that gain popularity.   \n  \nIf you've ever added your home network to the IOT device, then it'll be searching for that network and installing software/firmware updates periodically. These are usually installed automatically so if one bricks your device, you might never know why.",

The thing is full of computers for your tree, and you have to use them to service and repair your vehicle and they charge exorbitant rates. even if it\u2019s something like a failed spark plug the system locks the whole thing out and they\u2019re the only ones who can access it\u2026 When you spend $200,000 on a massive combine harvester and you get screwed I would be pissed off too\u2026",

I think it\u2019s quite simple only one or two inputs I think. However you couldn\u2019t do a thing with it until you downloaded the app to your phone, and went through all the set up process. I understand they do that so that people don\u2019t skip the set up and become disappointed with their product but it\u2019s a high end speaker. nobody is purchasing this who isn\u2019t the type of person to dig right into the AV settings\u2026   \n\nBut the actual problem was that the app didn\u2019t work particularly well, you had to first connect to it with the phone, and then configure it to connect to your local Wi-Fi network so it had Internet access also control from anywhere within range of your network. Without this step the thing literally does not work. It just ignores whatever audio input you plug into it.    \n\nAfter literally four hours trying to set it up and getting in contact with their customer support, required us to put a bunch of pointless settings into our router, it still wasn\u2019t working..   \nI remember my dad, just sitting there looking at the thing lol.         \n\nEventually great working, and to be perfectly honest\u2026 Not that impressed.

It just had radios for different wireless standards, a wifi chip, and some tooling that made it possible to control your lights while you were away.\n\nOne evening, Wink issued a standard, routine firmware update, but only realized when it had completed that they shipped a firmware update with an *expired SSH certificate*, meaning, they couldn't even SSH into the hubs to fix the problem and issue a new cert. They sent out emails to their entire customer base saying, \"we fucked up *bad* and need you to ship your hub to us so we can manually reflash the chip in our offices.\" They were covering the postage, but, if you had smart lights, that was sort of the only way most folks had on hand to control them, beyond just switching them on and off via the lamp. \n\nBy some miracle, I guess they discovered a zero day exploit and were able to get into the hubs and revive them remotely. Like, three months later, they started charging a subscription fee to use your existing setup. I eWasted it and moved to Phillips Hue, which was spensie but has yet to let me down.",

One oriental speaking lady told me I was out of luck. Currently, my fridge is not working properly, my microwave has a short and my range has an issue with one of the burners. I also had a Samsung TV which broke in less than a year. The technician told me NOT to buy their brand ever. He even said they look nice but never work properly.",
