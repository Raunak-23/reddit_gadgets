All those apps were super easy to develop applets that utilized the internet browser already on the device.  Nintendo didn't include a browser on Switch because it made consoles too easy to hack and mod.  And, apparently, the only services willing to dedicate resources to developing a native app were Hulu and Crunchyroll.  And since Switch 2 doesn't natively run OG Switch software, it seems they may need to either develop a translation layer or a new app if they want them on the new systems.\n\nSo yes, Nintendo is the cause of the lack of streaming services, but not for any conspiratorial reasons, just conservative business practicing reasons.",

I like the idea of a focused device that you pick up solely to play some games and then put down once you're done coz it doesn't do anything else. \n\nI realize it's not that simple, the device also docks to a TV. Ideally it should not be your primary way of watching Hulu Netflix etc anyway, at home at least. But yeah the fact that you can't just throw it in your travel bag knowing it'll let you watch what you want on your Hotel room TV is disappointing but I'm from an era where we had separate dedicated devices for taking pictures, listening to music and making phone calls and it was fine.",

      "body": "I believe Hulu and Crunchyroll aren't compatible, and YouTube is still under testing and will likely need an update to work. My best bet is they're most likely planning on releasing a separate version of the apps due to the way the Switch 2 runs Switch 1 games. In simple terms (from my very limited understanding), the games don't run natively, but instead run through a translation layer. This is actually a really good thing, because (from what I've heard), older games will run better just due to the nature of how they'll run. Framerates and resolution are more likely to hit their caps/likely docked caps in handheld mode / docked mode on Switch 2, with no updates to games required. If games are updated and tweaked (mainly to raise frame caps or adjust resolution things\u2014 again, not the most tech savvy, just going off of what I've heard from those that are), they could run at better resolutions and FPS. \n\nBut just due to this translation layer, I could imagine it'd maybe cause a couple of issues for these apps. In particular Crunchyroll, which was a bit buggy on Switch 1, but had the beautiful godlike addition of being able to download episodes to the console for offline viewing in handheld and docked. Worked amazing as it essentially made it a streaming tablet on that app specifically, without any load times, resolution drops or buffering that comes with video streaming. There wasn't really a cap on it (which was a slight bit of an oversight considering the original Switch's total space\u2014 it was easy to fill up all your native storage really fast lol). But I recall there being a fair decent bit of bugginess that had me like, deleting the app and re-downloading it just from how it was poorly optimized concerning the downloads and how it all worked. I could see that definitely leading to a very veeerrryyy buggy performance on Switch 2. Considering the popularity of the console, they've likely just gone back to re-package and put out a better optimized version of the app. \n\nThat being said, I'm still shocked Netflix, HBO Max, etc. never came to the console. It's kind of a really good fit, considering it can either just be watched right from the TV, or function as a tablet with a really really high quality screen (with the OLED specifically\u2014 HDR display in the Switch 2's case) \n\nNot sure if/when Hulu would come, but I'm definitely curious, as they are aware, y'know? Just a bit interesting to me",

Part of the problem with quality control and stability is the trend to make consoles like computers with DLC, patches, etc. It makes devs sloppy and games more prone to being buggy. Sure, fixed media wasn't perfect but there was an incentive to ensure optical disks, card media, and catridges were fully tested. If you want a computer then get a computer, let the consoles be stable. This likely dates me as a GenX luddite but I miss the days when we fully owned the games/media and didn't have to worry about crashes and rushed development.",
