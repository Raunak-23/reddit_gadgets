Unfortunately that's not really possible: it is it's own OS, which may or may not support my SBC.\n\nYou can, obviously, use the Docker version, but that's extremely limited to the devices/integrations supported, as you can't really add extra addons to it.\n\nBecause I do work, professionally, with all sort of virtualizations techs and have access to many resources, I do not really keep extra PCs/servers around my house, so I didn't really have another target to slap it on... except my PC, where I do my work but I *also* run VMWare Workstation Pro.\n\nSo, the obvious solution is to download the OVA and import it. Downloaded... done. Ok, importing fails.\n\nWhy does it fail? Well, something about sha checksum missmatch. OVA are just zip files, so let's unpack it...\n\nUnpacked, checked the `.manifest` file, sha checksum was a match to the vmdk file (disk image), so no idea why it failed/complained. Had to delete the `.manifest` to be able to import it.\n\nOnce that was done, it booted just fine, more or less and I had it running on my network in bridge mode.\n\nFirst of all: didn't really \"see\" any of my IoT devices -- the only thing it automatically detected was my Android TV. \n\nSo I had to manually add my devices/integrations.\n\nFirst was Sensibo -- it's a shit device btw, but it's the most accurate temperature/humidity sensor I have *right now* in my house.\n\nFor that, I had to... create an API key on the Sensibo website and then add it manually. No local control, it seems, all trough the Cloud?\n\nNext was the AC.\n\nThe \"local\" module for my AC is no longer working (some firmware versions no work), so you need to use the cloud.\n\nSo this is the only one working: https://github.com/maeek/ha-aux-cloud\n\n...but to install that, I first need to install HACS.\n\n...which is not just clicking a button, and that actually annoyed me a bit, 'cause it wasn't exactly intuitive, even after I installed the... installer for it.\n\nThe 3rd part was just me having to write an automation for the stuff I wanted, but that was also a pain, because the \"point and click\" builder wasn't sufficient, so I had to do YAML.\n\nAgain: I'm a \"happy\" case because I have all the tech knowledge behind, but a \"normal\" person wants shit to just work.",
