              "body": "Reviews in general are cooked.\n\nCompanies that have the market cornered (think Nvidia, DJI, etc.) only give early access to people that simp for them and withhold product and drivers until launch.  This way all the sites are flooded with positive reviews that become the reviews with most views and likes.\n\nThen you have the Amazon, Twitch, social media problem.  Influencers, bots, and people that get free product/paid flood platforms with good reviews.\n\nBasically, the internet has shifted and become a dishonest ecommerce tool.  You still have honest sites like Gamers Nexus, DCRainmaiker, etc. but overall, it is mostly fake.  Add to the problem review baiting for shocking content for clicks and ad revenue.\n\nOnly thing consumers can do is not have FOMO.  Let the product get released and check multiple mediums for reviews.  Stop preordering.  This comes with the bot/scalper challenge though.\n\nTL:DR: reviews are fake and controlled most of the time.  Only thing you can do is wait until long after launch and contest scalpers at a later date.  Still better than buying junk early and being stuck.",

So if you had a site that wanted to just show a feed of products related of plush teddies for kids, there'd be no way to filter out \"sexy lingerie\" or \"sex toys\" or whatever item that had the word \"teddy\" or \"plush\" in their name, so you had to have people that would daily screen and blacklist the newly added amazon inventory so those product would not show up in your site.\n\nAt least ebay a the time had the option to do negative keywords, but amazon when I last tried still doesn't. Wich is why for ages the only sane way to search amazon was through Google. (At the same time you have the google shopping tab, which is a total mess as well)",

Maybe the guy just...liked the drone, and that doesn't automatically mean he's shilling for DJI? We can't just argue with his conclusions, and instead have to believe the whole thing is purposefully dishonest? \n\nOnly say this because I see this line of thinking with a lot of folks nowadays, as if the only trustworthy reviewers are YouTubers and smaller orgs, when ironically those are often the ones who *don't* have an larger institution or actual editors enforcing stricter standards. GN and DCRainmaker are great, though, won't argue that.",

Here is what you can compare it to and how\n\nBrands and reviews are for a large part cooked.  Again, my point was companies that do this control the narrative.  Sure, there are honest reviews later and tons of good sites and reviewers.\n\nAnd the product could be great.  The problem is you won't know for real for a while.  And odds are with things like DJI not like there are a ton of options in the same space anyways.\n\nNvidia 50 series is a perfect example.  Excluding drivers the 8/90 are good, especially if you skipped a gen.  They require early access to have a good review and talk about framegen and MFG4x.  For the new launch they withheld drivers so the good reviews were out AND you couldn't test.  Also launched at computex and buried it.  Reviewers were trashing it in hotel rooms lol.\n\nIf the customer is uninformed and doesn't know this, they are duped.  In the Nvidia example many people will end up with a 5060 and regret it now and down the road.",
