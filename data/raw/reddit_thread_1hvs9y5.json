This particular claim about the 5070 having the performance of a 4090 is an example of how egregious their statements can be. That said, their benchmarks for *Far Cry 6* and *A Plague Tale: Requiem* should be fairly accurate because, unlike their other claims, these are actually based on direct comparisons of the 5070 against the 4070 with the same features enabled.\n\nSo, there\u2019s no MFG magic boosting the 5070 in these cases. And it shows: the performance \"improvement\" drops from a claimed 100% in games like *Alan Wake 2* to a much more reasonable and expected 15% to 25%.",
