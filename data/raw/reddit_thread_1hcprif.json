Sure, it *supports* VR, the games will run, but it\u2019s not designed for it so there\u2019s no controllers for it. That\u2019s gonna kill the actual practicality of playing. \n\nIf Google figures out how to make controllers that are good for gaming without being to scary or complicated for Sheryl in accounting to use for her virtual desktop, then they\u2019ll be\u2026exactly in the same place as Meta is with the Quest 3? \n\nThat is, it\u2019s selling, but not at the rate it\u2019s supposed to. And the people who buy it use it for a year or so and then there\u2019s widespread user reports here on Reddit of the headsets collecting dust.\n\nGoogle has a lot of work to do that so far several other companies have tried and are failing to get it off the ground level.",

The fact that they\u2019re developing AR instead of VR does kinda show they\u2019ve failed to tap into the segmented market of gamers.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I think gamers are the key to mainstream, because you\u2019re right; they\u2019re not. It\u2019s that gamers, as a community, are not shy of new tech, and are very often early adopters. They\u2019re the most easy to sell on new shit, and they can\u2019t even tap *that* market. Even now that Quest is the cost of a Switch, no one cares about VR/AR - the quest does both, and not very many people know how the OS feels, because not very many people bought it, or any other headset for that matter.\n\nIf they can\u2019t get tech savvy, early adopters to get onboard, how are they gonna sell it to Cheryl down the street? There\u2019s no practical use. \n\nThe absolute best they can hope for is the same direction Meta is now leaning with their quest - after failing to capture gamers/actual users - \u201centerprise app suites\u201d, business-friendly apps that somehow try and make augmented or virtual reality meetings desirable, even tho still to date no company makes a headset that\u2019s comfortable to wear for 60min at a time, let alone a full day of meetings.\n\nA laptop does everything a business meeting needs. Can be projected or streamed to be viewed easily and comfortably by everyone.\n\nI bring up gaming so much because it\u2019s the niche market for the niche product. Businesses don\u2019t need power point to be a fully immersive experience in order to better enjoy the actuarial graphs that Steve made. So what\u2019s the niche that makes AR even remotely appetizing to buy into when Office 365 already has so many competing products that are more accessible and significantly more practical on a computer than a headset?",

Those early smartphones were pretty shitty too. You're on the right track with what are essentially zoom calls, but imagine being able to put up a whole trade show or showroom in a virtual space, with live vendors all using glasses that are just a little bigger than some ray-bans.\n\nThat's the future these guys think they'll be able to deliver on. Meta isn't a gaming company. What they are foreseeing are tools for connecting people, especially people that want to sell stuff.",

Additionally, the gaming market buys into the latest and greatest pc components and monitors and TVs and sound systems.\n\nSo I\u2019m not talking about smartphones. I\u2019m talking about who is interested in immersive experiences, and that\u2019s gamers. There isn\u2019t any other large scale market I can think of that is so digitally plugged in and ready to be immersed in digital-living, which is the aim of mixed reality.\n\nGamers are blood thirst for new tech. They crave immersion and highly palpable experiences that feel tangential. They should have been easily sold on VR and mixed reality. But Google canceled Google glasses nearly 10 years ago because mixed reality didn\u2019t grasp a wide audience. And, again, meta is now leaning heavily into business suite products because their first attempt at gamers also isn\u2019t panning out like they hoped when they bought out oculus in the first place.",

I truly feel that gamers *should* be the market for R&D. I just don\u2019t see any practical use for business suite apps that will result in a sustainable product for longer than 2 years, just like many of Googles other scrapped innovations.

It\u2019s inevitable: more jobs are being done from home. More shopping is being done from home. Lots of blue collar jobs are going to be taken over by robots.\n\nThings like meetings, but also things like art galleries, trade shows, museums, markets will start having virtual versions when these things get the actually good version just like the first iphone, just like how smartphones were kind of a niche thing then blew up.\n\nTechnically speaking, maybe cloud computing is the answer.

Instead, they keep getting shitty ports like Skyrim that have so much aliasing it\u2019s unplayable without mods. \n\nBut if they produced more high fidelity, high performing gaming experiences, they\u2019d have a market ready and willing to buy every game released at full price and preordered (I\u2019m not a preorderer, but again, this market speaks for itself). They could develop everything they want to accomplish for business suites by implanting and testing new designs in games.\n\nInstead, they seem to be trying to make another thing that does exactly what the Quest or Vive can already do, without really furthering how the apps are gonna function on it.\n\nI\u2019ll be happy if this pans out, I\u2019ll even buy one, but I\u2019m just predicting this is gonna flop.",

As per Google's hack record, I wouldn't be surprised if the glasses didn't last long before being pulled. \n\nThe actual XR headset is made by Samsung, so that's a completely different kettle of fish. I guess the lifespan of Android XR will depend a lot on the success of this headset. But don't forget the Quest headsets also run on a version of Android. So we could see more collaboration between Meta and Google, and maybe both OSs will end up merging. That is basically part of Meta's long term vision for the metaverse (and no, the metaverse isn't that failed app, and it hasn't been abandoned).",
