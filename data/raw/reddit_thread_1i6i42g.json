The author of this article doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\n\niPhone has always been a bit of a showy status symbol in China for the upper-middle class, after all you can easily buy a phone that does 80% the stuff for 30% the price.\n\nAnd that demographics have been moving to foldable phones, which is why the flagship model for *all* top brands in China is a folding phone.\n\nThere is a reason Huawei made a big deal about their tri-fold phone: https://youtu.be/Yv_S7KrOlfk?si=0GwgBByWzBO1fguE\n\nAll top brands are launching new foldable flagships this year: https://www.notebookcheck.net/All-of-China-s-top-five-phone-makers-to-launch-new-foldable-phones-in-2025.945894.0.html\n\nWell all top brands except Apple, and it\u2019s hurting their sales. It doesn\u2019t help that iPhones have been looking the same for years. \n\nIf the author just spent a single day visiting a few Apple/Xiaomi/Huawei stores in China they\u2019d know why Apple is hurting.\n\n**Edit** Just looked up some data. China\u2019s foldable phone sales went up 48% YoY for the first half of 2024: https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/chinas-foldables-sell-through-up-50-in-q1-2024-as-book-type-sales-nearly-double/\n\nAnd none of that went to Apple, obviously.",

Apple might tie your phone to iCloud, iPad, iMusic, iTunes, but Xiaomi will also give you TVs, air conditioners, robot vacuums, smart lamps, home security cameras, motorized shades, rice cookers, and now even a CAR! \n\nThe Xiaomi SU7 sports sedan has been one of the most successful EV launches in recent memory and not even a full year after its launch Xiaomi is already working their factory at 200% capacity, selling over 20,000 cars every month, and building their second factory as fast as they can.\n\nAnd all their stuff is fully connected to each other. Like you can be standing next to your Xiaomi rice cooker at home, and tell it to get your SU7 ready because you are going out soon, and by the time you go downstairs, the car is all ready to go with the air conditioning on and everything. Or you are driving the SU7 home, and you can just tell it to turn all your home appliances on. Or tell it to bring up a feed of your home security camera, and it will just pop up right on the car's center screen.\n\nApple got nothing that can compare to that.",

But so far there have been little to no complaints about the hinge breaking on any good foldable. It's not a concern anymore, but I understand the hesitation.\n\n>Finally from what my friends told me, their battery life suck.\n\nYour friends are wrong. Chinese foldables have great battery life and even better charging tech (80-100W).\n\nI'm not trying to say there aren't any issues with a foldable (heft and less protection being the primary downsides imo), just that your list isn't very accurate for Chinese foldables.",

There's so many advantages to owning a foldable that you realize when you actually start using it. Here are a few examples:\n\n* Media looks awesome, whether it be reading, watching videos, or showing someone pictures you clicked. Hard to go back once you get used to it.\n* You can prop it anywhere in different angles. You can open it halfway through to make it a small laptop for watching videos. You can use it in a tent mode when you're laying down to keep your hands free and use your phone.\n* You can turn on dual preview to show your subject what the picture will look like, which saves a ton of headache and reduces the tries you need to take to get good pictures.\n* Multitasking is amazing. Dragging and dropping files between different apps, watching videos and scrolling on reddit at the same time, etc.",
