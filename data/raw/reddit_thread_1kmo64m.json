Handheld a switch only goes up to 460mhz max, with most games using  307mhz or 384mhz, but the actual base GPU clock of the chip is 921mhz, which is completely safe for the chip to run at. Anything higher than that is an actual overclock, and a lot of people run around 1300mhz fine.\n\nThermally it's also fine, overclocking the CPU, GPU and RAM with an undervolt still keeps the SOC under 60 degrees, which is pretty cool in the realm of silicon chips.\n\nThe stock switch runs at a high voltage for stability and lower clocks for battery life, but you can lower the voltage quite a bit and up the clocks to get both cooler temps than stock and better performance and battery life at the same time.",

Nintendo did what needed to be done to ensure MKDD was 60fps across the board.  This meant tweaking the LOD/detail/culling a bit to keep that framerate flat even in four player mode.  It was a conscious choice to do the extra work because, like you said, they were still courting the core gamer market and knew they'd be called out for being lazy if they didn't.\n\nObviously not so much when it came to the Wii.\n\nWhen they ported MK8 to the Switch and didn't even fix its most glaring issue when they absolutely could have, I knew it was because the laziness had straight up become part of the company's culture.  I should have taken a bet on how the next Mario Kart would turn out\u2014would have been easy money.",

We can call it \"weakening\" since PC gaming has trucked along and the gap between consoles and PCs has only widened.\n\nThe Switch 2 does _not_ represent an unexpected leap in power from Nintendo\u2014it's pretty much exactly what people expected: _basically-a-portable-PS4,_ or _something-that's-at-least-technically-slightly-better-than-the-three-years-old-Steamdeck._\n\nBut even that modest and expected upgrade in power puts Nintendo back into \"core gaming\" territory, thanks of course to core consoles allowing that to happen.  So what does that mean?  There's no more poignant consequence I can point to than From Software developing their next game as a Switch 2 exclusive.  The gap is closed.\n\nAnd this _may_ behoove Nintendo to begin courting back those gamers, which could in turn enforce changes to their now cultural laziness.

A little relaxing of the geometry demands and they could have put an end to the now ***20 year tradition*** of Mario Kart resorting to 30fps in its party mode.\n\nLike you said, it is _normal_ for developers providing split screen multiplayer to account for what they need to do to make it happen.

Everyone does this, and it's okay, since each subscreen is only getting 1/4th of the FOV from the user's perspective.\n\nNintendo is lazy in that they are unwilling to tweak visuals for 3+ splitscreens like they did before.  This cannot be sugarcoated.  Four player split-screen is not some \"interesting but unnecessary fluff bonus\" when it comes to Mario-freaking-Kart.  It's the way every family who owns a Switch plays these damn games.  But Nintendo just can't be arsed.  Not even when re-releasing MK8, which was already the single laziest cash grab they've ever committed, even if they _had_ magnanimously provided 60fps.",

Digital foundry has been iffy at best with their opinion pieces, especially on hardware that isn\u2019t even released yet.

That would also impact performance, because if it\u2019s not running a switch 1 game that layered OS can be switched off, leaving another free 1-2 gb ram depending.

Like others have said, handheld is sometimes better on the current Switch because rendering the game at 720p is significantly easier.\n\nWith the Switch 2 the question will be how upscaling is utilized.  I assume \"4K\" will actually be 1440 or 1080 upscaled.  Then what happens in handheld mode?  Does it try to run natively at 1080?  Is it 720 upscaled?  I assume upscaled.\n\nSo the question to ask is going to be how much worse do the games look in handheld mode.  On desktop 720 upscaled to 1080 kinda sucks.  Fewer pixels to upscale from, so details get lost.",

They could've done waay better god knows they have the money since they out sale other consoles buut nooo they want more profits just to ship out a better upgrade than the first Switch.  They could be going toe for toe with the other consoles and yeah I get it most of their games aren't that good on the graphical side but still if they have better power than maybe they would also get more games on nintendo.  Damn greedy bastards lol",

It's why the Wii won with its easy to use control scheme for casual markets. It's why the switch won with easy to use handheld and console play. It's why piracy can't actually kill the retro gaming market because buying a subscription or a $10 steam release is more convenient than setting up the emulators yourself and why iTunes saved the music industry from piracy.\n\nLearn the market before angry posting. What you just described is objectively a sure fire way for Nintendo to lose money. Why appease angry redditors when you're showing that they're this incapable of actually learning about the topics they pretend to care about?",
