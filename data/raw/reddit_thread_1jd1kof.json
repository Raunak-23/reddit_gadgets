I work IT support for education in the US, and although phone apps are more flexible and convenient, students have been explicitly allowed to use materials like dictionaries and calculators in some exams, but smartphones are simply never allowed. I have to imagine this significantly propped up these industries. \n\nNow that more districts are moving to issuing Chromebooks to every student, they\u2019re gradually moving towards apps instead. More and more exam suites simply build their own apps into the same software students test in.",
