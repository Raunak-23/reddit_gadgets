I'll also agree that it's a nebulous marketing term at this point, and doesn't always mean much. But it *does* have a meaning - well, two meanings really:\n\n1) \"AI apps\" usually consisting of some multi-step features, wrapped in an LLM\n\n2) An increasingly wide set of parallel processing chip architectures, ISAs, and software libraries that work in novel ways compared to typical single-instruction (and, increasingly, different from previous multiple-instruction) programming techniques. They'll also take advantage of training data like knowledge graphs, when appropriate. These don't necessarily have to manifest within an \"AI app\" to utilize the same processing technology as stuff like Gemini, ChatGPT, etc. Nor do they always need specialized AI hardware like an NPU. Some 70% of all AI processing is performed on the CPU and GPU already - the specialty hardware is just icing on the cake, meant for the most parallel-oriented operations.\n\nI actually interviewed an Arm senior vice president and wrote (what I thought was) a super interesting piece about it, if you want to read a little more :)",

                  "body": "Actually yes, it does work. \n\nFor those that don't know, tinnitus is imaginary. It's the absence of sound, usually due to hearing damage. Your brain thinks \"I should be hearing something at this frequency,\" then it creates that sound. \n\nWe can cancel out a frequency of tinnitus by playing the same frequency at the volume your brain imagines. I have tinnitus at many, many frequencies, and I've been able to test and confirm this with limited success. \n\nThe REAL problem is that there's no easy or convenient way for doctors to tune out complex tinnitus, like mine, at multiple (dozens-to-hundreds of) frequencies without spending hours of work *daily*. And since tinnitus is imaginary, the volume of tinnitus is constantly changing throughout the day. The technology just doesn't exist to dynamically cancel that out.\n\nBut... If you only suffer with one or a few specific frequencies of tinnitus, then yeah, there's something called Notch Therapy. You could also theoretically create tinnitus cancelling hearing aides and adjust the volume yourself.",

                  "body": "Look, I'll explain my objections to your original statement so we're clear about what we're discussing. \n\nThe most common causes of tinnitus are to do with hearing loss, especially in the high frequencies.\n\nThe greatest cause of hearing loss is damage to the hairs in the inner ear, which vibrate according to the frequencies to which they are sensitive, and cause the cells to which they are attached to send signals via the auditory nerve.\n\nSuch hair cells are susceptible to damage from normal aging processes, but also and very very commonly by exposure to loud noise. The cells sensitive to high frequency sound are also more readily damaged by high frequency sound. \n\nSo noise is damaging if it's loud, and much more so if it's loud at high frequency.\n\nWhite noise is equal amounts of actual sound energy across the hearing frequency spectrum, but we are not equally sensitive to every frequency, and so perceptually what we experience is random hissing noise peaking in apparent volume in the broad range of frequencies 1-6khz, with notable sizzle above that and next to nothing in the \"bass\" notes. But perceptual frequency isn't the same as actual sound energy, which is equal in white noise along the spectrum.\n\nAs a source of *hearing damage*, therefore, it's not especially threatening because of its character (it's not primarily high-frequency), but can be dangerous if you crank the shit out of the volume, just the same as anything will be. \n\nSo objection 1 is that there's nothing special about white noise which would make it dangerous other than the volume at which you might choose to listen to it.\n\nObjection 2 is that noise-cancelling headphones aren't cancelling noise using white noise! That would just be masking, no different from playing white noise through any headphones. That's not at all what noise cancelling technology is.\n\nNoise cancelling technology is phase inversion taking the incoming sound (with varying degrees of prediction) and flipping it 180\u00b0 out of phase, and injecting that sound into the audio stream or into the ear. Nothing to do with white noise! \n\nObjection 3 is to do with your claim that it's the \"biggest cause\" for tinnitus, which seems obviously wrong on the face of it, because:\n\nEven if white noise were harmful (it isn't especially), it wouldn't be the biggest cause of tinnitus because most people aren't exposed to it regularly, unlike the known and overwhelmingly more common causes such as loud music, industrial noise (think power tools and machinery), engine noise, age, and more; and, \n\nEven if white noise was the technology used in noise-cancelling headphones (it isn't), it still wouldn't be the biggest cause of tinnitus because the use of such headphones amongst the population is low as a percentage, and *especially miniscule* compared to the percentage exposed to all the other (actual, proven) causes of tinnitus; ***and***,\n\nEven if tinnitus *was* caused by \"white noise from noise cancelling headphones\" (which is to say a not unusually harmful type of sound, found in a device which doesn't generate it), it *still* wouldn't be the biggest cause because tinnitus had been around forever, and noise cancelling headphones are a recent innovation with far from universal adoption.\n\nSo your suggested biggest cause is the wrong thing, in the wrong place, for the wrong amount of time. \n\nI would gently suggest that you've conflated several different bits of information, and that maybe what you meant to say was something along the lines of \"the fastest growing cause of hearing loss, (which may lead to tinnitus), especially amongst the young, is long exposure to music at excessive volume, particularly as delivered through in-ear headphones\"  - which would be true, and there are certainly guidelines and regulations being drawn up and adopted all over the place to address this particular and genuinely serious threat!",
