I'm sure there's something in the pipeline. PlayStation has always gotten exclusive content or timed exclusives.  They used to get CoD exclusive content. \n\nRockstar wants a streamlined experience. Having GTA 6 on old hardware wouldn't make sense. Everything they are working on wouldn't be possible on old consoles. If you look at TT's investor relations you will see that they're doing just fine. GTA is keeping them profitable. They can afford to lose money on other franchises.\n\n\nSony will definitely phase out first party titles for PS4 but third parties are still making games. The last game for PS2 was released in 2013, PES 2014. PlayStation 3 is online to this day. They have no real reason to end support for PS4. They'll still push updates and keep the store up. It has millions of active users. GTA 6 will probably be the game to make people upgrade their consoles.",
