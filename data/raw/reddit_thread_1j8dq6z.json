I'm a consumer. I'm certainly not an enterprise. I would see an advantage to this being available on consumer hardware.\n\nIt's the same as high-end GPUs. A 'standard user' has no need for one but if you're a gamer who wants maximum performance on a high-res display then it can be worthwhile, and that's certainly a consumer use.",

And this is for sequential writes, random writes are way lower.\nMost ssds write at max speed for one or two minutes, then need quite a while to recover, until you can write fast again for two minutes.\nCrystaldiskMark with 1GB test size will not show this behavior, you need much larger test size.",
