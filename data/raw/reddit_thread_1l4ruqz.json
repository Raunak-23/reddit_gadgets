But since the Switch 2 allows save game transfers and old Switch 1 titles, there are plenty of entry points. It's more interesting If the those entry points can reveal more info, like the PS5 utilizes Execute-Only memory for their kernel which makes It difficult to dump the kernel code memory for example.",

I don't care enough about Pokemon to battle online with people, and someone made a homebrew that replicated the effects of Pokemon Home plus enhancements, so if I wanted to use something like that, it was available. The only other game I'd possibly play online was Mario Kart, but even then I'd be more likely to play in-person with friends than online. I simply never needed to ever connect to the Nintendo Network on my Switch.\n\nI know this is my personal experience, and others might feel differently, but I highly doubt that Switch 2 is going to offer anything that I can't live without online play for. If it's online only, I can do without. If you've got custom firmware installed then going online to play games in the first place is kind of a boneheaded move. If they get CFW running on Switch 2 soon, I'd be more than happy to never go online with it ever in exchange for all the extra functions that enables.

For reference, it's a technique that doesn't involve native code execution, but still manages to draw graphics directly to the screen.

I'm using loose terms here for laypeople btw, if somebody is going to harshly critique this.\n\nIt's a firewall where all the protected system activities/functions are behind and they expose secure APIs to the rest of the system so the two sides can interact together.\n\nThe user-side sometimes has *MORE* abilities than it should or the APIs aren't secure enough and you can shoehorn actions that shouldn't be possible.\n\nRegarding the **ROP exploit**, think back to those graphic APIs...imagine an API has a control flow like this (*completely made up example, btw*):\n\n1. Game starts and prompts you for your preferred name with a 40-char limit, \"JoeHacker\", and it then saves it to the user section on disk `username.json`. \n2. Game (user space) calls API using secure key that only the game has, direct from Nintendo during development, so it can receive an auth token to enable sending graphics to the screen. This secure key is the keys to the kingdom but rarely exploited. Instead, they leverage the key to get other things.\n3. Game then retrieves your avatar and name from #1 and sends it to the kernel to display.\n4. **\"Hacker\"** is able to gain access to `username.json` in the less secure user space...perhaps it's saved on a removable SD Card. He puts it in his computer and replaces the content in that file with `40-chars + an exploit immediately after`.\n5. The kernel receives an auth token permitting the content and the \"username\", which is expected to be 40-chars but in reality, is 1000's and is exploit code.\n6. Everything from 41-char+ gets put in memory and is a buffer overrun and inadvertently gets executed.\n\nThey've managed to bypass the security that way.\n\nAgain, this is extremely simplified and I used a bunch of random semi-technical terms.",
