And that is just  afun 30% in 1/2 of the year. This usually takes a year or 2 in planning. Because it could be more than a 30M investment for the year. \n\nAlso include the SW development for the accelerometer + validation. \n\nWe could do the same for the bracket. But they surely analyze this options and many more, and thinking in good faith, the gyro is the cheaper option lol. Potentially because they can use the SW for warranty claims.",

Although, you gotta add it to the hardware design and validate the design, which also would include a new process in the manufacturing, that includes stock and assembly process, process means time, time equals money, also process has to be validated.\n\nAdding one more point, it was hard to find a source for ASUS or an specific GPU, but lets say that during the first half of 2024, 18.2M graphics cards were sold. for fun lets say 30% will have the gyro, that is 5.46M GPUs, 5.46Mx$2.04 = $10.82M. And that is just  afun 30% in 1/2 of the year. This usually takes a year or 2 in planning. Because it could be more than a 30M investment for the year. \n\nAlso include the SW development for the accelerometer + validation. \n\nWe could do the same for the bracket. But they surely analyze this options and many more, and thinking in good faith, the gyro is the cheaper option lol. Just because they can use the SW for warranty claims.",

If you look up the units for gravitational constant, you'll see they are the same as acceleration. An accelerometer can't distinguish between the two as far as I know/seen. However, if an object is resting, you can make a safe assumption which way is down.\n\nYes you can replace a gyro with accelerometers, but the issue with accelerometers is that they are susceptible to forces. This means if you put a 3-axis accelerometer in a car and slam the gas/breaks, the sensed orientation will change. On the other hand, a gyroscope is not susceptible to the forces, it only senses when there are changes in orientation. It doesn't know which way is down, only if it's changed direction. If you had a perfect gyroscope sensor and calibrated it, you could definitely use it for orientation alone. However, sensors are never perfect and they will 'drift', which is why you need an accelerometer/magnetometer to do occasional homing. \n\nFor more on gravitational acceleration:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration",

Absolutely crucial one at that. That card won't operate without that cooling, so you can't really say it is the card plus the cooling, the whole deal is a packet and it won't work any other way. You can even put that PCB and GPU chip into the ice cold lake, ..and now you have cooling as big as a lake, it doesn't really matter what you use to cool it, that cooling mechanism will always have some volume. \n\n\n^^^^^^.\n\n> Alternatively if I liquid cool my GPU I can cut the size and weight down dramatically. \n\nNo you can't :)\nAll you do here is move radiator and fans slightly away from the card, but they are still a part of the whole packet and are frankly almost as big as heatpipe-aircolled ones, sometimes even bigger. \n\n\n^^^^^^.\n\n>My point was more that the PCB doesn\u2019t go all the way to the end of the heatsink anymore\n\nThat is correct, for some time manufacturers started to extend the cooler beyond PCB, which is the best thing that happened to gpu cooling noise-wise since deshrouding and noctua fans. We should do the exact opposite of ISA, because that short PCB and extended cooling allows the air to travel freely through that radiator, doesn't require that much static pressure from the fan, and makes it easier to point that exhaust out of the PC case.",

But I have not seen any recommended modern self-build cases designed for air flow in 20 years (when I started building my own). Possibly because you need to specifically seek a case configured that way. But the fact that GPUs are sold with extra infrastructure indicates a heavier demand for cases that stand vertically, like the one I just bought for my new build. I didn\u2019t see a single horizontal/flat case option at excellent tier or above on logical increments, and there were no alternatives for the standard vertical cases offered on Amazon or Newegg. Hell, it\u2019s more expensive to buy a boring case without flashy RGB (coolest rig at the lan party) shit in it \u2014 but that\u2019s a tangent. \n\nI\u2019ve thought for over a decade that it\u2019s weird that PCMR innards keep getting bigger and cases stay the same relative shape.
