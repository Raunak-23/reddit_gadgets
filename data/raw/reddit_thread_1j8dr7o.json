Right now, the consensus is if you have a Brother, firewall it from the internet ASAP so it doesn't update the firmware and lock out \"unofficial\" printer cartridges.\n\nE: Looks like Brother reached out to Louis Rossman to straighten this out.  Luis originally reported it; said he was told on the phone that his printer was bricked because it wasn't using an \"official\" cartridge.  He's said he'll make a follow-up video once it's all straightened out and what his takeaway is.\n\nIt's mentioned in other places that the report was from \"a clickbaity YouTuber.\" Louis is very big on consumer rights and right-to-repair, and he's all about pushing products that don't pull HP bullshit.  He may have been mistaken or been accidentally locked out, but there's no reason to believe that he's making clickbait videos.  He's worked extremely hard for consumer rights, and he's doing what he thinks is the right thing.",

When I buy ad free Disney+, I don't expect to watch a live sporting event that is from a televised source without ads.  They're not inserting ads into on demand content.  It's live stuff they're ADDING to Disney+.  Shit that wasn't included in the app before. I'm thrilled that I can watch content from ESPN+ on Disney+, but I'm either going to get an ad or 3 minutes of blank, because that actual feed has ads.  When I watch their live ABC News Live channel, it's the feed from ABC.  This is content I'd rather have than not have and I'm glad they're having it, but because people lose their shit at every perceived injustice they have to put out a statement saying that yes, sometimes you might see an ad on certain content.\n\nNetflix has the exact same issue with the WWE Raw event feed, and Max with their live sport feeds.  You're literally watching the TNT feed FOR FREE on Max, without having to have cable.  It's fucking awesome - I can deal with having the same ads I'd have it I had cable or paid for youtube tv for those events.",

He stickied his top comment on his video that Brother has reached out so that they can figure out what happened, and he'll share a video update as soon as it's all figured out.  \n\nIIRC, the cartridge that bricked his computer was working fine until a firmware update, at which point the printer locked him out for \"unsupported\" cartridge, even though it was the same cartridge before the firmware update.  Further, if the firmware/drivers are faulty, you're kinda SOL, because Brother removes previous versions from their site.\n\nIn short, it can very well be a mistake with an update, but I doubt there was any malicious intent by Louis, and I look forward to his update in this matter.",

We were constantly going through ink even though we printed maybe a page a week (I think the constant cleaning contributed to this). The Brother printer just works and has been oddly joyful to print something and have it come out as you'd expect each time.\n\nEDIT: I forgot about the fact that if you are out of color ink, but have full black ink and want to print in B&W, the Epson printer would not let you print. We never printed in color but somehow always used color, so we'd just randomly not be able to print anything until we bought colored ink.",

Can't tell you how many times I've recommended upgrading a piece of equipment because I know for a fact it's going out or is about to be at its end of life, and the powers that be refuse to replace or upgrade because it's working at the moment. Then six months later I get a panicked call that it isn't working, and the exact thing I said is what happened. Only now they're out of productivity because they waited for it to prove me right rather than just take my advice to begin with.\n\nThe problem with companies in particular is that they don't see IT as an investment, they see it as an operating cost. To them, IT expenditure is just a money hole that they don't see a return from, despite that that equipment and the staff to run it are absolutely essential for them to operate competitively. \n\nAs an IT professional I just keep a nice big glass of Toldyaso on my desk to sip out of on a near daily basis.",
