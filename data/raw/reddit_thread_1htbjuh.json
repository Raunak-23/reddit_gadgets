Of course when even DolbyVison is now mastered at 4k nits there is no point of anything more.\n\nAlso, what people don\u2019t realize is the HDR spec ie the PQ gamma curve was designed for very low ambient light.  If you turn off all of the lights and let your eyes adjust on a properly calibrated OLED dark scenes can be pretty good.\n\nThe problem there is: your eyes can perceive 10 orders of magnitude.  But not all at once, and not in rapid succession!  10k nits along with good black levels is pointless unless the top end is used very sparingly and in small specular areas, because it can mess up for low light vision for minutes afterwards.",

For outdoor use, something like 1000 nits would be appropriate. And this argument goes both ways. Your display being too dim for your environment can also cause eye strain.",

It feels like it\u2019s just a step down from OLED.\n\nI bought a 55\u201d TLC Q7 last year (needed the best TV I could find at a certain price point) after months of research and understanding Rting\u2019s (Rtings\u2019?) testing. I also made about a dozen trips to Walmart, Target, and BestBuy *just to look at the TVs*.\n\nOmitting OLED technology, the only upgrades I see that may be financially feasible are the Hisense U8, or TLC Q8. The super high-end Samsung and LG TVs are off the table completely for me, but at that price point I might as well just buy an OLED.\n\nI know nobody asked, but one of my biggest pet peeves is when people only care about the size of a TV and not the performance.\n\nI have a measly 55\u201d Q7 and the picture is *way* better than a 75\u201d entry-level Samsung or LG TV on the floor at WalMart lmao. Some of my relatives have these massive TVs and they\u2019re always in shock when they see the picture on my budget TV.

The reason is because for the average PC/console of the current generation, developers will pick a target framerate (e.g. 30/60/120) and maximize visual fidelity with the hardware budget in mind. Developers would sooner double texture resolution, LOD distance, poly count, etc. long before anyone could get the chance to take advantage of such high fps. (This holds true because low/minimum settings continue to creep up. You simply can't play some current games even on \"flagship\" hardware of long past.)\n\nModern AAA games nowadays can barely manage to break 4k 100fps at high settings on 4090 builds, and that's with frame generation. And even playing those same games at 1080p you seldom see >200fps.",

As such, the higher refresh rate does consistently produce higher scores for me. I suspect it's just in how the game renders more frames and thus is more accurate in handling mouse movements, control presses, and score calculations. This would be because both mouse acceleration and scores are calculated on a per frame basis in the game, so more frames = more data points = higher accuracy and less interpolation. That's a very niche benefit though and it's not why I bought the 480hz capable display in the first place.",

At some point you're rendering every possible pixel position for an object's movement.\n\nMore practically, even the highest end graphics cards currently available aren't able to render high quality graphics at 600 FPS or 750 FPS.",

In blind tests people get less and less reliable at determining which is higher, like above 144 it's already not great.

But in the end, it's all subjective, so that's what matters really.  What they subjectively experience.\n\nI'm not arguing the human eye can't distinguish the difference at all btw...

              "body": "Refresh rate is only a single factor in motion clarity. Response time and image persistence are just as important, but often ignored by consumers. \n\nThe first 240hz monitors were not much better than 120/144hz monitors in motion clarity due to having slow response times. This gave rise to the idea that 240hz is only a bit better than 144hz, but a more accurate statement is that 240hz with ~6ms total response time is only a bit better than 144hz ~8ms response time. When you see the full picture, it's not surprising that there isn't a huge improvement, because the response times barely got better and the image persistence is still nowhere near good. Some monitors tried to improve image persistence but almost all of them run into problems with crosstalk and brightness.\n\nSame thing happened to the first 360hz monitors.\n\nBut with 480hz monitors it was different. Some weren't a big improvement, but with the proliferation of OLED, there was eventually a 480hz OLED monitor. The 0.1ms response times of OLED were a *huge* leap forward for motion clarity compared to IPS and TN, which peaked at 3-4ms at the fastest. For the first time in over a decade, there was a large improvement in two areas required for motion clarity instead of just one, and it's once again a night and day difference between 480hz OLED with 0.1ms response time and 240hz IPS with 6ms, like switching from 60 to 120.\n\n480hz OLED is amazing, like looking through a window, but it's not perfect yet. It has fast enough response time for sure, and arguably enough refresh rate for what CPUs can reasonably achieve in real games right now, but those monitors are all still sample and hold displays with image persistence of around 2ms. That's still 2px of motion blur at 1000px/sec movement. Good but ideally we'd have 0.5ms persistence. \n\nTo answer your question, it depends on the other 2 numbers. A hypothetical 200hz display with <0.1ms response times and <0.5ms image persistence would have you begging for higher refresh rate because you could clearly see the choppiness. [Probably all the way up to 500-800hz](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep07861). But a 750hz TN monitor that still has a hypothetical 2ms response time will not give the improvement you'd hope for from the 50% fps jump, plus there's practically no games where you can hold a stable 750fps in actual combat.\n\nMore stuff on [blurbusters](https://www.testufo.com/ghosting) and [aperturegrille](https://www.aperturegrille.com/software/).\n\nOh and all the manufacturer response time labels are useless. Response time is not strictly defined, so they can put whatever they want on there. A monitor may have some 'transitions' that are indeed 1ms, but it doesn't matter when their definition of a 'transition' is horribly incomplete and this number only applies to a specific transition.",

                          "body": "This is an oversimplification, but the reason pro players use strange resolution is so they can stretch the aspect ratio. Most common is to play 4:3 stretched onto 16:9 or to play boxed in then stretched 16:10. This allows player models to be wider and blockier making it easier to place your crosshair onto them. If you know much about video resolutions you will know this means part of your screen is cut off, but in reality this ends up not mattering with how high level CS is played. You have to manually clear or account for every angle with utility, so if a player was in your 4:3 stretched cutoff zone it usually doesn't matter that you didn't see them because they already killed you, and the wider effective FOV would not have made a difference because your crosshair placement was off. \n\nIf you haven't played much CS or Valorant this likely sounds insane but trust me, it does make a difference. I was nowhere near pro but did play around 2000 hours of CSGO in high school and played in several tournaments, and was lucky enough to play against some actual pros a few times. CS is often just seen as a more serious cod but the games are dramatically different. Most CS pros have a seemingly absurd setup that they use to maximize every theoretical advantage that makes it difficult for outsiders to review products aimed at professionals. Because of this its difficult to review products targeted at them.",

You can CLEARLY see individual cursors on 540hz just wiggling your mouse around on the desktop, its the easiest fucking test that anyone can do, you can do it right now. 60hz monitor? tell me you couldnt fit 10 more cursors in between the afterimages and still be able to pick them out; you can easily move the mouse fast enough to make gaps that 100+ would fit between. The fastest monitors still dont have anywhere near the motion smoothness and clarity as standing outside in the sun and waving your hand around. Going from 540 to 240 is extremely noticeable. \n\nNot to mention latency where humans can detect <1ms of input lag reliably in some scenarios, such as dragging cursor around. Even if it wasnt perceivable the latency still exists, 1ms faster photons hitting your eyes is a 1ms headstart in your ooda loop. Maybe its .001% improvement and completely overkill for the average person but why shouldnt we aim to remove as much technical variance as possible. \n\nSome people for a study were able to reliably detect flicker >900Hz\n\nIm sure sensitivity to all these things is trainable to a degree as well, think of all the athletes and musicians with incredible timing and visual processing skills, the average persons skill in these areas are so far below what is possible, you dont need much to survive in day to day life.",

CRT monitors use an electron beam to \"scan\" (or activate) the phosphors of the display, which draws each frame. these phosphors only stay on as the beam is scanning the display, and turn off\u00a0immediately after they're scanned,\u00a0somewhere in the microsecond range. this completely eliminates any persistence blur and allows for perfect motion clarity *even at 160hz*.\u00a0\n\n\nwhat this all means is that even with four times the refresh rate (480hz) and band-aid solutions to persistence blur, we still aren't quite at the level of motion clarity that CRTs were at over 20 years ago. it will likely take a new technology (like microled) for us to achieve this, but that's a long ways off.",

That's how they actually created color palette, since the pixels can only be either on or off. Using PWM (and dithering/halftoning) with each pulse having a different weight, you can create shades of grey and colors. 10 and 14 subfields between Panasonic and Pioneer can't be directly compared, since they use different drive methods. It's just a basic description, there is so much more going on It's crazy.\n\nThey were always 60 Hz panels that can do 96 Hz only when they detect a 24p signal. The motion is so crisp because each frame is made of 10 or 14 subfields, so there is no perceived motion blur, but phosphor trails is still a bit of a problem.",
