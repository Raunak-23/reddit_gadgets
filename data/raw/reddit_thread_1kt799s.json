They tried to do VR when it\u2019s a niche use case without supporting anything the people currently using VR platforms actually use VR for and without adopting the already existing VR standard for interoperability. I knew that would be DOA from the moment it was announced without any support for steam VR or any existing VR infrastructure.\n\nIf they can make good form factor AR glasses? They\u2019d be one of the first to market and knowing Apple, they wouldn\u2019t take this to market unless they actually had a platform designed whereas the handful of AR glasses on the market are extremely limited and have almost no functionality beyond like 1-2 features. If they could partner with prescription glass makers and qualify for a discount with insurance they\u2019d have a very large market who\u2019d probably spend the extra money for apple glasses.",
