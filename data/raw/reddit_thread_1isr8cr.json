AKA slave wages. \n\nMore info about penal labor in the US: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penal_labor_in_the_United_States\n\nUnder the 13th amendment to the US constitution, slavery and involuntary servitude are prohibited, except as punishment for a crime. \n\nThe person you replied to made that comparison because legally, it quite literally is \u201cactual slavery\u201d.",

Believe me, I\u2019m well acquainted with a hard day\u2019s work, shitty pay, and the concept of volunteering. There\u2019s a difference between giving back to society by volunteering vs working manual labor/factory jobs. I still think they should be paid minimum wage, or even 75% of it at the very least. That\u2019s $15k/yr before taxes, assuming they\u2019re working 40 hours, 52 weeks a year. They ain\u2019t making millions, even if they\u2019re not paying rent.

The fab technology Apple uses in their 3nm processors is exclusive to TSMC in Taiwan and is a trade secret. Even Apple doesn't know how to do it, not that they actually manufacture anything. They design circuitry and components that are made by subcontracted manufacturing partners and assembled by other manufacturing partners. The same is true of Samsung and their 4nm and 5nm processes. There's no chip fab in the US that can duplicate this.\n\nAccording to one analysis I saw, if something like an iPhone ProMax was actually manufactured here, in the US, the end cost to the \"consumer\" would be on the order of $50k. Obviously only the super-rich could afford these devices and they wouldn't be made in large numbers.",

They're also under investigation for actually lying about the level of American \"content\" in their products. And you're right, they sell an inferior product that competes poorly against imported products with better specifications. I would personally dispute the idea that a company that simply assembles imported parts is actually a \"manufacturer\", they're really just an assembler.",
