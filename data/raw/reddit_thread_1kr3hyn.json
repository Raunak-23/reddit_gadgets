My cheap 55\" LG 13 years ago was so much better to interact with. Modern LGs are no stellar UX specimens but at least they're not infuriating to interact with. It shocks me that no one talks about how insanely bad the Samsung UI is.\n\nAnd yes, having no Dolby Vision (or DTS) but including gsync is insane.",
