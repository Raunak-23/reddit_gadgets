Their trackers have an IP rating though, instead of \"trust us bro, they're waterproof\". Tractive also uses 4G/LTE networks, instead of whistle 2G. Even in areas of good reception a Whistle tracker would take 3-5 minutes to report it's position if your dog was out of range of your home Wi-fi.",

Been using it for years to keep tabs on a stray cat we kind of take care of and on foster dogs just in case we get one that tries to escape the fence. They've generally been pretty reliable, had one tracker stop working over the course of 3 years but we have the higher subscription tier which means they'll replace the tracker once per year if something happens to it so it didn't cost us extra. Sometimes the app struggles to connect to the tracker for live tracking but that might be more because of being in a semi-rural area.",

My family has a total of six different dogs with trackers, all with their subscriptions starting and stopping at different times. Switching would have meant $500ish in trackers using multiple apps for a couple years while subscriptions run out, our abandoning subscriptions and wasting that money \n\nThis is perfect for us. We get new trackers without spending the money, and the subscriptions are just transferred over to tractive.\n\nI have no idea if tractive trackers or the app are better, I've never used them, I'm happy with how the transfer has gone so far.  I had all six trackers ordered and subscriptions transferred in about 10 minutes.  The new trackers haven't arrived yet, so I can't speak to how well they work. Their specs are much better and I'm hopeful though.",

(though physically they are a bit large for my taste).  There are a couple features the whistle had that tractive doesn't, but personally I think the tractive feature lineup is better. I'm sure others would disagree.  If I remember right, I'm trading whistle tracking how much my dog drinks, for tractive having bark monitoring and heart rate monitor. \n\nAnd instead of just throwing them away, taking them to an e waste recycler seems like a better idea to me",
