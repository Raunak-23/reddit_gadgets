Their actual strategy to compete seems to be to get as much training-data as possible to catch up with the big boys. (In this particular area.)",

I have probably 8 googles homes of varying models (mini, home hub, normal size), multiple google cameras, the nest learning thermostat, the doorbell, etc. While they haven't \"crashed and burned\" the quality of service certainly has. Every Google home I have randomly activates at random times, sometimes in dead silence. My cameras continually have connection issues even though I've spent a fortune on my home network, ensuring there's no dead zones anywhere. I just recently made a post over on r/Hue about how my google homes have all seemingly forgotten how to control my lights correctly. If I weren't so heavily invested, I'd love to switch to a different smart home setup, but I have huge issues with Amazon just enabling their sidewalk function and it being opt out instead of in.\n\nEdit: The crash and burn comment made by separatespend may be in reference to google discontinuing their nest security system but I believe that was done around the time they decided to partner with ADT. I have a ring security system, but haven't used it since offloading all of my ring cameras since it was found out that ring employees were watching camera streams when they shouldn't have been.",

They abandoned products and stopped updating the firmware so now the systems don\u2019t work right and Google shows no signs of investing in the ecosystem. It used to be competitive if not superior to most smart home systems on the market but now it\u2019s barely usable since it lacks reliability, which is a key feature for something you give control of your home. \n\nUnfortunately, smart home systems aren\u2019t something you can just replace like a phone. So you get stuck with a bunch of cameras that no longer work that you bought to integrate with your Nest (yes I speak from experience).\n\nMy advice to anyone thinking about setting up a smart home: don\u2019t use Google. They don\u2019t support their products and you\u2019ll be stuck with thousands of dollars of junk.",
