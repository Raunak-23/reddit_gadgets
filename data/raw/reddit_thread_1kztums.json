              "body": "kind of the opposite.\n\nthe US banned lead in drinking water plumbing in the safe drinking water amendments of 1986.  most locations stopped using pure lead pipes far, far before that and this ban only made the tiny trace amounts in brass fittings illegal.  pretty much all water in the US has dissolved mineral content and those minerals will deposit very solidly on fresh metal surfaces like lead or copper, if your water is particularly hard this can be in as little as a month.\n\nwater gets lead leached into it primarily through corrosion and the mineral lining prevents that corrosion.  The prime risk is the lack of flowing water combined with the water being too soft and too acidic is the highest risk for that happening.  That is why most states have the EPA and/or health department advising that it you have 80s plumbing or earlier that you should flush your tap for 3-5 minutes before you first use the water for drinking or cooking for the day.\n\nFlint and Pittsburg made their water acidic.  when water that is acidic sits in the pipe unmoving it very slowly dissolves whatever it is in contact with.  for the first weeks or months this is the mineral deposits, after that it is the lead.  when you wake up in the morning and have your first glass of water eventually the trace amounts of lead rise above the level present in the water naturally.\n\nYou cannot completely avoid lead, even without manmade sources it is present in the natural environment, but it has significant and long lasting effects in relatively low levels so minimizing unnecessary exposure where practical is important to consider, but in most cases there is not all that much more risk with normal water if nothing is being worked on in the system.",

Depending on where you live in the US, municipal water can obtain many contaminants. Arsenic, chlorine, and mercury are used to \"kill\" bacteria at large scale for some water districts, but you don't want to drink those. Fluoride is also common in municipal water, which is great for tooth enamel support but like mouth wash you don't want to drink that outright either. And this is before we even mention lead or hexavalent chromium levels. Don't trust the bare minimum by local governments to make municipal water a slow poison. \n\nFood for thought, you not only drink tap water but when you shower or bathe your largest organ (skin) absorbs it, then if it's a hot shower like some enjoy or you have a mist setting on your shower head you are also breathing it in. Bottled water is also an OK workaround, but never forget microplastic leeching happens to EVERY plastic bottle. Get your water comprehensively tested. Eco Water is one company that will do it for free. I do not work for Eco Water. Don't do this for me, do it for YOU and your loved ones.",
