I paid 600 dollars for a 1080 7 years ago. The equivalent card tier (4080) has almost *doubled* in price in that short amount of time.\n\nTaking trump at his word, the incoming tariffs will also cause those prices to go up even more. There is also another crypto bubble on the horizon. Pretty much every tech insider and hobbyist is saying that this is probably your last chance to get any kind of deal before prices start going up, and that it's better to splurge on a 40 series now rather have to wait through another 2017-2022 bad market while hoping the prices eventually come down.",

There was a sale, plus I got them to price match and there was a cash back reward through rakutan and newegg. Plus I didn't have to pay tax, I may have, who knows. Plus it came with a code for a game I was already going to buy. But still a top of the line gpu msrp was $700 and I'm proof back in the day you could essentially get 20% off that. \n\n$700 doesn't even get you a 4070ti super. I guess if you account for inflation it lines up 700 bucks back then is equivalent to 900 now. But it still feels shitty that spending the same equivalent money doesn't yield a same equivalent tier item. I'm aware a 4070ti super is going to be about twice as good as a 1080ti in most applications so it kinda evens out.\n\nI guess I'm just stuck on the fact that 700 bucks used to get you top of the line. Now the equivalent gets you 3rd/4th from the top depending on how you look at the super variants and the Chinese only models.",

They were already doing this before the pandemic when the 2080 was an extra 100$ compared to the 1080, when it was only like 15% better and sometimes even less than that. They got a lot of shit for that but it apparently meant nothing because the graphics card market is a duopoly and Nvidia controls more and more of it every year. \n\n\nHonestly though It's just a weird time to be alive in general, even excluding PC prices. I definitely do think It's a crime though that you can't build an excellent gaming PC for 500 dollars anymore.",

Linux **gamers** as a crowd are free testing. They value the latter not the former. So in a perverse way they're incentivized to throw their most buggy shit at the Linux desktop and see what sticks, because they know Linux users do good software testing.\n\nAMD/ATI have always had buggy drivers, on both Linux and Windows. It's just how they roll. They release buggy drivers and take very long to fix them. They eventually manage to get them to a good state by the time their next gen cards come out.\n\nIf you're on RX580 it's understandable why you think AMD is the bee's knees but if you'll pick up a recent card you'll be in for a surprise.\n\nI wish Intel didn't take after either of them but unfortunately it seems they've decided to go with AMD's \"release early, release buggy\" approach.\n\nEdit: If you want my recommendation, for Linux get a *previous gen* AMD card (something that's been out for at least 1 year). Intel cards may be cheap but still need some time in the oven.",

They're definitely pretty competitive here. \n\nThe main thing is that intel needs to work on their driver support. They are starting to look like a serious competitor with this card which is a good thing. Nvidia has been inflating their GPU prices since before the pandemic (the 20 series price increase vs the 10 series was disgusting) so even if this doesn't force nvidia to stop price gouging at the very least we will finally have a good budget GPU vendor again.",
