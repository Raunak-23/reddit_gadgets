Once there it's then trivial to also let you adjust the gimbal that way.\n\nI can imagine it's quicker than using arrow buttons on the remote. E.g. when you do that it will normally only move slowly on a single axis and ramp up if you hold the button. With the accelerometers it's essentially point at the middle of the screen, push the button, move to pointing where you want the screen to be. For large movements it can start moving quickly and along two axis immediately.",

Alternatively home users may have one they pull out of a cupboard for movie nights (one of the marketing pics for the N1S has it on a bed projecting on a ceiling).\n\nYou could still set it up manually but that either involves fiddling around with screw based adjustors or significant size/weight and being a PITA for a user with something friction based. This also looks more professional when your sales team are setting it up as the conference starts to kick off.",

BYD had been selling about 500k cars a year just China for nearly a decade by 2020, and it was their investment in vertical integration,  battery production, and pivoting their ENTIRE model line to PHEV and EV (and somehow also vans,  pickups, luxury sedans and shooting brakes, hardcore offroad SUVs, urban super minis, even a hypercar) which produced that explosive sales success. \n\nThe Chinese market is huge,  sure, but BYD still had to go out compete a dizzying array of rival carmakers to take those 4 million annual sales from them. In what other market in the world would one be forced to go against VW, Buick, Ford, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Hyundai, Kia, Citroen, Mazda, Mitsubishi, all at once PLUS the major domestic Chinese automakers including SAIC (MG), FAW, Changan, Dongfeng, Geely, Chery, BAIC, and then PLUS all the startup EV makers including Tesla, Nio, Xpeng, Li Auto, Leapmotor, Huawei, and now even the red hot Xiaomi. \n\nBYD took them ALL on, and some of those other carmakers with up to 100 years of carmaking history have been squeezed out of the Chinese market (Suzuki, Renault, Mitsubishi) and some are on their death door (Ford, Mazda, Subaru, Hyundai-Kia), and most are bleeding heavily (VW, GM, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, SAIC, FAW etc), because BYD has taken marketshare from them all. \n\nAs for support from the government,  well the government supports ALL carmakers,  so it isn't like BYD is getting special treatment. Even Tesla is receiving huge amounts of local government subsidies. Also don't forget BYD merely gets subsidy support, all the joint venture carmakers getting their ass beat by BYD (FAW-VW, SAIC-GM, GAC-Toyota, Changan-Ford, Beijing-Hyundai etc) are literally OWNED (well 51% owned) by the government. \n\nNow not only is BYD literally dropping nearly a billion dollars to buy their own fleet of transport ships, but are also simultaneously building factories all around the world in Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey, Brazil, Hungary, and likely Mexico too. It isn't unreasonable to forsee BYD going after the top 3 global automakers (VAG, Toyota, Hyundai-Kia) perhaps in as soon as 3 or 4 years from now.",

I'm not sure about the other chinese brands, but the cheapest EV you can get in other markets is probably the Nissan Leaf which is a tiny car that still costs $30k.\n\nTime will tell the long term, but obviously if they can keep their prices at half of their competition they will sell a lot of cars.",

Tesla has had to lower their price multiple times over the past couple of years to maintain sales volume in China, etc.\n\nBut BYD can out produce and out price all of them, even in China, and still do it while making a profit,  which is why they are such an industry juggernaut currently.",

Even in 2023 100\" TVs were still $6k.\n\nHaving had a projector for half of a decade I can say it's an amazing experience and most of the drawbacks didn't have an alternative when I bought it. That said, when this kicks the bucket, I might have more choices! And given that oled changed the name of the contrast and quality game... You might be right.\n\nThe one thing I will say with a projector, there's no big heavy screen that your friends and children can break, haha.",

If you have a dedicated light controlled room, the Mexigo plus its bundled 120 inch ALR screen is still the best bang for the buck because it is under $3000 and an UST type projector is relatively easy to install. \n\n120\" OLED (or microLED or whatever the next gen panel is)  would certainly be the best,  but that size screen will probably still be unaffordable even when this Nexigo needs replacing 5-7 years from now.",
