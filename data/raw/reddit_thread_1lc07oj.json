It's basically every example of anything ever being called a cyborg.\n\nResistance isn't futile because the enemy can talk despite having ALS either. It is *extremely commonly* used to mean \"enhanced\".\n\nIn fact, [it's part of the origin of the term:](https://web.mit.edu/digitalapollo/Documents/Chapter1/cyborgs.pdf)\n\n>For the exogenously extended organizational complex functioning as an integrated homeostatic system unconsciously, we propose the term \u201cCyborg.\u201d\n\nSo if both the originators of the term use it to mean an extension of existing ability, rather than an assistive device for those with disability, and also that's almost universally how it's used in all other circumstances, then...I think there *is* something to say that it can't be worse.",
