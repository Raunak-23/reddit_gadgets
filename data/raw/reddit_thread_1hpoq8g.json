Everyone has their preferred curvature, but traditionally displays are mostly stuck at a specific curve. This will allow people to just pick their own curve, no more if a display hits all the correct spots for you, but the curve is too far off from your preference.",

The whole point of it bending at 5k(Ultrawide) is it's actually wide enough to warrant it. \n\nFor example if you wanted to watch a show on a loveseat/ sofa, you would keep the monitor flat as you're farther away. And at 45 inches it's not too small for that. \n\nWhen you want to get serious at some gaming you bend the display, sit closer, and now with the display bent the screen is closer to your eyes and appears smaller and is more immersive.",

In September, the company started displaying full-screen ads on its idle televisions.\n\nGiven this shift, it wouldn't surprise me if LG's future products refused to operate if they weren't able to connect to their ad servers.\n\nGoing a step further, I can envision a scenario where LG partners with local TV stations to carve out low-bandwidth subchannels to broadcast nothing but ad information over the airwaves.  LG's TVs would automatically look for and tune into these channels to download ad content to present to you the next time you turn the TV on.",
