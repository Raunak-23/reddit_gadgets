If the phone is at risk of starting on fire due to the battery a free battery replacement or a generous counter offer to get you to replace your battery or phone are reasonable responses, and it would be arguably worse for them to give you the YOLO button. There's no reason for them to give you a completely new phone to replace a 4 (or in the case of the 4a 6) year old device.\n\n\nI'm not sure why in this scenario you're worried about your phone getting spied on - you actually can factory reset the thing and it will be effectively scrubbed. In fact for the most part simply powering it off completely will be just as effective if you have a decent passcode. In fact, you even have another option that lets you keep the phone, restores functionality, and lets you maintain custody - take the cash option, buy a replacement battery and replace it yourself.",

User data is stored encrypted and the only way to get it unencrypted is to use the security chip on the phone and feed it your unlock code. The unlock code then decrypts the decryption key for data on your phone. When you factory reset your phone it deletes that decryption key entirely and the memory chips store data that is indistinguishable from random bits.",

      "body": "Ars is doing a propaganda-bit for another manufacturer who sees google as a competitor (read: Apple), and they're succeeding as well.\n\nThe pixel6a, like literally all phones on the market at this point, uses a lithium polymer battery. They will not catch on fire and burn your house down (the organic lithium ion batteries also do not do that any more, and haven't for a decade - unless you actually light them on fire and damage the cells). There's basically no way to bypass the regulator for the battery discharge effect without shorting it out. But Ars seem incabable of actually mentioning this in any of their several articles about this.\n\nI'm sure it is possible to make most phones, including the pixel, way too hot by charging it full effect as you discharge the battery by accident through inadvertently running some app forever, or an update hanging itself or something like that. Where the combined effect from the charging and the processor burn will end up torching something, which then in turn flashes and causes damage.\n\nBut the battery itself is not the problem. With this phone, or with any other phone on the market. But Ars just doesn't know, I guess, like a good mercenary.",

          "body": "Lithium batteries work by moving lithium atoms from one electrode through a membrane to another electrode. Depending on the chemistry and manufacturing process, the lithium can deposit into spike shapes over time, and if the spikes grow through the membrane and make contact from both sides they'll act as a tiny short.\n\nIt might only be a very small short at first, with a tiny amount of current, but it reduces their effective capacity and causes the battery to drain over time on its own. This means the battery gets discharged and recharged faster, causing a feedback loop that grows a tiny wire to a more significant internal short that's fully capable of igniting the battery.\n\nDue to the microscopic engineering and precision metallurgy required, it's impossible to prevent this from happening 100% of the time. It's entirely possible that the Pixel 6a's battery happened to use a bad batch of electrodes/membranes/whatever. \n\nIt would take inspecting every crevice of every battery with an atomic microscope to prevent it, and that simply can't happen at scale, so we'll have to settle for 99.9%.\n\nMind you, my Pixel 6a has been running just fine.
