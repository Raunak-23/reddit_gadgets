The Quick Menu in 11 is really nice when you customize it and when you're used to simply typing the first couple letters of whatever you want to do and hitting enter.\n\nThat said, I realize I'm not necessarily the general consumer experience, because I'm running W11 Pro and not Home, and it's been ingrained in me over the years to turn off all the telemetry, including doing some registry edits. The entire process only takes like 30mins on initial setup and I don't even think about it again.\n\n(Not that I'm condoning MS releasing 24H2 in the state it's in, but IMHO life is too short for me to waste many brain cycles on stuff like that.

So if you will be retiring that by 2028 or something, you don't even need to worry about it.",
