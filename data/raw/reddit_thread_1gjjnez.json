Competition is a good thing and currently things are tilting towards one company in both CPU and GPU space. \n\nAMD has the high end desktop CPU market and Intel blundered themselves out of it. \n\nNvidia got the GPUs and AI accelerators. And they seem quite content to ask more and more ridiculous prices, while limiting features to new products. Because the 4080 and 4090's primary competition are the 3080 and 3090.",

Earlier today I disabled Banner in BIOS, and forced it to run on Gen 3 PCIE, and I did get more stability, less sputters, and no crash in the 30 minutes I was able to play...  but that's why I'm having such a hard time.  I'm older with a full life and I simply don't have time to troubleshoot all this crap.  I'm lucky to get 2-5 hours a week to game.  Spending hours to troubleshoot takes WEEKS, if not months.",
