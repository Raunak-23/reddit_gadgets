Reality is much more reflective of a hodgepodge of every cyberpunk and dystopian novel people have read than anything even close to resembling a hopeful future.",

Technology has not been used for the benefit of the common person, it's used to profile us and either sell us stuff we don't need or rank us on the likelihood of breaking some law. Facial recognition is bad enough - police are deploying that without oversight and just dragnet-scanning public places. The right to anonymity in public is being eroded - if you walk down the street minding your own business and don't meet anybody you know, you should be forgotten, not have your exact movements logged in a database for years and brought up by a random warrantless search. Because this is what actually happens. Even my local store has implemented facial scanning on entry - which makes me feel like a criminal every time I walk in there, because they're automatically suspecting me as a shoplifter.\n\nTechnology is not our saviour, it has become our oppressor.",

The benefits you see are for two reasons only: to fuel capitalism, and to protect the people in power. As such tech impacts have been incredibly uneven as the digital divide erupted into existence, then expanded quickly. Today the surveillance state has grown to such a degree that, as the previous commenter said, you are tracked almost everywhere and the footage is stored and can be processed years later.\n\nAs one example, I just spent six months doing digital verification on a case for someone who has been wrongly jailed for two years so far. I went through hours of footage and an exhaustive amount of work to prove the video did not show what the prosecution claimed it did. A motion has been filed to submit this new evidence, but there is no guarantee a judge will review it. A man who is absolutely not guilty is sitting in jail for an unknown length of time because of the false belief that the camera doesn't lie, ignoring the fact that people do.\n\nThe surveillance state is not in the public's best interest.",
