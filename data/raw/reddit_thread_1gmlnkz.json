Your phone is busy decrypting the data required to display your Home Screen.\n\nWhen everything is still encrypted in memory and storage it makes it easier to bypass the Lock Screen protections entirely. Both in terms of unlocking the phone and in terms of accessing data without unlocking it first. Anything decrypted and loaded into short-term memory can be accessed by forensic investigators, and exploits can be utilized to attempt to make the phone load specific desirable information into memory. Even with the phone locked it still loads and displays information related to incoming notifications, for example.",
