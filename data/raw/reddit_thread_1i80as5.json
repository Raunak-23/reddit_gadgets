So 4x more light per pixel but at the expense of the resolution. Unless you are outside in a well lit daylight, or in a well lit studio, quality of the 4x images are better than what you get with the full res. In well lit environments smaller pixels do work well. I have tested some 100+ MP phone cameras and they are pretty impressive in the right scenarios. iPhones have up to 48 MP. More pixels *can* actually be more beneficial, even when they become smaller. Daylit scenery with a camera stand, for instance. Or some mega-lit facotry settings in a production line for quality control.",

          "body": "You\u2019re getting downvoted, but you\u2019re not wrong. A sensor\u2019s dynamic range is fundamentally limited by its physical characteristics: size, pixel pitch, and pixel density. Smaller pixels can capture fewer photons during a given exposure, which results in less dynamic range (since there\u2019s less data per pixel to work with). Granted, things like BSI are significant improvements over standard CMOS, but they still don\u2019t defy physics - you can only get so much information in a single pixel, so the larger the pixel the more data you have to work with.\n\nFor example, I own several Canon cameras with different sensor sizes: an original EOS-1D Mark I with a 4 MP APS-H sensor, a Rebel XSi with a 12 MP APS-C sensor, and an EOS 5D Mark III with a 22 MP full-frame sensor. Of these, the 1D produces the best raw dynamic range because its pixels are significantly larger. However, this comes at the cost of resolution\u2014while I can get a good 20x24 print from the 1D, anything larger starts to look grainy. On the other hand, the shadows and highlights in the 1D\u2019s raw files are noticeably more detailed and recoverable compared to the 5D Mark III, even without any post-processing in Lightroom.\n\nThat being said, one of the biggest advancements in camera technology over the past decade has been in \u201ccomputational\u201d and in-camera processing. Modern cameras can extract far more dynamic range and detail than older models with similar or even larger sensors. While there are physical limitations to what can be achieved with small pixels or compact sensors, the software and processing that occur between capturing an image and saving it have become so advanced that sensor size and pixel density are less critical than they used to be.\n\nI\u2019ve taken images with my iPhone 16 Pro Max, which has a sensor much smaller than any of my APS-C cameras. Thanks to \u201ccomputational photography\u201dmulti-frame stacking and advanced HDR (basically, on-device Lightroom), the dynamic range and resolution is almost always  comparable to what I get from a consumer DSLR. But that\u2019s the result of processing inside the iPhone, not the sensor itself. But there are times when even really powerful software can\u2019t compensate for things like very low light; I would argue that larger sensors still have a clear advantage due to their ability to capture more light and produce cleaner images.",

              "body": "The point you don\u2019t address in your comment is that this matters on a *per-pixel* level but doesn\u2019t matter all that much for that global image. Combining multiple pixel into bigger groups will produce very similar results unless the pixel pitch is already on the extremely small size where absolute limits of (current!) technology become more and more important.\nOverall sensor size plays the much bigger role because that determines how much information can be collected. In an ideal world, it\u2019s just 100% transparency from there aka. trying to lose as little of it as you can. Some examples (regarding noise, not DR because it\u2019s easier to tell) you can easily validate using online samples:\n- Full frame sensors outperform APS-C sensors with the same pixel (or smaller) pitch (a7R4/5, a6700, various M43 low MP cams)\n- Full frame sensors with vastly different pixel pitches perform similarly (a7R4/5, a7 4, a7S3)\n\nBasically: sensor size scales almost perfectly, while pixel pitch just shifts the equation a bit (regarding noise).\nIt\u2019s a similar story with DR but there we cannot just quadruple a full frame sensor and immediately get a whole stop more DR.",

          "body": "It depends entirely on what your use case is and what focal length you are imaging at. Remember, this is not a consumer grade sensor.\n\nTo be more specific and give a real example, consider astrophotography. A sensor with a wide angle lens may be undersampled, because any single star doesn\u2019t cover enough photosites (pixels are in screens, not sensors) to get good resolution. That same sensor with a long focal length could be oversampled, because the star covers more photosites than it needs to for good resolution. It\u2019s a balance that you need, not just the smallest or biggest pohotosites. \n\nIn this example, you\u2019d want smaller photosites with the short focal length, and bigger photosites for the long focal length. There is no \u201cbest\u201d size. It is very subjective.",
