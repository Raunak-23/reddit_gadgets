Turning a total loss into a still profitable product.\n\nSome APU/SOCs (combined CPU and GPU chips) may have faulty GPU cores due to silicon failures, so those areas can be disabled and the rest of the chip sold purely as a CPU. You can buy AMD systems which are essentially PS5's but the chips only work as CPUs. The 4700S.",

So if a 8 core CPU has a faulty core or two, they get locked off and it is sold the same as the 6 core member of the family. Which in turn would get sold as the budget 4 core if that had a faulty core or two. There will be *thousands* failing from every yield and getting knocked down to the lower version. And Chips may indeed have different locked off cores, but the internal logic of the chip is just set to ignore them, 2 and 3 don't work? Then use 1,4,5,6,7,8 and display as a 6-core.\n\nOr all the cores work, but are *slightly* flawed and don't clock as high, so that gets sold as a non-overclockable slower version. This can effect the end user if they are into overclocking etc. Your chip might become unstable with a tiny overclock, while your mate with the exact same chip can get an extra Ghz with ease. We calling that winning/losing the silicon lottery.\n\nSo an I7 would become an I5, or a high clocked 7600K, would become a locked lower speed 7600T.\n\nThe Cell processor in the Playstation 3 had 8 special little cores, SPE's, however it was unlikely that all of them would work, so the faulty one was disabled, or if all worked then a working one was disabled, so every PS3 had a dead or disabled core inside making all systems equal and to reduce costs from yield wastage.",

Some individual dies may have defects or variation in their electrical properties. So in addition to what the other reply mentioned - obvious defects, there will be more subtle differences between individual CPUs that have an effect on their operating frequencies and voltage.\n\nSo during verification some CPUs may not reliably operate at the desired frequency and voltage of a given model thus cannot be sold as such. They might be thrown away or, as is suspected with all these late AMD launches, clocked lower and branded as a new model. \n\nThis is all super complicated and I know next to nothing but that's the general gist.",

Though I don't know if 570 was a downgraded 580 in that gen a well)\n\nEdit. In some instances it's possible to unlock some of those disabled cores and features with custom firmware, but usually it's not recommended since they were originally disabled for a reason to begin with. There are still some instances of that working and people essentially get a \"free upgrade\" there.",
