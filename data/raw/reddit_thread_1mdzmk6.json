This makes virtualization a lot simpler as you don't have to deal with pass through, but that's a more in depth discussion about why you might want to do that.",

My TVs work fine. My smart plugs from different brands cooperate via homekit integration, as well as my ecobee thermostat. Someone even made an integration for our alarm that (mostly) works.\n\nSince there's such a a big community out there, it's kind of hard to find a large manufacturer that isn't supported at all -- unless they're super stubborn.\n\nFor new purchases, just look for things that work with zigbee or zwave and get a dongle for home assistant. I run a bunch of inovelli smart light switches and some cheap sengled bulbs. I did that so I could have color changing smart lights with a physical light switch that wouldnt just kill the power to them. I even DIYed a landscape lighting controller that uses a zigbee relay.",

What no one is mentioning with Home assistant is that it's complex. Linking your services such as Philips Hue to Home assistant is cake, sure but the nightmare begins when you want a nice big library of premade scenes or scenes that gradually shift over time. There's nothing like that without taking a big dive into HACS. If you buy a zigbee adapter, all zigbee devices can only be controlled by one 'master' zigbee controller so you'll need to factory reset them (such as hue bulbs) and then let the zigbee controller manage them. It's very much an all in situation that I've been extremely hesitant to jump to even though I have a zigbee usb controller. I also think that the google speakers home assistant plugin has a subscription, could be wrong. If you want to switch to home assistant without fussing about hardware, check out the home assistant green or yellow which are made directly by the group who make the software.",

I haven't messed with any of that yet but it sounds like it's still being worked on and will be good in a year or two.\n\nI'm still using the method of exposing my local devices to Google Home and using Assistant for voice control. I hate it and its terrible. Google Assistant/Home is absolutely terrible now. With that said we don't use voice control much in the house. I have Z Wave wall switches for the switches that can support wired ones and battery powered wireless switches for areas that don't have a switch or have a switch that doesn't support a smart switch. I also have a lot of motion/presence sensors in the house which trigger things like lights when you enter a room. \n\nWow I'm sorry for the wall of a response this turned into... Lmao.

Google Home isn't \"bad\" by accident, it's a symptom of a business model built on harvesting your data first, while actual functionality is an afterthought. The lawsuits brewing aren\u2019t surprising: Google lured people in with promises of a seamless smart home, but the reality is a half-baked product that spies on you *and* fails at basic tasks.\n\nWhy? Because you\u2019re not the customer. Advertisers and data brokers are. Every voice command, habit, and failed interaction is still metadata gold for Google\u2019s real business. When profitability depends on surveillance, reliability and user experience become secondary. They sold us a always-listening mic *disguised* as a helper.\n\nIf I ever set up a smart home system, it\u2019s 100% local or bust. Tools like Home Assistant, Mycroft, or Rhasspy running on a Pi or a home server prove you *can* have voice control without feeding your life into a corporate AI. No phoning home to Google/Amazon, no abandoned features when the parent company loses interest, and no lawsuit-worthy betrayal of trust.",

Are still working reliably so I replaced my 14 WeMo switches with Amazon smart devices and everything works seamlessly. \n\nAs a matter of fact I was pleasantly and shockingly surprised at how easy it was to set up. \n\nEvery time I hooked up a in-wall switch or plugged in a smart plug by the time I was done and sitting down to open the Alexa app it was already there, set up and ready to go. \n\nAll I had to do was rename it to what I wanted to call it and put it into any smart routines I've wanted. \n\nI used to have my own personal smart home server setup And people will tell you that you should do this because it's so much better and you don't have to worry about big companies etc, blah, blah, blah. \n\nBut what they don't tell you is that you have to maintain the computer whether it's a raspberry pi or a full-on PC, you will have to update any APIs that change which is the instructions to the physical device that's turning things off and on and you will have to deal with any network issues that pop up, and they will pop up. \n\nAfter dealing with all of that for years I simply don't want to do it anymore. \n\nI'm not saying that Amazon is the best company but it works simply and reliably and Amazon generally doesn't have a huge record of dumping products unless they are not profitable and being bought by people. \n\nGoogle on the other hand does it all the time.",
