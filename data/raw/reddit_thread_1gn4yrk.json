A 200% tariff on Mexican cars, for instance, is going to hurt American car companies, that have a lot of their manufacturing in Mexico, *and* exactly the Americans who voted for him. \n\nI imagine his trade agenda will be a lot more targeted than this.",

Used correctly they are meant to apply selective safeguards to an economy, by pressuring consumers into spending on locally sourced or created goods, and are typically paired with subsidies to stimulate local supply growth.\n\nBut that's not happening. Its just bad dumb orange economics. No new business are heing created, no care or thought is being put into what consumers are being discouraged from buying, and its just everything. Parts needed for gizmos. Doodads needed for gadgets. Its just a broad spectrum price hike with no rime or reason.\n\nWhen that happens the cost of everything goes up, people can afford to buy less, which means higher tariffs are needed to recoupe the missing revenue from the few who still are, and that just goes around in circles.\n\nThat's what people are mad about. Yes, china is involved, but its not about them. Its about orange businessman no understand capitalism for dummies.\n\nSupply and demand.

When I was reading around the 2016 election, I came across the concept of the \"altruistic vote\": when people vote against their own interests, as they perceive them, in the service of some greater good.\n\nMany Trump voters, the writer said, however much we might question their reasoning, fell into this category. They were voting against their own direct interests, because they saw Trump as better for the country. Farming and farm communities were, if I recall correctly, the example he used.\n\nBy this reading, some of these voters are apparently *very altruistic*. It's going to be interesting to see how far they will tolerate economic pain in order to continue supporting Trump's cultural, economic and foreign-policy agendas.\n\nOthers, as you point out, aren't altruistic. They think Trump will deliver for them. In some cases, for instance oil workers and their communities in the Permian basin, he may well do. In other cases, they're probably in for a big shock. I doubt they jobs that are onshored will be sufficient in quantity or of the right kind to offer opportunities to all the voters who have been losers in the last twenty years of globalisation. \n\nAnd as the Democrats have just discovered, pointing out that your policies are working for *someone* doesn't go down with the people those policies are leaving behind, particularly if those people previously invested high hopes in you.\n\nInteresting times ahead.",

Production at one stage was held up weeks because they couldn\u2019t get a certain size screw in the right quantities because the local makers and suppliers couldn\u2019t meet the demand or the time frames. Meanwhile in China they could organise supply often within hours. It\u2019s not just the case of building a factory and magically building the products - they are complex combinations of hundreds or thousands of parts. And even stuff like aluminium milling - there was a time when Apple was using something like 90% of China\u2019s aluminium milling capacity. And even if you bought a bunch of mills and slapped them in the USA, I remember one pundit saying a lot of this equipment then wouldn\u2019t have the operational expertise and it could take ten years to build it up to the levels you can get in China because they do so much manufacturing.\n\nBottom line is you can\u2019t just rush production back to the USA and expect it to be better. It\u2019ll possibly be worse, slower, lower yields, worse quality, until you build up that expertise. You can see this is slowly happening as production moves out of China into other countries (including the USA) but it\u2019s a slow and steady wins the race operation.

So, they might stock up prior to tariffs to avoid price hikes in the short term.. but for a long term approach, they ABSOLUTELY WILL consider onshoring the manufacturing and supply chain for their products.\n\nExample: You know how cheap it is to make a light bulp? None are made in the US (with few exceptions). Put a big tariff on them, they will get made in the US. Auto parts, electronics, food, etc.. might become cheaper to manufacture in the US again. \n\nThe US can be pretty self sufficient if it really wanted to be. The massive corporations may not like it much because their profits would shrink and the little guy would be better able to compete with them, but in the end, the consumer, jobs, unions might all benefit in various different way.",

But then, the business will attempt, to increase the price. This doesn\u2019t always work. The market decides the price of things and it always has decided. \n\nIf they jack up the price on a product that is a leisure item, they will get shafted. The market would respond by not purchasing the PS5s or the games or the controllers or whatever item they price hike. \n\nThey will be able to push the line a bit, and still come out with good sales numbers. But there isn\u2019t a world where things that are leisure items magically double in price because they won\u2019t sell any product. Some of the tariff will be paid by the consumer. Most will be paid by the company selling the device.",

You're being willfully dense.\u00a0\n\n\nWe **can** assume it's that simple. We have the numbers. 81 million people voted Democratic in 2020.\u00a0\n\n\nIt stands to common sense and logical reason that they'd vote Democratic in 2024 *if they did vote.*\n\n\n\nIt's **highly unlikely** those 10 million voters change their vote to Republican or 3rd-party.\n\n\n**It's much more likely those voters didn't participate in 2024.**\n\n\n\nYou're creating assumptions and using what-if's about these supposed voters that \"well\u00a0you cant guarantee they'd vote Democratic!\"\n\n\nAnd you can't prove they wouldn't.\u00a0\n\n\nAn intelligent person can look at 2020 and say \"it's more likely those 81M people would keep voting Democratic\" and not \"there was a 10M+ person swing in Democratic voters now voting for a Republican.\"\u00a0\n\n\nAnd no. I can't give you the proof of those exact 10M voters because we don't keep track of individuals and how they vote. It's anonymous.\u00a0\n\n\nWe can't go track down every single registered Democratic voter or every Bifen voter from 2020 and create a polling report asking them why they didn't vote in 2024 and why they didn't vote for Harris.\n\n\nSo how about this, you prove that those 10 million voters **wouldn't** have voted Democrat and maybe I'll consider your opinion valid.\u00a0\n\n\nOr you tell me what's more likely:\n\n\nA. 10 million Democratic voters from 2020 stayed home and didn't participate in the 2024 election.\n\n\n\nB. 10 million Democratic voters\u00a0died/became Republican voters/became 3rd-party voters. While Republicans/3rd-party candidates also lost an equal amount of\u00a0 participating voters as they gained from Democratic voters.",

We've seen people explicitly say they don't want to vote Democrat because of Biden's soft touch on Israel. I already know what you're going to say and I agree - that's a fucking stupid reason not to vote Democrat, given the other guy will be far worse on this issue. I'm mad about it too, but a conscious decision not to vote Democrat it is.\n\n2. Yes. I agree. They likely didn't participate. Now read what I said again: the fact that they voted Democrat last time does not mean they wanted to vote Democrat this time. As per above, they may well have consciously decided they AREN'T going to vote Democrat, rather than your interpretation that they WOULD have voted Democrat, but just couldn't be bothered going out.\n\n*We can't go track down every single registered Democratic voter or every Bifen voter from 2020 and create a polling report asking them why they didn't vote in 2024 and why they didn't vote for Harris.*\n\nEvery single one? No, obviously not. But you do realise polling exists? Maybe it'll actually give some more insight.\n\nIf it does, I expect the general answers would be things like \"I refused to vote Democrat because of Biden's handling of Gaza\" rather than \"I would have voted Democrat but I chose to stay home instead\".\n\nWe clearly disagree on this - though not as much as you implied we do. I thought I was relatively respectful in my disagreement. If you're going to chuck strawmen at me and be rude, I'll part ways here, thanks.",

All the while using ther constituents tax dollars to increaseling incite war around the globe for their own political and economic gain.\n\nThere's a lot of good people and good things that have come out of the states, but if you take a few steps back and look from a much larger temporal and broader view, it becomes increasingly clear that they operate as the largest terrorist entity in the current world and likely history. \n\nThis is quite a broad statement to make, and may be largely unfounded in truth, but from my perspective US politics has become commercialised and gamified to distract the populace of the real issues that need tackling, pitting one side against the other. And while the American population is worrying and arguing about which two terrible options of candidates to choose from, they are oblivious to the goings in government in which the land they live on is exploited and stolen to then be sold to the highest bidder. \n\nAmerican politics is not a democracy, it's a corporatocracy masquerading as a democracy, and seeing people argue at length on reddit about how those on the other side are devoid of morals and have no idea how the world works, gets old after a while when you realise just how caught up people get in it.\n\nThis has kinda ended up in a ramble and I forgot initially what I was replying to you about, but I thought my perspective was a good one to share and makes people think that the things you see online are not actually that important. What is important is getting involved in your local community, and using your own capabilities as small as they may be to enact small bits of change in ways they see fit.",

Tariffs serve a specific purpose, for better or worse, and in this case it's working as intended.\n\nIt's very likely if anything close to the 20-60% tariffs come to happen, they absolutely will take the price of goods up by 20-60%.\n\nThe part that worries me personally is when and if those tariffs are removed, will the prices come back down? or are these companies just gonna roll with their new pricing permanently?\n\nSo many items that went up during the pandemic due to supply chain constraints never came back down, despite the supply chain issues being resolved.",

This lack of understanding is compounded by the promise to eliminate the Department of Education\u2014something he openly stated.- He knows uneducated voters are what put him in power.\n\nIf you voted for him, you\u2019ve only just begun to see the consequences of his promises, including lie #3 or #4.

And when he recently spoke to Putin, Elon Musk randomly dropped in on the call.\n\nSo, by supporting Trump, you\u2019ve effectively endorsed a power structure involving him, Putin, and Musk. They\u2019ve already lied about the Ukraine situation, Putin\u2019s actions are escalating, and now North Korean soldiers are involved, all while they continue to manipulate public perception.\n\nBut the only thing that will get their attention is that voting for trump is going to up the price of the PS5!!!",

Even with a 60% tariff, it\u2019s still cheaper to make it abroad and pass the cost of the tariff off on you.\n\nPlayStation specifically, but any manufacturer that makes a niche product without a US competitor is going to just make you pay the tariff AND the US competitor seeing that consumers will pay the higher prices will just raise their price to match and rake in that extra profit.\n\nThis is all just economics 101\u2026\n\nSmartphones, gaming consoles, computer parts\u2026none of those are moving manufacturing to the US\u2026\n\nGet used to those increased tariff prices!",
