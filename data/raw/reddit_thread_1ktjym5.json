Where are you getting that \"flopped hard from\"? \n\nThe ones I'm familiar with were:\n\n1. Google Glass - Never made it to market, despite the backing of one of the world's biggest tech companies.  People who beta tested them earned the pejoritive \"glassholes\".  Not a strong start.\n\n2. DAQRI Smart Glasses - Suffered from a very silly design, somewhere between ski goggles and a VR headset.  Barely lasted 2 years, company shut down shortly after.\n\n3. Snapchat Spectacles - Introduced in 2016, and in 2017 *\"Snapchat wrote off $40m worth of unsold Spectacles inventory and unused parts\".*  That isn't good.  Design described as \"truly horrid\" by Slate.  To be fair they do seem to be still trying and releasing a new version every couple years.\n\n4. Meta Ray-Bans - Introduced in 2021, These are the best-looking attempt so far.  Don't seem to have exactly taken off in the market though, and have some pretty significant privacy concerns.  A lot of people these days want nothing to do with Meta/Facebook, and for good reasons.",

High tech makes a huge difference. That is like a difference between (in terms of VR) oculus Rift DK1, that was available to only a handful of people, was expensive and limited in functionality, served as a tech demo, and something like Quest2 that had massive success as a headset, was cheap, and had tons of usages apps and games. They are both VR headsets, and just because you might consider the first one a flop by your standards, doesn't mean people don't want the tech if it was cheaper and more functional. I feel like the same applies to AR glasses. \n\n^^^^^.\n\nWe are glued to our phones, one of the advantages of AR glasses (for better or worse arguably) is having that screen constantly available to you right in your field of vision, so there is already huge appeal for a lot of people. \n\n^^^^^.\n\n> A lot of people these days want nothing to do with Meta/Facebook, and for good reasons.\n\nAnd I hope none of their AR product ever succeeds really. I hope they invest bilions, develop tech and forma factor that others will copy and will make better/open/nonspy products.",
