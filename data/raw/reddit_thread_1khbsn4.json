          "body": "Characters are made up of different parts which help when looking at a new or uncommon word. Radicals help you deduce meaning, phonetic components help with pronunciation. \n\nNow, think about how you read. Do you sound out each word? Or do you look at a word and know its meaning intuitively? It\u2019s the same with Chinese, you grow up seeing it every day, you internalize rather than memorize the characters. \n\nConsider this: English natives have huge vocabularies of 20,000-30,000 words. 8,000 characters doesn\u2019t seem like very much now\u2014and you only need 2,000-3,000 to read a Chinese newspaper. \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how they can tell the difference between similar looking or sounding characters, just think about how often you mix up the words \u2018interior\u2019 and \u2018inferior,\u2019 or how you know the difference between tearing up at a wedding and tearing up a dance floor. Chinese is a contextual language; if you know what\u2019s going on around an unfamiliar character, you could guess its meaning pretty easily. \n\nOr, yes, look it up. Just like English users look up unfamiliar and uncommon words in a dictionary, it\u2019s easy\u2014especially with technology\u2014to look up unfamiliar characters. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: apparently I\u2019ve never seen numbers before. Just realized you\u2019re saying 80,000 not 8,000. \n\nThat\u2019s even easier to answer. Depending on how you want to count it, there are 600,000-1 million English words. But the average native only uses 20,000-30,000. Still, a keyboard should be able to type every possible English word. Same with a Chinese keyboard. No, most people probably don\u2019t know or use \u9998, (\"cut off the left ear of the slain\"), but if this keyboard can write characters containing all of the components of \u9998 for other words, then it can also type \u9998. \n\nI\u2019m leaving now before I fundamentally misunderstand anything else",

Ponderous and requiring flipping of the thinnest pages back and forth between radical tables, the actual character lists using those radicals, and finally arriving upon the definition itself.  It was awesome and a serious effort.  The language itself is a phenomenal testament to the complexity of human brains and their capacity to figure out written communication.\n\nI only saw a \u201ctypewriter\u201d once or twice during my time there.  And yes the skills to use it are apparently insane.  Like exponential to the dictionary experience described above.",
