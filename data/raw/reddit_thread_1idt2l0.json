They're going to hire a handful of coders to clean up and string together the inefficient code slop. They're going to hire one or two artists to Photoshop and prettify the soulless art that gets vomited out in volume. They're going to hire one writer to proofread and edit the endless glut of homunculus text for their article mill.

When it first got big, everyone thought it was going to be the future of manufacturing, and everything else was obsolete. And that's not what happened because 95% of what you can make with a 3D printer can be made faster, cheaper, at higher quality, more reliably, and in larger quantities with conventional injection moulding. The 5% of shit you actually need a 3D printer to make are the things that would be impossible or very difficult to manufacture using traditional methods. But, it is also very good for rapid prototyping and hobbyists because it's easier, cheaper, and more efficient than manufacturing an injection mould that's only going to get used once or twice.\n\nSame thing with LLMs, they aren't going to make writing or programming obsolete like everyone thinks they will. Instead, it will primarily be used as a method for rapid prototyping. LLMs can be very useful for writing rough drafts or basic code structures that would be tedious to create by hand. But it's never going to get to the point where it can compotently produce a final product of acceptable quality without human intervention.",

I'd say in 5-10 years we'll be using it more and in more useful ways.\n\nAI is annoying to people now because every company is trying to slap it on as a gimmick. When AI will be at its best is when it's like Jarvis was in Iron Man, when you can just talk to it like you would a person, and it will be able to quickly assist and understand context perfectly. Imagine your daily life if you had a real human being personal assistant to help with everything, that's the ideal for an AI assistant on your phone. That being said, many people wouldn't have much use for an assistant even if they had one, so it won't be some kind of game changer for everyone.",

Making the jump from the 22 to the 25 sound like it would be roughly the same as I experienced. If you're happy, skip this and wait for the 26 or 27 for more noticeable gains.       \nThe only real caveat of waiting is the depreciation of your current device. The money made from the old device helps offset the cost of the new, obviously. For fun, I checked with Samsung and with pre-order and device exchange, they were going to give me $1125 off for sending back my s24U. Pretty sizable discount, but being Canadian, it would still cost me another $800 CAD for the upgraded which doesn't sound like enough for what I'd get back.",
