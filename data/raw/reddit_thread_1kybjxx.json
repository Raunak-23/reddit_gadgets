For a while I was using Nvidia GameStream as the host for Moonlight. I only switched back after Nvidia discontinued it, and this time around it became fine for me. \n\nI wonder if another software set might work better for you, I\u2019m interested in trying out Artemis/Apollo next because I stream a lot to my MacBook and it supports custom resolutions better, I wonder if it would change the situation on your end. \n\nRegardless, best of luck on your next setup friend.",
