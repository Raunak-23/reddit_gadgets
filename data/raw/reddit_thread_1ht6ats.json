But compared to Atari, NES is far more *playable* at worst and really fun at best. If you're willing to grant a fair amount of patience, NES games are just fine. Super Mario Bros, SMB3, Kirby's Adventure, Mega Man, Castlevania, Final Fantasy, Tetris, Dr. Mario, Metroid, Legend of Zelda, etc. All bangers. And leagues ahead of Atari.",
