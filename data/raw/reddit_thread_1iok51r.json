That was my experience.\n\nIs Apple ai out for Mac? Yes. Is it functional as an ai experience? Not unless you bend the current public understanding of the definition of ai. I apologize if my comment upset others (not saying you) but I am the layman here. I\u2019ve had my Mac for 4 months. I was getting prompts every couple of days to activate AI. I activated it. Tried to get it to do the things I had heard it could do, tried to get things I\u2019ve used GPT for, tried to use it as a search engine, it couldn\u2019t do any of those things. People can argue with me about the semantics of \u201cuseless\u201d or say I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is just a reskinned Siri for now.\n\nIf they\u2019re planning on adding additional features, that\u2019s great! They shouldn\u2019t have pushed it out and advertised it if its key features aren\u2019t there. No hate. I just think it was a mistake.",
