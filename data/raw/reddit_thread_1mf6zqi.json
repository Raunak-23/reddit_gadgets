That we (U.S) didn\u2019t fully enable Ukraine knowing the track record of Russia and knowing their active hybrid warfare is foolish beyond description. Makes any U.S. explanation for dedicating resources to the military seem hypocritical. We could be being trained by today\u2019s most experienced military, and once Russia is staved off, Ukraine could relieve much U.S. presence in Europe. An achievable scenario that would save the U.S. billions every year and hamstrings a global opponent bent on our downfall. That a U.S. president would hamstring Ukraine and enable Russia is un-fucking-real. Unbelievable. \nHowever Ukraine has proven themselves second to none in having pure grit and resolution. \nI recently heard that Ukrainian engineers are able to 3D print drone chassis. Six $1k printers can churn out a unit every 8 hours. Once fine-tuned, the manufacturing will likely be added to near-front-line operations.",

So they had a decent stock of NLAWs, Javelins and Stingers appropriate for infantry to hit armor or aircraft, but not the stock of artillery, etc. needed for a more conventional sustained ground campaign. Never mind warfare based on cheap drone platforms that basically didn't exist at this scale or level of sophistication before this conflict.\n\n\nCould the US have done more? Yes. Europe as well. There was also way too much concern about \"red lines\" that were never real. But hindsight is 20/20 and governments and militaries are always reasoning from incomplete info and trying to balance a range of sometimes mutually conflicting priorities.",
