I won't deny its not quite as useful as having two (Hence my pointing out the SteamDeck is the superior device), but the Legion S *DOES* have a trackpad.\n\nAnd in my experience there was nothing wrong with it, outside of the trackpad being generally crap for controlling games, as all trackpads are in my opinion (Including the SteamDeck ones).",

Theoretically therefore, if you were willing to bring the fps down to whatever the steam deck gets per game, you could raise the graphical presets. \n\nSo strictly speaking in terms of graphics, to someone who has never seen either system in person - on two equal displays, the game with the higher resolution and higher graphical settings is going to look better. Is the Steam Deck\u2019s OLED screen really that good that it can offset those disadvantages?",

              "body": "On the balance of just the screen and the screen alone being the deciding factor the Legion would probably edge it. The deeper colours of the OLED screen on the SteamDeck are nice but so is the higher resolution and higher FPS on the Legion. If it was just down to that I might pick the Legion. However one thing to remember is the Legion has a slightly bigger screen so that increased resolution spreads out over more screen estate. \n\nBut it\u2019s not just the screen that is the deciding factor and that makes the difference.\n\nThis is likely subjective but the resolution is something that either bothers you or it doesn\u2019t and if you have never seen the difference it doesn\u2019t bother you. Also some games are a bit hard to see on the small screen so having a larger resolution doesn\u2019t always help. Now this might also be subjective to the person but even if you do see the difference it\u2019s not so great that you go \u201cOh wow I can never go back to the SteamDeck\u201d. It\u2019s just a bit better. Not game changing better. \n\nAnd here\u2019s the thing. Some games don\u2019t run well at that higher setting. They are both great devices but they aren\u2019t gaming PC\u2019s and sometimes a game doesn\u2019t run quite as well on the Legion as the SteamDeck. And that is the real beauty of the SteamDeck. If Steam says it runs, it runs. No frame rate drops, no chug, no tinkering. The Legion performance and experience isn\u2019t quite as smooth. Some games need a tinkering with to get them optimised.\n\nAdd to the fact the steam deck has better controls and options and it just feels like the better device. But as I said it\u2019s close enough that if you bought the Legion you aren\u2019t going to feel like you bought an inferior device in the slightest. I\u2019d be happy with either device and would not regret buying one over the other no matter which one I went with.",

      "body": "Just a callout that is purely anecdotal and might be worthless here\u2026 I\u2019m an original Legion Go owner. I loaded Bazzite onto it and have been exceedingly happy with it \u2014 it\u2019s basically SteamOS but with some extra customization options.\n\nLiterally last night, inspired by some other posts that I saw, I installed the official SteamOS release onto it instead. I know it\u2019s not technically officially supported, but most folks were saying that it was functional.\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t. My FPS in the Steam interface (outside of any games) was pathetically poor, I was seeing consistent drops to less than 60FPS and brief hangs that brought me into the 10s. I tried to play one game \u2014 Sworn, which is similar to Hades \u2014 and it was holding a steady 20FPS at 720p.\n\nI loaded Bazzite back onto it. Consistent 144hz in the OS, 55-60FPS at 1600x900 resolution while on the \u201cBalanced\u201d TDP profile. Night and day difference.\n\nNow I noticed while poking the BIOS to disable secure boot that my Legion Go was set to the \u201cquiet\u201d hardware mode, which is an 8W TDP. (I don\u2019t recall setting that myself, but I might\u2019ve done so a year ago or more.) I didn\u2019t see anywhere to customize TDP draw in SteamOS like I did with Bazzite, and that well may have accounted for the performance dip. But without a quick way to customize, forced to go into the BIOS, it would be annoying. I\u2019m guessing there are things that one could install to allow for this control, but that\u2019s an extra step!\n\nTl;dr, original Legion Go is great especially with Bazzite. My experience with SteamOS was subpar, but might\u2019ve been my own fault.",

I\u2019ve seen other reports of it working well. I suspect that if my TDP wasn\u2019t set for 8W the experience may have been better, and I believe that there are tools available to allow for TDP switching in SteamOS as well.\n\nFrom my experience, the SteamOS installation was smooth and seamless, definitely the quickest OS install I\u2019ve ever done. But, while it\u2019s a tad bit more complex, I returned to Bazzite for 99% of the same experience with some additional stuff built-in. I\u2019m not sure if they have an image specifically for the Legion Go but it\u2019s available in the \u201cdevice\u201d dropdown menu, so it\u2019s definitely tested, at a minimum. I\u2019ve been very happy with it for my Steam games, which is 99% of my Steam library.\n\nOnce Windows releases their \u201cimproved handheld experience\u201d or whatever alongside the Xbox Ally (or whatever it\u2019s called) I\u2019ll probably give Windows a shot again, because rumor is that as part of the project they\u2019re cutting way down on bloat, boosting performance, and suppressing a lot of the annoyances\u2026 While maintaining full Windows compatibility, including all launchers and Xbox Gamepass.",

Even then, analog-to-mouse works fine for those too. If a game is M&KB-only and required fast pace movement and precise clicking, or a large variety of keyboard inputs, I wouldn't play it on the Deck in the first place.",

As of the PS4, they finally ditched the ergonomically-challenged housing they'd been on since 1994, and they seem to have lived to tell the tale.  And with the PS5 pad, they edge kind of shamelessly in the direction of the Xbox form factor (as did Nintendo).  Grips are still a touch too vertical but I'm sure they'll get there.\n\nMy guess?  They have a portable PS5 coming.  They really _can't_ get away with keeping the primary analog stick at such an inconvenient spot on a Steamdeck clone... so they may just go ahead and use that as their excuse and say their hands were tied.",

So natural positions that aren't awkwardly asymmetrical are left stick and face buttons works or right stick and dpad, but you're almost never using the dpad and the right stick at the same time.\n\nA lot of modern games use both sticks and the triggers, so in that form factor PS layout actually kind of makes sense.

There's only one size fits most.  Realistically speaking, though, the games you're talking about are almost certainly better to play with KB+M.\n\nI will say that the Xbox _controller_ as an entire package is far from perfect.  (Especially if we're talking about XB1.)  It's the layout that wins.  There's nothing stopping Microsoft from giving us bumper buttons that are actually buttons as opposed to levers, but apparently that's a bridge too far.  And obviously they have some serious design hangups when it comes to the poor D-pad\u2014the best one they've ever had was only available on limited edition 360 controllers.  But eh, as long as I can comfortably use the D-pad as four bonus buttons, I'm happy.",

It\u2019s very, very good. I\u2019m still getting used to it, and there are some things that I don\u2019t prefer (the placement of the home and QAM buttons, the size/placement of the right stick) but so far none are dealbreakers. The biggest thing going for it is that the console is huge but you can barely tell while you\u2019re holding it. It just feels right. The Ally didn\u2019t have that shape despite being lighter and the original LeGo just didn\u2019t feel great to hold for very long (note: the Go S is actually much closer in size to the OG Go than I expected but despite that I can\u2019t tell while gaming). For me, the best handheld is the one that just feels right when I pick it up, something that doesn\u2019t feel like a chore to play for a longer session (I game a lot on airplanes\u2026 no blue 8bitdo either). Steam Deck had been the only one that did that for me, but the Go S is the first that feels like it could actually get me to retire my Steam Deck.",

I don't want to come back to Windows anymore. On the other end, using SteamOS is great when most of your games come from Steam but not if you mostly find them elsewhere like I do (other launcher or direct downloads). I know that you can add non-steam deck but it feels like a loophole and not a real functionality (you have to go on desktop mode and tinker). I don't want to leave a closed environment to end up in another closed environment.\n\nIs there a linux distrib that would be adapted for these kind of devices? Something that would be adapted to be used with a gamepad and displaying games maybe like in Playnite?",

Theres plenty of handhelds above $500 but the switch 2 and steam deck both prove to be the best value and most popular because its affordable and capable. Anything else new under $500 is either a mobile or cloud streaming device.\n\nBy all means, continue releasing pricey devices, letting valve dominate the market on thr PC side. Hopefully asus and Microsoft can pull some strings and make a version of the Xbox handheld under $500.",

It's all power profie dependant, or fidelity dependent. I haven't come across a game I can't run so far. Usually a few tweaks to power/resolution makes any game a 40-120fps experience. Battery life is on par with most handhelds at 2 hours for let's say Doom or God of War. 3-5 hours for like Hades, or Dave the Diver. Got 6 playing just Balatro to see how far I could push it. \n\nWeight is my biggest complaint, but otherwise that screen is killer, the grips feel great, and the dual action triggers are a great addition.",
