That, or they forcibly would because of archaic Nintendo policies that limit you on your in game purchases of premium currency for games.\n\nFor example; Warframe has a premium currency called Platinum. You can trade this platinum with other players, but Nintendo policy prevents users who paid, or traded for this currency to be locked to the platform, and you cannot trade platinum via cross platform with other players either because of this archaic policy. Only with other Switch users.\n\nTo add more context to this. Warframe didn't get cross play until a few years ago, and has already been out on Switch since 2018 or so. Also, if you were gifted Platinum either with a new account at the time like I did, or from winning it via raffles, it's labeled as \"gifted\" platinum and cannot be traded as well. This effects all platforms, and not really an issue as there's ways to still spend it for cosmetics and other items, and the rule is evenly applied. It also only effects that amount, and is tracked on their site as well and can be seen fairly easily.\n\nNow players have the option to finally get off the Switch as many were begging to, especially since when the Switch port came out you had a limited time if you wanted your PC save transferred to Switch. It also creates an issue where the Switch version is the worst version to play not just from poor performance at times, and lower quality visuals if you care, you cannot interact with the game in the same capacity as everyone else. Sure you can trade item for item still, but that's an EXTREMELY rare occurrence. The iOS version is out, and Android is in closed beta currently, and they too feature universal Platinum wallets, while Switch is sitting alone, and the devs have yet to still see a Switch 2 dev kit to make a proper Switch 2 port that doesn't crash a lot via backwards compatibility from what I've heard.\n\nNot to mention the community at times would basically bully Switch users, and got more aggressive when Cross play came out. To even go as far to block you despite cross play is out because you \"can't trade with them\", further pushing users away from the platform.",

Games need LESS Whaling mechanics - not more. \n\nI find it quite hilarious people do that, since it became such common practice to harass whales on other games - to thep oint where some game studios have been removing emotes used to harass them or even removing in-game chat due to people being shitnozzles.\n\nAs an aside, I also find it hilarious that whenever people complain at Nintendo having \"not enough third party support\", they always give a resounding \"Meh\" at 99.9999% third party games on their platforms... and if it is a good game, say \"Hey it's also on PC/PS/Xbox!\" and shame you for daring to buy it on Nintendo.

Can't just put it in a pocket or a purse like you could with the DS. The battery life is also worse and for a short play session on your commute or something most people find a smartphone to be more convenient. You're already carrying it, the games on it are more built for short play sessions, etc.\n\nSwitch is still a good console and incredible technology (don't own a Switch 2 so I can't comment on it), but I find its best handheld mode use is for playing video games in bed or in your hotel room while on vacation.",

Dedicated video game hardware leans older and older these days, and more expensive hardware could mean less younger people buying the Switch 2 at this time. I would argue younger people are more likely to be seen in public playing games. Could also be that less people find it novel to take the Switch outside, or that the Switch 2 is so big that more people are keeping it at home. Who knows!",

A lot of people were rightfully skeptical of a mobile system that is \u201cgood as a console; it _is_ a console\u201d. But it worked and thus we have such great numbers for the Switch 2. \n\nHaving had mine since launch I can say Mario is fun, too many complain about it, but the actual launch slate has been a bit underwhelming. It was nothing like the face melting changes that came with: Nintendo 64 and Wii. \n\nBut it is definitely a better console than the original, so much cleaner in many ways, but ultimately it currently feels like a nice Switch not a new experience. So I consider those numbers really representative of how much goodwill the Switch bought Nintendo. And similarly the Switch\u2019s numbers reflecting how much they lost with the prior generation.",

It sold for about $50 at launch if I remember correctly. The first castlevsnia dev team size was similar and took much less than a year to make. Breath of the wild took about 10x as many people across multiple years.\n\nFor a while, the prices could ignore inflation because the market grew faster than inflation and the distribution costs went down too.\u00a0\n\nHowever, games have been mass market for a while now and distribution costs aren\u2019t getting dramatically lower anymore now digital downloads are a standard. The teams are still getting more expensive too, because their salaries need to keep up with inflation. Price increases are inevitable.\u00a0\n\nMeanwhile, if you are satisfied with small team games that can be made much more cheaply there are endless great indie games out there for $15.\n\nThere are also tons of discounts on older games, and you can get great titles for 75% off or more regularly, or get them as part of some humble bundle.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty good time to be a gamer.",

It's hard to keep cutting distribution costs when digital game distribution has been mainstream for well over a decade now. Digital distribution also means there is now far more increased competition for game $ than ever before.\n\nAs for the dev costs, they've continued skyrocketing. They're not slowing down at all.\n\nMario 64 was made in about 2 years by about 20 people (Miyamotio said 15-20).\n\nMario Oddyssey required well over 200 peopleand was in development for about 4 years. The same team apparently made Donkey Kong Bananza, which just came out and was in development for \\~7 years.\n\nWith salary of the team also having to keep track of inflation, Bananza's development would have cost somewhere beteen 30x to 50x what mario oddyssey's dev did. Marketing costs increased with inflation too, as did many other costs.\n\nThe factors increasing revenue no longer outpace the factors increasing costs, including inflation.\n\nSo with all those factors, you're getting a much more polished game that cost like 40x as much to make for even less than what you used to pay once you adjust for inflation. That's just true.",

I referenced how Digital Distribution became mainstream which dramatically lowered the average distribution cost. You can't get much cheaper than digital distribution.\n\nFor a long time revenue grew faster than costs & inflation rose, due to a mix of market size increases lower distribution costs (I'm including the price of manufacturing in the distribution cost, since digital distribution was a major factor in lowering those costs too). As long as that happened, prices could stay at about $60.\n\nHowever, that trend stopped a while ago - and the rising dev costs + inflation in addition to more competition for gamer $ has not stopped. Continuing to type in all-caps about $30 cartridges is irrelevant. Things change, and you can't reduce distribution costs forever.\n\nMario 64 was also a mega-hit, the best-selling N64 game. The average game even today doesn't get 11 million sales. Only 21 games on the Switch have sold 10 million copies or more on that platform.\n\nEven major switch-exclusive **hit** titles like Metroid Dread only sold 3.07 million copies. You can't price games assuming you're going to get 10 million sales.\n\nEven if it now cost $0 to distribute games, full digital with no physical copies, inflation would keep rising and force price increases eventually. You can't lower costs below 0. You can keep raising inflation and dev costs though. That's what happened.",

It\u2019s not relevant to my point, because most games don\u2019t come close to generating 600 million in total revenue - but yes there have been games with total dev costs above 600 million in today\u2019s dollars. The call of duty series is infamous for it in particular. Some are estimating the new gta 6 is going to cost over 1 billion dollars by the time it\u2019s done too. I don\u2019t need your money, but feel free to donate to a deserving charity in my name. I like Doctors Without Borders.\u00a0\n\n2. You\u00a0continue acting like 10 million plus sales is normal, when even a 3 million is a huge hit by modern standards. Metroid dread was a huge success at only 3 million sales, the best selling Metroid game ever and topping preorder charts. A game can sell 1/3 of what Mario 64 did and still be a hit game in modern standards. The market hasn\u2019t increased as much as you think for most new games.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n3. Many games lose money too. Publishers fund a bunch of games hoping some will be hits and they\u2019ll pay for the ones that aren\u2019t as well as make back their own investment. Concord cost over 200 million (some estimate closer to 400 million all in for Sony) and sold 25,000 copies.\u00a0\n\n4. You\u2019re objectively getting 100x bigger games for a *lower* price than you used to pay when you account for inflation. Games made by simple size dev teams to Mario 64 (15-20 people over 2 years) often cost much less than $60 too, even in today\u2019s dollars. You\u2019re already getting a much better deal, and your anger\u00a0comes off as entitlement. I\u2019m not going to bother responding to you anymore.",

It's not a easy calculation to make to just say \"oh inflation\" \n\nYou'd need raw profit data which for Nintendo is kinda hard to find.\n\nEdit: found an answer to back up my claim at least a little. \n\n\"The cost to manufacture a Nintendo 64 (N64) cartridge was significantly higher than that of CDs, which were used by competing consoles like the PlayStation. Reportedly, N64 cartridges cost over $30 to produce.\"\n\nSwitching to a CD, digital, or a lil SD card has saved a ton. That money was then reinvested into development. So still not an easy comparison.\n\n\nOh and demand absolutely matters when supply is technically unlimited. \n\nMovies are the closest comparison. They can also cost $300 million to make. A blu ray is what? $40? Add in a $20 movie ticket and you get $60 (Based on recent release thunderbolts) And it's only that high because no one buys blue rays but afficionados. So realistically much less. But higher demand for movie seats.",

And the markets have proven time and time again that Nintendo's pricing model is correct because their consoles and games seemingly keep selling out and breaking records even at these allegedly \"greedy\" prices, in addition to the fact that their operations seem to be a lot more sustainable compared to other companies that push for rapid growth and mass layoffs.\n\nThe vocal minority of aggrieved people on the Internet complaining that Nintendo is too greedy ultimately have no leg to stand on besides voicing subjective frustrations regarding their own personal preferences for affordability.\n\nAnd while there is a real conversation to be had about how our current socioeconomic climate has negatively impacted a lot of people from being able to afford basic life amenities. At the end of the day, Nintendo is a toy/entertainment company, not the government. Nobody is going to starve because they didnt get to play the latest Mario Kart.

The language and tone is worse than for companies like EA selling their kids gambling in sports games, or gacha companies like Mihoyo...\n\nWhile I think some items like the joycons are overpriced to make up margins globally, the overall price of the console is inline with inflation. People are simply finally understanding how fucked inflation has been since 2020 is all. Based on inflation the 299 launch price of the Switch1 would be 399 now. Then you have the tariff and global shipping cost issues, the fit and finish of the Switch2 being slightly higher than the first, etc ... The price unfortunately is about right.\n\nNo console maker has hall effect switches in controllers and the magnetic rails likely preclude them anyways. MKW being 80 as a complete polished game without MTX there is an argument for, and most ppl are getting it bundled for 50. MS is backing off the 80msrp they were going to charge for Outer Worlds 2 because most companies don't deliver a product worth 80, let alone games that are half a game and sell the rest in a cash shop, etc. I was also paying 70-80 for some games in 1990s money, so it's not unprecedented.\n\nThey definitely stuck their foot in the mouth with the legalese for banning consoles though. There is a 99% chance it's intended to be used the same way Sony and MS ban online accounts (and has been only used that way so far), but nuance is dead and trolls like to stir the pot. 99% of the people buying a MIG are using it to pirate, and 99.9% of people with a Switch don't buy devices like that, so it's a no issue. The handful getting banned for used games have gotten things sorted quickly by contacting support and showing a receipt from the game store, etc. which is a reasonable action and outcome IMHO.\n\nFuck Nintendo for that Palworld lawsuit though: While I do think they have a small case, they've gone way overboard in how dirty they approach it and they need to lose for that reason.",

They set a price point that quite clearly the market supports given these sales figures.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you were in charge of Nintendo, would you suggest they make it cheaper? Sounds like a good way to get fired from being in charge of Nintendo.\u00a0\n\n\nThey are a company. They want to make money. That's what companies do. If you don't want to buy it cuz it's too expensive. Totally fair. Totally understandable. But if you're not buying it out of some kind of moral stance?
