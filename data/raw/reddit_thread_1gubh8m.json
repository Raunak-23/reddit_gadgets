It goes against the humanistic company ideal \u2013 bringing people closer together through technology. \n\nIt was Apple\u2019s stated goal five years ago to create beautiful stylish glasses that will replace everything in your pocket \u2013 your wallet, your keys, your money, and your music. \n\nYes he relented and created and promoted VR headgear as a means of refining the technology. But that was never the goal. From it, Apple created amazing eye tracking and a very stable OS. You can be certain they\u2019re working hard to solve the lens technology which is the major stumbling block going forward. And minimizing the power supply. It might be five years yet to perfect. No one knows. \n\nYes it seems META beat Apple to market. Wrong. META created something goofy which only sort of works in its recent glasses reveal. Nobody will buy them if they do release. \n\nApple is never first to market with anything. Not the iPhone, the iPod, Apple TV, iPad or Apple Watch. They wait until their technology is refined to be best in market until they release anything- after assessing for sure they are doing it better than anyone.\n\nPeople said Apple was stupid for making the Apple Watch. The watch was a crucial step forward in the technology in that it basically took an iPhone, minimized it, and made it do everything the iPhone could do right on your wrist. Apple glasses will do exactly the same thing\u2013 minimize and push the technology further forward.\n\nPeople look at what Apple says and think they know what the company is doing. As someone who worked there for 18 years people have no idea of the long-term plans. And there\u2019s always a long-term plan \u2013 whether it\u2019s for the car, VR etc.",

The battery lasts like a month on a single charge and it\u2019ll nag you for a week before you actually need to plug it in. If you intentionally dismiss a week\u2019s worth of low battery warnings and act like the surprised pikachu meme when your mouse dies, that\u2019s on you. Worst case scenario? You plug it in for 5 minutes and have a full day\u2019s charge. \n\nThe port on the bottom is actually kinda smart. First and foremost, it prevents overcharging. Lithium batteries hate being plugged in all the time. If you do that, it\u2019ll degrade faster (happened to me with a razer mouse, after 2 years of being mostly plugged in, the battery wouldn\u2019t even last an hour. Razer immediately asked me if I leave it plugged in all the time when I got a warranty replacement. Made me realize Apple is actually playing 4D chess here). It also serves their brand image by not allowing you to have the appearance of wired hardware.\n\nSiri sucks, but as someone else mentioned, there\u2019s a reason for that and it involves your data. At least it\u2019s not like Google assistant where it *used* to be good, then sometime around ~2022 it just went to absolute digshit. Like basic requests about media playback and smart home lighting stopped working reliably. Now, they\u2019ve gutted the assistant and half replaced it with an AI powered version called Gemini. At least Siri didn\u2019t get lobotomized and then have an identity crisis. Siri has always been\u2026\u2026 *Siri*.",

Surely, it will be the thing that puts Macs in every office in America, as well. Oh, wait, that won\u2019t happen, because people will say, \u201cBut does it play this game I want to play? Does it run this software I need for work? No? Well, then it\u2019s kind of a paperweight isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nAnd I don\u2019t think you grasp how people buy televisions. They pick a size, because they have limited space, and then they shop based on cost. It\u2019s a very different market from the rest of tech, and you\u2019d know that if you ever sold them. People don\u2019t pay retail price for TVs, and they wait for TVs to go on sale. Apple doesn\u2019t really do sale pricing, so now the other TVs look even *more* attractive to the person who shops based on price.\n\nSeriously, go to your local big box retailer and ask them how many people they get who shop for quality; who buy TVs when they\u2019re *not* marked down a couple hundred bucks. That guy will call his supervisor and then ask you to repeat the question, and then they\u2019ll both laugh at you.\n\nAlso, consider this: I\u2019ve owned an Apple TV for about two and a half years. How much money have I spent on it? Zero. \u201cBut Apple gets thirty percent of your\u2026!\u201d you might say, but they don\u2019t, because rational people do their subscribing on websites, to avoid the Apple tax. Hell, isn\u2019t Disney or somebody taking out the option of in-app payment, rather than take the 30 percent hit on their already-too-small margins? They\u2019ll inconvenience people before they say, \u201cFine. We\u2019ll bill you an extra 30 percent,\u201d because that\u2019s confusing to consumers and it\u2019s really hard to explain to those people why their bills went up, whereas just saying, \u201cThis is how it\u2019s done, now,\u201d inconveniences the consumer for about five minutes.\n\nSo, we can put that, \u201cSell it for no margin and make thirty percent on the aftermarket!\u201d idea to rest. If they want to make thirty percent, they\u2019re going to have to do it on the hardware.",

Macs have *never* been number one, but the margins are high enough that it\u2019s worth doing. On TVs, I can\u2019t see how that would ever happen, because Apple could make displays with more pixels and charge a premium, but it\u2019s not like their 5K studio display because there\u2019s no content for a 5K TV, and that would basically have to be a custom panel, which is the reason the studio display costs five times what my 4K monitor does, despite the fact that my 4K is 40 percent larger by area. The studio display wouldn\u2019t be worth making at all if it wasn\u2019t something that video professionals could just expense when buying a Mac Studio or Mac Pro. So, they take that and then make it a million times worse, because now they\u2019re in large retail channels, most of which wouldn\u2019t sell $1500 TVs. Even if they\u2019re five times better, most people would still rather buy five inferior TVs, or one TV and wait five years for the inferior ones to hit the point where they\u2019re as good as the superior TV, and then spend $300 on that.",

It\u2019s the same thing that console manufacturers have always done. They sell you the console for less than it costs to make because they\u2019ll make their profits on every game you buy. Except instead of games, the TV manufacturers are selling ads. Samsung has fucking banner ads built into all but their most expensive models. \n\n\nRealistically, Apple would sell a TV at roughly the same price that Samsung, LG, or Sony sell their more expensive sets, which are still artificially cheap because they collect usage data to resell to advertisers. They\u2019d also assume that a lot of people buying a TV made by Apple would also be paying for iCloud or AppleTV+ or Apple One, and that would be the secondary revenue stream that subsidizes the TV itself. \n\n\nApple relies more heavily on selling subscription services than they do on scraping and repackaging your usage habits to sell to advertisers like the rest of the manufacturers of the products you mentioned. Amazon loses money on every single Echo product they sell. Google loses money on every Fitbit sold. They do so because they know that more people will choose a lower up-front cost, and that the larger their market share the more they can make from ad revenue and subscriptions. \n\nApple is a hardware company that offers subscriptions, Amazon and Google are advertising companies that offer hardware. Samsung is a data collection agency that offers hardware, at least as it pertains to things like TV\u2019s.",

Roku is kinda of crap, there is basically no real competition for somebody like Apple with Google/Nvidia basically just dragging their ass as if it's not the biggest electronic platform in the world.\n\nHaving had most TV streaming boxes, it's pretty clear Apple is the only one taking it seriously beside game consoles, whom mostly don't care about all the other uses beside games, thus massively limiting the platform and having huge costs for the gaming chips that most TV users in general don't really care about. Plus those M whatever chips are so good now you can get ideal performance without fans, unlike Nvidia shield which is more expensive and breaks far more often AND never gets updates or features because Nvidia is too busy selling to cryptokids and WHO-THE-FUCK ever buys $1000+ dollar GPUs.",

It's all fucking cheap considering their size, weight and components. Monitors are not there yet.\n\nApple Displays are usually more expensive than their competitors; they are also mostly better or have an unique offering. But a 27 inch monitor despite being so easy to ship can cost the same of the same quality 4k 55 inch TV that's difficult to ship.\n\nThe differences on the low end have grown smaller with time. However on high end equipment the difference is big. A 32 inch Samsung OLED monitor is roughly the same price as a 65 inch OLED. However when OLED or Mini Led monitors started coming out, they were 2000 dollars and more expensive than their TV counterparts.\n\nPrice comes with innovation, so in that sense the latest tech in Monitor comes later and you pay innovative prices for it; even when it's common on the TV market.",

The ecosystem they\u2019ve built keeps users invested in their products. So, while the latest iPhone might seem underwhelming, the overall value proposition of Apple\u2019s ecosystem still holds strong for many users",

Iphone 16 as the literal prime example. Hence Apple can just sell good tv's and they will sell with minimal innovation (double oled like in the ipad might be a good call). Again why do you go off talking about its ecosystem, software and services when we all know it is good and doesn't CONTRADICT my statement. A tv would literally broaden that ecosystem and is the *thing* that would make it so easy to sell the tv for a $500 special apple tax. you are literally helping me by coping so hard that the iphone is lame af this year",

                          "body": "The point about Apple\u2019s ecosystem is actually very relevant \ud83d\udc80The reason people buy new Apple hardware even with minimal innovation is because of the seamless integration and the overall experience that Apple offers. The ecosystem is a major selling point and it adds value to every new piece of hardware including the iPhone 16. People are not just buying a phone they\u2019re buying into a system that works flawlessly together. This is why even a TV with minimal innovation would still sell well cuz it\u2019s not just about the hardware specs but the added value of being part of the Apple ecosystem. That fact that you think it might seem like a \u201ccope\u201d to bring up the ecosystem just shows how uneducated you are when it comes to understanding why Apple products continue to sell so successfully.",
