              "body": "My husband restores watches as a hobby, the sapphire crystals are only about $5 each when buying them in sets of 20. You can get them individually for about $8.\n\nThe strap is going to run you another $5. Not sure about the movement cost but individually those are going to run about $30 including free shipping, so presumably the price will plummet fast if you're buying them in bulk.\n\nThe case itself is going to very significantly depending on quality, what you're looking at anywhere between $10 and $40 depending on the quality for an individual case including shipping. These look like a pretty basic design so I'm going to guess they're on the lower end of that scale. \n\nI would say approximately $60 to $70 to make each watch. Depending on how they got the movement to work that could add significant costs, so another $20 to play it safe and you have a watch that costs no more than $90 to make on the high end. You could achieve this price as long as you're making at least five since custom dials often have a minimum quantity order of around that much. \n\nThey made hundreds between all of the colorways, so I would be shocked If this thing is over $60 plus the cost of the Watch box.",

If me calling that out is enough to make you start calling people stupid then you seem like an incredibly petty person. Why does it bother you I don't like seeing people getting ripped off? This watch doesn't have features watches at the \u00a31100 price range should have. If the original price wasn't asinine then why did they discount it to less than HALF immediately? It's the same shit that the polystone statues were. They marketed so hard people didn't realize they're essentially just epoxy resin marked up hundreds of dollars because of marketing. \n\nIf it bothers you that I call a rip off a rip off then move on.

The general public is never, EVER, going to give a shit about this stuff.  They see an expensive watch and they laugh.  Nobody, **nobody**, outside of watch snobs gives a shit about \"the caliber of the movement\", or \"oh it's more expensive because it's mechanical instead of quartz\".  Does it tell the time, yes or no?  That's what most people care about, and that's what makes most people laugh at most watches when they look at their prices.  That's all that's going on here.\n\nLike anything else outside of watches, this is a limited run of something and it's going to come at a higher cost than normal because of it and/or the brand.  It's going to either have to mean something to you as a watch collector, or as somebody that really likes Atari/Asteroids.  That's about it... I can't see it having any appeal whatsoever to any other person.  People will spend the money if they think it's worth it.  You can call it a cash grab and I don't know that I would disagree with that, but on some level, most watches period are a cash grab as it's a fashion item/jewelry.",

I know there are exceptions, but they're probably extreme exceptions (and I wouldn't count sales as that's \"cheating\").  I don't know *why* that is... either there's some cost that nobody is factoring in, or everybody that makes a watch has just agreed that this is the way pricing should be.\n\nMechanical watches are typically for enthusiasts.  There's no real function of value to them for the average consumer.  Quartz is way cheaper, and ironically enough is more accurate at telling time too if you get one with a good movement.  Watch enthusiasts just like the idea of the machinery inside of a mechanical watch.  The \"craftsmanship\", the history, blah blah blah.  It's kind of like people who pay a lot of money for art.  Quartz is mass-produced shit and mechanical watches are for people that really love the smell of their own farts (I kid, but I sometimes wonder about the attitude around the two).  Maybe the only real advantage of mechanical on a technical level is that there's no battery involved, so one watch could last and function for generations.\n\nIf I go on the Tissot website for instance, a Tissot PRX goes for $525 Canadian.  A Tissot PRX Powermatic 80 goes for $975.  The difference?  One's quartz and one's mechanical.  Explain that difference to me because it doesn't make any sense, and it will never make sense to the average person.  I think technically the Powermatic has an anti-reflective coating on the glass/crystal... but besides that, I think it's literally the same watch beyond the movement difference between mechanical and quartz.  Is that really a $450 difference in parts?  Bullshit, but that's typically the way that goes for quartz vs mechanical and that's typically what you're going to find on the market.  Not *every* case, but somehow, it's the case most of the time for any reputable brand or microbrand.\n\nIt might be because nobody is mass-producing mechanical watches on such a level that the savings in cost for hyper-bulk manufacturing just isn't there for them so they're inherently expensive for that reason?  I'm not sure.  I'd like to believe it's not just an entire class of watch that exists to price-gouge people who care about craftsmanship, history, the idea of what a mechnical watch is, etc... but maybe the answer really is that simple.",

                          "body": "I said most, not all.  Mechanical watches tend to be priced higher than quartz watches.  I suspect, movement and everything that goes into it aside, that's because there's no inherent value to a mechanical watch to most people versus a quartz watch.  If you really care about a mechanical watch, chances are you're caring about it for artistic reasons and/or for longevity reasons.  Those types of folks probably aren't buying $120 mechanicals... yeah, you can probably find them, but that's not where most of that market is.  Thus again, I question whether that whole thing is largely based around price-gouging people who care about what a mechanical represents versus the actual cost of making one because the pricing and pricing differences you see largely don't make any sense.\n\nTissot's a fun example because those are 2 watches that are nearly identical to each other, but one's a quartz and the other is mechanical.  If you don't like Tissot... then Hamilton?  The Khaki Field Quartz 38mm is $540.00 Canadian.  The Khaki Field Mechanical 38mm is $800.  Again... like, wtf?  There are minor differences between them, but that amount of money in difference?",

Not to shit on people that like mechanicals but when what you're selling me is something I have to hand-wind to keep going... which means I have to constantly have it powered or literally set the time almost every time I wear one before I go out of the house, it keeps time less accurately compared to a quartz, and it costs more, it's like... why?  I'm not saying mechanical watches should die off, but it's almost like on paper, the really cheap watches should be mechanicals... and instead it seems to be the other way around.\n\nThere's a whole market of people out there, and I don't want to use \"fashion watch\" as a term for it because that has negative connotations associated with watches that are garbage all around and are built entirely on their marketing campaigns and shit, that see these things as jewelry and fashion, and care far more about how they look than they do about a $400 movement being in one that they will never actually see or look at.  Put that money into the fucking case, the strap/band, the clasp, the dial, the hands, etc... not the thing that nobody actually sees.  Good quality workhorse movement at a good price and not the \"Rolls Royce\" of movements.\n\nI'm not shitting on enthusiasts who do care about movements, but it's kind of like... how come we don't have economy cars that look like $100,000 sports cars?  Can I get the body without the fucking expensive engine with all the horsepower that I'm never going to use because I'm not planning on ever going to a racing track?  Why doesn't that exist?
