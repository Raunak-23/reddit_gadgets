What I mean by that is, instead of having 200 million cars on the road, your 'major' routes get buses (and for longer or more static routes, trains).  Buses travel between fixed points in high-density areas and receive preferential routing and roads, avoiding the requirement for 'novel' problem solving.  Cars are relegated to your last-mile service, getting you to the boonies or off the beaten path.\n\nUnfortunately, 100 years of automotive industry have poisoned Americans against the idea of mass transit.",

      "body": "From the article: Self-driving vehicles are typically loaded up with expensive sensor arrays such as lidar, radar, and high-res cameras. But one DIY builder has shown that for certain closed environments, you can ditch all the fancy gear and still get autonomous driving with just one camera.\n\nYouTuber Austin Blake is one of those people who just happens to have a self-built go-kart lying around at home. After christening it \"Crazy Cart,\" he decided to convert it into his very own self-driving test platform. For this, he first designed a makeshift track laid out on the floor of his workshop using contrasting tape markers. As you can see in the image below, the space is pretty tight, but so is the cart's turning radius.\n\nThen came the hard part \u2013 actually giving Crazy Cart its self-driving skills. For this, Blake employed a technique called behavioral cloning via a trained neural network model. First, he recorded around 15,000 images while manually driving the kart around the track, using the steering angles at each point as training labels. He then fed this data into a convolutional neural network, which learned to associate the image inputs with the corresponding steering directions.\n\nGetting a well-performing model took quite a bit of trial and error. Initial tests failed as the network had trouble distinguishing the track edges and navigating sharp turns. Blake tried data augmentation tricks, tweaking hyperparameters, using multiple cameras, and even adding wide-angle lenses to enhance the field of view.\n\nHowever, the real breakthrough came when he added bright blue tape as an outer border, increasing contrast.\n\nWith the track clearly defined, his creation could autonomously zip around the floor track using just monocular vision \u2013 no expensive sensors required.\n\nWhat it did take, though, was a total of three Arduinos. One relayed the steering predictions from the computer to the second Arduino, which combined that data with positional feedback to operate a motor controlling the steering angle. The third Arduino handled the throttle by feeding control signals to the kart's speed controller.",
