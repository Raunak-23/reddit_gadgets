              "body": "I built an integration to their backend API a few years ago for an internal company portal so that employees could self-service manage their employee paid mobile plans/devices.  I ran into an issue where the integration was failing against their test environment that they had given us credentials for to test ordering devices, etc without actual transactions happening.\n\nSo I escalate and eventually end up on a call with a lead developer on their side and he says \"oh yea, the test environment has been broken for years and no one knows how to fix it.  Just test in production\", which is *not* a good idea so I challenged back \"If I run these test transactions through production won't that result in charges being applied to our account and devices shipped?  how do I flag them as test transactions so that this doesn't happen?\" to which he confidently replies \"Just use this fake address to the North Pole, we have this hard coded in production to automatically cancel the order.  This is how we test internally\".\n\nI take this info back to my management and told them no fuckin way was I going to use my own corporate pcard to run these tests against their prod because I had zero confidence in that working out well for me.  My manager thinks it'll be fine though so gives me his pcard and I'm like okay, whatever, you get to deal with the fallout of this.\n\nYou can probably guess what happened next.  I ran a small test batch of 10 device orders.  We received 4 cancel emails and 6 YOUR ORDER HAS SHIPPED emails.  My boss gets 6x iPhone charges on his pcard for devices shipped with tracking numbers to a fake address at the north pole.  They were unable to cancel those orders because the address was invalid, yet the billing and labels had been printed somehow and the devices left the warehouse never to be seen again.  Fortunately since they never showed as delivered we were able to charge back the billing.\n\nAll that to say... their backend is likely compromised in so many ways that this article doesn't surprise me at all.",

The other back end support folks would \"rotate\" access to it quickly when the main support line wasn't ringing to get tickets if they lost them, needed to add notes/close/delete, didn't auto print, etc.\n\nAs is the norm with your average institution, too many folks demanded access to it and they lost the ability to fully keep a lid on it (rather then upgrade it, guess the status quo was better)\n\nSo one day they can't get into it. We had 3 main campus locations and many satellite locations in town, out of town, and wayyyy out of town. Turns out one of the wayyyyyy out of town locations had a power tripper demanding access to this patchy system of ill repute/poor design and then just... disappeared? (went to lunch most likely)\n\nThat was a hilarious mess. Always had my own work to do between printers or my primary purpose for getting hired in (shuffling box trucks of equipment around for rolling upgrades) but the sheer annoyance/panic of everyone just in the office i'm working in alone i'll never forget \"Hey, is your instance closed?\" Yeah!\" \"yours?\" \"YEAH\" \"yours?!\" \"YES!\"",

Their pay is based heavily off commissions, and they have increasingly unrealistic quotas and metrics they have to meet.\n\nThe system is heavily skewed to ~~force~~ motivate store salespeople to make sales.  If you go into a brick and mortar cell carrier store for help with your account or to just get a new SIM card, you'll discover pretty quickly that none of the staff there will want to help you unless they can *sell* you something. If you walk away from the store without buying anything, it counts negatively on their metrics.\n\nAnd, it's not enough to *just* sell you a new phone. Doing *just* that is also a negative. They also have to try and push a a new line of service on your account. Device insurance. Their family location tracking add-on.  Pet and car trackers that also require separate lines of service. Accessories like chargers, screen protectors, cases and cables (all of which you might already have or can get cheaper somewhere else).  Each sales employee has to sell a certain number of these.  If not, they not only miss out on commission, but they could be shown the door if they don't hit their quotas.\n\nIf you notice every once in a while, people will post on r/ATT, r/Verizon or r/tmobile about how they left a store and discovered they got got charged more than they were told, and their account has add-ons and lines they didn't ask for, this is why. The customer probably needed something basic, and the employee had their back to the wall because they're required to upsell.  So they crammed what they could onto that customer's account, maybe confused the customer with a bunch of doublespeak, and hoped they wouldn't notice long enough for it to stick to their metrics.\n\n**TL;DR: When you already have to be unethical to keep your job, it's not that far of a reach to start selling out customer data you have access to, so someone else can go for device thefts.**\n\nThis is why I tell people to avoid going into a brick and mortar phone shop unless there's some reason you absolutely have to.  If you're buying a new phone, buy it unlocked direct from the company that makes it if you can (like the Apple Store, or direct from Google/Samsung/whatever).  It sucks for anyone working at these shops who maybe don't have any other choice, but going in there puts you in a grift that's a pain to get out of, and your personal data is also at risk too when you're on the employees' radar and they have reason to  access it.",

Many people prefer having packages delivered directly to their homes rather than having to pick them up from a central location or locker. The sheer size and population density of the U.S. make centralized delivery points less practical in many areas. While porch piracy is a known issue, there are several measures being taken to combat it. Some people use security cameras or video doorbells to monitor their porches. Others have packages delivered to secure lockers or use services that allow deliveries to be made inside their homes or garages. Some delivery companies are offering more flexible delivery options to minimize the risk of theft. It\u2019s not that there\u2019s no solution but it\u2019s a balance between convenience and security and different people and areas are adopting various strategies to address the problem.",
