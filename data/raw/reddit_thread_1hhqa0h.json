After the first few customers we had with the new card reader we just took the card from them and placed it in the machine and then talked them through pressing the green button to accept the total and pulling their card out.",

The more simple and longer it's been vetted, the more secure and reliable it is. One of the big reasons for constant vuln patching is *because* software continues to be iterated on and made with increased complexity.\n\nThe hardware vulns you're talking about are largely concentrated in exploits made possible by branch-prediction that makes CPUs more performant. Said older hardware doesn't use fancy techniques like that.\n\nI don't know what system they use for passing data to the mainframes, but I would assume there is a jump-server that resides straddling the network boundary and whose job it is to pass that data safely to the mainframe. The mainframe wouldn't have WAN access and you could even take it a step further where the jump server doesn't even have access to the mainframe outside of firewall rules that get enabled when it's time to settle the accounts at EOB.",

DOS lives on very simple small singletasking computers.\n\nA mainframe is designed to do tens of thousands of things simultaneously without slowing down, while being used by thousands of people simultaneously - both directly with their own terminal and user account, and indirectly i.e interacting with a cash register. Often a mainframe will be pretending to be several different machines via a process called virtualization. So not only do you have multitasking but you have to have exceedingly complex system of permissions and resource allocation.\n\nThat \"green text on black screen\" is a terminal.",

They can spot unusual patterns to detect if employees are stealing. Their inventory integration features inform future purchasing so the store buys the right amount of x and maybe stops buying y altogether because it's not profitable. The far more real time data gives insight into seasonal and even time-of-day trends. \n\nYou can run a donut shop on a metal box with a calculator strapped to it.

There's infant mortality, which weeds out the weak chips early on, but if a solid-state system has run for ten or twenty years it's not unlikely that it will run for ten or twenty more, or fifty, or a hundred. The analog components are more likely to go but those are easily replaceable. A good portion of those are in the power supply and you can easily replace that as a single piece with a modern unit that produces the same voltages.",
