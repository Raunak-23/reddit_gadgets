There\u2019s also a new button under the home button on the right Joy-Con, which had shown up in leaks. The video also appears to show the Joy-Cons being used similarly to a mouse. The kickstand has a new design, too \u2014 it\u2019s shaped more like a U.\n\nNintendo promised to share more in a Direct on April 2nd, 2025.",

Zelda has done insane numbers compared to before the switch - and now they'll probably try to get the same success with Metroid. The franchise will keep selling once it goes big. Then they have created another cash cow franchise. Zelda was popular before the switch but never sold even close to Mario or Pok\u00e9mon games. Now it does.\u00a0\n\n\nThey may also just be launching with Mario kart 9. It's overdue.\u00a0",

                              "body": "Zelda may have a huge swathe of it's games available on the Switch, but the fans have been clamoring for them to port the HD remasters of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess that are trapped on the Wii U since the Switch launched. Whatever other titles there may already be, those are the ones that have been *constantly* requested and never delivered. While I don't necessarily think they'd make something like that a launch title for the Switch 2, I *do* think that they might use it as a very safe bit of padding and release them shortly before the launch for the original Switch, giving the fans who aren't adopting Switch 2 right away a very nice going-away present, while simultaneously giving people who *are* picking up a Switch 2, be it for the first time or as an upgrade, two beloved titles. That way it's not a flagship title for the Switch 2 itself, but it also isn't just a last gasp for the original hardware, and it'll sell copies to both demographics.\n\nThat leaves the door open for Metroid Prime 4 to be upgraded to a 2 release, and/or something like Pokemon Legends Z-A that might be ready to go around that time as well. It wouldn't exactly be a terrible idea to come out the gate swinging with a long-awaited title in a recently revitalized franchise, a hotly anticipated Pokemon release, and round it out with a very safe Mario Kart 9. It also covers a range of bases for launch games with an action/fps title, a pokemon rpg, and a multiplayer racing game. And it bears repeating that backwards compatibility means that even if they're not *new* titles, the entire Switch library is right there for the taking on launch day so you don't run the risk of enthusiastic gamers blowing through stuff too quickly and having nothing else to play on their new consoles. Even things like BOTW/TOTK will probably run a lot smoother on the more powerful hardware, and that's not even mentioning some of the hidden gems for Switch, like Astral Chain, which still looks and plays fantastically.\n\nBasically, with backwards compatibility confirmed, there's room for Nintendo to throw OG Switch owners a few bones at the end of it's life in the form of long-awaited titles that become something like \"backdoor launch titles\" for the Switch 2 because they're still new releases, just not ones built to take full advantage of the new hardware. It's the smart business choice to capture sales from two different markets and keep squeezing money out of the original console for a little longer while simultaneously padding out the \"hot new titles\" that Switch 2 owners can enjoy on day 1.",

They brought me the Super Mario Bros/Duck Hunt with a Zapper and Super Mario 2 & 3, Dr. Mario, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Mega Man 2 all on the suggestion of my cousin who'd had her NES for a while at that point. They also thought they were the same thing, but they went to Electronics Boutique with a written list of games and the name of the console.",

He plays too many video games and already has more than one console. So yeah, doing research basically like you said. \n\nHow much is it going to cost? A few hundred dollars? I live in Portland. A realistic weekend night out that I would actually enjoy would be: a pre-dinner small restaurant to get some light starters at and get in the mood of the night. Mid-range restaurant with a few appetizers. Two or three top end entrees between the two of us. A couple of small desserts at the restaurant, then a dedicated dessert restaurant for the *real* desserts with some shakes to wind down. \n\nDo you honestly think we'd be able to do that for less than like $500? With generous tips included? No way. And I don't play video games so the money he'd spend on this console could be used for both of us to actually enjoy a night out. And that's not even *close* to being a top-end dining experience. \n\nAnd yeah, he's taking me out. I'm not paying for it. I don't have a job. Is it unheard of for the man to take his gf out for dinner? Well if he spends all his money on a new video game console then we certainly couldn't do that could we? So we're supposed to never go out just so he can play *more* video games when he already has video games?",

So you'd lose a single night out.\n\nAll our money is pooled so pocket money auto transfers out each week into our own accounts. That's guilt free money. Seems you have expectations on what your BF does with his.\n\nOr maybe, ya'know, set up a sub account and throw a bit in each month until you have enough?\n\nHope the tariffs don't bite you.",

It was outdated before it came out. The graphics, resolution, storage, framerates, etc are all 5-generation-old technology, and playing it is painful. My original comment about hoping for 1080p in 2025 is absolutely true and hilarious. The follow up comment about thinking about it as a home console is also just as legitimate, because it's their only console, it comes with a dock built to be permanently be hooked up to a TV, and the console is clearly built to live in it. It's how it charges, it's how the \"highest\" resolution it offers is output, it's how the thing is pictured on the box! lol. It is Nintendo's only console for almost the last 10 years - apart from their other version of the same console...without the dock - the handheld version.",

Modern phones are tasked with doing tons more than a gaming OS/game is, and their payment model is stypically subsidized by mandatory service plans. It's not an apples:apples situation, but that doesn't change the fact that Nintendo's decision not to upgrade the APU when they did the OLED refresh has resulted in a \"modern\" console that cannot reliably run games designed for last gen's console hardware.\n\nNintendo has been focusing more on innovation than raw power for several generations, and they've been successful in doing so outside of the Wii U. They know what they're doing and they're still going to get my money despite my critique here...what am I going to do, tell my kids they can't play next gen Mario Party because Dad is a butthurt tech hobbyist nerd?",

I dont get why you guys wanna overpay for outdated hardware , when playstation portable and steam deck exists. I get that nintendo gate keeps all their games so you can only play them on their console so they force you to buy their shit too but imo they're a really shitty company that releases shitty under performing hardware ,and force people who like them to pay a premium for it. They have done so much scummy shit i cant support them i dont know why anyone would. Theres a reason mario games from 2004 still go for $60 on the nintedo store people are fucking dumb.",
