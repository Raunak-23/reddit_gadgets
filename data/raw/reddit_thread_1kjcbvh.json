It seems to have helped the nurses a fair amount from what I heard.\n\nYou know what would actually help speed up waits, improve care, and reduce costs for patients and clinics? Not sticking to this outdated, expensive, and inefficient daily dose clinic model that requires people to spend ~ 10 hours a week in a waiting room.\n\nIt really sucks for tons of jobs and/or trying to build a career once your back on your feet because there are always times your stuck for hours while they deal with messed up paperwork or billing or signing something, oh and appointments they schedule and don\u2019t tell you.\n\nAnyways not meaning to rant; I guess any improvement is a step in the right direction. Its just such an unpleasant system to go thru but it really does wonders for people and getting their lives back so you put up with it. Most of us just want to live normal, productive and peaceful lives and being on MAT people think you collect welfare fraudulently and steal scrap metal all day.\n\nOne day maybe I\u2019ll be able to just pick up my prescription once a month like the regular person I am rather than an inmate in the med line.",

We opened at 4:30 AM and the line with our two nurses at the dispensing window moved so insanely slow, I had people that started work at 8 sitting in the waiting room at 5 hoping they\u2019d get their dose in time. It was a terrible system, but we were completely hamstrung by state laws that I\u2019m fairly certain were written by the Moral Majority.\n\nIt\u2019s fairly clear that the model was designed to be punitive to addicts and to set them up for continued failure.",
