It was fun at first, but then stuff stops working as expected, custom launchers aren\u2019t as snappy, and I just defaulted to.. the default. Then there were other things that just made the whole operating system feel like a jumbled mess, or a house of cards built by 20 people with differing opinions on card-house-architecture. Little things really added up. The final nail in the coffin was reaching out to support (for a different issue) using the Google one app (you have to PAY for support btw). When it opened the support ticket, it did so in an inaccessible window in Google chrome. I could hear the agent join the chat and send a message, then leave the chat about 5 mins later. Then they wouldn\u2019t let me open a new support ticket because that one just closed. It\u2019s not like I was using the Samsung browser or anything (not that that should cause issues as it\u2019s the *default configuration* the phone ships with). I was trying to contact **google** about an issue with one of **google\u2019s** digital products, through **google** support and a **google** browser.  Whole software \u201cpipeline\u201d was Google operated, but it still didn\u2019t work. Bought an iPhone that same day.",

All Qualcomm SoC phones have that in common. Which is why the only devices you see with a longer support window are non-Qualcomm SoCs. One of those being iPhones.\n\nLuckily Google is now making their own SoCs starting with the Pixel 7 so Qualcomm can't force them into a shorter support window. I don't know why the Pixel 7's support window is so short though.",

It is nowhere near replacing official support and more often than not gives people a false sense of security.\n\nA lot of the time those are essentially skins. They cannot replace the kernel of the OS because that requires either access to the SoC driver source code or reverse engineering it. Which means that you're still running an old out of support OS on your device with associated security issues. Heartbleed a few years ago was a huge issue because patching it required patching the kernel.\n\nThe exceptions are distributions like LineageOS. They reverse engineer the SoC drivers, allowing them to update the kernel. But that is hit or miss because those builds usually don't pass the full suite of tests that Google provides for official builds.",
