Furthermore, Apple attempted two years of Mini and both did not meet their monetary expectations and sales were not as high as their other devices. Only way I can *possibly* see the Mini making a return is having one iPhone as the standard (which they won\u2019t do) and then the Pro models. I held out hope for the SE considering they can lose some profit there but as we can see, that is not the case and they have doubled down on bigger devices. I do hope they prove me wrong someday.",

They were rife with battery issues and often experienced premature death.  The minis had the shortest lifetime out of all of our iPhone models.\n\nThe SE, however, were reasonably popular, but that was more due to pricing (free with contract) than size.  Users often lamented the size, only a minority sought it.  It's a shame, because I prefer the smaller size myself.  I would love a consistent 4.9-5 inch cell phone.",
