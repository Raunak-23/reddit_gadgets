The dimensions of the original iphone would allow for a 5 inch screen if the screen covered the entire front of the device. Personally I think that's big enough. There really isn't much extra you can do on a 6 or 7 inch screen that you can do on a 5 inch screen. For anything beyond basic functionality I'll just use another device anyway. I'd much rather have the option of carrying around a smaller phone, but nobody seems interested in makeing them anymore, unless it's a folding phone, which is still way too expensive and fragile.",

Last year I upgraded my 2017 model phone to a 2023 model phone and while it has a nicer camera and bigger screen and is somewhat snappier in performance it has made almost zero difference in my life. I only upgraded because the old phone's touch screen stopped working (not from external damage.)\n\nThere's absolutely no consumer need for a new model every year, but it's necessary from the producer perspective so we just get a bunch of changes for change's sake.",
