Like I said, the profitability model is gonna be more like a laptop than a console or the steamdeck.\n\nAny SteamOS console that tries to compete with Xbox/PS5 will have a bunch of hurdles, the least of which will be a necessarily higher price. A lack of DRM and Anticheat support will be much bigger obstacles, and not one that consumers that would traditionally buy consoles would be willing to put up with.",
