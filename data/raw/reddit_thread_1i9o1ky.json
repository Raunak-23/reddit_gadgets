Fittingly Xbox is in some ways based of the Sega consoles.\n\nMicrosoft collaborated with Sega on the Dreamcast (notice it has a compatible with windows CE thing on the front). You can see the original Xbox controller looking very similar to the Dreamcast controller too.\n\nSega would develop arcade machines and turn those arcades into home consoles. For example the Sega Naomi arcade is very similar to the Dreamcast.\n\nOne of the followups to the Naomi was the Sega chihiro which is based off the Xbox. (they also had another one, the Sega triforce which is based in gamecube).\n\nSo yeah Microsoft and Sega had a connection and the xbox is basically the spiritual successor to the Sega consoles.\n\nTook over their businesses and ended up going down the same route lol",

I mean the sega saturn using discs in the early 90s was wild, then playsation came along and everyone flocked to it. So then sega dropped the dream cast with just stupid graphics for the time, and features we still haven't seen again since like save cards that were mini hand held consoles you could play the level you saved on. The thing was wild and i drooled over every inch of the display model. I actually think thats why i quit playing video games is because i was never fortunate enough to get one and then sega went to the background for a long while.\n\nEdit: man please guys i had no idea of all the online stuff or extras.... i never had one and now im stupid jealous of all you luck s.o.b. punks lol. One day i will not be poor and i will live out the dreams of 10 y.o. me.",

                      "body": "Sega consoles are definitely really cool.\n\nEven before the Saturn, Sega had the Sega CD already back in 1991.\n\nAnd the gamegear in 1991 could play a bunch of master system games through ports and from what I can read with an adapter it could run master system cartridges  directly. They basically had home console games on the go already back then.\n\nThe save card thing is a really cool idea. Nintendo did something similar with Pokemon HGSS on the DS, you had a little step counter with a screen that you could transfer your pokemon too and walk around with it irl. Worked a bit like a tamagotchi from what I've seen. But that's like 10 years after the dreamcast did it. \n\nDreamcast is still a pretty cool system today because it doesn't have much copy protection which means you can make your own games and run it on the Dreamcast directly. Some people still develop small indie games for it.\n\nI've been wanting one for a while, they're not unaffordable but still a bit too expensive imo for a retro console.",

Think about it - this entire time we've had no more than 3 main competitors in the console space and eventually one of them drops out. We had Nintendo vs. Sega vs. Atari - Atari eventually drops out. Then we had Nintendo vs. Sony vs. Sega - Sega eventually drops out. Then we had Nintendo vs. Sony vs. Microsoft - now it looks like Microsoft is dropping out? The only reason why Nintendo didn't drop out completely is because of their legendary IPs and their ability to pivot to the Wii and then the Switch.\n\nThe difference now is that it is *significantly* more expensive to enter the console business, meaning it would be highly unlikely we see a third competitor in the console space ever again.",

Another one might be Valve as a complement to their current hardware projects but Valve seems more focused on creating an open platform with steam OS. Asus maybe, since they have been focusing on gaming devices with their ROG phone and handheld. The issue is that none of these companies really make their own games so it's kinda weird to enter the console business if you can't make any unique games to go along with it. Valve kinda could but it's not really their style.\n\nSomething really interesting would be if a Chinese company bought it up like Tencent but I don't think the US would allow it.",

That would sell a Microsoft made handheld. \n\nAnd while everyone's talking about what the Dreamcast brought to the table and what it did to change consoles as a whole, in more ways than have been discussed so far and also just so many ways that PlayStation and Microsoft should both be eternally thankful for the trail that Sega Blazed. The online store. Not just being able to play online but actually having a store online that you could buy items for in game play. One of the biggest titles on Dreamcast and one of the most forgotten games that probably Rockstar took a lot of notes from, was Shenmue. That was an amazing game if you look back at it. That game took place in real time. If I remember correctly time truly went by the same as it does in reality. It's been a hell of a long time since I've played that game but that was \"game changer\" for sure. No pun intended at all. That was the first game I ever played that had Free World range away from the main story, along with having mini games in side of the game. You probably wouldn't be able to play pool, or poker, or pin the tail on the fucking donkey in GTA/RDR or similar games if it weren't for this game. I think it was four discs? I'm not sure. In that era of my life was kind of a blur and I had a Dreamcast and a 64 and I'll let a friend that his 5-year-old play it so we can get all go outside and get drunk and whatnot and big surprise, all of my Dreamcast games were scratched up and my Nintendo 64 was not even capable of playing games anymore somehow. And yeah I felt some type of way about it. But I couldn't be mad because what did I expect from a 5 year old. I was too busy getting drunk with his dad and the rest of our friends. But losing Shenmue and losing my Dreamcast, is up there with lightning striking the antenna  of my house.....while playing ChronoTrigger on SNES. It fried the game and the system. I was on my third time playing through the game to see what ending I could come up with. I know they came out with Chrono cross on Playstation but it didn't compare. Ultimately I think final fantasy is pretty much what came of Chrono trigger. And I wish that I had gone out and bought another copy immediately. Over the years I would go into GameStop and ask if they had a copy and most of them just looked at me like I was crazy for asking for this fabled game. I actually saw one on eBay still in the hard plastic box at Walmart keeps them in.... unopened... and I think someone was wanting $10,000 for it. For that price it better have had the walk-through guide as well. Haha",

Xbox wasn't king though, they were being eaten by their red rings. Sony did a masterplay by losing on the PS3 hardware to win, yes they won, the format war. They just didnt realize physical media was soon to be going away too.. and Sony just announced they are halting productions of most of the physical media, and they have already shown the new playstation having an optional drive on it. Xbox is gone bro, and consoles have become way closer to PCs than before which is part of microsofts reasoning to stop trying to make a home console.",

Isn\u2019t it weird how Sony reports sales numbers for decades while MS only reports sales until the next new console comes out? I wonder what impression Sony is trying to give off to people who don\u2019t actually compare year-by-year? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s crazy that the reported number for ps2s is updated to last year, and Xbox hasn\u2019t reported 360 numbers in a decade? Surely you aren\u2019t comparing these numbers directly lmao\n\nThe PS3 famously didn\u2019t sell more than the xbox360, even Sony has been quoted saying it was a flop, and reported sales long into the ps4\u2019s generation to appeal to investors (even though a lot of those sales were wholesale, for example to the government due to parallelizing cpus). Keep in mind this was also the time when the psvita was tanking, Sony was doing everything it could to keep a grip on its market share\n\nYou aren\u2019t putting in the effort to actually compare these things in good faith, and are just looking at surface level numbers to make a point that doesn\u2019t logically line up. Bigger number doesn\u2019t mean it sold better. I said I haven\u2019t bought a console in forever to show I don\u2019t have a horse in the race, plus I had both consoles at the time.

At best not owning up to a simple mistake, at worst moving the goalposts to the point of changing the entire point you were making). Even if you want to pivot and say you personally don\u2019t care about the Xbox exclusives, Halo\u2019s popularity alone proves that people were buying consoles almost solely for the unique games. It\u2019s literally the progenitor of the modern FPS game template. \n\nI\u2019m not unfamiliar with the year over year numbers, which is why I\u2019m asserting not asking: Xbox 360 outsold the PS3 consistently for the entire duration of its production. Sony started liquidating consoles wholesale bc consoles are sold at a loss and they lose even more money by having them sit in warehouses, and there was military value in parallel computing. That led to a bump of a few million sales despite no longer being in production and years after the release of the PS4, when there\u2019s no demand in the consumer market for a PS3 anymore. After, Sony took advantage of the optics, and published its sales numbers now that they had exceeded the last posted Xbox 360 number, so they could tell investors and idiots like you who don\u2019t pay attention that the PS3 outsold the Xbox 360. It\u2019s a very simple marketing move that you\u2019re falling for like a bag of rocks.",

You are clueless to say such bs, try reading that wiki link and see how some repair shops were getting thousands of units and the big 3 resellers had internal estimates of failure rates around 30%. That is not just an oops.\nMicrosoft fell off because of that, they were only ever king of the hill in the eyes of the fan boys. I used to be one of them. They have never been a top hardware seller, game publisher, or anything top in the gaming market. So their throw in with the switch is sus at best, their CEOs opinion is only marketing to keep xbox relevant.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLook up top selling games, not a single sony or microsoft exclusive, but most are nintendo exclusives. Minecraft on PC is king there.\n\n\nLook up top selling game hardware, PS2 is #1, PS3 is #8, 360 is #9. The top 10 shows the 360 was the peak of microsoft, and it was actually a very weak peak propped up to grandeur by fanboys like you.\u00a0",

You can make whatever assumption and guess you want, but calling me a liar is ridiculous when I\u2019m telling you exactly what Nintendo told me lmao.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m not going to read a wiki as proof of anything. Every console has dumb faults especially release versions. The PS5\u2019s big fan gets clogged and overheats, the PS4 is loud as hell when it does anything more than sit on the main menu, the ps3 was a nightmare for devs to make games for and with little to no documentation. None of these are \u201cjust oops\u201d they\u2019re notable technical flaws.\n\nYou can say whatever you want, MS is still higher on the Fortune 500 than Sony, they didn\u2019t \u201cfall off\u201d by any metric. You\u2019re objectively wrong about never being a top hardware seller (ignoring that it\u2019s a game industry not a hardware industry and hardware is sold at a loss anyway)\n\nYou can\u2019t use game sales to indicate anything here lmao. There\u2019s no correlation here, they\u2019re not substitute goods\n\nYou can\u2019t use the console sales wiki page to directly compare numbers either. The ps2 tracked sales from 2000 to 2024, the Xbox 360 is 2005 to 2013 (when the xb1 launched). Just because they didn\u2019t tell us the 2015 sales doesn\u2019t mean there are 0 sales\n\nI\u2019m not a fanboy just bc you don\u2019t have basic data analysis skills. You\u2019re acting like that test they do for kids with the fat cup vs the tall cup and the kid says the tall cup holds more, this is 4th grade stuff",
