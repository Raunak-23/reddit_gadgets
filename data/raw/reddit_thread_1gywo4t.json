I'm talking about 1000. it's very useful when you work on massively parallel operations such as matrix manipulation. So it's great for machine learning and deep learning (if the optimization can be re-written in matrix operations), but not so great if you do iterations where the next one depends on the previous iteration (MCMC). \n\nPlus the data transfer between GPU and RAM is still a gigantic bottle neck. For most stuff CPU based computations will be faster and much simpler. I tried to run CUDA based algorithms on our GPU (P-100) and it was a hassle to get it running compared to CPU based algorithms.",

I would agree that the average gamer shouldn't do this, but it made perfect sense for me. A lesser GPU just wouldn't cut it - even with the 4090 I'm hitting performance limits trying to run heavy games while capturing/recording, and my live broadcasts hit technical issues because the PC starts lagging when I tab out to use other apps. My type of work is a constant arms race in terms of hardware trying to keep up with the heavy games and increasingly complex live production tools!",

It's not just about render time, it's about what can be loaded on to the card. \n\nAs the automotive industry is moving more and more in to Unreal Engine, animations are done a lot quicker and with heavy scenes (forests, cities etc) again, the 24gb of GPU memory handles it without problem.\n\nAs for render farms, I just finished an animation job and was using Chaos Cloud because it's a one button solution and nothing else supported some of the plugins I was using. To render 300 frames @ 1440p  cost around 600 credits which works out around $600.

My build was 7700k and 1080Ti, I bought them because that was the fastest gaming setup at the time. The 1080Ti was so fast in particular that I could run every single game at absolute max settings at 3440x1440 and almost always top out over 100fps. \n\nI'll probably upgrade when the 5090 comes out. Build a 9800X3D, 5090, really fuckin fast PC. Yes, it'll be eye-wateringly expensive, but it will hopefully have some sort of similar mileage to my current PC, I don't feel like settling for middle-of-the-road because in 3 or 4 years it will be behind the curve.\n\nI'm disappointed that there will never be a 1080Ti equivalent. I paid $1300 here in Australia, and if I wanted to buy a 4090 right now I'd be paying around $3000.",
