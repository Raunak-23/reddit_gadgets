I have the opposite experience since Nvidia is pretty hit or miss on Linux and AMD drivers are quite good and you also have the option of building software such as Stable Diffusion (Don't really use it since I didn't find it to be very useful as a drawing aid, it seems to be mostly geared as a drawing replacement, but I've tested it.) with ROCM yourself as a replacement for CUDA in order to effectively use your gpu.",
