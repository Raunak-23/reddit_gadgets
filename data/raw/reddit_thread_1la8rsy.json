          "body": "Ok I fed the site to ChatGPT and this was the answer\n\nHere\u2019s a clear summary of \u201cVanMoof\u2019s new S6 e\u2011bikes fix everything but trust\u201d (published June 10, 2025):\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83d\udeb2 Key Points\n\n1. Relaunch under new management\n\t\u2022\tThe S6 and S6 Open mark VanMoof\u2019s first e\u2011bike models since its 2023 bankruptcy and acquisition by McLaren\u202fApplied. They cost \u20ac3,298 and are available to pre\u2011order now (with an \u20ac150 refundable deposit), shipping expected in August in Europe, and rolling out to the UK and US later  \ufffc.\n\n2. Mission: fix past issues\n\t\u2022\tVanMoof aims to rebuild trust by improving reliability, ride quality, and ease of repair. A three-year warranty backs that promise  \ufffc.\n\n3. Smooth mechanical upgrades\n\t\u2022\tThe bikes include a fully mechanical 3-speed AutoShift hub (no electronics), bright battery indicators, modular wiring for simpler servicing, quieter audio alerts, and core VanMoof perks like the Boost button, Kick Lock, and integrated lighting  \ufffc.\n\n4. Custom accessories & ride comfort\n\t\u2022\tEach bike includes a Slimlink phone mount by Peak Design, with an optional 30\u202fmm-travel suspension seatpost (also retrofittable on older models)  \ufffc.\n\n5. Enhanced anti-theft protection\n\t\u2022\tThe updated anti-theft system offers finer-grained tracking and includes a free year of recovery subscription (\u201cbike hunter\u201d program) that recovers or replaces stolen bikes within 14 days  \ufffc.\n\n6. Battery and weight details\n\t\u2022\tBoth bikes feature a non-removable (but serviceable) 487\u202fWh Panasonic battery integrated into the frame. Charging from 25\u2013100\u202f% takes about four hours. The S6 weighs ~23.5\u202fkg with 27.5\u2033 wheels; the lower-step S6 Open weighs ~22.5\u202fkg with 24\u2033 wheels  \ufffc.\n\n7. Availability & support\n\t\u2022\tLaunching in the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Belgium\u2014with UK later\u2014VanMoof supports these models through 250+ bike shops and 130 sales partners across 13 countries. UK and U.S. service and sales rollouts are planned  \ufffc.\n\n\u2e3b\n\n\ud83e\udde0 Verdict\n\nThe S6 series fixes almost all past technical and usability issues, delivering a smoother, quieter, more user-friendly ride. But the central challenge remains: can VanMoof win back consumer trust, especially at a premium price point? The extended warranty, improved service structure, and strong new lineup indicate they\u2019re making all the right moves\u2014but time will tell.",

The most damning one being that the drive train would need to be connected to the wheel that steers the bike. That takes a hell of a lot more engineering than slapping a sprocket on the back wheel and using a chain. \n\nThe power ratio issue between front and rear is very different between an e-bike and a motorcycle, so the primary problem a front wheel motor poses on an e-bike is control. Electric motors have exceptional acceleration. When that acceleration hits on the back wheel, you have more control over the bike. When it hits on the front, you have less control as that wheel will want to go the direction it\u2019s headed, rather than being led by a different force (I.e. a different wheel that gets steered). \n\nIt\u2019s one of those things that most people wouldn\u2019t think about unless they spent 30 minutes on one and then 30 minutes on the other. VanMoof putting a motor on the front wheel and divorcing the electric motor from the chain drive shows they\u2019ve spent 0 minutes on either.",

Everything you say might be true from a technical standpoint, but I haven\u2019t found any e-bike that comes even close to the feeling of a VanMoof. My other bike (an Urban Arrow) has a motor at the crankset that helps you pedal. That feels like something is helping you pedal. The VanMoof feels more like something is slightly pushing you or pulling you while the pedaling feel \u201dnormal\u201d. That\u2019s the best way I can explain it.

It's generally done to ensure the rear can be fitted with a gear hub without running into space issues.  \n  \nBut it does have some drawbacks:  \n  \n1. It feels like you are being pulled, a rear wheel engine feels like being pushed which is a more natural feeling, as that is similar to having the wind in your back.\n  \n2. Higher chance of slip in corners, which can make you lose grip in turns and fall, especially on wet roads. \n  \n3. More vibrations in the front make for a less comfortable ride.  \n  \n4. Worse EMC behavior and some efficiency losses as there need to be long motor cables running through your frame.  \n  \n  \nSome advantages these front/rear hub motors have over mid engines (Bosch et cetera) is that they are quiet, cheap, look slick,  deliver power independent of the users' gear settings and can do recuperation in some cases.",

They have anti-dumping laws so no bikes can really be made in China, so you're talking higher manufacturers costs compared to ones you can buy in the US. They're also sold through bike shops, which have higher margins than internet sales here. The entry level Trek Verve+ is 1850\u00a3, or $2,500 in the UK, for example.\n\n$3k also isn't anywhere near the \"upper part of the spectrum\" for road bikes, either. You can't even get the base level carbon road bike from Trek for that price.",

Post a bunch of links to internet-only brands.\n\nAs for the road bike, you said $3,000 was in the upper limits of road bikes which is.... demonstrably false.
