      "body": "A couple of questions really.\n\n- Are the rates of vulnerabilities and exploits higher than the average for such devices?\n- Are the compromised devices delivered in that state or does it happen after they have been in use for a bit?\n- Is security for these devices increasing or decreasing?\n- Are these built-in exploits or are these failures of programming and bad security?\n\nI've used TP-Link network equipment and found them to be more stable and hardened than many alternatives. If these aren't designed backdoors and the devices are as good or better than the competition then why ban them?\n\nAccording to an [article linked](https://www.techspot.com/news/105414-tp-link-routers-center-massive-botnet-used-takeover.html) in the current article:\n\n> The hackers exploit a vulnerability in the routers to gain remote code execution capability, although the specific exploit method is still under investigation.\n\nSo this seems to be just a normal run-of-the-mill exploited vulnerability, something that should be patched but not something that should be banned under the guise of national security. This seems like a trade war instead of safety concerns.",

I was only ever able to retrieve data from a small target program I wrote that continuously hammered a \"flag\" into the CPUs memory cache and share that memory address with the program exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nThus, unless someone is actively exploiting something and gaining access to systems, I pay very little attention to reported vulnerabilities.",

You should have to hold down a reset button or use a designated physical connection or similar. Unfortunately, sometimes people put this kind of crap in and allow it to be accessed remotely without adequate safeguards.",

Conspiracy or not, but this is likely shrouded in the fact the govt can't MITM TP-Link, but they can other brands. I'd also say it's retaliatory after the telecom hack. Have to show \"strong\" on China. The government never actually updates their own stuff, it's very hypocritical how outdated half the US government infrastructure is. Everyone knows how hacky they are running on a shoestring budget. It's not a secret. \n\nNone of the TPLink devices I've ever used (Cameras/routers/switches/Wireless APs) have ever called home randomly. However, other brands in my house create over 5% of overall traffic calling home. I monitor and actively block these things, but TPLink is absolutely the least of my concerns.",
