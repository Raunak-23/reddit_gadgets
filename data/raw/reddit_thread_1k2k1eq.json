So after building a business alongside a host of industry partners they now want to try monetize and fuck them over with what I\u2019m sure will be some kind of approved list given a jazzy name like Synology Preferred Hard Drive Vendors. My guess is they think they are so big they will be able to either charge the vendors a fee for playing along or they can manufacture their own platters for less cost and market them as somehow being more premium. Tests will go on to confirm that the house brand drives are (spoiler) exactly the same as every other friggen drive ever manufactured. CEO will be fired for not staying true to the company values but the same shitty board will remain. The replacement CEO will jump in promise to right the ship and get us back closer to the community and customers needs. Meantime the preferred partners and shitty house brand drives will remain. Other NAS manufacturers will split down the line, they will either copy Synology in this route or they will promise to always give customers the choice of user their own drives. Meanwhile the shitty run of the mill house brand drives will remain. So my question is, how does this tremendous wankfest drive NAS technology forward? My answer is it probably doesn\u2019t, but it might make a buck.",
