In most games, that means control stick on left, main buttons on right.\n\nI don't envy Sony's position on this.  You can bet they'd like to be able to provide something more ergonomic, as evinced by how they finally gave up the PS1 grips for something more Xbox-like, but I think they're aware that their fanbase would be out for blood if they fixed the left analog stick's legacy position after all these decades.",

A kind of sheepish hybrid between that early effort and what the other makers had cooking.  As much as I liked the Wavebird, I didn't like the variously-sized primary buttons or the octagonal stick resistor.  Vestiges that Nintendo couldn't immediately abandon.\n\nIt is a good observation, though.  It suggests that Nintendo's insistence upon symmetry was part of the marketing package they came up with for the Wii.",

Never owned an Xbox for this reason and hate the fact that the Switch pro controllers moved the stick. That said, I also find the dualsense less comfortable and ergonomic than the dualshock 4. I was one of the first to offer my thoughts about the DS and found criticism from both sides of the fence.\n\nThat being said, the real path forward, imo, is to make both sticks, the 4 face buttons, and the dpad magnetically interchangeable. The reality is there will always be people on either side, and the first to introduce such a feature will win the game. It will also open the path for increased comfort for left-handed individuals.",

What is more likely to happen, especially within the context of this very thread, is some kind of inter-compatibility between platforms and pads, which, even if arrived at through a third party device, is left alone by the first parties.\n\nSince Microsoft has already made the first significant move (Gamepass) in the inevitable transition away from core consoles, this inter-compatibility may well end up being resolved _de facto_ when both parties are simply hosting each of their platforms as Gamepass/Gamepass clone on PC-compatible hardware.",

At that time, I looked into how to change the battery, and also fix the drift, and all the details of taking them apart, and it became very clear that they changed a lot of things.  The old battery was larger and the sticks were better protected from dust.  And looking back to PS2 and XB360, those NEVER had stick drift issues for however many ~~years~~ *decades* this is now.\n\nThings are just built to lower standards now.",

I didn't play a huge amount of Wii (mostly just used it for exercise and Skyward Sword) but I played a ton of PS2 with two different controllers, mostly Final Fantasy 7, 8, 9 and X but also a bunch of Gran Turismo 2, THPS2, DMC and so many other games that I forget. It's PS2, there were so many good games.\n\nThe only time I've ever had to replace a controller was last year when my infant daughter drooled on a thumbstick and her drool nuked the logic board (I took it apart, I fix things for a living). I still have the spares which will come in handy if I do experience drift in future.\n\nI played a fuck ton of Xbox but only the OG and almost all of that was using the Duke controllers (yes, I liked them). Never had a single issue. Played the absolute shit out of the first two Halo games but also Splinter Cell, THPS2X, Fusion Frenzy and a ton of other games, most of which I imported from Canada because it was cheaper. \n\nYou can think I'm a liar but I'm not. Idk what to say, I've never had stick drift. I never abused my controllers either, so idk if those are related. I just play and don't have issues. I think I've had a sticky bumper before but I forget what controller that was, probably my X360 one. I used that for ages. Both of my PS2 controllers still work great but the thumbsticks have started to deteriorate, not the function, just the rubber on the outside.\n\nMy nunchucks are absolutely fucked though because they were stored in a closet that got water damaged.",

Even if 1% of potentiometers produced are a bad/subpar batch, that's still a lot of bad units given the scale of production.\n\nE.g. xbox series x/s sold 30 million units. That's 60 million potentiometers. 1% is 600k bad units. Usually only one stick starts drifting so there are about 600k controllers with a bad potentiometer that will drift early. And since people are more likely to complain, you will more likely hear from the 600k people who have a drifting xbox controller. And if the parts have a higher failure rate, the number only goes up.\n\nNote: my numbers aren't meant to accurate, just to illustrate the scale that even 1% of subpar parts affect hundreds of thousands of people.",

I have replaced quite a few of them over the years for friends who go ham on theirs.  Yes normal wear and tear can cause stick drift, but not pressing so hard on both the edges when rotating, or down when activating makes this happen significantly less. Pressing harder or sharper cause the wear and tear of the device as described in the video you linked.... The fact that you can watch this video and not understand that how you take care of your controller GREATLY affects how long it will last. This whole video is pointing that out and somehow you're not getting it lol.  If you are going through controllers all the time. The issue is somewhere between the thumbsticks and the chair.",

Which is why playing these games can result in causing stick drift... \n\n  \nWhat I am saying is... It's possible to still play these games and not 'press' 'move' 'rotate' as hard as some people do and your controller will last longer. This is because it causes less friction within the thumbstick... as pointed out in the video you linked...\n\n  \nSome people grip their controller VERY hard when they are playing these types of games. You don't HAVE to do this. if you dont... your controller will last longer. \n\n  \nSeriously this is insane to me this is not obvious to you.",

That being said they\u2019re extremely unremarkable, it\u2019s like the ultimate \u201cstock\u201d controller, and you can definitely do better for around the same price. \n\nMore than anything though, their elite controllers are the ones that are insulting. Horribly over.priced and horribly unreliable, and they don\u2019t even perform well. Just about any good controller that\u2019s half its price blows the elite controller out of the water, but knowing Microsoft I know that a non-dogshit version of the elite controller would probably cost an extra $100 somehow because at the price of the elite it\u2019s not even good to begin with",

Gyroscope is a 1:1 input modality, but it only allows for precise aiming, not comfortably doing 180s. \n\nFlick stick makes up for this lack of comfortable 180s by treating the right joystick as a sort of compass. North is where the player is currently looking. Tap north (forward) on the right joystick and nothing happens. South is 180 degrees behind the player. Tap south and the player turns 180 degrees (and this is now the new North). You can also rotate the stick in a circle to keep turning.\n\nThe Team Fortress 2 player SolarLight made a great video on the subject which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJIqEX93vL8)",

                                  "body": "Personally, I wouldn't say mid, they just produce a wider variety of games than PS. Some of those genres aren't as popular, so it's not always as flashy. \n\nFor the games you mentioned, Forza Motorsport has a whiny community, but most players just get on with it and have a good time, the game reviewed well. Starfield was the first Bethesda game I ever enjoyed after bouncing off the four games they put out before it. Halo Infinite also reviewed well initially, it was the post launch support that did it in. \n\nBut you're forgetting gems like Age of Empires 4, Psychonauts 2, Forza Horizon 5, Pentiment, Grounded, Deathloop, & HiFi Rush. This isn't even getting into some of the truly deserved remasters (games that needed it) like Quake 1 & 2, several Dooms, and Age of Empires 2. These were just the titles that stood out to me. \n\nMy point being, Microsoft puts out plenty of games. It doesn't feel that way because most people aren't interested in such a wide variety of games, so only a few appeal to each person's taste. But if all you want is high production, narrtivie lead, 3rd person action games, there is a platform that just focuses on that, or at least used to and is probably busy refocusing on it.",

Granted if you're not within the Steam ecosystem for most of your games (why?) it may be a bit more of an issue. \n\nErgonomics I definitely don't agree with personally, I find the XBox controllers far less comfortable to use in general. Alltogether I think each of them is very well suited to different people, and neither of them has any major ergonomic flaws. It's really more a matter of preference than anything.",

Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers would be nice, especially if they were implemented in a way that makes it relatively straightforward to make the functionality cross-platform since that would encourage PC titles to adopt those features if they know the most popular PC controller supports them. But really what I want more than anything is gyro because the industry refuses to universally support gyro aim assist as long as that feature isn\u2019t supported by Xbox, their controllers have been holding the whole industry back by 10-15 years and it\u2019s time for them to catch up to every other controller on the market.",

Just the controller won me over in the PS1 days, and almost nothing else besides their terrible controllers keeps me from owning an xbox. Nintendo has the same problem, but I tend not to play as seriously on Nintendo so it's not as important. \n\nIf everyone wants their controllers to feel like Sony's, it goes past the features into the form. Because the thing about Sony's controllers that makes them feel good, has been the same since the first one. And to know what that is, all you have to do is look at an xbox or Nintendo controller, look at a Sony controller, identify what's the sole difference, then look at your hands, and there's the answer. Because I don't know about anyone else on the planet, but my thumbs are in the same place on each hand. I am not a crab, I don't have one finger thats an inch longer at a different angle. My hands are mostly symmetrical, so the controller should be too. All the haptic feedback and sensors and crap in the world do not make the controller itself feel better.",
