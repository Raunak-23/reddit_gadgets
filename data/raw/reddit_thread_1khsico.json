And so, so, SO many PC gamers are extraordinarily frustrated Nvidia just completely refused to push the envelope aside from their 5090.\n\nThey\u2019ve become the new Intel CPU division.\n\nDefinitely all that money from AI accelerator GPUs being sold for data centers have completely taken higher priority for the company\u2026 and left the PC gaming industry out to dry.",

Through various benchmarks comparison I watched on YouTube, the performance of RTX 1650 is about half of RTX 4060.\n\nAny games can be played on either GPU. The problem though is AAA+ game developers are pushing out more un-optimized higher graphic fidelity that most average players didn't asked for, and nVidia is just cashing in on this.\n\nAll the players need to do is to stop buying over-priced GPU, and to demand for optimized AAA+ games on day one.",
