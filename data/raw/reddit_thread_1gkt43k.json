I feel like the time to do that though is either at the end of wave 6 which the time has passed to do that, or when they reveal the next Mario kart to get people hyped and still have something for switch 1 owners too. The mk team might be too focused on the new game to do something like that though unfortunately.",

Kart64 has a slew of fairly unique ones that would be fun to see given a modern update.  Koopa Beach, the jungle one, and Bowser\u2019s Castle are the ones that spring most readily to mind.  DoubleDash has a bunch too like Mushroom City, Mushroom Bridge, and Wario Stadium which would bring some unique elements still.  Peach Beach is another standout with the fun of a rising tide and the flipping guys wandering around.  I played 7 only a little bit because I disliked the motion controls and graphics (felt kind of dull), so any courses from that one would feel new to me.  Same goes for the DS game.  I\u2019m just not into handheld gaming so never played them.\n\nI feel like the team has a pretty good track record (heh) of finding ways to deliver new twists to even the oldest styles of tracks.  I don\u2019t mind having even simple figure 8\u2019s redone as there\u2019s always a little something that\u2019s slightly different from the others.  It\u2019s nice to have the largest possible playground of options.",

The presentation explained that until the Switch, they couldn\u2019t easily carry over software history over generations, but with the Switch accounts, this has became viable for them. Then they brought back the prior Switch 2 pseudo announcement, and said that Switch 2 will have NSO and will be \u201cable to play Nintendo Switch software they currently own\u201d, I feel it would be hard to assume that in general, all Switch purchases will carry over to Switch 2.",

This is how I called Vita using PSP hardware long before it was known. And I remember one forum getting mad at me for claiming so. To emphasize, even PSP for the most part natively runs PS1 games as it uses a more advanced version of the CPU. PS1 games on Vita even use the PSP hardware      \n\n> Is the Switch 2 a more powerful version of the Switch 1? \n\nYes. Just like Wii U was for Wii and Wii was for GCN",

I am not repurchasing the 120+ Switch games I have just because Nintendo changed the design of its physical media.\n\nThis is exactly the reason I walked away from the DS years ago. Once my backward compat DS finally kicked the bucket, I had no console to play my library of GB games.\n\nIt was easier to just sell everything and leave Nintendo.\n\nGranted, the Switch brought me back because of its flexibility between portability and home use, but we're all screwed if Switch 2 uses a new cart format.",

That's why they got so many downvoted rather than about still unknown spec on Switch2. \n\nThey were also factually wrong, how is recent Zelda even considered as woke? And how is EoW any related to Zelda's Adventure?\n\nAgain, if they hate Nintendo titles so much, why even bother? Their past video game comments were all critical at Nintendo consoles specs. Just go get the console or PC they want. They are just not Nintendo/Switch's targeting audience. That's why I said why look for luxury car in a Honda?",

That's the point I just made.\n\nI don't think that you can say they are factually wrong about such a subjective opinion, and even so I don't really have much interest in discussing that. We were more having a discussion about the Nintendo's direction particularly relating to hardware and implementation of software\n\nFor example, would you be just as offended at a person asking more than the Wii? They aren't the target audience. They might hate all the Wii iterations of Nintendo properties but believe they still have potential with better hardware and  leadership, etc.",
