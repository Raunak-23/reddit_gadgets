At 40W, you can draw 40 joules per second.\n\nIf you want to mention energy delivery over such a short amount of time, you'd use number of joules over a specific burst duration, or just joules delivered is probably fine if it's such a short duration IMO",

If you bought a 9mm gun, nobody's going to joke about how it would be too small for your finger in the trigger guard. We know that's bullet diameter, not length of the barrel. A phased plasma rifle likely uses a standard wavelength, pulse width, and duty cycle. A 40W laser could still cut you if focused well, or if it's used to heat and eject plasma. We don't know enough about the weapons to say it's ludicrous.",
