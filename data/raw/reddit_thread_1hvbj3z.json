It felt like that was the end of the altruistic internet and we'd moved into the era of just trying to squeeze the blood out of the stones that were already hooked in. \n\nIt feels like that, getting the entire world connected, may have been that next big leap.  But it didn't happen, so we've just been left with companies trying to create something and then the big money venture capitalists trying to turn it into the next big money maker, and it hasn't happened.  Like you said, there's been a 16 plus year gulf where they've been trying to make all the dumb tech I've mentioned into the next thing.  \n\nFuck, I forgot flexible screens!  Maybe that'll finally take off and not just be a kinda shittier version of a solid screen phone.",

Not to say there aren't dope experiences there, but it wasn't what the hype was. \n\nAnd it's gonna happen with AI, ChatGPT is genuinely amazing but also, it's not quite there and probably won't ever be there.

But to actually utilize it, you have to rethink the problems.\n\nTake steam engines for example: When they first came out, places literally just replaced their waterwheels with steam engines and honestly didn't get that great of improvements out of them. It wasn't until they built factories away from rivers (so you didn't have to worry about flooding and closer to raw materials to lower transportation costs) or laid out in more logical ways (you don't have to build everything around one central crankshaft) that steam engines actually became really valuable to production.\n\nYou can use the same idea about computers in general, or the internet, or almost any new technology.

I honestly think that's where this is going, and I do honestly think people will like it when we get there. \n\nThis is a transition period, but when you can ask your computer 'Why aren't you seeing that second monitor that I just hooked up?' and have it actually make meaningful suggestions like 'Hmm ... let me check my settings to make sure I'm looking for a second monitor. Oh, I see it, but it's not turned on. Are you sure you plugged it in, and it's getting power?' and you reply 'Yes, the red light is on. It's definitely on.', and the computer says 'Are you sure that's a data cable and not just a charging cable? Maybe try another cable to be sure?', etc, etc ... because people find computers difficult, and having a little personality inside the computer, that will help use it, is probably going to take off once it gets good. \n\nHow many times have you looked at Photoshop, or GIMP, and thought 'How do I cut out this face and make the background transparent?'. Except now you'll literally just say 'Hey, computer, walk me through the process of cutting out this face and making the background behind it transparent', and it'll respond 'Okay, is this what you want?' then do it for you. \n\nThe 'skill' involved in using a computer could become entirely moot, when your computer is also its own assistant. \n\nI do think people actually want THAT, and that's why they're installing TPU chips in laptops. \n\nThe rest is bullshit. The hype is insane, and you just have to ignore it until we reach some equilibrium with what we actually want and what we can actually do.",

I think what I found through my own research after the fact is essentially their top end spec is too much for their designs, and they're forced to limit power and thermals also suffer as a result. But this would be consistent for any laptop with the same hardware and a similar thermal design. My problem stemmed from the fact that they advertised the full performance of the i9 chip and gpu I bought instead of the actual performance of the machine, and furthermore they provided very inaccurate battery life metrics claiming \"up to 9 hours\" while the reality was you could sit idle at a web browser and run the battery completely out in just 2. There was literally no way to even get half the advertised battery life with their top spec, yet their *dedicated page* for that model made the same claims.\n\nMy last good PC was a Dell XPS 8300 tower, so it's not like I went into the XPS laptop expecting it to be bad, in fact quite the opposite. I just didn't get what was marketed to me and what I therefore expected of the machine and it didn't fit my use case as a result. The final nail in the coffin for me though was their complete disregard support wise. The support team I worked with did not try to find a solution, nor did they offer an exchange or refund for what could only be two possibilities: a defective laptop, or an obvious case of false advertising. They tried to spin it the other way and blame me for apparently believing their own specs and performance metrics. I don't take kindly to that, so dell is now on my shit list until further notice and they will not be getting any more money from me...",

The crazy thing is I have the \"worst\" MBP for this too - the 14\" with the binned M4 Max, meaning there's only a 74wh battery powering their second most powerful soc. Most recommend you go to the 16x for the 100whr battery, but I need it to fit in my bag so 14\" as the only option, and I needed the max chip for it's dual media engines. Been pleasantly surprised so far. Granted I don't do crazy AAA titles or anything but I didn't on the XPS either and, well, I already explained those results...",

      "body": "I had a Dell XPS Win 10 PC. It was the shortest lived PC I ever had, and gave me more software and hardware problems than any other PC (and I've been using Windows since 2001, and owned all the major brands I believe). USB ports would play musical chairs about stopping functioning, and stuff like that. I spent lots of time troubleshooting the thing the last year or two I had it. Finally the hard drive died (or else something else with the machine made it inaccessible). Oh, and it arrived at my house with the graphics card inside not properly seated. Googling the problem led me to mucking around with the drivers (I ran on the motherboard Intel graphics in the meantime), and ended up screwing up the drivers somehow, so that even after manually reseating the card, I never could get the card to work.\n\nThis PC had rave reviews in the major PC magazines.",
