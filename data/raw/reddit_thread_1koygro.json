The exponential growth, and the seemingly continualness of it as of last quarter, speaks to this.",

I honestly didn't expect 8gb to have issues like this for at least a few more years.\n\n[https://www.techspot.com/review/2980-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-8gb/](https://www.techspot.com/review/2980-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-ti-8gb/)\n\nThe Intel B580 is a decent choice if you can find it for close to MSRP and your CPU is newer and fairly high end, it has some CPU overhead issues though so older CPU's really seem to hold it back in some games.\n\nMaybe the 9060 XT 16 GB is going to have an aggressive price point and be good and have decent stock and sell for close to MSRP, that's a lot of maybes but it looks like we should find out a lot more in the near future.\n\n[https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-all-but-confirms-the-rx-9060-xt-will-be-announced-on-may-21/](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/amd-all-but-confirms-the-rx-9060-xt-will-be-announced-on-may-21/)\n\nOther than that you could hunt for a bargain last gen or even 2 gen old card, as long as your getting at least 12GB of memory it could be a decent option. A quick check on BestBuy's website found some 6800 (non XT) 16 gb cards on clearance for $386, as long as you have a decent PSU and don't mind that it's not super power efficient it's a pretty solid card.\n\n\\*Edit - I also found some new 3060 12GB cards going for right around $300, amazing how long certain cards can stay relevant.\n\nGood luck with things I hope you manage to find a good budget option that will last you for a while.",

I also don't want to miss out on newer features so latest generation definetly has it pros.\n\nFor CPU, im running a 5700x3D so that should still be decent to deal with some overhead.  \nIm also gaming in 1080p so far, hoping to get some 60fps without DLSS to hopefully get to 144fps with DLSS, depending on the game.   \nBut the 8GB will be limiting at some point as, in addition to textures, the AI stuff should use some VRAM as well, right?   \nBut I'll wait for the 5060 benchmarks as well, just a shame they dont have a 12GB Vram version of the non ti but I guess, that would screw with their 5060ti 8GB version.",

Yeah I know its a good 120-150\u20ac pricier than the regular 5060, but in the long term, this would be the safest investment due to the bigger VRAM and the feature set.\n\nOr you can wait another year and hope for a 5060 super with 12GB VRAM.",
