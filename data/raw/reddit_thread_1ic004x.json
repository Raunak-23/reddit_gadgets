And they have fast charging now.\u00a0\n\nYou just plug it in while you do your self care routine and then you\u2019re good.\n\nIt\u2019s not like they are gonna figure out a way to get the watch to last a whole week or something. So Apple\u2019s target is a reliable day of battery life, they aren\u2019t going to invest a ton into improving the battery just so you only have to charge it once a week.",

Much better than my Google Pixel Watch Gen1 that have about twelve hours of battery life and finicky touchscreen controls.\n\nThe big downside of the Garmin watches is that they're crazy expensive.  I only got mine because I was able to use a perk from work to pay for it.  These new Pebble watches could be a nice cheaper alternative.",

Might even be on the original battery which by now is probably 15-20 years old? (if not, then this watch also withstood 13 year old me with a screwdriver and a battery from the supermarket) Probably a hell of a lot more resilient than a smart or mechanical watch too which honestly if you're talking about longevity I'd say is more a concern.
