When they do that at the phase where batteries are being produced, it\u2019s usually for things like failing Apple\u2019s child labor audit. Then that company decided to continue building more batteries and selling them without authorization from Apple. That\u2019s pretty much the straight up definition of counterfeit of a counterfeit part. So Rossmann was happy to swoop in and buy the counterfeit child labor parts.\n\nAlso, Apple did not contact customs about that shipment of batteries. Apple, like most companies, provide customs with a guide to determine if goods are genuine or not. And those batteries failed the test that Apple had given customs.\n\nHow does Rossmann\u2019s dick taste?",

Definitely not nearly common enough to be an argument against theft protection.\n\nSecond, this scenario is easily fixed. The reseller can either reimburse you for the repairs cost if they would normally let a third party fix the broken phone they bought, or, in case they do the repairs themselves, you send the phone in, they repair it, send it back to you to unlock it and then you send it to them again. Again, neither method is so complicated as to warrant not having theft protection on phones.",

It reduce it more to car jacking and ways that require the theft to get the key with the car. Well until Kia got caught cheaping out and the Kia boys happened.  There was a reason why the most common stolen cars was sticking around year 2000 never moving up. It was shortly before the chipped keys became common place. \n\nIt will basically drive phone theft into the ground and have very limited effect on resale.

Perceived obsolescence\nReuse: stop adding features that only function to make repairs and reselling unviable in a failed war on \"theft\" or \"hackers\". Planned obsolescence.\nRecycle: materials in these phones are valuable enough to ship old hardware around the world for the global poor to tear apart in hazardous conditions. The chip manufacturers should be required to buy back old hardware and use safe methods to reclaim material. Actual obsolescence.\n\nIf any multi-billion entity isn't pushing towards long term sustainably at every turn, they are the enemy of all life on Earth, and should be treated accordingly.",
