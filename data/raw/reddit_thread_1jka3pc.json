They are also saying if you want to use the new ams2pro with your existing printer you have to update your firmware.\n\nIf you want to use any new upgrades or hardware you have to get into the new firmware that includes the new bambu suite locking you down.\n\nI also wonder what firmware ships with new equipment sales at this point as well. Chances are it's coming with the changes.\n\nFor existing printers with the existing capacity the answer was \"we won't make you install the update if you don't want it\" effectively freezing you where you're at.\n\nThat means if you don't want to be further locked in you effectively lose all new feature updates.",

Here it is cutting some foam.\" It's very hard to find detailed technical specs and comparisons, and like I said in my comment above, it's really hard to tell what the difference is between cheap and expensive (diode) lasers.

I guess one big advantage is that when you buy from a reputable company, you can trust that they're not lying about their specs and that a 10W laser *is* actually 10W.",

It's no longer a value leader. They should put the board, touchscreen, and chamber sensor on the P1S with native 90w heater and sell it for $899 as a P1S turbo and retire the X1C. With the addition of the chamber heater in the H2D it's really displacing the X1E but those are pretty rare in the wild.\n\nThe H2D feels like they are SKU forcing a step up from the X1C to get that profit spread but it really does not bring enough to the table for the pricing. \n\nNow we have the Prusa one as the premium option and QIDI is really breathing down their door. You expect to pay more for a Bambu, sure, but everyone else is launching their own multimaterial options in the next year and they look pretty good. That means there is going to be a lot of competition.\n\nIt feels like an awkward SKU. The kind of people who are tinkerers who would swap in and out a laser head here are small scale etsy sellers and home users - the kind of people who are not paying nearly 2 grand for a machine like this BASE and $3500 with all the options.\n\nIf they wanted to be a market disruptor they needed to do this for $500 less than the base price, minimum, with the laser head. Bambu is stuck in their own past and it will be the boat anchor that sinks them from relevance.\n\nI can't imagine giving them $3500 for anything as a consumer or any space with the developer mode and firmware stunts this year.\n\nThey also locked this printer down for the new options, laser does not work outside of their closed system, you're locked in.\n\nWhile the machine is pretty cool it's WILDLY out of it's target audience pricing there. People are not spending $3500 for a hobbyist targeted cricut and... pen plotter. \n\nGranted it's a cool machine and has a lot of neat small features, but, why would I pay triple the price of a p1s for this for idex, more watts, and an optional laser head? \nIf I wanted a 10w laser, Creality has one for $338. I could get a P1S, AMS, and a laser for 1/3rd the price. It's convenient and slick as an AIO, but, is it slick enough for an upcharge of thousands over the rapidly evolving competition?",

You probably want a drybox to feed from in that case instead of the external spool otherwise you're constantly putting it in the ams2 to dry back out. It's also no good for engineering filaments.\n\nThink about what this means for actually using the idex though. Let's say you want to print a red and black nylon part. You could not have red and black nylon in the AMS for no purge idex print. You would have to remove the second color from the AMS and manually feed it. That means every single 2 or more color print (not just suppport/tpu) requires you go play filament musical chairs. How often are you going to do that when you are doing this professionally to prototype when you can just tell it to use the AMS and disregard the waste so you can print and walk away?

I think Bambu really pioneered and normalized multimaterial with the AMS and inspired all the AMS clones hitting the market today. This machine COULD result in a resurgence in idex options hitting the market. the IDEX however could just be the natural evolution to multi material printing becoming almost standard in the market. It might also just be what would have been borne of it either way.\n\nA lot of exciting printers and printing products are launching this year.

People probably won't care about filament waste in that environment. The cost is negligible, and the users aren't paying for it anyway. If you simply want multicolor, get a single extruder printer - it's realistically gonna cheaper anyway.\n\n\n\n>Bambu raised the bar for everyone, including their competition. They don't have that advantage for this printer.\n\nThis isn't the absolute leap frog that the X1C was at the time, but it still raises the bar - only that this time, its direct competitors are professional / prosumer printers like the S8 and XL, and it is positioned very competitively here. It was probably always going to be a much more niche product than their existing line-up.\n\n  \nI do agree with one of your earlier points that the X1C is starting to show its age, and suspect bambu might start transitioning its lineup to printers based on the H2Ds tech. If I were them, I'd start by making an \"X2C\" that has all the H2D features minus the Dual Extruder (chamber heating, automatic vents, filtration, nozzle cam, servomotors) and then cut that down into a p2 series.",
