Even with a folding device it would be hard to have 3 things on the screen at once. Maybe rotate the screen and you'd have a little more width per app, but it would still be very little space.\n\nWe already have support for \"windows\" for devices with even larger screens or when you hook up your device to a monitor, so I don't really see the use case for having a mode that's specifically 3 screens as opposed to just making a better window manager that makes it easier to organize any number of windows and have them snap to eachother or the edge of the screen.",

The user can organize them how they want. Save different layouts so the user switch back and forth between their favourite layouts.  So many ways to make this more versatile rather than just working on a single fixed layout  that only works for a very small percentage of users.  The only place I've ever seen a folding phone was on YouTube in a tech review. I've never seen one in the wild. I'm sure some people have them, but they are extremely rare.",

Only time will tell if that bares out. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure they sell better in Asian markets and they sell well to \u2018business\u2019 types / people who are willing to drop 2 grand on the latest not-totally proven tech, which are definitely the type of people phone manufacturers want as customers\n\nHardware drives software innovation as hardware is where the money is (in phones). Perhaps they feel 3 windows on a candy bar design is too visually crowded. Or that 3 apps would slow down all but the latest flagships. Or it\u2019s just a more difficult task to make them truly dynamic with the way apps/OS are designed than it seems at first glance\n\nAnyway introduction of 3 apps is moving closer to your overall stated wish for a more dynamic system over what we have currently",

The problem is that it's hard to organized the \"windows\" in any meaningful way. This is why I said they should work on their window manager to allow you to more easily snap apps to the edges of the screen or up against eachother, rather than trying to create just a few pre-defined layouts that may or may not work for someone's specific use case.  Just give people the tools to organize and display the apps in a way that makes sense to them.",
