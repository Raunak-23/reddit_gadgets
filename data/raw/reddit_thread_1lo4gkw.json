At the risk of sounding like a gatekeeper, you're better off repairing/retrofitting old quality tech because this is literally a case of \"don't make em like they used to\"\n\n\n(By the way, if you like these concepts of preserving things that weren't really made to be preserved, check out the podcast \"Ephemeral\". It's finished it's run, but it has discussions on so much niche cool shit that I wouldn't know about except for having tuned in.)",

Even in its heyday it wasn't great, tapes would rapidly decay and break. You'd have to clean the heads all the time to get good output and tapes would need to be replaced regularly. The motors, reels, and associated mechanisms would often cause a good amount of [wow and flutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow_(recording\\)) as well as tangling, stretching, and breaking tapes.\n\nAnalog and digital technologies both have their flaws and their benefits. We need to look at the implementations and use them where they are appropriate.",

There's no precise clock signal, so wow and flutter are an effect of inaccurate tape speed. There's no error correction and precise tracking of things, so head misalignment can make stuff sound bad. Any kind of interference can make it into your audio, including motor noise. Analog always has the real world intrude into it somewhere, so a copy always loses quality.\n\nDigital basically makes everything perfect. 44.1 KHz/16 bit audio on CD came out in 1982 and is still perfectly good for playback.\n\nOf course it's not so terrible as to be unusable, but there's just no real reason to use analog.

Hell it will even sound different if you sit in a different spot relative to the speakers in the same room. \n\nThe fact of the matter is that it is not possible to recreate the experience of sitting in front of the instrument or person who is making the recording in real life, feeling the subtle vibrations the the instrument itself is making pass through your body and bounce off of objects in the room. This is why live music will always be a timeless and sought after way of experiencing music\u2014 nothing else is really identical. \n\nSo if you give up the notion of perfection and concede that a recording cannot ever achieve that result, you are then able to appreciate the unique quirks (and flaws) that each type of recording technology brings to a listening  experience as worthy of merit in their own right. Sometimes the \u201ccrackle\u201d of vinyl or the hum of a motor moving a cassette tape becomes a part of the joy of those listening to music using that method\u2014 it brings people back in time to a different era and connects them in some way with the past. Polaroids are vastly inferior to taking a picture with your iPhone and yet still for many people the Polaroid is more fun. \n\nIt\u2019s not about the pursuit of perfection (eliminating the barrier the technology present between what you see/head and reality) it\u2019s about savoring the intangible distance between the two worlds that remind you that everything in this universe is ephemeral and nothing can be perfectly captured or frozen in time, we only get to glimpse the past, we can\u2019t live in it.

Also, if you're using the tape then every use will significantly accelerate that degradation.\n\nThere are much better mediums and formats for long-term storage but you have to choose between a balance of cost, ease-of-use, durability, and so on.

However there is still something to be said for the benefit of having to take a little intentional effort.\n\nI've recorded to tape, and it's about a million times less convenient than using a DAW. But the act of rewinding the tape, getting the room ready, then knowing that the next five minutes were going to be a take, regardless of what happens, then listening back to it... it added to the performance.\n\nNow overdubs and edits... give me digital all day. I don't miss splicing tape.",
