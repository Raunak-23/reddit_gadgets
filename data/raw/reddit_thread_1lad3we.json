What is relatively novel is moving that RDMA off of a point-to-point network like Infiniband, and putting it on a packet switched network like Ethernet.

So with Ultra Ethernet (and to a lesser extent RoCEv2), the question becomes WTF are they doing to the Ethernet frame, and to congestion control, and other mitigations to make it suitably fast and low latency for HPC.

You\u2019re the one who jumped in to my general answer to that question with your own anecdotes. \u201cConvo\u201d wasn\u2019t originally about you \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nAnd, from NVIDIA\u2019s OWN WHITE PAPER on them:\n\n\u201cNVIDIA Spectrum switches operate in a cut-through forwarding mode by default, which offers lower latency compared to store-and-forward switching. Cut-through switching forwards packets as soon as the destination MAC address is read, minimizing delay, but it can lead to forwarding corrupted packets if errors are present. NVIDIA Spectrum switches are designed to handle this by having large, shared buffers that can accommodate traffic bursts and minimize packet loss.\u201d\n\nAlso, a [brief post and config guide](https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/switch-forwarding---160---store-and-forward--vs---cut-through-x) on their support portal.  Guess maybe you don\u2019t actually \u201cknow everything\u201d about it ;)",

      "body": "There are a lot of smarts in these pollara NICs that are purely operating using RoCEv2 offload at this point and Ultra Ethernet in the near future, with a firmware change.\n\nWhen using Pollara RoCEv2 QPs are modified down to the packet level to adjust the source port to the known number of upstream switch uplinks to increase entropy for ECMP hashing, providing packet spraying. Memory pointers are added to each packet as well...this combination allows for retransmission of a single packet always and not larger parts of the flow. \n\nThe approach allows for packet spraying, selective acknowledgement, congestion control and individual packet retransmission and put of order delivery into memory. The smarts here make RoCEv2 sing on standard Ethernet networks that now only require ECN to be configured. \n\nUltra Ethernet builds on this and will be a multi vendor standard for Interop.",
