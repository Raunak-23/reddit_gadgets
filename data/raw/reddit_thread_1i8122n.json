Sure there are some games that couldn\u2019t port to the switch, but that\u2019s not going to be what sells your console (games already available to buy on other platforms). When you look at how impressive BotW is it\u2019s clear they could have put other big games on the system.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s actually that valuable to design exclusives for your console anymore, it\u2019s too risky. I think A - AAA game design in general has become too risky. Beyond BotW/TotK they really didn\u2019t do anything that massive. And I\u2019d guess TotK took half the team BotW did.\n\n I think (or maybe just hope) we\u2019re going to see a refocusing around game mechanics and gameplay as opposed to graphics and load speeds. Especially with games like Balatro being as popular as they are. It shouldn\u2019t take 3000 people to make a profitable video game.",

Like, idk, I guess you'd boot up the Xbox app on your PC, mobile, or other console devices and access games that way.\n\nWhereas Sony is making deals with game studios to get exclusive games, some say Microsoft is buying studios with the intention of keeping those games cross-platform, because they figure they can make more money selling games for every platform instead of continuing to fight the console war and losing to Sony.\n\nI think internet connections are going to have to get better for, say, steaming games to any device to replace consoles. I tried Google Stadia when that was a thing, and games on that were almost impossible to play due to the lag and freezing. And I live in a city. There are many, many places across North America that have less reliable internet than I do. They're going to have to run games locally until the infrastructure improves.",

So far, Sony Studio's wise,  it has been\n\nLast of Us Factions - Naughty Dog\n\nGod of War - Blue Point\n\nConcord - Firewalk Studios\n\nCodenamed \"Camden\" - London Studios\n\n(off the top of my head)\n\nYou are probably looking at a combined 20 years worth of work which has just vanished never to be seen, two studios shut down. Naughty Dog will get their first original PS5 release at the tail end of the generation and first game from Blue Point (though they did complete Ragnarok support) will probably be on the PS6.\n\nAlso Marathon seems to have gone very quiet.\n\nI get the games are taking longer and longer to produce but at the same time I really feel that Sony Management bet on live service trying to chase a trend (and money) and failed, rather than focusing on what was working for them and maybe taking a chance on new IP (instead of another Last of Us Remake). This gamble has cost people's jobs (at the bottom) while Jim Ryan said he was to retire to swim in his money.\n\nFor me if Sony want to increase console revenue they should focus on selling more consoles and I think that is done by expanding your range of games (new IP, go back to older dead IP... let's not just think sequels) to appeal to more people rather than chasing people's time with live service.",

Many of the ones already released are scaled back so much that they don't look any better than UE4 but run slower.\n\nConsoles struggle so much with UE5, you can think of them as next gen games that are released on current gen with severely compromised performance.\n\nWhen the next console comes out it will be able to run current gen games properly and I think that will be a big selling point.",

The PS4 to PS5 jump was good, but felt only incremental compared to, say, PS2 to PS3. \n\nI can think of a few upsides\u2026\n* More revolutionary console generations. Hardware is just moving slower these days and there\u2019s probably less of a need to do it every 8 years. \n* More money in gamers pockets to spend on GAMES. We know that console manufacturers make tiny margins on consoles, a new console release is really all about getting gamers excited for new releases with better visuals etc - then Sony etc make their margins on licensing fees, store fees, subscriptions etc, so ultimately on game sales. This generation we saw fewer releases and exclusives. Modern games take a considerable amount more time and money to make, the software complexity and art requirements are absurd - more money for gamers to spend on games could be a way to address part of this problem while also increasing profitability for console manufacturers and game developers. \n* Less E-Waste - perhaps not entirely relevant to gaming in itself, but I do dread to think about the amount of E-Waste a new console release results in. Millions of consoles, games controllers, etc all ending up discarded, and the resources for manufacturing millions of new consoles.",

GTA Online also got its last major update around 2015 or 2016, when the PC version launched.\n\nEarly 2017 is just over ten years after the PS3 launched. PS4 is now just over eleven years old.\n\nWe must keep in mind that it's easier to make cross-compatible titles now. No longer is there a need to code for the complicated (and unrewarding in most cases) CELL architecture. Every console has the same x86 basis, and with games being so expensive, publishers would prefer to squeeze money from the larger eighth generation crowd.",

Most PS3 software runs at 720p, and much of it runs even less, around 560p. And still has the nerve to lag, like Sonic Unleashed. Many PS4 games can at least hit 30 consistently around 720p or higher.\n\nI feel PS5 and Series X should've been delayed to early 2022. Probably not the smartest move; I'm sure it would've been a lot of money to swallow, but more people would've had the chance of getting them.

Nvidia dropping the GPU ball and essentially stifling PC gaming growth for the foreseeable future is really all the green light Sony needs.\n\nI basically see it this way.  (Core) consoles were on the way out, due to the steadily encroaching embarrassment of being the 30fps and/or 1440p platform, which PC would then serve up in proper 4K60+.  One look at Capcom's sales-per-platform pie chart is all the evidence one needs for that.  But AI providing fake details, especially now in the interpolation department, has shifted that reality.  The new reality is that PS6 will probably give the same performance as what you can get on PC, and the new downside is that you get the added latency and shitty artifacts of framegen... which are not merely more subtle than a lower resolution or halved framerate, but literally below the threshold of identification for the typical console user.\n\nAnyone can design a \"4K120 game\" if the entire dev landscape is going to be leaning on framegen.  And console users are sure not going to be the first ones to gripe about AI artifacts or latency.  I really hate the direction this is all going.  But it does mean the likes of Playstation gets to stick around a while longer before going portable and making their own PC-compatible Gamepass clone.",

I\u2019m expecting $500-600, $650 if we have a bunch of tariffs running around when it launches.  Depends on how hard they go on the specs.  \n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft doesn\u2019t have great options for price pressure.  \n\nThey aren\u2019t Nintendo, they can\u2019t roll with a cheaper console with lower specs and lean on the best exclusive IP lineup in the industry.  Honestly, of the big three MS have the worst lineup of exclusives.  \n\nTheir core audience expects them to meet the PS6 head on.  They expect the new Xbox to at least roughly match the PS6 in hardware specs so games are of similar quality across the flagship versions of the two consoles.  It could go with less powerful hardware for a cheaper console as it did with the S, but I wonder how much of a reputation hit it would take for falling behind on specs.  \n\nThe other option is running the console as a loss leader and making it up in software.  Companies are a lot more hesitant to do this now for multiple reasons.",

You can't begin any other considerations except mayyyyybe some concept design shells until then. \n\nThe components determine power budgets and cooling solutions which in turn determine physical characteristics for thermals and layout. \n\nSo this is still years out - but I'm not sure many who aren't big in the PC space realize the insane power of AMD's 3D V Cache tech. \n\nIntel can't come close and AMD does it cheaper AND with a lower power draw! \n\nFor modern games, you hit one of two walls of performance usually - VRAM limits or RAM limits, for VRAM it's more about capacity and for RAM it's more about access speed, that is the fact your CPU needs to do work to read from RAM, and that work can reduce the available \"power\" for other computation: aka your game. \n\nAMD did some clever fuckery and stapled a HUGE fast access cache buffer onto their gaming focused chips, as a result they are worse performing in multi threaded high impact workloads, however almost nobody does that kind of workload - especially gamers. \n\nSo at the cost of slower workloads like CPU rendering or non-GPU calculations you receive a large amount of extremely fast access memory for the CPU and since that's the bit games struggle with (games almost by their nature cannot take good advantage of multithreading) it results in by far the best gaming CPU on the market. \n\nIt's so good, that the number one top performer by a mile is the 9800X3D, their most recent. \n\nThe SECOND best performer, still comfortably ahead of other options? \n\nThe 7800X3D, the old model lol. \n\n3D Vcache is a huge plus to the console gaming community because unlike ray tracing or frame generation gimmicks, it's a tangible and direct massive benefit for many games natively. \n\nIf you want to see how wild it is, look up some comparison videos of Escape from Tarkov, a famously unoptimized CPU bound mess of a game. \n\nBefore the recent wipe which fucked everything super hard, my wife got a 7800X3D and I trialed tarkov on it with my GPU and I more than doubled my FPS even on the biggest most difficult to run map. \n\nAnd her CPU cost LESS than the 13900k! And it uses less power and thus runs cooler!\n\nI'm glad they're expanding their tech and dominance in gaming. I just hope it means Intel follows suit.",

Gotta get an RTX 4090 or 50 series GPU for games to actually look noticably better for the average person. That's something that won't be feasable on console until PS6. And will it be enough for people to consider it a generational leap? Idk\n\nSony tried to create new avenues with VR, twice, but it didn't take off and thus for them isn't worth dumping AAA budgets into.\n\nNintendo took a super safe bet with Switch 2 (first time I believe they actually just slapped a 2 on a successor console) but at least on the handheld market there is still room for growth as the base visual experience is still one or two generations behind.

Whether you remove loading times, steady/good FPS, substantial improvements to systems like UI/interface, friends, streaming, etc.\n\nIt is rumored the next gen AMD stuff might potentially catch up to nVidia's ray tracing, as well as performance for their mid range GPUs. They also already have the best gaming CPUs (X3D) which seems to be what is referenced for the PS6.\n\nI prefer to stick with PC for now, it'll keep running anything, no compatibility BS, access to masses of great indie games.",

I think a lot of people here are forgetting that the average consumer isn't looking to build a $1500+ PC just to play the current AAA games. If you're\u00a0a person who's just looking to play the current generational offerings, a PS5 is $500. It's a plug and go gaming option that runs games extremely well. To that kind of person, exclusives are kind of just a bonus.\n\n\n\nObviously, PC stays winning, but that wasn't really up for debate anyways. The PS5 isn't suddenly dogshit because it shares a lot of its library with steam. It's a box that plays games, and that's really all it needs to be for most people.",

Which any modern GPU has, but they are waging this stupid war on behalf of \"native resolution\", they hate DLSS and RT for that matter. They balk at needing a modern SSD, they balk at Gen 9 console exclusive (as in no Gen 8) needing 32GB of Ram. \n\nIn other words with no PS5 where would the heard of PC gamers be? I have a 4080 Super so I'm in the minority. If the PS6 is anything like this leak describes, it will push PC graphics and system requirements to a whole new level.

Nintendo knows this, which is how they are able to churn out so many first-party/exlusive titles in a single generation.",

Game developers would need to learn and write a lot of code unique for each system, and couldn't really even start to develop much until after dev kits were released. That's what takes time, and it was an art all of it's own.\n\nThe move to x86 changed the formula a lot. Consoles now are more of a PC form factor with a TV friendly interface. Everything is streamlined and the complexity in putting together a console has never been lower. The guts are essentially reworked off-the-shelf computers, and the \"custom\" silicon is instead a built to order SKU of the same CPU you have in your desktop. Plop 'er in and they're done. Game developers can develop the games on PC, make since relatively minor tweaks for APIs and such, and if they're feeling generous, optimize a few things to take advantage of more CPU cache or an extra core. There's no need for years of lag time anymore. \n\nIf they really wanted to, I can't think of any technical reason they couldn't release the PS6 this year. Though if I had to guess, I'd think more like mid-2026 to 2027 for the sake of having exclusive release titles and building up hype. Or I could be totally off and it'll be 2028/29, but my point is that it's a business decision rather than a technical one at this point.",

Not that it isn't great or to belittle/downplay the genuine engineering that goes into it, just that the tedious parts have been streamlined out with existing off the shelf circuits and tweaked (\"custom\") variations of existing components can be made to order. 10 or even 5 years ago would have been a lot more limiting in tippy top performing yet affordable ICs, but it's wild what even us peasants can just order off mouser. And it would be wild to me if something like PSSR isn't just integrated into the CPU. It's something that needs to be working in unison with what's pumping out the frames, and anything else would likely be a very expensive and pointless move if they're already using customized AMD SKUs. Especially given that effectively identical tech is already integrated straight from AMD regardless. I wouldn't be surprised if there's some  actual custom silicon somewhere doing something, but nothing wild or that wouldn't be figured out before the CPU is finalized. That said, I'd be curious in hearing an explanation of why they would roll their own silicon rather than integrating it. I do love me some custom silicon tales, but I just don't see where the benefit would be.\n\n\n>And then there's the controller and the console box design itself\n\nI mean... That's just aesthetics though. 90+% of the design time is bouncing between middle managers wanting a slightly different shade of black or a 49.5 degree bevel instead of a 51.2 degree one. Controllers are pretty much perfected as it is, so they'll play with aesthetics/feel a bit and maybe they'll add in a gimmick or two, but they know they already have exactly what players want. Plus it's not like they're going to wait until the hardware is done before they start sketching up ideas. These have probably been waiting at 95% for a good while already.",

If you were into tech at the time, think back on SSDs in 2015. Beat the hell out of harddrives sure, but decent control ICs were still pretty damn expensive and an absolute joke compared to today. 10 years later, it's largely the NAND itself that costs money, and a cheap ssd will shoot out 6gb/s of data like its nothing. 10gbs for a decent, but still shockingly inexpensive drive. Cost and performance has already been optimized to hell and back. The same applies to *tons* of inexpensive off-the-shelf components now, and aside from raw processing power, are generally more capable than the average person can even notice, let alone appreciate.\n\nIts also pretty fair to call a tweaked CPU design custom silicon, and yeah, that'll still take a good amount of time to work with AMD for. But if the PS6's CPU is already being finalized, they clearly didn't just start working on it, so why would anyone expect it to be 4+ more years?\n\nTLDR... I guess I'm really, really over complicating this by gabbing on about how mind blowing tech is right now. Like the headline says, the processor is being finalized, and that's kind of the whole thing. All the supporting components are laid out well beforehand and tweaked as needed.",

At least it sure feels that way.\n\n[If I look at this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1g8jwka/all_ps5_exclusives_not_on_ps4_list/).

It's been 12 years now, and Sony STILL produces the PS4 and PS4 Pro which is crazy. For perspective, the PS3 had 10 years.\n2. AAA games are still being made for the PS4 with only a little bit of games being exclusively made on PS5.\n3. PS5 still has good hardware for the money. You can certainly build PCs that run better but it definitely doesn't have underpowered hardware like the PS4 when it first released.\n4. Most games require you to pay the extra $10 if you owned it on PS4, just so you can get slightly better fidelity.\n5. Pandemic and scalping made it super hard to get it for the first 2-3 years. It wasn't until the last year or two that I've seen the list of my PS friends go from 4 to 5.\n\nIt feels like I've had my PS5 for only two years when I actually had it for four. We've had a handful of titles that are pretty damn good on PS5 but we're already almost halfway through the console cycle and already have a PS5 Pro, yet a PS6 set to be discussed in a few years. Lmao what's the rush? Most games feel like the $500 I paid for was to play the PS4 games I had in 60fps.",

As such, the costs and future considerations makes a 3D cache decision a very tricky one.\n\nHowever, Cerny some months back talked about how he was surprised by the number of 60FPS titles this gen, and that focus by developers may influence where they go next. That's perhaps a hint that next time they'll focus more on CPU, given how it's usually the GPU that is always given the main focus, which may include giving the CPU a healthy amount of cache this time so it can reach its full potential (current console use an extremely stripped back Zen 2, removing most of its cache).\n\nAll depends on what is afforded by the silicon budget. Raster is no longer gonna be the focus, so if the GPU gets bigger it'll be to accomodate ML upscaling and ray tracing. That may leave the CPU with more wiggle room to include more cache than usual (for a console design).",
