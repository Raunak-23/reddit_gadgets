There's a lot more even heat soak from all the hot components that having a myriad of additional sensors to monitor hot spot probably became redundant when the hot spot is now about the same as the core temp on the FE cards. May be a couple of degrees out, but the GPU will still throttle based on hottest temperature if it reaches that point.",

However, AMD is known to have hotter GPUs and a larger optimal delta between core and hot spot temps. And AMD isn't going above and beyond with their designs because they're not targeting the top market. Massively overhauling a cooler design is an expensive R&D process. \n\nAnd AMD is a different architecture GPU from nVidia. GPUs have multiple sensors and a hot spot monitor for a reason. Because those GPUs have significant deltas in temperatures across components. But the 50 series doesn't have that reason for a hot spot monitor when the entire GPU is concentrated to the GPU die and memory dies all around the core, in a very tight format where even heat soak occurs. \n\nEven heat soak means that all those hot components are going to cause just everybody to be the same temperature. Why have 5 temperature sensors in this GPU if they all report the same temperature? Why keep a hot spot monitor if it's not detecting a hotter component than the GPU core which is now surrounded and enclosed by all these hot components? \n\nThis design removes having to monitor for a hot spot temperature, makes for in theory more affordable coolers to be produced for it, and makes cooling more efficient. As the benchmark results on temp for the 5090 is cooler than the 4090 hot spot temp, but warmer than the core temp, and hits 575W and up.",

These card designs ever since the higher end 30xx and 40xx are horribly designed, there were just too many issues with the added larger heatsink weight, power consumption and heat released, they used 10xx and 20xx pcb specs on something much more heavy and power hungry. I am afraid all the other manufacturers of 50xx that didn't use the nvidia design are going to suffer from the same failures of the previous generations that were that big.\n\nModern thermal pads are losing good contact to the heatsink after several months, this is observed and happening with many people, thermal putty seems to be the solution, like UTP-8.\n\nI also have a problem with the gpu retention bracket, it's difficult to tighten them flush.",

It's actually an abstraction of various sensors which is what makes it so useful. When that \"sensor\" reads a value significantly higher than your overall GPU temperature, it likely means that your cooler is not seated correctly on the die and part of the die is getting significantly hotter than the average\n\nIt's therefore very useful for determining if your cooler is seated correctly\n\nSo why does none of what you said have any bearing on the validity of their point\n\n> There are way more sensors\n\nYes. That's literally why this quasi-sensor is useful - it gives the max of those sensors\n\n> and usually none of them actually report the true temperatures.\n\nDoesn't matter, as long as they're all vaguely in the right ballpark it still tells you whether your hotspot is much hotter than your overall GPU and you therefore have a hotspot\n\n> For reporting, multiple sensors are added together and offsets are added. The temperature it reports is likely not even measured by a single sensor\n\nYou are wrong for this specific sensor. Literally the ENTIRE point of this sensor is that it doesn't do that\n\n>  And that\u2019s also true for hotspot temperatures which often are also just measurements with an offset\n\nNo it isn't\n\n> Temperature readings are pretty much made up numbers and don\u2019t really represent the truth\n\nThis one worked, as proven by hundreds of people who've re-seated their cooler and found that the hotspot temperature reduced to be much closer to the \"average\" temperatures\n\n> If they wanted to, they could have just reported fake numbers for hotspot and everyone would have been happy.\n\nIf discovered, people would have complained for the exact same reasons (plus nVidia being misleading). Chances are that people would have noticed when suddenly all reports of hotspots vanished. Either way it would've been a dick move because it's misleading",

So, they take thermal conductivity into their calculations and try to estimate what the temperatures would be. They take averages and something like the standard deviations to estimate hot spots. \nYou have to trust the engineers on this but redditors think they know better. \nIf engineers think that the hotspot value doesn\u2019t make sense in their setup, it likely doesn\u2019t.
