If you discharge them to 0 every cycle, they will last 5-10x less cycles than if you discharge them to 50% every cycle.

                      "body": "There are several major problems with how you arrived at your end conclusion.\n\n1. The chart is Depth of Discharge against *cycle count*. The reason higher DoD causes more wear is because *each cycle is more watt hours*. DoD against cycle count is a bad metric, because 1000 cycles at 20% is literally twice the total throughout as 1000 cycles at 10%.\n It's like a chart with \"Trip length (miles) vs total number of trips\" for a car. What matters is Depth of Discharge vs *total watt hours* (or kJ or whatever your chosen measurement). That tells a very different story.\n\n2. The start end end charge states are ambiguous with DoD charts. 100-80-100% is 20% DoD, as is 60-40-60%. The latter is actually far more favourable for batteries, and manufacturers exploit this.\n\n3. Being held at elevated charge states for long periods of times causes significant wear, even with no charge cycling at all. This is not factored into charge cycle charts at all.\n\nIf you *really* want to learn the nits and bolts of lithium life preservation, you can't beat https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries\n\nIf you just tldr'd the above, think about this: why does every single EV and most phones let you limit the maximum charge state if it wasn't beneficial?\n\nEdit: I should also note that the 100% as a measurement of charge state is also very ambiguous - what really matters is the cell voltage. For example, the 100% charge state on a typical EV or UPS is typically 3.7V, while for a mobile phone it's often more like 4.2-4.4V, even though they are both similar chemistry (though constructed differently). The latter is chosen for maximum capacity while the former is chosen to favour overall lifespan, and if you take your phone and limit it to that same 3.7V maximum charge state (around 60%) you will see similar benefits.",

I agree with most of what you said apart from #1. \n\nAs can we see in this chart, the relation between DoD and life expectancy is not linear at all, it'salmost exponential. For example, 100% DoD will give you twice the throughput per cycle than 50% DoD, but life expectancy will be 3k cycles versus 18k cycles. So the total throughput of the battery before losing 20% capacity is 3 times more in 50% DoD scenario.\n\nBut I totally agree that this report totally misses the high charge degradation aspect, which is likely to be much more significant contributor to the battery life than DoD.\n\nThanks for the link, will go educate myself.",

What I was trying to get at was a chart of DoD against total watt hours was a much better measurement, and what is even better is *height of recharge* against the same. I left point 1 as before so people can see what you were responding to.\n\nI also amended it to note that EVs limit their maximum charge state to what is effectively around 60% charge state for your typical mobile phone exactly because height of recharge is so much more important than true depth of discharge, even at the cost of overall range.",

Otherwise 5Ah powerpack will give you 2.5Ah effective capacity, no one wants that.\n\nThey are incentivised to discharge to the absolute safe limit. Hours on one charge sells things; how long that battery will last doesn't (as far as it is > 1 year)\n\nMaybe you're getting this chart wrong. Discharging from 100% to 65% every time still doubles your batteries' life expectancy compared to discharging from 100% to 55% every time. It doesn't really matter where the cutoff is in the controller.\n\nWhat matters much more in small goods are bad chargers. Some companies spend huge amounts of money on RnD, charge controllers, battery chemistry, and cooling to achieve fast charge without destroying the battery (i.e. car companies). And some companies just brute force voltage into it, effectively cooking that battery. \n\nI don't see a reason why power tools companies would care about battery health. Their batteries are effectively disposable. And there's nothing they will love more than locking you into, effectively, subscription for ***their*** batteries (if we're talking about professional operation)\n\n\nP.S. There's one thing missing in my thinking, which is max charge. Everyone knows that charging lithium batteries to the brim is also bad for them, and the chart I attached doesn\u2019t focus on this at all. If you charge battery from 80% to 100% every day, it may indeed kill it significantly faster than if you charge from 20% to 100% every 4 days, just because you're keeping it above 80% all the time which hurts more than deep discharge.

This is a problem for all batteries built with multiple cells inside.\n\nThe voltage of the individual battery cells will drift from each other, causing battery imbalance. This isn't good for battery life. You will basically overstress single battery cells in the battery and experience faster battery degradation. You might also run into a situation where a single cell will be drained beyond what it is designed to, because it bottoms out before the rest of the cells in the battery.\n\nThe way to combat this is to put the battery in the battery charger before you use your power tool, when you haven't used the tool for a while. Even if you stored your batteries at 100% charge and the charge indicator reports a full charge.\n\nPutting the battery in the charger makes the BMS module inside the battery balance out the cells, even if there is very little need to actually add energy (charge) the battery.\n\n[https://www.zitara.com/resources/demystifying-battery-balancing](https://www.zitara.com/resources/demystifying-battery-balancing) for some more reading on the topic.",

Due to better gravimetric and volumetric densities. While weight might not necessarily be an issue in cars, vehicle engine bays are getting tighter. Installing a new battery in a recent gen Ford Escape is not trivial. Smaller sized batteries for the same capacity would be very helpful for car manufacturers. And if those batteries only need to be replaced after 10 to 15 years, then its even better.\n\n2. Cycling stability: Minimal self discharge for SIBs means you can leave your car unattended for months and not worry about the battery being flat when you return. Plus I read somewhere SIBs are more tolerant of deep discharges, meaning if they do run down, you can recharge it again without much loss of capacity.\n\n3. The environment: While there are strict regulations in western countries for how used LAB should be disposed, it isn't necessarily the case in the developing world. If we can use fewer batteries that do not contain toxic materials, the earth will be better off for it.",
