Notice how I specified the exact properties I was talking about (no permanently online backlight and only using power when updating). E-Ink is a specific brand of display that has those properties but is not the one Garmin or Pebble use.\n\nThe fact that you said \"display always on\" makes me think you are talking about something different. I am talking about trans-reflective MIPS displays. They hardly use any power by \"being on\", only by changing the pixels.\n\nAs to the battery, it depends on how much you use it and what model. I said \"weeks\" in general and then talked about my watch in particular when I said almost a month. \n\nBeing more specific, it was definitely over 3 weeks, because I was on a trip, but I don't know exactly when I charged it again when I got back. It wasn't right away. I also have the largest watch they offer with the largest battery and the built-in solar extender (Fenix 7X Solar).\n\nBut the nitpicking is nonsense anyway. The comparison is between typical smart watches that last maybe a day or two, and ones that last weeks. Yes, the weeks vary depending on model and how you use it, but it is still weeks.",
