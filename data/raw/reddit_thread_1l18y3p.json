It makes little to no difference to her  work flow as it primarily consists of reading/creating documents and emailing. Meanwhile, I benefit greatly from the horizontal scrolling on the daily to readily access out of view column values on spreadsheets and DB tables. Easy access of X/Y axis scrolling is just so much more efficient for my workflow.\n\nIf size and horizontal scroll wheels aren't dealbreakers, the Logitech M720 Triathlon is about half the price of the Mx Anywhere - it just isn't rechargeable via USB. A single AA battery lasts months and months even with heavy use. It works well with rechargeable NiMH batteries as well. I find the ergonomics to be better on the M720 as well when compared to the Anywhere series. As for size it sits between the MX Anywhere and the MX Master.",

I owned an original MX Master and an MX Master 2, and I just won't buy them anymore.\n\n* Their lifespan isn't considerably longer than other, much less expensive Logitech offerings.  (And notably, *all* mice seem to have far shorter lifespans than they used to, and I baby my mice.)\n* The feature set isn't game-changing.  I struggle to find a need for the horizontal scroll wheel on a regular basis.\n* Ergonomics - The MX Master came out at a time when most ergonomic-focused mice lacked any other premium features.  This is no longer the case, and indeed, many average mice have excellent ergonomics.\n* Resolution / Polling: I'm a CAD guy and gamer, so high DPI matters to me. The sensors in even run-of-the-mill mice have gotten to the point that they're more than fine.\n* Logitech is absurdly obstinate about taking the device-switch button off of the bottom and putting it on top of the mouse.  This is why I daily drive the MX720, so I can seamlessly switch between laptop, desktop, and more.\n* It lacks the features that matter to me - Replaceable batteries, easily removable parts for cleaning.\n\nAll in all, the MX Master became an overpriced, unnecessary spectacle.  I'm much happier with my 720.",

The inclusion doesn't slow you down as it's not a forced feature that disables your kb shortcuts, it's not an either or situation.\n\nNot everyone edits spreadsheets - many just use them to view data from generated reports, so KB shortcuts don't speed up workflow for everyone who works with spreadsheets. I agree with /u/Digital_loop - it's amazing to scroll in X/Y axis with ease in spreadsheets and db tables for those of us that view them more than edit or create them.",

The mx master isn\u2019t sold as a gaming mouse.  It is targeted towards developers and other creative professionals.  \n   \n>Additionally, the Darkfield laser sensor works on many surfaces such as glass, but has a resolution of only 8,000 DPI..   \n   \nWhich is more than enough for the target market.   \n   \n>At just under 5 oz, the MX Master 3S also weighs more than twice as much as some high-end gaming mice.  \n   \nAgain, not a gaming mouse.  Also highly subjective - I very much appreciate the higher weight.  Far better than the cheap feel from lighter mice.    \n   \n>Lastly, Logitech doesn\u2019t offer the option to store the USB dongle inside the mouse, which can be practical when transporting or using the mouse on the go.   \n  \nThe only time I needed to pull the usb thing out of my laptop is when I\u2019ve replaced the laptop.    Not having onboard storage for the dongle is not an issue for the target market.   \n    \nThere\u2019s plenty of gaming mice.  The article writer should kindly fuck off and stick with one of those.",

I made another post saying that I would line-up for pre-order, if they put onboard memory, increase the polling rate (not asking for 1000.... but 125 is too low), and put in something that makes me able to switch device without lifting-up entire mouse. I am ok with heavy mouse, I am not ok with needing to lift them up to switch device. \n\nAlso, I do have the M720 Triathlon.... but while its like 80-90% of MX Master, its still not MX Master. The sensor is definitely a step below MX Master, along with the scroll wheel definitely feeling worse and functioning worse (no auto-switch between ratcheting and infinite). The thumb rest position is also worse. I do like that the switch device button is on-top though and there is a place for dongle.... but that's kinda it.",
