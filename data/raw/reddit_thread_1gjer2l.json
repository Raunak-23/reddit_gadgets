Multiuser support isn't the one big thing that makes these products different, but adding features that are exclusive to the macbook to the iPad makes them more similar. And the more similar they get, the more likely iPad sales are to \"cannibalize\" macbook sales.\n\n\nI assume there are also some technical reasons behind it (since mobile OS don't really have multiuser support it would probably require a bit more work than some other basic features), but I think this is the main point.",

But there are too few registers to work with and most instructions are two-operand; the result must replace one of the source registers.  If you did not want to overwrite a source register, you had to copy one first.  Sometimes there aren't enough registers to accept the copy, so they spill.\n\nThis is easily done and the cracked instructions will run no slower than RISC instructions doing the same on ARM.  But the extra higher level instructions required to convey this information and to handle register spill negates most of the compact code advantage.\n\nI see ARM compilers happily using all 31 registers available and even they spill for some work.  Intel has to spill much earlier and more aggressively.  I think the memory operations are NOP'd but am not sure, does it have to update caches and maintain cross CPU coherency with the spills?\n\nAny Intel design that reaches a specific performance on real-code, can be matched by an ARM design using the same tricks, but with a lower transister budget.  Instruction decoding is far cheaper and the instruction cracking is simpler.\n\nSo far as I am aware, for any performance level where an ARM and x86-64 are similar, the ARM is lower power.\n\nFor any power level where ARM and Intel use about the same power, the ARM is faster.",

I want to say the instruction set is something like 2x as many available instructions.  \n\nDoesn't it have a smaller instruction set? What it does have is fixed length instructions that are much simpler to decode. And ARM can use more decoders to more efficiently fill up instruction pipelines.",

Back in the old days, RISC workstations and servers were all the rage -  Sun SPARC, DEC Alpha, SGI MIPS, IBM POWER.  These were generally superior to x86, but when AMD64 came out it was more powerful and cheaper than the RISC chips and they dominated from early 2000's to at least mid 2010's.  These AMD64 chips had much more computational power than the RISC chips of the day, the RISC chips had advantages in I/O but eventually AMD64 was able to brute force past that too.  Now it does feel like the pendulum is starting to swing in favor of RISC (ARM) again for general purpose (non embedded / low power) workloads but to me it's not as clear cut as it was in the heydey of the workstation.",

The main issue is that instructions don\u2019t have a known length, and can be arbitrary in size. This makes instruction decoding very complicated. Specifically being able to decode instructions ahead of time before you get to them (if you dont know the size of the first instruction then you don\u2019t know where instructions 2 and 3 are located).\n\nApple Silicon doesn\u2019t have this issue (neither do many ARM architectures). This allows the Apple chips to decode substantially more instructions in parallel ahead of time.\n\nThis matters because it has a big impact on improving the efficiency of the chip when it goes to run those instructions. i.e. if you know what instructions are coming in advance, you can look up the memory they need to use in advance.",

When you go for an M series you are buying into the entire platform with every other decision Apple made as well. Don't get me wrong, I think my MacBook is a great machine. But because you have no choice for everything else that goes along with it, you are easily looking at $1,000 or more increase over other options at this performance level. Because of that, I find pure performance benchmarks to be not very valuable. Yes, the performance is impressive. But it would be only news to me if it wasn't. For an extra thousand bucks (or possibly much more) I expect the thing to be a screamer. By the time you get done upgrading your RAM and hard drive at triple the rates of what a hard drive costs anywhere else, these performance numbers can actually start to seem a little disappointing. Not to mention the fact that a lot of people who care about this micro a comparison to Ryzen also care about gaming, and the Mac remains a uniquely poor platform for gaming. I game on mine, and it's very frustrating only having access to a third of what's out there.",

I think on the base model tier of their products, and on the extremely high end, we can see some merit there.\n\nBut that's not the only thing Apple is selling, I think the preceding comments in this comment thread are arguing separate points.\n\n1. Yes the performance to $ ratio itself is a bit off compared to traditional x86, \n2. but that isn't the only thing to what makes an appliance good or bad for its price ([except you, Airpods Max](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Wm8qJCWcMFw)).\n\nBoth of these statements can be true.\n\nI'll use my self as an example. I have a M1 Max MBP with 64GB RAM. In 2021, and to a certain extent, even now, there is literally no amount of money that could purchase an x86 laptop with the same **performance, size, and battery life**. You basically pick two, and lose on the third no matter how you slice it. I think the closest would be Dell Latitudes and ThinkPads if you DIY the RAM upgrades, but definitely nothing out of the box.\n\nIn addition, I have an iPhone 13, iPad Pro, and some AirPods. Again, **there is no amount of money** that could buy the seamless integration to my Apple devices.\n\nHow do I know this? I also have a Samsung Galaxy Book, ZFold 4, Galaxy Tab Ultra, and Galaxy Buds Pro2, by all means premium pricing tiers in their own categories, and the integration difference is just night and day. The software experience just isn't there. We won't even go for the low hanging fruits like the shitty touchpads and Windows OS. The core usability of the devices is just so severely gapped.\n\nIn essence, Apple can charge what they charge, **because no one else provides an alternative with the same functional performance. I would argue access to such a top tier product is worth its price.**\n\nYes ARM on Windows can show some promise, but until their licensing dispute ends, we won't find out. I'm a big supporter in having more competition in this space, because I obviously want to see more competitive pricing on Apple products; by the way, we've already seen what the huge backlash has done to base model SSD performance and RAM specs in their most recent update, so the market definitely pushes Apples to answer. I hope for more of it in the future, but until then, there really is no alternatives besides shelling out for what is basically the best computers in their perspective markets.",

I do this for a living. I've had to deal with more MacBooks than you've seen in your life. Thousands over the last 12 years. \n\nBy the time the battery needs replacement, you will be replacing the entire topcase. There's always a bad key.

Pretty much everything you complain about has diminished after Apple switched away from Intel. They don't have butterfly keyboards anymore. They don't have touchbars anymore. Battery life isn't bad anymore either. Anecdotally, I have a 2020 Macbook Air that I use for work for 8 hours a day on battery and it's still at 86% max charge. This isn't just some freak outlier, either - battery life is something that pretty much every other apple silicon mac owner has been raving about since they came out. Heck, you're even wrong about not being able to get parts for them. Apple has had a [self repair program](https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair) for years now and you can absolutely buy any parts you want. Replacing the battery does not require you to replace the entire topcase, and a topcase itself does not cost $700 either. \n\nIf your experience with Macs are entirely based off of the math of maintaining a fleet of them for a business, you have a skewed perception of what it's like for average people buying them for themselves. And I'd bet the reason why you're being so harsh on it is because you're only seeing the ones that are problematic - which, once again, is the older models that have issues that have been addressed with more recent iterations.",

But your statement actually fits Windows better these days: As a matter of fact they include a Windows Subsystem Linux, that developers have the possibility to flee to a proper command line environment. So basically the only thing left of this OS is to use MS teams and office stuff in Windows and a lot of the actual work happens in Linux. Which is also the initial purpose of an OS developed for accountants. So actually a lot of people are being forced to use Windows in their workplace but do as much as they can in the WSL (Linux), with the support of Microsoft, as they realized they should integrate Linux in their OS for a lot of reasons - this fits the \"but if I wanted to do Linux, I would have Linux.\" a little better I think. An operating system that focuses on providing Linux out of the box. \n\nThe good thing is that smart MS developers really contributed a lot to the Linux kernel the last decade, so win win I guess.",

For the general part we have benchmarks, memory consumption comparisons, power efficiency and such metrics. We have ads popping up in Windows everywhere until it will be just a big ad-based SASS product at some point, harvesting user data like shit. But the discussion is somewhat exhausting anyway and everyone should be able to choose the OS themselves. \n\nTherefore I get your point. It is convenient when you know your environment. Give me any Linux or macOS and I am ready to go in no time, using like 95% of my dotfiles in any POSIX oriented OS. But then give me Windows and I\u2019d do all I can to never leave the WSL and hope that I never need to open the registry or such shit. Surely I\u2019d be extremely unhappy and ultimately quit the job that does force me onto Windows.",

                              "body": "i think part of it may be that PC gamers are by and large DIY (or at least very much into investing in piecemeal upgrades rather than replacing their entire gaming rig), and apple has deliberately removed the option of user modification on every single device they sell now, with the sole exception of the mac pro. Officially you can't even upgrade SSDs anymore outside of the mac pro (technically it is possible on some machines to swap NAND chips, though absolutely not something most people can just do at home), and RAM upgrades have gone completely out the window with the current SOC design. apple doesn't want customers that keep old macs around; they want you to abandon your investment and buy a brand new machine when the SSD wears out or when 8 gigs is simply not enough to run basic OS functions. I suspect they only allow upgrades on the mac pro because even corporate users still scoff that their $7k base price machine (more realistically, probably $10k+) unnecessarily becomes ewaste when their needs start to grow.",

I don\u2019t really see much competition. Lenovo X1 can maybe compete in some fronts but then it\u2019s not cheap also.\n\nIt says more about the PC market but the reality is that no one really does proper competition for what Apple does. Since they are making their cpus their laptops in terms of performance/ battery also seem unbeatable. \n\nOf course if you don\u2019t care about looks or amazing battery life then you can get a much cheaper PC. That\u2019s the compromise. \n\nTheir really only problem is price. \n\nBut if you want exactly what macs have, there really isn\u2019t much proper competition on the windows pc front\u2026 which I always found strange but still true.",

Comparison is therefore rather uninformative because, as you said, none of them are attempting to do what Apple is doing. I highly doubt that it's because they can't and more because they don't yet think it is worth their while to design something so wildly outside the designs where they can leverage existing economies of scale unless a client specifically pays for it. Well, AMD anyway. Intel is toast without a bailout.\n\nLike I said above, as the ARM designs from Apple and Qualcomm continue to show how much is being left on the table by classic discrete component architectures, the x86-64 players will change their strategy.",

All the gains **do not come from node or on-package DRAM.** This is just not correct. As I said previously, if we do an ISO-Node comparison from Apple to the x86 contemporaries the delta is still apparent. Using notebookcheck's data (which is already problematic as they used cinebench R23 for a long time which is much worse for Apple Silicon vs R24) we can quite clearly see that the singlethreaded performance / watt for the [M2 silicon is as high as 171 points/watt](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-M3-Pro-M3-Max-analysis-Apple-has-significantly-upgraded-its-Max-CPU.782974.0.html), vs 25-100 points/watt depending on the Intel/AMD CPU you pick. This means a perf/watt advantage of 6.8x to 1.71x with no node advantage. If you believe that it is the PoP DRAM then you can read [here how even the Core Ultra 9 288V trails the M3 Pro by 2.66x in Perf/watt](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Intel-Lunar-Lake-CPU-analysis-The-Core-Ultra-7-258V-s-multi-core-performance-is-disappointing-but-its-everyday-efficiency-is-good.893405.0.html) singlethreaded. Also the memory is not on-die, it is on-package which is a significant difference. [Just look at geerkerwan's data if you want more points of reference.](https://youtu.be/ymoiWv9BF7Q?si=AnzGeXYDnKkIYXUb&t=618)\n\n>It's an unimaginative approach that realizes the gains precisely through the mechanisms I mentioned above, the processing pipeline itself is pretty ho-hum and nothing interesting.\n\nThis statement is extremely reductive of what goes into CPU design, that I don't believe you can see the performance and power delta I have presented and unironically believe it. Squeezing every % of IPC in a core design is extremely hard, let alone paving the path forward. They aren't playing catch up. The M4 core has a 1.7x higher performance per clock in specFP vs the 14900k, thats \"ho-hum\" ?\n\nDoesn't really matter if AMD or Intel can build an equivalent, ultimately they don't. This is the same reason why the node advantage point is dumb, because at the end of the day I'm not buying a node, I'm buying a product. If Intel or AMD wanted to, they could also pay for a better node. Apple has shown that the market wanted ultra low power, high performance devices and blind sided the x86 guys with M1. Intel and AMD are getting better but it really just shows how bad the duopoly has been for so long!",

I completely agree that it isn't the instruction set doing it, its just good execution from Apple.\n\nJust by the way, the memory is **on-package**, not on-die like the X3D chips. The X3D chips are a much more expensive and performant technology which is literally stacking die to die. What apple uses is effectively what we have in smartphones which is the DRAM traces going through the package around the core die. Its mostly a space and power saving advantage, not really for extra performance as its functionally just LPDRR.",

They just managed to get a step ahead and make different trade offs. When they finally took that leap of faith from x86 to ARM, they had all these advantages stacked up together so it looked like a very impressive uplift, but that was a one time deal, and in reality it's just another step of incremental gains.\n\nI bet if you put Intel's architecture on TMSC's latest node and add AMD's X3D cache or some other kind of large on-die memory, the performance of x86 could probably beat Apple's M chips.\n\nBut I mean, it's still real performance, so it deserves some real praise.",

You really can't find anything else that doesn't sacrifice on one of those. MacOS is also really good, and it has a lot of other nice things like a great trackpad. All my Macs have also lasted a really long time. I got an M1 Max MBP to replace my old Mac Pro that I used since 2008, and I still use my 2012 MBP today, literally daily.",

Geekbench literally just runs a bunch of small tests like code compilation, blender etc and makes a weighted score. People just believe it pulls some numbers out of thin air to lie to gamers. So I do actually trust that M4 chips have 30% faster ST performance than the best from Intel and AMD.\n\nAlso not sure where you're getting double the multithreaded performance from, because the 14900k gets around [2230 in MT R24](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21084/intel-core-i9-14900k-core-i7-14700k-and-core-i5-14600k-review-raptor-lake-refreshed/8), while the [M3 Max gets 1683](https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs), which makes it only 32% faster. The Core Ultra 9 also barely moved the needle, so fair to assume the M4 Max will make up some ground.\n\nGiven that, I don't know how you justify this:\n\n>But as a desktop chip it\u2019s kind of underwhelming tbh.\n\nGiven that you're getting almost all of a 250W Desktop chip in a 55W laptop design, not sure I agree.",

A huge demographic for them is university students moving away from Chromebooks and Windows machines for the first time.\n\nMany of their machines have many inherently more expensive components that competitors often cut corners with. Particularly cases, displays, trackpads and the speakers. In more modular computers like the Mini, the Pro, the prices have historically been much more comparable to other manufacturers than many people estimate. Where they sacrificed value was in upgradeability - which is now irrelevant with SOCs providing such advantages that upgradeability isn't as much a priority for anyone anymore.\n\nApple clearly wanted things that intel couldn't deliver, or they'd never have transitioned away in the first place. Their standards were just different to a lot of the other manufacturers in the PC market. They're much more concerned with power draw and thermals, and this wasn't being well catered to by intel.\n\nThat's why iMacs used portable rather than desktop processors in their iMacs for so many years. I'm not sure it made for good products at the time, but they wanted thinner machines and quieter fans. It's a compromise, they bet on those UX commitments over raw performance while with intel, and it seems to be working out for them now that they can more easily do both.\n\nTo my understanding the slow rate of product refreshes had a lot to do with a high failure rate of intel chips, which was compounded by Apple wanting to run the chips hotter than other manufacturers. There was a constant push and pull between them on this issue throughout their partnership.",

And that's fine - what isn't fine is being so confident in your assessment of a field that you very obviously don't work in.\n\nNot that you'd necessarily understand it, but for example [the build instructions for Chrome](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/master/docs/windows_build_instructions.md#faster-builds) are pretty clear that a 20+ core CPU with 64GB+ of RAM is the recommended system requirement to compile the project without taking ages. A couple paragraphs down you'll spot a reference to [Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient), a tool which (as I said) distributes builds to remote workers and which (as I said) is recommended to Google employees to use to work with large projects like Chrome and AOSP, which is why (again as I said) it doesn't matter what their _personal_, local machine is. You can use even a Chromebook when the actual work is getting done by a different machine.\n\nThis shouldn't even be that hard for you to grasp given your profession, have you never used a render farm before? It's literally the same concept, and equally as silly to argue that the work being done is trivial because the computer an animator is using to _control_ the render farm isn't the beefiest thing in existence.\n\nAs an aside, there are plenty of \"heavy workloads\" that GPUs suck balls at just as CPUs suck at the things GPUs are good at. Using GPUs as the holy grail of intensive compute makes no sense to anyone who does know how both components work. They are designed to optimise for different things (latency vs throughput), one is not inherently more powerful than the other.",

To compare to a similarly-placed industry giant, people at e.g. Pixar and Dreamworks aren't rendering _those_ projects on their personal computers no matter how \"capable\", because consumer-grade hardware will simply not cut it.\n\nAs an aside, Apple Silicon chips _have_ a GPU. A pretty mid one as far as raw performance in certain applications (gaming/gaming-adjacent) goes, but so do plenty of other actual workstations. Dell's Precision line for example doesn't exactly ship with RTX 4090s.\n\n> Back to the point you made, the ultra has 24 cores..the thread ripper comes with 96 if you so choose.\n\nDo you...just not understand computer architecture at all? Number of cores (as is the case with GPUs themselves) increases _throughput_. As I have already said, CPU-bound workloads are those that are dependent on low _latency_. \"Making music\" (i.e. real-time audio processing) for instance is not a trivial workload by any means simply because you don't need a top-of-the-line GPU for it - you don't need one because despite plenty of effort, GPUs _suck_ at the highly sequential but also extremely low latency demands of DAWs. There are some workloads that benefit immensely from both high throughput and low latency, which is where processors like the Threadripper and Intel's Xeon line come in, but _those_ are the ones that are actually niche (which is why they don't actually sell that well, and are often used as hosts for multiple virtualised systems).\n\nThis is why CPU benchmarks measure both single-core (this is latency) _and_ multi-core (this is throughput) performance. \"This CPU is behind because it has fewer cores/that CPU is ahead because it has a higher per-core clock frequency\" is the opinion of someone who doesn't know much about both things.",

Can\u2019t say much about rendering graphics because I don\u2019t do that in my own use cases. I\u2019m curious to know what the difference between the newer gpus on m3+ would perform in comparison to the 4090 since graphics was the biggest jump from m2 to m3. The ideal setup is having both imo. \n\nAlso I think it\u2019s worth mentioning how insane it is that an M2 Ultra performs half the speed of a 4090 considering it doesn\u2019t use a dedicated GPU at all.

Currently, most major discrete GPUs only work with x86/x86-64 processors, so that's gonna have to change aswell. \n\nthey'll have to pay for a license right? or maybe they'll use other reduced instruction sets that offer similar performance. what will happen to the decades of beloved software, including video games? \n\nso many questions.",

You can make a build to get these benchmark scores for about 1/3rd the price, but to match the other specs of the laptop you get decently close. Unless you want more memory and storage than the base model mac has, in which case it gets silly expensive.",
