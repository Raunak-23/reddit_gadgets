                      "body": "Considering we had many oleds drop into the 450-650 range with sales this holiday season, we can probably expect the same next year\u2026if tariffs don\u2019t mess everything up lol.\n\nThere are even WITHOUT sales a couple options in the $550 range, aoc being the only good brand option though, without going for a sketchy innocn or KTC or something.\n\nBut $600-$700 is where a TON of good oleds are available right now. The big con is that almost ALL of them are 1440p or 1440p ultrawide, and 1440p over 27 inches is not ideal. 1440p is great AT 27 inches though. Or a 1440p ultrawide is basically the same PPI. But for a true 32 inch, you\u2019ll really want a 4k display at 32 inches. \n\nAnd as a caveat, 1440p oled 27 inch is good for \u201cgaming\u201d. But i\u2019ve heard many, many complaints about 1440p 27 inch oleds for viewing text, productivity work, web browsing, etc. Also, even for gaming, ai upscalers like dlss/fsr look better and work better for 4k then they do for 1440p. Upscalers are closing that gap, where it might make sense to goto 4k over 1440p. There are even these new monitors that have a sorta dual mode feature, where they can switch between 1080p super high refresh rate, and 4k lower fps, on a hardware level? Idk. \n\n4k 27 inch \u201cis\u201d clearer and sharper. Especially for productivity. It is very very close in PPI to the so-called \u201cRetina Display Resolution\u201d Apple coined the term for. At that specific PPI, at a specific distance from the eye, it is impossible to discern pixels consciously or subconsciously. OLED 4k 27 inch monitors are JUST releasing this week though. They are probably THE best choice for most folks as a monitor upgrade. \n\nCrazy deal though I believe that is still going on, is the Alienware aw3423dwf. A revision of the best oled monitor from two years ago that many big YouTubers got and went nuts over, specifically Linus of LinusTechTips. It was the first QD-OLED (quantum dot oled) to release for monitors. Also MonitorsUnboxed has been using it continuously these past couple years even with \u201cbetter\u201d monitors releasing. It\u2019s a curved 3440x1440 ultrawide QD-OLED 165hz Freesync Premium Pro monitor. From Dell\u2019s website, and a promotional code MONITORS15, it drops to $552.49 without tax. Best oled monitor deal PERIOD right now. \n\nBut for you to get anything below $500, don\u2019t know what price you\u2019re looking for, but youll need to wait for next year. And it\u2019ll be the 1440p models dropping into that range. Of course tariffs will more than likely screw this all up, raising monitor prices $100-200. That would likely lead to the same deals next year as this year, rather than an actual drop in prices.",
