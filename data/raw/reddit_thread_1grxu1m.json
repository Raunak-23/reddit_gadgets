But just saying I have to give ***MASSIVE*** props to MSI to looking into it from the first case, and the second case is just making them double down on making sure it isn\u2019t a manufacturing error. We have had wayyyyy too many PC part companies try to say it isn\u2019t their issue until you smear their face in their own shit. This goes all the way up to the biggest part company of Intel even. So this is honestly huge showing that they are willing to take accountability if they are at fault, and once the issue is fully solidified I think my next board will be an MSI knowing they are going to try to stay on top of these issues.",

If it's user damage and easy to cause (meaning at least a few more people regularly do this in the same manner), that's fine (to them); still worth the investigating. What would not be fine would be ignoring it entirely, because then it could be questioned. If they address it and find it's user damage, even if it's common user damage failure mode, they can explicitly address that and keep public trust (and probably prevent others from doing the same thing). If it's not, they can gain public goodwill by showing they didn't handle it like Intel just did their failures across the board. They can also immediately address it if it is indeed a CPU or socket failure.\n\nNo matter what, their problem or not, investigating immediately and thoroughly is a PR win and a financial win.",
