I can only hope that there's no economic value from most consumers and brain chips die in the market, but I don't believe that will happen, regardless of if Neuralink is the successful attempt or not.\n\nIn an ideal world it would only be used for medical purposes. I remember seeing the guy who was quadriplegic be able to play computer games with it. With additional medical hardware, they theorize they could make some specific cases fully mobile again. That's just objectively a miracle.\n\nBut at the same time, you just know that when brain chips become available on a consumeristic basis, it's going to be brainrot slop and an absolutely data collection hive.",
