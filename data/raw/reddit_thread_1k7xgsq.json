Are the only eyes looking at open source software the \"good guys\"?\n\nHere's another:\n\nIf you develop software professionally, how much time do you spend upgrading npm packages as the old ones are found to have security holes?\n\nFor all the downvoters, enjoy your reflex.

Do you have any idea how convoluted that code base will be after 15 years of development? \n\nTL;DR is this stuff is hard. Assuming that it's magically safer because it's open source is wrong and more importantally, dangerous. It still takes care, feeding and diligence.",

But open source *is* ***more*** secure than closed source, by simple virtue of having more eyes on it, and being auditable by anyone. Yes, this means bad actors can take advantage of it too, but it also means they need to work quietly and quickly, too, because the good actors have all the same information as them. \n\nYou can -and should- point out all the times open source software had bugs in it that were caught and explored by bad actors first. But they are far outnumbered by the number of times the same things happened to closed source software.",

Google has absolutely no qualitative advantage any more and they pack in more and more ads as well as rank search results according to how well paid they are. Bing doesn't do as much manipulation with the rankings and Duckduckgo just gives a couple of basic keyword ads without profiling you. \n\nSEO has just ruined the traditional search engine so it's functionally nothing but basic keyword searches, while Google has turned their algorithm away from serving users and focused it completely on advertising. I use DDG and Brave search and they're fine for keyword searches.\n\nHonestly, just about the only thing these LLM AI chatbots are good for is search. With a little practice, you can quickly get them to help filter the wheat from the chaff and give clear, useful search results like Google used to. For now. The enshittification cycle will come for them too, and I expect advertisers will adapt SEO for the AI age by using their own AIs to pollute ChatGPT and Copilot results with crap too. But for now, they work pretty well as search engine replacements. I'm partial to Copilot in particular, mainly because I use it extensively for work so I'm familiar with its little quirks.",

Companies releasing products as closed source is fine so long as when the hardware is no longer able to sustain with a live service, all code that runs on the hardware itself must be l\nreleased within that same year of discontinuing said software service connection to the hardware. \n\nIt just solves so much heartache, pain, and waste. And creates jobs and market opportunities for those willing to use the code and step in. \n\nAf far as security, which is a real concern, the way to counter that argument is simply that obfuscation isn't a valid security method. Given this truth, it isn't much of a stretch to deem arguments formed to defend stopping the release of this code as extensions of code obfuscation. That's because the code will never be patched anyways going forward, so any claim of danger is ignoring the fact that defacto code function can be sourced manually over time by any bad actors anyways. So simply specifying a time not greater than 1 year before the code is released should be enough to technically appease that crowd anyways, after which time the real code would be released. \n\nThis does not require the online service code and it shouldn't. Just the code that is existing on the hardware, along with any extra code required to communicate with that hardware (Like secret internal keys meant to stop the change of code on the hardware by non company action, which would be a moot security point by the time such services are canceled)\n\nAm I missing anything obvious here?",

              "body": "> Cyber security needs change continually after a physical item ships.\n\nThat is sort-of bullshit. For one, it's not a law of nature that software in devices must have vulnerabilities. A lot of that is just the result of bad software development practices that businesses have no incentive to fix because they can use the vulnerabilities to sell support and updates and replacements.\n\n> It\u2019s not possible \u2014 I don\u2019t mean feasible under the iron thumb of ruthless capitalism, I mean possible \u2014 update obsolete tech indefinitely.\n\nThat is pretty much bullshit, too. I mean, maybe not indefinitely, but certainly much longer than they do. So, 30 years would be perfectly possible, and would be close enough to indefinitely in practice for many products.\n\n>  Every new model release would necessitate commitment to support and integrate with those changing cyber security needs. \n\nThere are no \"changing cyber security needs\". More precisely: Most vulnerability fixes are just fixes of broken code or hard-coded credentials. Those were vulnerabilities when the product was released, not the result of some \"changing need\". The one big area where that might not be quite true is crypography, where faults in protocols or primitives get discovered and thus those need to be replaced. However, for one, that field has matured a lot, and the current generation of protocols and primitives can generally be considered pretty reliable. But also, it's just software, and software that is generally not particularly specific to the respective hardware, so it's not really that hard to update anyway.\n\nThe major shift in that area was the shift away from clear text communication to encryption, which required more processing power in devices to handle, and thus couldn't really be done with an update. But for one one could argue that manufacturers dragged their feet on that, so we could have had that much earlier, instead of needing to replace everything, but more importantly: That is behind us. All new devices do have the processing power. So, changng details of the cryptography used is much more feasible.\n\nBut also, part of the solution here, too, is local control. If your device only talks to your local home assistant instance, then cyber security is much less critical than if it directly talks to the public internet. And it's better for privacy. And the product can't be obsoleted by the manufacturer switching off their server. And it's much easier to apply security updates for home assistant, should those be necessary.",

Ecobee is making shit up.\n* Creating custom schedules is an exercise in frustration.\n* Trying to understand how Eco+ works is an equally frustrating experience when the thermostat doesn't tell you any details why it is ignoring your schedules.\n* Their rebate program with my electric company can't verify my account for some reason and doesn't allow me to cancel the application or resubmit it, yet they email me constantly to try again. Support told me the program is full and I should try again...even though their outsourced provider running this program doesn't let me. Great job guys!\n* The official integration for SmartThings (and probably others) doesn't allow you to explicitly toggle heat or cooling modes.

I always understood that to be their killer feature which makes it sting even more.\n\nI have a simple setup: forced central air, natural gas furnace, and freshly pulled wiring with a proper C wire and no splices or janky adapters -- all servicing a single zone. All equipment is properly maintained and serviced by me and the equipment is less than 10yrs old. The house is about 1500sqft and the thermostat is located in the living room. The Zigbee SmartSensor is on the exact opposite side of the house (my bedroom) and the furthest from the equipment and thermostat. No connection issues and the sensor reliably records my motion and presence each time, albeit with a totally unacceptable cool down time that demonstrates quality engineering is not Ecobee's primary motivator.\n\nBecause this is my bedroom, I'm not in it all day. No matter the season, the temperature delta between my bedroom and the living room is between 8 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit. The Ecobee app reliably shows the differing temperatures of the sensor and thermostat. However, devoid of all common sense, the temperature physically displayed on the thermostat can be an average of these two temperature readings and not the actual temperature of the thermostat. I have an Accurite weather station right next to the thermostat, so I see it every time when Ecobee decides to intentionally gaslight any person reading the thermostat display with a temperature 6 degrees off from reality.\n\nI would expect that if I enter my bedroom after a long time of inactivity, while there is also activity in my living room, the thermostat will compensate for this and run the equipment to reach the desired temperature as measured as an average between the two. I would also expect that if I am not in the living room at all, but I'm in the bedroom, then the thermostat temperature will be ignored. It rarely works this smoothly. There is unnecessary complexity with the home/away/night modes and the ability to choose which sensors to use during each mode. Given that geofencing with their Android app is unreliable, I cannot be sure which mode the thermostat will be in at any time and which sensors will be used to determine the set temperature.\n\nI am sure I can dig into this further and develop various automations to compensate for the platform flaws...but it is kinda ridiculous to do so.",

I've got a bunch of these; had a 2nd gen at my previous house and have 4 gen 3s in my current house and I have a load of Nest smoke alarms too. I remember being excited about Nest when they were first released; designed by ex-Apple staff and looked really nice. But then Google bought them and good iOS support was always due to be coming 'soon'. Siri support was never quite promised but always hinted as being available in the near future. Just like they were strongly hinting years ago that they'd add some Nest compatible radiator TRVs but again, that never materialised. \n\nBesides all that; I really hate the 'learning' part of them. I just want to be able to set it to a temperature, set it remotely using my phone or a voice command or schedule it to be a temperature for certain times of the day. I don't want it to learn and adjust settings whenever I turn it up. I don't want it to learn when I'm home or not and I don't want it to turn off when I'm out (there's almost always someone at home and when there's not, there are pets here).\n\nI know I need to replace them all but it's not obvious what works well. I want Apple HomeKit Support. I want Smart TRV support. I want separate zone support. I have four underfloor heating zones and radiators that control two floors. Right now I have a Nest per underfloor heating room and one Nest for the rest of the house which is heated by radiators. The last time I looked into it, there weren't any solutions available in the UK that could handle all of that.",

Hopefully these can still be used after being removed from their network, as I remember years ago during a bad heatwave, Google services were down that powered these devices, and users couldn't use their Nest to cool, or heat their houses.\n\nBasic, cheap thermostats will always be king to me just because of issues like I stated above. Usually easier to install too, especially for those with older houses that don't have updated wiring to units to support these smart devices like I do.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention too, the coupon system seems like a slap in the face to me as I don't see why they can't just make these older devices function normally without smart functions locally, and literally taking people's money while taking the product away they paid for.

The auto schedule thing always ran like crap, it was hot when I got home and would randomly get hot in the middle of the night or morning. I tried resetting the learning several times and if I left it on too long it would start messing up. I've been running efficiently off of a timed schedule for 5 years.  \n  \nI was also really annoyed they collect all this cooling data from my system, it knows the temp outside, humidity, so it knows how long it should take my house to cool, but when my system has a problem and isn't cooling I never got an alert that there was a problem. I'd come home and it's 85 in the house because it's been running the pump all day with no fan, or the pump didnt come on because the capacitor went out. The only benefit over a cheapo thermostat is it looks nice and I can control it from my phone.",
