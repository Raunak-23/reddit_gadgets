Esp at a similar price point.\n\n\nIve noticed the bigger problem is content.\nA series would have like 1 episode with 10 seconds where sound is properly mixed to take advantage of it but would be advertised as dolby atmos\n\n\nEdit: im my example im considering a soundbar like samsung 990.

                      "body": "ATMOS is just different version of already implemented surround sound. The only real difference is the added height channel. So it's 5.1 with an added channel of height. Thats really it. The mixes are also a bit different, you have location based sound instead of standard \"channels\" so when sound team creates audio they can \"play\" with the audio a bit more and give it locations instead of \"this sound plays from this channel speaker\". Think of a halo around you. Traditional 5.1 has the center, left, right and rear left right (5) and a bass if you have one (.1). \n\nWhen sound mixing for this you would say these sounds go to this speaker at this level of volume. Imagine these FIXED to a certain position on the halo around you. They can put sounds here or there only and at certain levels. Atmos allows them to pick \"locations\" on the halo around you to give more precise sound. With the added bonus of a height channel (vertical halo) above you. This helps the precision a bit more because if for example something flies overhead and to the left, right or behind you tricks your brain better in the perceived surround sound depth. \n\nIt really does make a huge difference, when I finally splurged and got my Bose 900 with surround speakers I had family over and we watched a few movies with great Atmos support and there were times people kept pausing the movie thinking something fell or dropped in the kitchen behind us. There was one movie I loved to put on for people because it had a knock on door scene that the direction was where my front door is and it gets them EVERY time. It literally sounds like someone is at my door. \n\nLast scene was I believe in The Sandman show, there is a rain scene that gives you the effect of rain actually falling down on you. You can hear the rain move from ceiling to floor. It's VERY good when done right. Problem is not all movies/shows have it and those that do only a few really take the time to utilize it properly.",

When we mix say Dolby 5.1 for a feature film, we need to say which speaker is to play what sound. But with Atmos we say \u201dit should play from over here\u201d in a 3D space. And then that is converted into physical speakers on the other end. If you have a hundred speakers, that position in space will be perfect and exact. If you only have four speakers, not so much. And if you only have two, like AirPods, it won\u2019t be precise at all but it will try to simulate 3D space.",

Sorry if I got a bit off track, but I was questioning the viability or realistic nature of 8K being a thing.\n\nHigher resolutions, especially in a VFX heavy film industry, means higher rendering time, and more expensive render farms, and that means spending more money. Studios obviously don\u2019t want to do that. The fact that most people don\u2019t realize how much 4K content is actually 2K content speaks to that.\n\nAnd for what? Denser pixels, you say? The benefits of going from 4K to 8K simply aren\u2019t the same as 1080p to 4K. Content is not really being future proofed for 8K because audiences can barely tell the difference between a 2K upscale and a true 4K master. The files are being put on disc without compression. Played as if they are straight from the digital masters. There\u2019s no \u201cimproving\u201d that content.\n\nAnd ALLLLLL of that has a big old asterisk on it, which is the assumption that a restoration is done well and isn\u2019t DNR\u2019d to hell.

Perfect contrast. A perfect picture.\n\nMy mother, God rest her, would still watch DVDs or sometimes a local broadcast in standard definition. I remember asking her a \u201chow can you possibly watch this? It\u2019s so low resolution\u201c and she was like \u201cgrowing up, I never even had a color TV. When TV went to color that was a huge deal. Then   DVD came out and it looked nicer than cassette, hat was a big deal. But outside of that, it\u2019s pretty hard to impress me when you go from black-and-white to color\u201c.",

Our eyes do not have a frame rate per se, they are constantly picking up huge quantities of dynamic information. Between our central vision (the area with the most acuity and detail) and the amount of processing our brain does to produce a cohesive experience, the estimate is closer to 7 - 15 megapixels.\n\n4k is 8 Mp and 8k is 33 Mp, and given that our eyes *effective* resolution is much higher than that, it's reasonable to say we haven't quite reached that limit yet.\n\nAnd as a previous poster mentioned, the ability to perceive the difference has many factors...\n\nI'd say between the nuance that is the human visual experience and the vagueness that is the \"4k and 8k\" standards (how big is a \"pixel\") it's reasonable to assume that we can tell the difference... And it will be a while before we fully stop being able to tell the difference (but will the cost of price and complexity continue to be worth it?)",
