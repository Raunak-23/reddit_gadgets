Without a dam large scale hydro would be just as if not more inconsistent than on smaller scales. Also, even large scale plants are subject to seasonal changes, they are just much less impactful due to the ability to plan and prepare for those changes through the use of dams.\n\nThis isn't to downplay the tech, just to point out the downsides of large scale hydro-electric plants. There are huge advancements that have been made over the years that significantly lessen the eco impact as well as reduce the foot print that is needed, but dams are still an unfortunate requirement if you want consistency.",

Those are not cheap to make and require extensive manufacturing and metallurgy using\u2026 fossil fuels.\n\nReminds me of celebrities who build \u201csustainable mansions\u201d but all the construction equipment used burns more fossil fuels than the house is ever gonna save.\u00a0\n\nAll those solar panels, wind turbines? The carbon footprint is thru the roof and the hazardous waste they create can\u2019t be recycled or repurposed so disposal costs involve the use of fossil fuels to power up all the equipment to deal with literally trash.\u00a0\n\nJust don\u2019t forget the real costs involved in making these devices, and you are barely making a dent in the use of fossil fuels, from a manufacturing point of view that needs to be considered in this entire equation. \u00a0",
