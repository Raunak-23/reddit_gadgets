People have just found some prototype devices on a Chinese site:\n\n- Surface duo 2 lite, which was a cancelled, cheaper version of Duo 2\n- Surface Andromeda, which was a prototype from before Duo that ran Microsoft's own Andromeda OS instead of Android\n- Surface Duo 1 prototypes with rear facing cameras (which wasn't implemented until Duo 2, and arguably in a less elegant way)\n- Surface Neo, which was a dual screen tablet meant to run Windows X (cancelled OS, which basically became Windows 11). None of these appear to be working.\n\nNone of these are new discoveries, and all have been seen in some manner before - like the Duo 1 prototype was shown to MKBHD in a video visiting Microsoft I believe. It's more just interesting that people are getting their hands on these weird devices which were never meant to see the light of day.",

The innovation came with how thin it was, which  was pretty cutting edge for the time, but when you realize it\u2019s because so much hardware was sacrificed, it becomes clear while nobody else makes a phone this thin. \n\nThe black matte finish was much nicer in my opinion than the white that they went with with the newer devices.   \n\nCool little piece of trivia. These devices, though not successful, we\u2019re heavily pushed for a product placement in Hollywood. Even the larger tablet that was never released is in a Netflix movie.",
