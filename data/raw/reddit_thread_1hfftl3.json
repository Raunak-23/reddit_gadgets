You might chop $20~$30 off the end price. Because the different design configs are gonna cost money to too. And for $30 I\u2019d wager that just about any consumer would be like \u201ceh. Yeah. Might as well take the screen one.\u201d There\u2019s also risk in carrying additional sku\u2019s that you don\u2019t know for certain will sell especially if they\u2019re at a lesser price point, that can take away sales from higher price points. If they end up with excess inventory, and have to reduce prices it also devalues the higher price models.\n\nThe OLED/LCD one wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea but as someone else said I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they launch with LCD, because it\u2019s easier to secure supply and ramp production for those. They\u2019ll secure all the launch sales, and then release OLED later to double up on sales where people want to upgrade to OLED, some LCD will end up on the used market (which is fine for Nintendo, because that means they have a new customer buying games), but/and a lot will go to become a 2nd household switch (kids/multiplayer/families) as Nintendo positions themselves as a family oriented console.",

              "body": "So while I 100% am disappointed by the news (or rumors) that it won't have a OLED screen, it's funny because I would also never use it in handheld mode. \n\n\nI do currently own a launch version of the switch (my daughters) and I did purchase the BOTW OLED version of the switch. I just can't stand the joycons whatsoever and only ever play with it docked and with a pro controller. Maybe the new joycons will be bigger and a more comfortable fit in my hands and that would change my feelings on using it in handheld mode. \n\n\n\nI just feel like the only two reasons I can think of them not using a OLED panel would be 1 to cut production costs and 2 to have something to add to the refresh. But without having any real knowledge of how much these things cost, I do wonder how much more it would really add to the price tag (assuming my guess is anything near correct). Regardless of all this, not launching with an OLED is a pretty simple way for me to feel like I don't mind waiting. Which again is such a funny outlook considering what my expected use case will be haha.",

You don\u2019t see the 10-20% improvement typical from hardware changes - you see it go 10-1000x faster.\n\nThat\u2019s why you see a game like BotW and Pokemon on the same console.

Takes about 2 years to start heavily noticing the burn in, after 3 I see it all the time. I expect my top line electronics / displays to last 5 years personally before I refresh. It's really irritating to me. But I get it. Not everyone cares about accurate colors. If you're a 1-3 game person, avoid OLED at all cost.

This is the exact method used to jailbreak \"new\" Switch consoles like the Switch Lite and the OLED model.\n\nEven if there are no boot ROM vulnerabilities in the CPU/GPU code, if you can carefully time a nanosecond-precision power glitch to the chip and there are no glitch detection circuits within the SoC itself, you can get it to skip instructions. The OG Switch did have a USB bug in the boot ROM (fusee gelee). This was fixed in later models but didn't prevent open-source modchips from glitching the power supply to the SoC at the exact time it performed \"if (signatureInvalid()) {abortBoot()}\".",
