This means that better sticks can be made, but they just aren\u2019t (while prices for controllers have steadily increased).\n\nIt\u2019s cool tech (I have a hall-effect keyboard and it\u2019s over 40 years old) but it looks like too many people are buying into the marketing hype and thinking that Hall-Effect is the only superior solution.",

Its probably not the *only* one but its a very simple one at minimal cost that *does* solve the issue. \n\nFeel free to go use a much older controller. A lot of them were basically just a set of on/off buttons by comparison... if not literally. \n\nThats the difference.\n\nAs sticks got more sensitive, it exposes the downside of the tech being used. Deadzones are tiny and tiny drifts start existing.",

Most people don\u2019t play constantly, so they don\u2019t damage the mechanisms from excessive wear and tear.\n\nLike most fandoms, the most hardcore tend to complain the most LOUDLY. I\u2019ve been using analog controls for decades and never run into stick drift. Neither have my friends. \n\nI would consider myself a mid to high level gamer. I buy every console and multiple first party controllers for each. I switch controllers from time to time and treat them with respect (no excessive grinding the sticks, no shaking the controller and definitely no throwing it). If people treated their controllers like they did their phone, they\u2019d last longer.",

Kotaku claimed, without a source, that \u201cthousands\u201d of joycons were sent to Nintendo every week for repair. Another article said 40% of all Switch users experienced stick drift, but if you looked at the source, it was a self-reported survey site. Of course people are going to complain they have a problem. It\u2019s not a representative sample.\n\nThe fact is, again, we\u2019re relying on secondhand data instead of the companies themselves. If there were significant replacements of hardware, publicly traded companies like Microsoft and Nintendo would have to report it because it would eat into revenue. \n\nIn fact, Microsoft did report issues with the 360\u2026 console. The red ring of death caused a $1B write up on their financials. They had to report it during an investor\u2019s call (https://www.computerworld.com/article/1579132/xbox-360-red-ring-of-death-costs-microsoft-more-than-1b.html).\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying stick drift doesn\u2019t exist. It does. But if you ever look at people posting about it, it\u2019s clear that a good chunk of the time (not always, but a good chunk) they have been beating up their controllers pretty badly. I\u2019ve seen \u201cmy stick is drifting\u201d pictures on Reddit with broken bumpers. Cracked chassis. Peeling grips. Further, I\u2019ve seen pictures posted in front of what looks like a pigsty. Dirty carpets. Consoles shoved into areas with no ventilation. Visible dust. Hardcore gamers aren\u2019t known to be the most, uh\u2026 I\u2019ll just say \u201crational\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d people. Go to any convention and you\u2019ll see this. The fact that they wig out at the slightest provocation and don\u2019t treat their own bodies with respect doesn\u2019t surprise me when they post pictures of busted controllers.\n\nIn any case, I digress. Tl;dr: drift exists, but it\u2019s not nearly the problem hardcore gamers online make it out to be. If it was, it would show up in company\u2019s financial statements.",

The ds3, for example, came with a lithium polymer battery (unusual for the time, but means that they are still going to work today..), a rubber in the thumbstick that wouldn't sweat and deteriorate to an unusable level, very small deadzone, analog pressure on the facepad buttons (like.. who does that?) and an onboard logic that an engineer at Sony spent an hour waxing poetically about that would allow all kinds of simplifications for assuring input ranges and deadzone adjustment, and so on. Sixaxis was cool, I thought.. which I apparently was alone in XD\n\nSony would not build that pad today, of course. They want to just earn as much money as possible on only exploiting their fans and market share, like everyone else. But it was and is possible to build something that actually works, doesn't fall off the usability scale over time, and that doesn't actually cost significantly more.",

We literally have decades of precedent to refer back to.  Look how bad their controllers have been since the N64.  You'd think they'd have learned by now, unless there was an ulterior motive - and that motive comes down to selling replacement controllers.  The profit margin on controllers is obscene compared to the console.  Where it costs 270 bucks or more to make a 300 dollar console, it costs around $3 to make a $60 set of joycons.  You only make $30 on the console, but for every joycon you make $57.  You come out better selling joycons than you do consoles at that point.  It makes perfect sense if you're a sociopath (e.g. any given corporation).\n\nAs far as the magnets are concerned, those wouldn't have made any difference whatsoever to a hall effect sensor.  The strong part of magnetic fields are actually much smaller than people think and it's trivial to calibrate the hall effect sensors to compensate.  Component and board level electronics is what I studied in college.  Trust me on this, it's trivial to work around such things.  There's no technological reason not to have hall effect.  It's all a financial/profit based decision on their part.\n\nNo, the most likely reason is the tiny added cost and the constant revenue stream of replacement controllers.  Do you know how much Ninty made from replacement joycons on the Switch?  TENS OF MILLIONS...all because they didn't use hall effect joysticks (in other words controllers that wear out fast).  Do you honestly think they would do anything to endanger that steady revenue stream?  Absolutely not.  Especially not if it also increased their margin on consale sales by any amount at all.",

They also sell a charging station for it (to save life on the USB-C port, sticks with alternate stem length and a mount to attach your phone to it - very nice for Gamepass remote play.\n\nBy far the best gamepad I ever used.",

Potentiometers degrade gradually whereas a failed HE sensor fully loses control all at once. With millions of units being manufactured and an industry standard failure rate of like 2.5%, you have the choice of like 25K people out of every million having zero control out of the box vs maybe never even noticing a slightly faulty potentiometer. If you are a peripheral company, this is the only RMA you have to do, not even close to the situation of console manufacturer",
