Which might seem like a lot of money, but Apple also just made approx. $29.6 Billion dollars in gross profit from just the pre-sales weekend of the iPhone 16 launch. So regardless of anything else the company does or sells, just that sales volume is staggering.\n\nIndonesia is the largest smartphone market in Southeast Asia, being 40% of the total smartphone devices for the entire region, so it's a juicy steak to smartphone makers. Good to see a country leveraging its market share to bring more money, training and skills into the country and keeping it there, rather than having all that money immediately going offshore",

They need GPS receiver, LCD or OLED, the panel itself, touch sensor layer, protective glasses, flash storage, image sensors, camera, camera lens, camera modules, lithium ion battery, NFC chips, accelerometer, gyroscope etc.\n\nLet me give you an example for Vietnam. For non-Vietnamese phones, ~25 phone parts are produced in Vietnamese plants/factories/mines, but 72 for Vietnamese phones. China itself is able to make more than 150 parts of a phone. You mentioned \"logistics\" and \"distribution\", so you have to at least realize phones are not just made in phone factories out of thin air.",
