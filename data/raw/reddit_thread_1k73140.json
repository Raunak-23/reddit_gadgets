If Nintendo insists on putting their games on the carts... I guess that means even more sales than they already get from me?\n\nIt's not the same as Steam.  I've had Steam for like 20 years.  The library is still what it is.  PCs don't change generations and there's no concept of losing access to games because previous generations of games reside in shops that are no longer online so you can't redownload something you bought.  Backwards compatibility is pretty good too... about the only thing you have to worry about are really old games that want older OSes and weird shit like that.  I'm comfortable buying shit on Steam as a result... plus, you kind of don't have a choice for PCs anyway.  Physical media for PC died out a long time ago.",

That's in theory not always going to be around.  I'd feel more comfortable about it if they would just stick to the same infrastructure, OS, whatever, from now to infinity, so it's always one store, one place, etc, and we don't have these generations that are like a hard reset.  I hope that's the direction that things are going in for everybody.  Switch 2 makes that promising... so far.  We won't know what that looks like until the next generation or two.\n\nQuite honestly, the only thing that's going to get me to fully adopt digital on console is the death of physical media.  I hope by then, we have that kind of shit in place where your library just travels with you from generation to generation and a game you bought 15 years ago just works on the console you're playing now.  I get that physical media has this same problem where you need the older console connected and plugged in to play it, but I'm saying if digital is going to have the same restrictions **and more** than physical does... then I have no real incentive to buy digital and so I generally don't for consoles.\n\nThat's a little different for Switch because it's portable and you have to think about carrying carts with you... that's finally a positive thing for digital and it makes the desirability for digital go up for me as a result.  I don't want to carry carts with me all the time, and so smaller games, I'm willing to buy digital to have a library of stuff that just lives on the console.  Another positive for digital with Switch 2 is that finally, it's looking like some carts will be more expensive than their digital counterparts, and so there's now a pricing incentive that generally didn't used to be there.\n\nWhile this is a fringe case... we now have Ubisoft ripping The Crew out of people's digital libraries.  Sony has ripped movies and TV shows out of people's libraries.  The idea bothers me, and if physical media still exists, that's what I'll prefer probably right up to its death.  But like... again, *real* physical media and not what these game key cards are.  The data is on the cart, I can play it off the cart, I don't need an online connection or service or whatever the fuck to play it or download the rest of it or whatever, and that's it.",

Still played every game I ever wanted to play. I wasn't ever going to pay for Nintendo's exploitative and exorbitantly priced shit internet service anyway, so there was no downside to never being able to go online. Still got updates and DLCs for free.\n\nThe Switch 2 is so expensive and so disgustingly scummy to the consumer that I may straight-up pass on it entirely, so Nintendo won't even get the money for the console that they got out of me for the Switch.\n\nI have hacked basically every Nintendo console I own and their hackability is the only reason I own any of their products in the first place. With the way I play games, there's a 0% chance that I'm paying even $50 for a title. $70 and $80 is completely out of the question. I tend to get really into a single game every 4-6 months, play it nonstop for like three days, and then never touch it again.\n\nThe shit they've got going on is not worth it, and they've even managed to ruin the only series that DOES usually get me to play for longer (Pokemon) to the point where I drop the new ones in less than a day and just go back to the GBA and DS games, or other games in Nintendo's back catalogue that, over the past two decades, they've been trying to trick me into buying multiple times when I already own them. I scrounged up my birthday money as a kid to buy the old game at a huge price (adjusted for inflation) when it launched, I'm not going to be nickeled and dimed every console generation buying a poorly-emulated version of it over and over again.",

This is honestly a way better option. Especially when Nintendo wants to stick with their expensive to produce cartridges (anything above ~~64~~ 32 GB gets pretty costly, and even ~~64~~ 32 GB cost them that much that they priced TotK which use it 10\u20ac higher). That's unfortunately too small for modern AAA games. So between going full digital with code only and this I'll pick this. Of course, full physical would be better.",

Selling a switch with no physical games and no games on it (because you wiped it) is not going to get as much money as a switch with even just 1 physical game.

They don\u2019t have to pay for the physical game card and they can really limit the ability to play the game, share, or resell it by doing so.

Maybe digital games become even more common in the future, but not because of these new keys. This whole brouhaha seems like the biggest nontroversy to me. It doesn\u2019t actually change anything wrt to the concerns people are raising.\u00a0",

It's completely on them to decide to use the key cards. I think Nintendo is at fault for even making this an option to begin with, but they're not forcing devs to use them. \n\n\nAlso I get people having a problem because this is a terrible option for those that want physical media (like myself sometimes) but you can't turn around and act like the state of game ownership on PC is any better lmfao. When's the last time anyone's owned a physical copy of a PC game? \n\n\nEDIT: I know services like GOG exist that offer DRM-free local ownership. I'll concede that's different and a good way to preserve games. That's not what I'm talking about though considering the majority of PC gaming happens through store services like ORIGIN and Steam.\n\n\nI like to shit on Nintendo just as much as the next, but this ain't it, lol.",

      "body": "Yeahhhhh. No. Not happy about that. I very rarely get games digitally. Usually only if that is the only option available for a particular game. I wanted to get Shadow Generations, but didnt want it digitally. But they didnt make an accessible physical copy for the PS4. So my option was wait it out or get it on Switch where it would run like Crap. So I waited, got excited when I heard Switch 2 would be as powerful as a PS4 and heard it was going to be on Switch 2, now I see it will not be physical and am back to being stuck. At this point, I should say F Switch 2 and just buy a PS5 instead.\u00a0",

They aren't doing this. It was completely made up by rage baiters. The game costs the same digital or physical. Nowhere is it 90 USD.",

You're also ignoring that physical games still exist on switch 2 and digital game sales, so clearly devs aren't concerned about using this as a security measure.\n\nYou just made up a connection from two unrelated topics and combined them while ignoring the real reason (Nintendo only providing 64 GB cartridges and devs not wanting to pay that cost). Of course you're going to get down voted.",
