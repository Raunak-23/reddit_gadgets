Every complex piece of software utilizes a suite of tests designed to catch, among other things, regression bugs and ensure things like past security fixes continue to work. That's what this suite of tests is for. To my knowledge this suite of tests deal with the OS itself, not the Google Play services which are the closed source components of Google's \"walled garden\".\n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. A company called Fairphone documented their journey to extend support for their devices and documented their partnership with LineageOS to deliver official support for their devices as Qualcomm refused to allow them to use official drivers for their SoC. It was not trivial and one of the hardest parts was making sure their updates still passed those automated tests for quality.\n\nhttps://www.fairphone.com/en/2020/06/18/fairphone-2-gets-android-9/",

Some do it online even, like you mail it in and get it back same way.\n\nI'm sorry but you are talking absolute nonsense. And basically describing your personal inability to perform basic tasks such as getting a device serviced.\n\nApple charges 49-99 dollars to replace a battery, Android devices cannot be 100-200 dollars.

Never experienced it lol, besides we got fast charging these days, 10-20 mins and you are done for a while. You can survive without using your phone for 10-30 minutes in a day, maybe more. I think you have a problem. Not the charging or phone. \n\nWe got charging in cars, we got wireless chargers for desks. If I got my laptop with me I can plug it in there. \u00a0",

However, I do worry that they may be starting to overreach with lawmakers mandating things that may not be feasible. \n\nIn this example, if a user replaces their own battery and does not reassemble the device in a way that creates a sufficient seal against water ingress (which is highly likely given the demand to not require specialist tools, and knowing the average person) then we will inevitably see a large number of devices being damaged by simple water exposure that would have otherwise been no risk. Apart from the fact that this may lead to unnecessary e-waste, I wonder how the EU will rule where liability of the water damage lies in such a circumstance. A sensible approach would suggest it\u2019s on the consumer who performed the faulty reassembly (and I say this as an extremely pro-consumer person) but, judging by the EU\u2019s actions thus far, I daresay they\u2019ll be pinning it on the manufacturers which is rather stupid and demonstrates a lack of understanding of how things work. \n\nMany modern devices more closely resemble a mechanical watch than a combustion car. Intricate and delicate parts are inextricably linked to the function of the device, and come with cons. Curiously, we don\u2019t see the EU mandating the same protections for said automatic watch mechanisms (or similar devices), though.",
