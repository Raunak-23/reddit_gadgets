Programs like Blender or video editors are very memory intensive. So are AI programs.\n\nBut more to the point, it's about the mismatch. For the past 7 years, memory has been the factor that ages Nvidia cards the most. For example, my 3070 8GB is powerful enough for decent 1440p gaming, but 8GB of memory is so small that I can't really turn on most ray tracing features without getting a memory bottleneck (unless I lower texture and show resolution way down). \n\nNow that AMD finally fixed their encoders and made a decent upscaler, there's a good option besides Nvidia for the average user. It really highlights the weaknesses.",
