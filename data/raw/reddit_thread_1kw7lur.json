The subscription includes things like AI(?) and analysis, but there's no data to work with, it's just going to be making everything up.\n\nA vibrating toothbrush you can get for $20-100 and heads probably are recommended to be changed twice a year for $10-15/year and normal toothpaste $5-10/year.\n\nI assume you still should floss regardless of the method.",

                      "body": "For me it was a tool I 3d printed. I got tired of wrapping the floss around my middle fingers until they turned blue, so I printed two short rods with a transverse hole through the middle that i can thread the floss through. I give the floss two wraps around each rod and now it's held securely, like cheese wire. The grips sit in my palms and i can use my thumb and forefinger for the fine movements like getting that C curve around the teeth.\n\nNo more blue, numb fingertips, and my teeth are clean.\n\nETA: Uploaded it to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7050255 There's STL, STEP and a Plasticity save file if you want to make your own edits.",

This is not the right way, instead you're supposed to move the floss up and down along the side of the tooth. This is because the purpose of flossing is to mechanically disrupt the biofilm that grows between teeth, so you have to get that whole edge. If you just move the floss back and forth, you're only getting one point, not the whole edge.",

People just want the lazy and easy way out instead of learning how to do something properly.\n\nLearning how to use a toothbrush is genuinely not a difficult thing but it's hard to build the inertia to actually change something you've been doing the same way for a decade or maybe even several decades.  A few months ago I took a look at some dentist's videos on how to use an electric toothbrush properly and no lie, my teeth look a lot better and feel cleaner now that I know how to angle the brush head properly to get at the gum line and between teeth.  And of course I am flossing regularly as well so that helps too.",
