It doesn't matter how much wattage is being passed through or how much safety there is, ie, passing through 150 watts through a wire that can handle 300 watts, if the connection is loose and therefore a short, the cable can still melt.\n\nSplitting the load between two 600W cables will not prevent a cable from melting.\n\nAnd you are forgetting that the 12 pin standard has been updated that it is much more difficult not to plug it in properly, the sense pins act like an additional safety net and the device won't draw power if the sense pins aren't detected. Part of the new standard is changing the length of the sense pins, that it is very difficult to have a loose connection and have the sense pins connected. 6 pins and 8 pins connectors don't have that safety net and never did.",

Most users aren't going to know which breaker runs to which outlet to split the load, if they even can split it. Any 20 amp circuits a home may have are almost always relegated to kitchens for appliances. I half expect Jensen to come out on stage and talk about how the 60 series will need a dedicated 240 line. \n\nNVIDIA is skipping the efficiency round that would normally come after a generation that significantly increases power draw, almost certainly because they are too focused on AI and took shortcuts on the GPUs. If nothing else, it swings the door wide open for AMD. Let's hope they don't trip on their own shoelaces trying to get through it like usual. NVIDIA needs a serious competitor and could use a generation where they get punched in the mouth and aren't on top.",
