My car had an adaptive cruise radar where the front plate would go, and it's an entire front fascia swap for front plate compatibility, around $3500 in 2005 money. I half jokingly told a cop as he's writing a ticket that he needs to write 45 more of those to make me even think about paying for the front plate fix.",

Every year, every federal agency is audited by 3rd party independent auditors as required by law.  \n\nEach agency posts their results on their website as required for transparency sake.  \n\nEvery year they post their Financial report which includes their report for how they executed the previous year, and their budget for the upcoming year.  \n\nOn top of that, any dollar that leaves the public coffers is required to be publicly disclosed provided it is not a no kidding secret program.   \n\nFinally, you have GAO, the Legislative branch watchdog that reviews each agency and provides their own independent reports.  \n\nIt is not uncommon to see findings of poor controls or poor accounting procedures of government programs, but that does not equal fraud.  Many times it is administrative issues.  Regardless getting a clean opinion on your audits is important.....and if there are issues those are also published annually.  \n\nThe idea that there isn't transparency in how the government spends money is pure BS.  Those that do not wish to be spoon fed by Fox News or conspiracy theorists on Twitter can easily find this information.   It would be great if more people read and came up with informed opinions.",

The way a cloud provider uses it; probably.\n\nThink about what percentage of the time your desktop is making maximum usage of its hardware. For most people, that's going to be almost none of the time. For a cloud provider, they are trying to squeeze every bit of value out of their hardware. That tends to mean that the average utilization is very high. The reality is that silicon is less a question of \"wearing out\" than it is of \"the weakest piece fails\". Heavy utilization does seems to be correlated with error rate (at least based on [this decade-old paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf) which is the best source that I'm aware of for large-scale ram analysis).\n\nAlso, that paper notes that older dimms seem to have higher error rates which implies that _something_ is happening.",

It's literally Peter Thiel's whole deal, why he wanted PayPal (replace the US dollar with a currency \"powered by individuals\"), but of course he and other tech bros making this happen already have so much of the share. \n\nIt's an attempt to throw the game board and replace the pieces in a more favorable way. That's all.",

If you bought an ounce of gold in the '20s for $35 and sold it now for $2500, did it produce value? No, it produced nothing. You gained money because an asset increased in perceived value, not because anything was produced. An ounce of gold doesn't give birth to little ouncelets. Dollars tend to decrease in value slightly over time, because the population increases, the economy grows in size, and more dollars are introduced into circulation to ensure a money supply. If you choke the money supply by restricting it, it shrinks the economy and makes most people poorer. Bitcoin and other crypto are intangible and backed by nothing. How much are those Hawk Tuah coins worth right now? How are those TRUMP and MELANIA investors doing?",

The one that gets trotted out like a show pony every time someone needs a straw to grasp at is remittances - again, because crypto makes it easier to avoid government scrutiny if thats needed.",

It's not.  You guys specifically built it up as an investment vehicle and not an actual viable currency.",

I pointed out that in some situations, FIAT is equally as difficult to utilize. You said that to use crypto, I have to first turn it into FIAT, then use the FIAT to pay. I pointed out that to use FIAT, there are situations where you have to first translate it into another form of FIAT, the same way crypto would need translated into a form of FIAT. The situations are identical, you are ignoring that rather than admitting 'yes, there are situations where FIAT has gaps'. Ever want to pay your friend but don't have cash? Now you're using a transaction service. You understand that you could just as easily use crypto in that situation right? It's the exact same situation as if you're at a business and they only/don't take cash. Sure you can turn around and go to another business. Same as if a business only accepted crypto. Just because you can't grasp that the difficulties of using crypto are identical to the difficulties with using FIAT in those situations does not mean they do not exist. I've personally be in a situation where I HAD to have cash and didn't, so I couldn't buy something. I've also been in a situation where I HAD to have card and didn't, so I couldn't buy something. You might not have ever experienced those situations, but to deny their existence does not mean they don't exist. FIAT has gaps, as does all methods of transacting business. Saying crypto isn't a viable form of currency because it has situations where its use can be a hurdle is the same as saying FIAT isn't a viable form of currency because it has situations where its use can be a hurdle. \n\n  \nI don't know who you're saying as 'you guys', but bitcoin has heavily been pushed as a currency more than a store of value. What's the most famous news story about bitcoin that immediately comes to mind? For most people that's going to be the news story of someone buying a pizza with bitcoin, or people buying drugs with bitcoin. Both of those are examples of bitcoin being used as currency. The store of value has been a recent adaptation, mostly pushed by finance people in the last 5 or so years.",
