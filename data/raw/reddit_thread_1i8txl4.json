The doorbell circuit was very simple - you press a button and this closes a circuit which makes a hammer rise to hit a bell for the ding. Probably a little electromagnet or something. When you release the button the circuit is open again, the hammer falls and hits a second bell for the dong.\n\nOne day my doorbell dinged but didn\u2019t dong. I didn\u2019t notice it at the time. What had happened is that water damage had corroded the doorbell button so the circuit stayed closed. About an hour later, the doorbell caught fire because the thin metal wire coil for the electromagnet got hot enough to melt, contacted the plastic enclosure and went up in flames.\n\nThankfully, I was home at was able to pull the alarm off the wall and extinguish it before things got really bad. We were just left with scorch marks on a wall and a weird story.\n\nBut yeah, shitty electronics can cause fires even with low current and voltage if they\u2019re shitty enough.",

              "body": "Well in an over-amp fault there are smaller wires inside the mouse that'd go first, likely cutting the circuit after a brief flash/pop. The power wires in USB are 20-28AWG size which are rated for 3.5-1.5 amps, roughly. At 5v, a circuitboard trace can safely carry around 1amp. So, it's likely that the trace or a component will briefly burn/pop before the cable even heats up.   \n  \nFor example, check out [this vid](https://youtu.be/4N4iDKYiKcU?t=76) where some kids try to send way too much power through a USB mouse (at a way higher voltage too). It briefly flashes inside the mouse and goes dead. They end up cranking up the voltage, but it quickly becomes clear it's just the ends of the wire sparking to eachother inside the mouse.      \n  \nI'm still dubious, but someone noted this mouse was prone for accumulating dust inside (likely from the scroll wheel openings on top). If the mouse somehow encounters an overamperage fault and sparks, then in a million-to-one chance it could ignite some dust bunnies and start a small fire. \n\nAnother [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/comments/1i8txl4/comment/m8ywkje/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) noted that USB cables/devices are designed to tell the PC how much amperage the cables/devices can support. This can be done passively by adding resistors on certain data lines. So if by some fluke your mouse was demanding enough power to charge a lithium battery, or you were using some shoddy USB adapter/extension that requested high-amperage, then perhaps an over-amperage fault could occur?    \n   \nKinda reminds me of that rash of exploding knockoff iPhone USB wall chargers.",
