Early adopters of the card ran into issues if the connector wasn't seated properly and it is apparently hard to tell if it is or not. Or so I understand at least. \n\nI presume Nvidia and their board partners have re-engineered the power connector to make sure it is seated properly. I do believe this revision was already in place when the Super cards dropped. However, the 5090's power draw is even greater so I hope they double checked to make sure every T is striped and every I is dotted. \n\nThe hardest part of any engineering project is the end user. People are very good at doing something wrong in ways that you'd never see coming.",
