      "body": "I\u2019m a big fan of all this standardization and the EU actually regulating things. I still foresee tough times ahead though in the transition from USB-A to USB-C in most peripherals. \n\nPlenty of laptops these days (especially Macs) come with nothing but USB-C ports, but you still can\u2019t find a mouse that comes with a USB-C connector. Best you can get is a dongle and a USB-A connector, which while workable obviously isn\u2019t ideal. Same goes for keyboards, headphones, external drives, on and on. \n\nI would love it if I could ditch USB-A entirely, and not have to worry that I have the right combination of both on my PC and laptop. Hopefully someday soon",

Sure.\n\nFrom the perspective of ensuring that the hardware they buy doesn't require 30 different adapters or force them to be locked into specific models? Nope. \n\nUSB-C is present on everything from phones, to computers, to game consoles to cameras to the charging case on my bluetooth headphones.\n\nAnd because of the way the spec works, you can have a cable that has two Usb-C ends and it does not matter which way you plug in the cable, and which side you plug in the cable. Software can denote which device is the parent and which device is the child, so you could arguably do a file transfer from phone to phone without needing an OTG cable.\n\nPlus Thunderbolt and USB are built into the spec so newer versions of products can do things like use displayport support.\n\nOlder USB-C cables and plugins may work at a reduced capacity, but they'll still charge your phone or other devices, so you don't have to throw them away. On top of that a 60w charger is going to cover anything that uses USB-C charging, even if it doesn't need that much wattage.",

That has nothing to do with a standard when the standard has a protocol to deal with this.\n\nData transfer almost doesn't matter anymore. Wifi and 5G is plenty fast for most purposes and people prefer sending the data wirelessly anyway.\n\nOnce in a while I'll use a stick to boot Linux on a laptop. Most people won't even do that.\n\nNo doubt there are rare obscure problems. But that's irrelevant because it's not a relevant argument against having a standard. That only means a particular manufacturer needs to produce better devices and fix their mistakes.\n\nIf somebody sells me a shitty product that triggers my breaker when I plug in my coffee machine or whatever, I'm not going to complain about the standardized power plug. I'll complain about the shitty device manufacturer who did a shitty job implementing the standard.\n\nUSB-C is not only now coming into use on January 1st. It's been around for many years. Most recent devices already used it. It works. It's interoperable. We don't need a different charger for every single electronic device anymore. That's a good thing.\n\nApple is the only company who was a PITA about this. And Spoke just lives to be different. Sometimes to keep their garden walked off. Somebody just because it's on brand to be different.\n\nThey insisted for ages on single button mice to signal that their devices are so much easier. Which was complete bullshit. You still got the second button functionality (for context menus) by pressing a key. And a zillion Mac users ignored the stupid single-button mouse and simply bought an extra regular mouse with 2 buttons.\n\nThis was just Apple being Apple.\n\nAgain the differences between Lightning and USB-C are unimportant.\n\nYou can charge either way. You can transfer data either way. You can transfer data even faster with USB-C - but again that's not really important in practice as few people will use that feature and even less will notice the speed difference under most circumstances.\n\nHaving a matured universal standard for electronic devices is a good thing.\n\nAnd the regulation does not forbid future updates of the standard.",

So it was de facto mandatory, even though de jure it was voluntary.\n\nAnd it wasn't really that Apple forced EU to adopt USB C as a legal requirement, rather EU forced Apple to adopt USB C by making it a law. Apple didn't want USB C to be mandatory in their phones. EU forced Apple to do this.\n\nEU was already forcing the industry to agree on a standard, but with softer methods than law. Those softer methods resulted in micro USB becoming a charging plug standard in EU and contributed to USB C being developed as the successor standard.\n\nThe EU agreement for unofficial standard for micro USB is \"Memorandum of Understanding\" from 2009. It was basically an EU-initiated deal with the industry that the industry will have a standard and will develop new standards together so that EU will not need to legislate it. This was signed by  Apple, LG, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, Research in Motion (RIM), Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments.\n\nThe fact EU later legislated it is a demonstration on how micro USB was not simply voluntary, but that it was motivated by the threat of legal regulation. And as Apple voluntarily didn't comply with USB C, EU forced.\n\nSo the voluntarily was like \"you will voluntarily eat this food or I will force feed it to you\". It's a bit silly to say that you ate the food voluntarily then. You were forced to eat it yourself. And if you refuse to eat it, and you are force fed, it's not you who forced the other one to force feed you.",

To illustrate: The EU  had a non-mandated \"standard\" for Micro-USB starting in 2009. Just because USB-IF calls it a standard doesn\u2019t mean it was one. Apple ignored that and introduced the superior Lightning connector. In 2025, that wouldn't be possible because of this mandated standard.\n\n>So what? Does that make it less great than when it was the \"de facto\" standard? \n\nYes, because details matter. \"De facto\" means it was chosen based on merit. Micro-USB is a good example. It was a \"standard\" according to you, but it was ignored by Apple (who sells ~50% of all smartphones). \n\nA mandated standard kills that merit-based choice. If the EU had enforced this in 2009, Apple would\u2019ve had to switch to the inferior Micro-USB, only to swap again in 2015 when it became clear Micro-USB couldn\u2019t keep up. That\u2019s a ton of cables in landfills... Thankfully this EU directive/mandate wasn't around back then and we got the superior Lightning cable, which would still be around today\u2014if this mandate didn\u2019t exist\u2014and would eventually give way to wireless charging through organic innovation.",

They just didn't have the power to enforce it (they corrected for this in the 2022 directive). My point stands, if voices like yours and the EU won out in 2009, we would have been forced into MicroUSB just to realize 3-4 years down the road that the cable was inferior. More consumer confusion, more land fills being filled with junk. The 2022 EU Directive is more dangerous because it is mandated and will take years to change if a superior technology comes along. Why would you want that? Especially when USB-C became so widespread *without* idiotic EU mandates. \n\n>So superior that Apple never used it in a MacBook.\n\nNot sure what you're blabbing on about here. Are you saying MicroUSB could be used to power laptops? That was the only competition to Lighting at the time...",

They failed (Yay!)\n\nThe EU was mad they didn't get what they wanted and after 10+ years, finally strong-armed everyone to pass the exact same garbage mandate (Booo!)\n\nLittle Alfie Owens closes his eyes and ears and pretends that the intent/goal with both mandates is different (one bad! one good! bc USB-C so Shiny!!). What little Alfie's brain cells don't comprehend is that the EU tells everyone on record what the goal was with the first and second mandate and gasp.... they are the exact same! (Womp womp womp)\n\nAlfie gets teary eyed and upset when people point this fact out to him. He clenches his little wrist and says \"Not same! MicroUSB not Shiny, USB-C so shiny! Situation completely different grrr!!\"... What poor little Alfie doesn't understand is that there were other little Alfie's just like him back in 2009 who also cried and yelled \"ooh Apple evil! and bad! MicroUSB Shiny and good!! More better than Apple evil connector. OMG EU so GOOD!\" \n\nOur story doesn't have a happy ending because Poor little Alfie doesn't like to learn from people more intelligent/informed than him. He resorts to looking stupid on websites like Reddit. Poor little Alfie has a head injury and can't compare events in the past to the present like any logical good boy should.  (oh no! so sad!)\n\nThe end",

They failed (Yay!)\nThe EU was mad they didn't get what they wanted and after 10+ years, finally strong-armed everyone to pass the exact same garbage mandate (Booo!)\nLittle Alfie Owens closes his eyes and ears and pretends that the intent/goal with both mandates is different (one bad! one good! bc USB-C so Shiny!!). What little Alfie's brain cells don't comprehend is that the EU tells everyone on record what the goal was with the first and second mandate and gasp.... they are the exact same! (Womp womp womp)\nAlfie gets teary eyed and upset when people point this fact out to him. He clenches his little wrist and says \"Not same! MicroUSB not Shiny, USB-C so shiny! Situation completely different grrr!!\"... What poor little Alfie doesn't understand is that there were other little Alfie's just like him back in 2009 who also cried and yelled \"ooh Apple evil! and bad! MicroUSB Shiny and good!! More better than Apple evil connector. OMG EU so GOOD!\"\nOur story doesn't have a happy ending because Poor little Alfie doesn't like to learn from people more intelligent/informed than him. He resorts to looking stupid on websites like Reddit. Poor little Alfie has a head injury and can't compare events in the past to the present like any logical good boy should. (oh no! so sad!)\nThe end",

Looks like you're actually a moderator of a subreddit. I screenshotted your childlike hissy fit on this comment thread and sent to the lead moderator. Probably not relevant but took 2 seconds of effort and should be a good laugh for all involved. \n\n2. I'm realizing that your sad lonely brain thinks that \"getting the last word\" is some sort of \"win\", even if the last word is some keyboard warrior all caps rant. By the time you read this you're blocked and I'm signed into my real account. \n\nEnjoy your lonely trolling little Alfie.",

You're (correctly) pointing out that we don't have that problem today and it happened without government intervention. \n\nI would encourage you to own your view on this and get it out on the table. Tell me with a straight face something along the lines of: \"Yes I trust EU Government bureaucrats to pick and choose tech standards and shut down any tech company that attempts to create something different or better\". Then, we can just agree to disagree.",

I think they would have preferred to switch to USB-C years ago but they made a promise at an investors meeting because of the switch from 30-pin to lightning and if they had switched the iPhone earlier they would have been sued. The EU even gave them an extension on complying because it was a reasonable position. But they had already changed iPads to USB-C well before that. They even had a MacBook that was charged by USB-C.",

Obviously, I would still need two cables to charge two devices at the same time, but if I don\u2019t want to charge both devices at the same time, then I would only need one cable. And I would only need one type of cable (USB-C, the universal standard) if that was the case, instead of having two cables of different types even when I don\u2019t want to charge both devices at the same time. Is all this wall of texts needlessly complicated? Yes it is, and I\u2019m sorry lol. Do I still need two or more USB-C cables in my life? Yes, I probably do, just for convenience. Can I get away with just one though, for all of my devices, for whatever reasons? Yes, yes I also can get away with just one USB-C cable for all my devices if I want to (idk, maybe I got robbed or something, or the rats have taken over my apartment and chewed all the damn cables except for one). \n\nIt would be easier to not use Apple devices when they\u2019re not yet using them. Once they\u2019re already in the Apple ecosystem though, it\u2019s harder to get out. Case in point, if they want to not use iPhones anymore and use USB-C phones instead, now they have to also ditch all your old Lightning cables and buy new USB-C cables for their new USB-C phone. \n\nYeah, because Apple\u2019s ecosystem is more than just the cables. The point to understand here, is how we are now taking down Apple\u2019s control down and letting people have more freedom to choose what they want to use, instead of the choice being dictated by only a few things that is needlessly held down by these tech giants, for example, the freaking damn cables lol.",

And they do not limit the use of USB. It is very cheaply affordable for any company to use. They do not limit the use to just the consortium members.\n\nA cartel would be companies working together in secret to dominate the market and preventing other companies from using the same thing.\n\n>>electrical sockets and voltages being set in legal standards is not a cartel by electricity providers and tech companies.

It is dependent on the country how they legislate it, but for example my native Finland has [this law](https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/1993/19931694) which mandates electrical appliances to follow the International Electrotechnical Commission standards.\n\nIt's sort of like SI units.

EU still has phones with wireless charging.\n\n>For example, if you do have both ports on a phone, how do you handle the very real issue of a user trying to plug two power inlets simultaneously?\n\nI do not understand why would you have to plug both simultaneously? If you have USB C and the Amazing New Plug, you are free to plug in just the new Amazing New Plug. But you need to have the option to use USB C too.\n\n>Had this law passed a decade ago you would having this discussion about micro USB... Which clearly was not enough.\n\nMicro USB was the previous phone charger plug mandated by EU. It was not set in law, and it did not prevent USB C to be developed.

A company with that aim already would need to have considerable financial backing, and 3 500 dollars is a tiny amount. It's the cost of a few business trips.

The device can simply recognize what power sources are plugged to it and choose which one to use. Like phones already can recognize with USB C what power source it is plugged to.\n\n>Yes, microUSB was not enshrined because it was replaced by COMPETITION.\n\nNo, it was replaced by coordinated agreement and cooperation by the industry, pressured by EU. USB C wasn't a competitor to micro USB as a charging port. It was the industry agreed successor to micro USB as a charging port.\n\nThe EU agreement for unofficial standard for micro USB \"Memorandum of Understanding\" from 2009 says this:\n\n>*3.4 The Signatories note that this MoU should not preclude innovation in the Mobile Phone and EPS markets, for example in relation to battery and charging technologies, new interfaces, multi-modal charging capabilities and improved environmental or charging performance. Therefore a review process is necessary to adapt this MoU and to address the impact of such changes on the related specifications and standards.* ***Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU, unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical, economic, social or environmental perspective.***\n\nThis was signed by  Apple, LG, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Qualcomm, Research in Motion (RIM), Samsung, Sony Ericsson and Texas Instruments.\n\nSo the 2009 agreement with EU already laid the groundwork for that the industry will develop a successor which would still be a common charger plug. That's why they developed USB C as a charger plug successor to micro USB. EU mandated it.\n\nThe industry reviewed their situation and updated their stance in 2013 \"Letter of Intent\" to EU which stated:\n\n>*The Signatories hereby declare their intention to: Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones, while considering:* \n>\n>*-The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies.*\n>\n>*-The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary*\n>\n>*-That minimum geographical area should be the European Union, but aiming towards a global reach.*\n\nSo, mirco USB was not replaced by competition in EU. It was replaced by EU mandated cooperation by the industry. They developed USB C to meet these requirements, so the EU mandated standards development affected the development of USB C.\n\n>Sure the legislation allows room for development... except the only companies that will have that room for development will be... the ones ruling over the fucking consortium.\n\nAgain, every manufacturer is free to have another charger plug in addition to USB C.\n\nAnd be honest: how much room for innovation do you think there is left for charger plugs? \n\nUSB C can provide 240 watts and that's enough to fully charge a smartphone in less than 10 minutes. If some charger plug is faster than this, is it really the crucial factor for a major part of consumers? Like instead of phone memory, storage, OS, cameras? Or with laptops their memory, storage, graphics card, size? Or with bluetooth speakers their sound quality, portability and such?\n\nDo you remember how it was in EU before 2009? There was like 30 different charger plugs, and no one chose the phone based on what charger plug they had. The diversity in charger plugs was only a nuisance for the consumers.\n\n\"Hey does anyone have a Nokia charger?\" \"Sorry, I only have the Ericsson wide charger\" \"hmm, I have Samsung charger\" \"Hey I have a Nokia charger, but it's the small plug\" \"Oh that won't do, I have the large Nokia plug\".\n\nThe \"competition\" was just awful for consumers. EU had to step in and force companies to agree on a standard, and thus micro USB and its successor, USB C.",

All this is also more costly, because you have to design the product so that it is in line with legally required safety standards. You also need to hire someone to manage the finance and marketing of your product. And then you have to pay for the manufacture and logistic distribution of the phone. You have to make deals with different sales companies, travel around the world.\n\nSo you are saying the USB C cost for device manufacturers is a problem for homeless people, people who have to prostitute themselves, who have to steal or sell drugs, who have to worry day to day how they will feed themselves and their children, or can they afford the rent. \n\nYou are saying these people, **the poorest, the homeless, the ones prostituting and stealing and selling drugs, the ones worrying how to pay their rent and feed their children** can afford to set up a company, hire engineers and coders to design the software and hardware so that it is in line with legally required safety standards? You are saying they can afford to hire hire someone to manage the finance and marketing of their product? And then you say they can afford to pay for the manufacture and logistic distribution of the product? They afford to make deals with different sales companies, travel around the world, but 3 500 dollars is too much for them?\n\nDo you have any idea what the priorities of the poorest people are and what kind of resources they have to run a company producing radio frequency devices?\n\n>>Yes, and you asked where it is legislated.

The difference is that you have to pay to have the USB certification and logo. And the cost is pretty much just a fee to test that your product is in compliance with USB standard.\n\nLike you cannot sell a product with USB logo, if no one has checked that your product actually works like USB.\n\nIn addition, any manufacturer is free to join USB implementers forum for 5000 dollars.\n\n>USB C came around because Apple refused to cheaply sell their lightning connectors, and EVENTUALLY USB C showed up. And the USB C that you have right now is not even the same USB C you had previously. Every time USB is beaten, they have to come up with a new standard. Now they cannot be beat, because they're the only players.\n\nUSB C is partially based on Apple tech. Apple was part of developing USB C. And USB C is just the plug. It's not the protocol that controls the plug. The EU standard concerns the physical plug being used for charging. It does not concern about the protocol of data transfer with USB C.\n\nAnd no, USB C has not been beaten \"every time\" in the EU since after micro USB by far the most common and widely used charging plug has been USB C. Apple was the only other, and it was used only by Apple products. \n\n>That's the same as me saying \"Yea, all combustion vehicles can still exist, as long as they can still be charged with electrical ports\". \n\nNo, it's not, since the devices we are talking all use electricity. We don't have mobile phones running on combustion engines.\n\nSo it's the same as saying \"yea, all EV cars must have this charging port, but they can have additional charging ports too\". Or \"All gasoline cars must have this kind of gas tank opening to facilitate the common gas nozzle, but they can have other kind of gas tanks openings too\".\n\n>I do, and companies voluntarily adopted better technologies, as demand grew for them.\n\nIn the EU, no. EU in essence forced the companies to agree on a single charging port standard for phones. Thus micro USB became the charging port standard in EU.\n\n>Ah yes, people sure do complain that we can charge phones in 15 minutes and transferring files through cables doesn't take 3 hours.\n\nThe current charging capabilities of USB C have not come through competition, but because of EU mandated cooperation.\n\nAs I quoted, the 2009 Memorandum of Understanding said this:\n\n>**Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU, unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical, economic, social or environmental perspective.**\n\nAnd the 2013 Letter of Intent to EU stated this:\n\n>**The Signatories hereby declare their intention to: Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones, while considering:\n>\n>-**The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies.**\n>\n>-**The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary**\n>\n>-**That minimum geographical area should be the European Union, but aiming towards a global reach.**\n\nSo the industry specifically said they aim to develop a new charging plug standard for EU in a way that EU would not need to legislate it. They developed USB C. But Apple refused to comply, so EU made it a law. The current capabilities of USB C is not a result of free competition. It's the result of cooperation by the industry, cooperation which EU mandated.\n\nAlso, EU doesn't legislate the data transfer capabilities of USB C so those are irrelevant.",

I'm talking about the, let's say, engineer that is experimenting on his living room and is trying to start up a company, after sinking in thousands of euros in legal fees, setting up the company, etc. Then, have the additional artificial hurdle.\n\n> In addition, any manufacturer is free to join USB implementers forum for 5000 dollars.\n\nWhich is funny because it's a conglomerate created by companies. That fee can raise, and the conglomerate will do things in behalf of the constituents, which may go against your own companies' beliefs\n\n>  And the cost is pretty much just a fee to test that your product is in compliance with USB standard.\n\nWhich you do need to be able to sell in the EU\n\n> The EU standard concerns the physical plug being used for charging. It does not concern about the protocol of data transfer with USB C.\n\nYou do understand that electronics are not magic right? There are actual physical connections within the plug. \n\n> No, it's not, since the devices we are talking all use electricity. We don't have mobile phones running on combustion engines.\n\nTechnically you do, but the energy is accumulated in batteries, but that's besides the point. The point is, a new device may not be viable if it has to accommodate USB-C and a new plug that is superior to USB-C. It can be both physically impossible, legally prohibitive and/or economically impractical. Cars are a good example of the concerns of getting two different energy stores (battery & gas tanks) to coexist, the solution is basically to keep the systems separated. However, if we're talking about a fully electrical circuit then you do tack on a huge problem if you have two power sources. PCB are an interesting example, have you considered what happens if you connect a secondary power supply to the same source?  That is a huge problem that what you're suggesting does create.\n\n> No, it's not, since the devices we are talking all use electricity. We don't have mobile phones running on combustion engines.\n\nThe energy source is completely immaterial, the necessity of having the plug, thus the physical ability for it to be powered through that plug IS a problem.\n\n> The current charging capabilities of USB C have not come through competition, but because of EU mandated cooperation.\n\nQuite literally the USB Consortium wanted to use 2.0 as that universal plug, but the plan ended up in the bin because Apple released the Lightning Connector which surpassed anything USB had. Currently the lightning connector is only behind USB C because it's still ensuring compatibility with USB 2.0\n\n> So the industry specifically said they aim\n\nThe whole issue is summed up in this sentence. The fact you, and the EU Comission say \"the industry\" flat out pressuposes that we _have_ to see the existing companies as untouchable and pushing naysayers out of competing, because for the good of the industry - the already existing large companies - things need to be created with the approval of the industry.",

If I get a second monitor, I can also use the same port for another monitor without having to shop around for another docking station. I could even add Ethernet connectivity.\n\nI can see how it could be frustrating not being able to plug in any cable and it do what you want, but that is not a new problem. USB A has USB cables that are only capable of charging, USB2 cables where some can only transfer data as slow as 30 Mbps, and then USB3.2 cables with transfer rates of 20 Gbps despite having the same connector. HDMI cables can be HDMI 1.4 and support 4k@24hz, but it could also be HDMI 2.1 and support 4k@120hz despite having the same connector.\n\nYou will not catch me complaining that now I can buy a single cable capable of: 240w power delivery, 120 Gbps data transfer, outputting to three 4k@144hz monitors simultaneously, and serving as my Ethernet connectivity to boot. It is an enormous step up for me as a user to only carry around a single cable with a few adapters for the most part. I plug my laptop into one cable and am connected to everything at my work station.\n\nYou just have buy good quality cables, which has always been the case, but now you have more options. It is not the case that you\u2019re going to have to shops around for display specific USB C cables, or Ethernet specific USB C cables. You only need one from the USB standards that meets your needs. USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 will handle pretty much everything. Just follow the standards and buy from reputable brands. Cable Matters has these USB3.2 gen 2 type C cables which are phenomenal. Automod deleted my comment earlier for including a link, but they are part number 201045 if you\u2019re interested. I use them for everything except where I require a thunderbolt cable. If I need a thunderbolt cable, I generally get it included with whatever hardware I bought. Same with USB4 devices. OWC docks include a thunderbolt cable, and so do their other thunderbolt accessories that I\u2019ve purchased. These days, with a good USB4 cable, you may not even need thunderbolt for much going forward.",

I remember as a teen my family each had a laptop, 3 out of 4 were from the same manufacturer, and NONE of them could use the same charger. Now, every laptop at my house, my parent's house, and my employer's business can charge from the same cable. If I forget my laptop charger at work, I grab my steam Deck cord, and I can charge either device in my car with a 12v phone port thing that was less than the cost of a normal 120v barrel jack adapter. If I desperately need to transfer data from one device to another, I haven't personally had the bad lick of getting a usb-c cable that can't carry data at all. \n\nA lot of people talk about getting rid of micro and lightning as the primary benefit, but that's the cherry on top of a gourmet cake. \n\nSure, USB-C isn't literally perfect. Yes, the naming convention is as clear as dirt cheap meth. No, not every single usb-c cord is capable of charging my laptops, or high-speed video, or being used for an egpu or heavy data transfer, for that 0.1% of us nerds who care. But no barrel jack even try. No other port has ever served this many purposes in this many entire categories of devices. \n\nCheap manufacturers still make scammy garbage and people don't always recognize it - but they did the same thing with old proprietary connectors. To say we solved nothing is ludicrous.",

Cooperation. The EU law clearly states that the industry can develop new better technologies, but they must agree on the new standard.\n\nAnd ironically that's partially what happened. The USB C as such a developed plug is affected by EU pressure. Before USB C, the unofficial standard for phone plugs was micro USB.\n\nIn 2009, EU pressured phone industry to agree on a phone charging plug standard, like \"agree on a standard or we will make a law about it\". The industry agreed on micro USB since it was handy to combine a common USB data transfer cable with charging. \n\nEU also pressured companies to develop the next charging standard together, **so the industry developed USB C as the next charging standard**, and as it is also a data cable, it would replace other USB ports. Like if every phone is going to have the same charging plug any way, so why not make it USB C which can also double as a data transfer cable?\n\nApple refused to comply with EU so EU triggered their threat and set the standard in law so that Apple has to have USB C.\n\nBut the EU pressure to agree on a standard already 16 years ago did not prevent USB C from being introduced. In the opposite, it *contributed* to development of USB C.",

It\u2019s all over the place and gives too much power to the cable.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a 120W power brick and your phone can draw a maximum of 100W. How many W does you phone get? Dunno, depends on the cable. It can be 100W, it could be 20W. The cable decides, as they tell the devices how much power to supply/draw.\n\nThat 20W cable is about as useless as your old micro usb. But it\u2019s harder to tell as it is rarely written on the cable itself.\n\nAnother thing: does usb c support usb extension cables (to a maximum length) like usb a does?\u00a0\n\nThe answer, officially, is no. But you can buy 10$ usb c extension off of amazon. Those are fire hazards.\n\nSay you have a cable that advertise it can draw/supply 240W. You plug in an extension that can handle 50W per its specs. The devices on each end still see they can draw/supply 240W since the extension just carries the signal of the cable itself. Thus overloading the copper in the extension. (If you do not believe me, test it yourself with an usb tester).\n\nThen, finally, add to this that on the data side not every cables are the same (some can transfer videos, other not, some are usb 2,3 or 3.1, etc) and you end up with a \u00ab standard \u00bb that has no teeth\u2019s and 5 cables that are visually identical but support different features.\n\nUSB C should have been a set power (say 100 or 240W) and pinout for every cable, then let the devices handle the negociation. And when that pinout and power are not enough anymore in 10 years, release a usb d that is not compatible.\n\nThe eu rule will boost that issue, where we will see 500W usb c before usb d as technologies evolve, because it kills anyone desire to develop a new standard.",

If you buy them then that risk is on you.\n\nStandards-compliant extension cables could be made, but they would have to implement retimers and PD-passthrough to downgrade the power negotiation downstream to compensate for losses.\n\nNobody is making you buy 60W cables - and you can usually tell them anyway because they are thinner. 100W cables have been deprecated and no new 100W cables will be certified. Just buy the 240W cables which even with USB4 speeds are not very expensive. Most USB4 cables certified for 40Gb/s actually work with the new USB4 80Gb/s, too.\n\nYou don't want to break backwards compatibility just because there is something new. Charging my 140W Macbook off a 20W phone charger is useful - it is enough to keep it charged whilst doing light tasks, or trickle charge it overnight. If they made another port just because now >100W was allowed, then I would have just gotten sick of it all.\n\nThe superset rule says that a charger with a higher wattage will charge all devices with a lower wattage.\n\nTL;DR you can't blame them for lack of research when you buy things.",

In some stations you get power +2 external monitors, in others you get power + 1 external monitor and others power and zero external monitors. Why? Dear lord knows why, it's the same equipment. The \"port\" itself is probably fine, but the underlying technologies that make it work, very much isn't.\n\nEdit: it goes without saying that the confusing naming schele and the inability to tell what a cable is capable of by simply looking at it makes everything even worse.",

The directive says:\n\n>*It is also necessary to reflect future amendments to labelling requirements, such as for charging devices or cables, or other technological progress.* ***The power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should therefore be delegated to the Commission*** *in respect of amending categories or classes of radio equipment and the specifications relating to the charging interfaces and charging communication protocols for each of them and amending the information requirements regarding the charging interfaces and charging communication protocols.*\n\nIn other words, EU parliament and EU Council delegated the power to update the standard to Commission, so there's no need for legislative process to update the standard.",

We have previous \"industry standard\" data cables like USB A which is still very common after like 30 years.\n\nThe EU agreement for unnofficial standard for micro USB \"Memorandum of Understanding\" from 2009 says this:\n\n*3.4 The Signatories note that this MoU should not preclude innovation in the Mobile Phone and EPS markets, for example in relation to battery and charging technologies, new interfaces, multi-modal charging capabilities and improved environmental or charging performance. Therefore a review process is necessary to adapt this MoU and to address the impact of such changes on the related specifications and standards. Industry should continue to provide a common charging interface as defined by this MoU, unless such technology innovations cause such to be not viable from a technical, economic, social or environmental perspective.*\n\nThe industry reviewed their situation and updated their stance in 2013 \"Letter of Intent\" to EU which stated:\n\n*The Signatories hereby declare their intention to: Work towards the harmonisation of a charging capability for future generations of mobile phones, while considering:* \n- *The power needs for future generations of mobile devices and their associated charging technologies.*\n- *The transition from the existing European standards for mobile phone chargers to potentially new European standards developed by Standards Development Organisations should make specific EU regulation unnecessary*\n- *That minimum geographical area should be the European Union, but aiming towards a global reach.*\n\nThey developed USB C to meet these requirements, so the EU mandated standards development affected the development of USB C.\n\n>Is the EU\u2019s adoption of standards dependent on what the rest of the world does, in that case?\n\nIIRC, yes. In the end, what EU sets in law is agreed by the industry, not solely dictated by EU. If the industry decides that in a few years they globally move to USB X because it is better, then there is a mechanism in EU law to update this to EU law. In a sense, USB C was also partially like this. USB C wasn't developed as a standard because EU said it specifically should be the next standard. It was developed because the industry itself decided it should be the next standard in EU, and EU then took this industry proposed standard and set it into law.\n\n>Or is it that go forward manufacturers will take any new standard (outside of the mandated USB-c) to the committee before implementing them, to see if the EU would consider adopting that instead and consider it \u2018better?\n\nI believe the EU does not consider standards from individual manufacturers, but the industry as a whole. A single company cannot say their and only their plug will be the new standard. Rather the mechanism is that the standard needs to be suggested by large representation of the industry. The EU approach in this is that better standards are developed when companies are forced to cooperate instead of competing with each other.\n\n>Or would they have to do a \u2018side by side\u2019 connector for a while on their devices to see if it caught on beyond USB-c?\n\nYes, a single manufacturer would need to have a \"side by side\" solution. This is currently the situation with wireless charging. While many phones already have wireless charging, they are also required to have USB C. The USB C standard does not prevent seeing how wireless charging catches up.",

A universal connector that is used by numerous companies meaning it can be interchanged with many devices,,, this has the added effect of being able to be manufactured cheaper, as 1 company doesn't have a stranglehold on the market and standardisation allows for more 3rd party companies to produce cables.\n\nI seriously don't understand why Apple fans don't want a better, cheaper option....  Oh wait... They're Apple fans.\nThey believe that paying more for inferior products is better.",
