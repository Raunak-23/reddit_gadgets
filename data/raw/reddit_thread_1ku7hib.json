They want an era of isolationism for the U.S. because they think this country can prosper with the right access to raw materials and straight labor. It\u2019s why they are working on shutting down access to proper education, having Trump go on and on about acquiring Canada and Greenland which is partly for resources and accessibility but also as a buffer zone to the rest of the world. They have been convinced into thinking AI is figure out all the problems but Elon Musk and Peter Thiel/Palantir. Palantir who is now the biggest defense contractor for the CIA/NSA based on publicly available data on DOD contracts. Palantir for years has been a major defense contractor for the UK and recently got done shifting through all the data over at NHS England which Kier announced will be shutdown. Palantir which has contracts with Norway giving them full access to all the data coming out of their government and public surveillance programs. Palantir who works very closely with the IDF on their war in Gaza.",
