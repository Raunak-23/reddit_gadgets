My personal opinion is that's a bit of a waste of time since they're merging iOS and MacOS so rapidly to make a single more unified design, but it's likely the next immediate progression of hackintosh. It may also look into supporting older arm macs with new software updates... But none have fallen off support yet. In a couple more years I'm sure that'll kick off.\u00a0",

It's basically Ampere Altra or nothing, and that still requires a dGPU.",

I could have a folder open with files of the type I wanted to find \\*right there\\* and I'd enter (for example) JPG or \\*.jpg or part of the file's name and it'd claim nothing found.\n\nAfter I managed to track down everything on the horribly messy computer (the owner had so much stuff on the desktop it ran out of space for icons so things were virtually stacked up like a real desk overflowing with papers and other things) and copied to a flash drive, I got Big Sur installed.\n\nIts self-searching capability was even worse than High Sierra! I had to resort to a 3rd party file manager, the first one I tried had no capability of auto-renaming conflicting file names, not did it have a MOVE capability. I was wanting to find all files of a specific type, move them to a new folder, skipping any with the same name. Then I'd make another folder and try copying what was left to that folder, repeating until all the files were moved.\n\nNope! Can't do that. Nor could the second 3rd party file manager I tried, but that one had a \\*keep both\\* option where it would append a number in brackets to the names.\n\nWhat I'm surprised at is that nobody has ever just gone and created an exact functional copy of any version of Windows Explorer for Mac. \n\nI've used Macs since System 7 and have always hated the flat out stupid things Apple has done with the user interface all along the way with every System and OS version. It takes extra time, extra clicks, just \\*more work\\* to get anything done VS how Windows works. Since Windows 95's introduction of the Start Menu it takes \\*two mouse clicks\\* to launch anything that has a shortcut in the menu.

I don't think they will go out of their way to maintain a second version for a second, old platform.\n\nBottom line, the last existing versions of software for Intel will keep working, of course... as long as Apple doesn't make a breaking change. If that happens I think their makers will take this opportunity to abandon them.",

                      "body": "There's two reasons why Apple is getting much less crap for this than Microsoft.\n\n* One is that there's an understandable technical basis for why it's happening. ARM chips and x86 chips are fundamentally incompatible, so it makes sense for technical users that it could be a spec cutoff. The Windows 11 cutoff is easy to deride, because it's so obviously arbitrary, and based entirely on whether the processor was released before or after summer 2017 - a fact that should be completely obvious since Intel released a laptop chip at 45W early that year (which isn't supported), and then rereleased the exact same chip in the fall with the only difference being that it was now underclocked to 15W (which is supported).\n\n* Another is also that Apple made a new computer that's so disruptively better that it has no trouble justifying why you should do a potentially premature upgrade, solely based on the merits on the new hardware, and has likely already convinced much of the userbase to make that switch. That's very unusual - it's really the first year-over-year processor upgrade since the 90's that can lay claim to \"once you see how much better the new one is at everyday usage, the old thing will literally seem unusable by comparison, and you will just want to throw it in the trash\"-status, and that's probably not something we'll see again anytime soon.",

I didn't suggest that you switch DAWs, nor would I. \n\nI told you what I use for my music production setup.\n\n>CLAP/VST\n\nThere are a handful of CLAP plugins, but that's not the point. The point is that some native Linux plugins exist. U-He releases many of their plugins as Linux native, as does Modartt. I have some of them, and like them, and think they're pretty good.\n\nAnd you're absolutely right about plugin download/licensing managers. I've had the same problem with Native Instruments and IK Multimedia's managers via WINE. It's undoubtedly a pain in the ass... With that said, there are workarounds. I have a working Kontakt and Sampletank, as well as GuitarRig, Amplitube, and MODO Bass/Drums, but it was certainly a hassle to get everything downloaded.\n\nFWIW, the next version of WINE seems to have fixed the issue with downloading from NI and IK launchers, but that version isn't ready for prime time yet either, so I'm still on the last one. \n\nNone of this is ideal or as hassle free as just installing plugins without issues on a supported OS of course, so I can totally understand not wanting to deal with these kinds of rough edges.\n\n>I couldn't even activate my DAW of choice on linux because it wouldn't connect to the network and I couldn't load the license file because it wouldn't let me move anything from linux filesystem to windows based one in wine/whatever. \n\nWell, you got me there. I've never had that problem because I use Bitwig, which is native. \n\nI've successfully activated an older version of Ableton Live in the past, but I don't really use that anymore so I can't say whether something has changed or not.\n\n>Couldn't get latency even close to the numbers and stability I get on windows with ASIO.\n\nI strongly disagree with this. \n\nI was just recording guitar last night at 64 sample buffer @ 48k samplerate. I can't do the math on the latency of that off the top of my head, but it's very close to real time. Certainly close enough that I personally find it manageable and not too disctracting. \n\nMy CPU (Ryzen 7900) gets a bit unhappy with that after a while. I probably should have got an x3d...\n\nIt's possible that because your DAW was running through WINE you need to do some other WINE voodoo in order to get it to play well with pipewire. Or at least configure pipewire differently in some way. Configuring pipewire does require you to edit a text config file while i know some people aren't comfortable with.\n\nPersonally I think ASIO is a piece of shit. The latency is fine, but (at least the last time I checked) is doesn't support routing audio arbitrarily between programs, nor does it support multiple audio interfaces. \n\nI'll take pipewire any day. I get good lantency, endless routing, multiple interfaces, and I've never once had a pipewire crash.",

Too much stuff probably... I know \"professional\" musicians who do just fine in a dawless setup without a computer at all. I also know pros who do nothing but chiptunes in a tracker program like Deflemask and Furnace. There are a lot of different studio setups and workflows; what works for me might not work for you, and what works for you might not work for Yuzo Koshiro or whatever.\n\nLinux might not be right for you and that's fine (you clearly had a bad experience, so it's not like you're making shit up), but to say it's generally terrible and can't be done \\*is\\* misleading: You absolutely CAN compose, produce, transcribe and edit music on Linux.\n\nHow difficult and painful it is for you really depends on how much you rely on Windows software, which Windows software it is, how familiar you are with Linux, how familiar you are with WINE, and so on. People who are willing to give Bitwig or Reaper a shot are going to have an easier time for sure, but like you said, I'm never going to recommend that someone switches their preferred workflow just to run Linux. \n\nIn the end of the day, use the tools that are best for you, just understand that those tools are not the best for everyone (even among Windows and Mac users).",

You kind of have to do it all these days to make a living in it.  Linux is nowhere to be found in the professional world of audio aside from embedded systems that offer no user control.  Even some of the big console manufacturers are just running windows embedded.  \n\n>I strongly disagree with this.\n\n>I was just recording guitar last night at 64 sample buffer @ 48k samplerate.\n\nBoy, you're really pushing the boundaries there...  You'd have to do RTL measurements to know what your latency is, but that's still too high for some stuff in the pro world.  Vocal tracking with headphones/iems for instance needs as close to zero latency as possible to prevent foldback interference.  \n\n>I told you what I use for my music production setup.\n\nYou did more than that, you framed it within the context of whether audio work on linux is good or not, and from my perspective it simply is not.  \n\n>It's possible that because your DAW was running through WINE you need to do some other WINE voodoo in order to get it to play well with pipewire. Or at least configure pipewire differently in some way. Configuring pipewire does require you to edit a text config file while i know some people aren't comfortable with.\n\nWhat a total waste of my time that would be to figure out.  That's the problem with linux and audio, it just wastes your time trying to get things to work.  I really do not have the time to tinker with this stuff.  I NEED tools that simply work.  I can't tell a client \"sorry sessions canceled because I can't figure out how to activate my DAW\".  \n\n>Personally I think ASIO is a piece of shit. \n\nASIO has been around since 1997 and has been the backbone of low latency audio signal routing on windows since then.  Pipewire had a 1.0 release in 2023.  It doesn't really matter what you think about them, one of them has the history to prove it's a stable and effective API.\n\nThe use case differences to me are clear here.  You don't work in pro environments where absolutely no one has any interest in the OS you use.",

It actually goes back much further if you bypass the TPM requirements in the installer. \n\nThe vast majority of PCs from 2019 will run Windows 11 without any bypass needed. \n\n>Name a PC getting OS updates still.\n\nSince the PC platform is open, there's almost certainly a modern Linux distro that runs on 90s hardware and still gets maintained.
