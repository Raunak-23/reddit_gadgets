It's really hard to time these things.  Apple on the other hand, will continue to see steady increasing growth for their products for the foreseeable future.  \n\nContractually it's likely apple is largely funding TSMCs research, and have exclusive rights on these cutting edge nodes.  So it might not even be possible for Nvidia unless they rework the contracts.  Even though they largely serve different markets, Nvidia is starting to encroach onto Apples space, so apple will want to hold onto their edge.",

That should really start paying off in products coming out soon and we can already see dramatic improvements in their software stack.\n\nThey are perhaps flagging a bit in terms of hardware on the GPU side but Intel have done oddly well in that respect this gen, and it'll be interesting if AMD return to producing higher end SKUs around the same time Intel start pushing into that area.\n\nAnd as for Intel everything hinges on 18A which is... eh. There was of course the rumour about Broadcom not being happy with it but [the only actual quote](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-manufacturing-business-suffers-setback-broadcom-tests-disappoint-sources-2024-09-04/) is that it was \u2018not yet viable to move to high-volume production,\u2019 which doesn't really tell us anything as it wasn't meant to be ready at that point. They've since [confirmed a defect rate of <0.4 defects/cm2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/opinion/continued-momentum-intel-18a.html), which they are very unlikely to have fudged, so there is a fair chance that's overblown even if we don't have enough info to judge yet.\n\nIf Intel do pull it off we could see both CPUs and GPUs on a truly cutting edge node for the first time in a while, as opposed to all of that capacity going to mobile (Apple). More competition for TSMC is also always good given how expensive they've become.\n\nObviously a lot of this does hinge on Intel not fucking up again, so maybe it's not all sunshine and rainbows, but I think there's a fair chance we might see some really cool shit come out in the next few years.",

I was originally planning on Intel but with that 13th and 14th gen BS going on, I wasn't going to mess with that risk.  The combo of the 7950X3D and a Nvidia 4090 is a big fucking improvement over an i7 and the 2070 Nvidia card.  So even if there's some slightly better combos out there now, I'm happy as a clam with what I got.",

And honestly the 4090 is overkill for everything that is presently out (unless you have a VR use case). AMD putting out two cards that can cover the spread of all* of the last generation of cards kind of shows you where the market is really at. (*Except the 4090)\n\nFrame gen and ray tracing are snake oil and the new \"Crysis\" bench marks for modern gaming. Frame generation has many draw backs and is only good for \"make number better\". If you have a game that you are getting screen tear on, sure you can trade ghosting and input lag for a better frame rate. Only ONE game in the last 4-6 years REQUIRES ray tracing, and they didn't even use full ray tracing. \n\nI'm thinking AMD has pulled the right move here. Slot into the market at the 250-400$ mark and try and gobble up the user's that are coming from the 10/20 series cards where it's a HUGE improvement over their current card. Keeps MFG costs down, keeps the number of SKU down. Put that time/money into the 9080/9090 they can release 6mo-1y from now to slap around the 50 supers.",
