      "body": "Surface makes great hardware, but I don't need an OS that nags me to update with ultimatums, which then after you update, forces you to interact with their 365 ad. I already have 365, and they need my credentials to sign in to the OS, so I don't understand why they're inconveniencing me with an ad for a product I already pay for. Ironically, that's one of the reasons I don't use Windows anymore, and am looking to replace 365.",
