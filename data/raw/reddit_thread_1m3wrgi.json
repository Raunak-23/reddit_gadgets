They very often introduce input lag and delay when switching resolutions, like Resident Evil 2 does when you go to the item screen.\n\nIn my own experience, I hooked up my Wii to my living room TV and it looked like total shit.

To mod it so you can hdmi out, which will only be 1080p, you need a retrogem which is $199. You also have to have extremely proficient soldering skills because those ribbon cables are no joke. Most people would have to pay for that to be installed. Usually those install services are around $100. \n\nSo even without the other features like Bluetooth controllers, it's currently more expensive to buy original hardware and modify it even if you can do the mod yourself, and you're not getting 4k but 1080p.\n\nIt's actually a cheaper solution with more benefits.",

The desire to get this noatalgia has kept many companies, including the one in the OP in business. \n\n>if I just wanted to run N64 games on\u2026let\u2019s say something other than your phone or laptop, what\u2019s the cheapest possible option?\n\nI'm assuming you're also including a desktop PC into the exclusions here since you mentioned laptop. You're effectively ruling out emulation at this point. \n\nSo you have four options. \n\n1) Buy some super cheap junker N64 off of eBay; won't be pretty, but will function. You won't be able to connect it to a modern TV, so you will need, at minimum to buy some sort of adapter (most of which introduce a lot of lag making some games unplayable.) \n\nBut, it's not THAT expensive of an option. You can get one of those adapters for around $20 off of Amazon, plus around 70 for a junker console. So you're right around $90. Sounds reasonable right? \n\nWell, most of the listings you'll find off of eBay are \"console only\". So you'll also need to buy a power adapter (usually around $20) and a controller (another 20 if you don't mind a clone controller). \n\nSo you're at around 130 for the cheap option, that will look bad, and have an unpleasant laggy gameplay. I'm not exaggerating, those video adapters are awful. Retrogb does lag tests on those if you're interested in seeing how bad. But if you're okay with that, price tag of roughly 130 \n\n2) Similar to option 1, but instead of getting m HDMI adapter, you opt into getting a CRT TV instead. These TV's can range anywhere from actually free (of you're extremely lucky), to several hundred dollars. I got my 25\" CRT off of offer up for $50. But I consider that to be a lucky find. If you're patient enough though, you may find something cheap like that. So add 30 to option one since all the other things like power adapter/controller still applies here. So you're at around 160. \n\n3) Mod the console to work on modern TV's. You can buy a cheaper HDMI mods for around $50. You're only getting 720p out of this mod, but we're not going for looks here, but cost. If you can install it yourself, you're good. If not, add another 100. Most people can't mod it themselves so 150 for the mod, 70 for the console, you're at 230, and still likely need a controller and power cable. \n\n4) You get an external scaler like the retrotink. Or lesser known Retroscaler2x. You can get the latter for around 70 off of Amazon, and it will actually look good on your TV. So here you're at 140, still likely need a cable and controller, so 180 all in, and it will look nice on your display. \n\nThere's no truly cheap option. And I'd say for most people interested, the OP is a great solution for its price point.",

Instead of a register in hardware we have a byte in RAM that might be anywhere on the host machine, and may not behave the exact same way every time due to threading and other behaviors of modern operating systems.\n\nBuilding in fpga correctly means instructing the gate array to create that register in hardware. It's in the same addressable memory location and is more likely (although maybe not going to perfectly) replicate the behavior of the original hardware.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Analogue 3D will perfectly replicate N64, but if done correctly it has an increased possibility to run erratic titles correctly - without needing emulator-specific configuration for different games.",

So they won't work with anything other than those retail games. Presumably, the FPGA will work with the actual peripherals and that feature of our romhack will work on something other than real hardware and a custom emulator build we made just to update the word list.\n\nWe ran into so many similar emulator issues when making the mod. I do wonder how the Analogue will fare.",

If you've ever used a computer before in your life, you'll know how to navigate a menu and adjust a few settings if you want to tweak the experience, and if you're a gamer at all, you've probably adjusted your resolution settings and such in a game before.\n\nBasically, stop acting like emulation is rocket science. If you're a gamer who's enthusiastic enough to want to play classic stuff like N64 and the like, you're familiar enough with computers to download and operate an emulator. This device is for those people who have a weird purist boner for playing on hardware, and that's fine. Emulation is still just as easy, way more customizable (and thus objectively better), and is infinitely less expensive than paying for a brand new 4k N64 in 2025.",
