We (the industry) know that metal migration (\"poisoning\") is accelerated when the voltage across the diffusion layer, or the contact point between two metals, is higher, just like higher voltage accelerates Galvanic corrosion. Reductively, it's the same principal. \n\nReducing the voltage with the new microcode can slow down this metal migration, and the effect is non-linear.",
