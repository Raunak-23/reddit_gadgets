And that does look terrible with movement despite being much sharper. It\u2019s also lower frame rate than 720p, which can do 60fps for super smooth NASCAR. ESPN has been 720p as far back as I can remember (over cable, dish, online). FOX jumped into 1080 land with two feeds (1080i and 1080p). It depends on the broadcaster and the sport.\n\nWhen league games were first made available online, they were just re-encoded broadcast satellite feeds you could watch on your computer. I believe interns had to watch and start the encoding manually or viewers would miss the first few minutes.",

This is the same way GPU\u2019s are going with exceedingly high prices for the average consumer and only the rich being able to afford them.

Finally the pricing is ridiculous as in some countries buyers pay nearly 40% less than in other countries where the product is being made in the same place, just because a country\u2019s wealth might be more than another country doesn\u2019t mean exploit it and charge more to buy that product compared to the poorer country.
