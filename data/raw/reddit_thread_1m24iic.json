Let\u2019s use Apple as an example. Every year they \u201cupgrade\u201d the camera and chipset. They discontinued their true \u201cbudget\u201d phone, the SE, in favor of the 16e. The SE 3 started at $429, was released in 2022. Now, these SE phones used some parts from older phones such as the camera and shell, but they tend to use newer chipsets so it ran similar to the numbered iPhone it release alongside. I have the 2nd generation SE (released in 2020 at $399) and it was a solid phone until it started showing its age this year. It\u2019s a 5 year old phone, I should expect that. I can\u2019t buy a new SE 3 (released 2022 at $429) from Apple, but I can shell out $599 for the new 16e \u201cbudget phone\u201d. That\u2019s not a terribly large price difference, but for people who can\u2019t afford a new phone it can be since the difference might be one or more phone payments (about 2.5 of mine). Apple hasn\u2019t necessarily raised their prices of their phones, at least since I bought my current phone, base models start at $799 and pro models start at $999. However, they raised the price of the SE two years after \u201creintroducing\u201d it, then killed it. Granted they raised the price by $30, but raising is still raising. Except, now that they killed the SE model they opted to raise the price further by calling it the latest release number followed by an e, and raising the price to $599. What is inherently different? Is it different than the iPhone mini, another model that they killed? The mini was just a smaller sized version, so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d call it a \u201cbudget offering\u201d, considering the last mini was the 13 and the price difference between the 13 ($799) and the 13 mini ($699) was a whopping $100. Neither the mini nor the 16e are much of a savings, when you consider previous savings for budget offerings was closer to $400 difference. \n\nTo answer your stupid fucking, shitty rhetorical question: no I cannot manufacture a phone. Or I can, you don\u2019t know me. But what I can say is creating something \u201cnew\u201d that isn\u2019t adding new features and charging \u201cnew\u201d prices for them every year is ridiculous. A new camera and chipset isn\u2019t \u201cnew\u201d unless you add features that are innovative. Companies used to do that with phones, then the market got lazy and stopped caring about that. Myself included in this. Just because we\u2019ve normalized it, doesn\u2019t make it any less ridiculous. I remember a time when the Razr was released, and its biggest selling point was how thin it was compared to other cell phones at the time. Today, it seems we care about minuscule camera differences, adding AI, and foldable screens with weak points that will likely break after multiple years of use. I used two different razrs over the course of 7-8 years, only replacing them because I broke them as a reckless teenager. Phones actually lasted back then, but today they\u2019re made to be replaced every year either through failure of the phone or vanity of the buyer. And imagine spending $800+/year just to have the \u201cnewest\u201d phone, which works exactly like your last phone apart from differences you will never notice. Just to replace it next year over differences you\u2019ll never actually notice.",

The iPhone for example is a superior product compared to what was before, especially in terms of software, but there were some products like the Ericsson P800 that was similar. And if you shrink an iPhone and wrap it on your wrist, is that an invention or innovation? I agree that it becomes fuzzy. \n\nI\u2019m probably nitpicking but I kind of look at it from a business strategy perspective, and innovative companies tend to have sizable R&D where companies that focus inventions have fellowships and collaborate with universities, etc.",

Most other manufacturers have different products that each have their own options but are not comparable one to the others.\n\nApple has no \"flagship phone\" (as of now) because their ONLY phone is already in the flagship category. The price ladder works because you CAN'T upgrade specs after the purchase, so they always have the lowest tier specced just below what most people look for to guide them a step up towards more profitable configurations. Why do you think the best selling iPhone configuration is almost never the base one but the step after that?\n\nMost companies use this strategy in some way, apple is just the company that use *only* that because they offer much much less products (a single phone, a couple of tablets, a couple of laptops, a couple of desktops etc...).",

I can have a chrome page open, reddit, and my diagnostic app all up at the same time and it doesn't feel cramped or tiny and pull information from all 3 at once for quicker diagnosis.\n\nI've found it super great for emulation. Is powerful enough to run even the hardest ps2 games. I can play Gran Turismo 4 on my phone with a Bluetooth controller. Upscaled to 720p and smooth frame rates with LESS battery consumption than any of the play store games I've played\n\nIts also pretty awesome if you stream a lot. The folding aspect means you can fold it into a 90\u00b0 angle and play videos on half the inner screen and have all your controls and such on the bottom half, or open another app. \n\nFully open offers full, smooth, crisp 1440p or better 120fps video. Which is absolutely amazing for things like slo-mo guys videos or just streaming in general. You hardly ever notice the crease in the middle unless the light reflections around you hit the crease just right.\n\nIn the end, its a multi-tasker powerhouse with a bunch of creature comfort features. Its perfect for the office power worker who uses android over iPhone, but also the media consumer looking for content presented in an above average fashion. \n\nAs far as fragility, I've had absolutely no problems with the inner screen, even after the stock screen protector started peeling. Im not running any screen protector inside or out and im not worried despite working in a dirty ass automotive shop. I only have a case and I've dropped this phone plenty of times with no issue. \n\nI didn't mean to turn this into a mini review, but it did. Nothing will change my mind about wanting a better camera though. If it wasn't for the camera being my biggest factor, I'd probably get the z fold 7. But I take a fuck ton of random pictures and the S ultra series phones take the cake for this Samsung fanboy.",
