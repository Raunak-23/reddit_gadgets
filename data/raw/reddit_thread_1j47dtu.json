There's lots of reasons why you might want to go authentic over emulation and just going \"just hack your 3DS dumbass\" is ignoring the point entirely.",

Its also not too hard to move old saves for most games.\n\n2) I get wanting to play games on actual hardware, but if you are wanting to play your cartridges on hardware and are either considering getting a authentic console, or refurbishing a console you own that might have been in a drawer for years and years, its also worth considering some amazing modern systems that can play those games off cartridges like the Analogue Pocket, which IMO is the best way to play Gameboy cartridges nowadays.\n\n3) I know you mentioned it as an example, but if you are trying to move Pokemon from Gen 3, you need a hacked 3DS nowadays anyways to get Pokemon Bank if you want them to go to the modern games. Assuming you don't have a 3DS right now with Bank already on it.\n\n4) Speedrunners, I get, but I do want to point out that that is a very niche community.\n\nNow none of what I said invalidates wanting to play a Gameboy game on a Gameboy. If you want to do that, do that. But if you just want to play Gameboy games, there are a plethora of methods I would recommend before recommending getting a Gameboy, much less a DS which can only play GBA games, and has the issue of a rechargeable battery (same reason I would not recommend a GBA SP.)",
