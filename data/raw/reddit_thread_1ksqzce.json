The component cost at scale for a shunt resistor for each pin is probably a few dozen cents at most, nothing compared to the ridiculous MSRP of the card, never mind the actual retail price.\n\nNVIDIA designed those \\~600W cards in a way that it can't tell how much power it is drawing through wich cable and if there is the a slight difference in resistance in a cable (which can happen from manufacturing defects, mishandling, simply on the inner side of a pack of cables when bent as a group, heat or varying cable length in a group), more power will go through one strand, potentially enough to go multiples above spec.\n\nSeasonic is selling a broom to swipe up after NVIDIA's *repeated* misconduct.",

The connection from the PSU to the GPU is low voltage, high current, DC. The connection from the wall to the PSU is higher power, but also waaay higher voltage (and AC), so lower current. So the required wire gauge from the wall is actually way lower.\n\nTo put numbers on it: 12VHPWR carries up to 600 W at 12 V (duh), meaning up to 50 A. A standard US power outlet can handle up to 15 A, so much lower. Even that's only for peak loads though; for sustained loads it shouldn't exceed 12 A. Of course, that's at a much higher 120 V, so total power is higher: up to 1800 W peak and 1440 W sustained.",

So more current means quadratically more heat produced in the cable per unit time.\n\nMany people are more familiar with the formula for power dissipated as V * I, where V is voltage. While technically this is correct, to calculated the power dissipated by the cable, you need to use the voltage drop across the cable. Since the source voltage is split between the cable and the load according to their relative resistances, you can't know the voltage drop across the cable without also knowing the load's resistance.\n\nSo in this case, it's better to think about how much current the load will require to meet its power demands, and since that current must be carried by the cable (Kirchoff's circuital laws), you use the formula I^2 / R instead.",
