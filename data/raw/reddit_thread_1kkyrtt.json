With cover hosting solar cells.  Ideally, enclosed with wind driven system to ventilate with a tail wind.

No one else would take the cycle to go to the hardware store 20km over, nevermind volunteering/working 40km over. They just use the car. But I want to believe living without a car is possible.\n\nUnfortunately, my city is essentially bankrupt. There are many projects on the table, and no money to actually pay for anything. There's a bridge re-construction project coming soon, but that's only because it's paid for by the train company, as they fear it'll collapse on their rails... Still, our job to chime in, and ensure the new bridge is better adapted to cycles (and pedestrians! I got hit by cars twice while walking!!) than the old one.\n\nWithin my town, it's mostly chill. The main issue is people walking dogs without a leash, or trash bags left onto the cycle path. Delivery people, too, but rarely parked cars. Close passes are rare too, people frequently go all the way onto the opposite lane (and I give a big thumbs up in return every time!).\n\nSo it's mostly intercity travel I want to focus on, places where cars can be found going 90km/h. And connecting our stores to our cycling infrastructure a bit better. But to be fair, there's not even a sidewalk there either ; construction guys cheated on the plans, and nobody went to check before it was finished...",

I think actual bikes should be eat sidewalks, i'll put it this way, the worst I have ever seen in america a sidewalk get is still able to have a bike drive down it, and in a city where they may need scaffolding, either detour to the outer left perimeter, or walk the bike and stay on the right if it ends up eating into the bike area. \n\nI think city planning going forward should make bike lanes either eat sidewalk space, or if its new, plan for bikes from the outset, and not a painted line, an actual car cant cross with out potentially fucking the car up barrier. \n\nthe only time a bike lane should eat into actual traffic lanes is if the route is the only one a bike can realistically travel lets say a bridge where sure, there is a more open route, but its 2~ miles out of the way, on a car that would suck but doable, on a bike that a massive amount of effort and you should be incentivising bikes over cars ideally in a city",
