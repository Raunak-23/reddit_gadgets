Fuck that, this is some backwards bullshit. Now this bullshit requires 2 usb ports for the same shit",

I personally hardly use the mmo side of the mouse now but thats partly due to me cutting back on mmos due to life and even when i do play I barely touch them as it's no longer a muscle memory. They're great mice if you need extra hot keys but it really depends on how you are if you can get the moust out of them.\n\nAs for actual recommendations, Naga line was what I used from razer, decent quality interchangeable side piece so I wasn't stuck with the mmo setup, they also have a dedicated model that has freespin and wireless (afaik only big company between Logitech, Corsair and Razer to have that setup) but name is escaping me which is what I currently use. The Logitech mmo mouse was fine but felt it got dirtier than it should and was harder to clean than I'd have liked, and I don't think I used a corsair and if I did it was brief, faintly recall their design not seeming very ergonomic to me",

The keycaps on my old MK750 are still looking pretty much brand new after 6 years of heavy usage.  Even the keycaps on my old g910 that I had to toss because of bounce on a lot of the keys was fine after 5 years.  All the previous keyboards that I had used ended up with the majority of the legends wearing off and I used to joke that they were security keyboards because way too many people don't know how to touch type lol",

Older gaming mice or wireless mice usually just don't fail, especially if they have replaceable batteries. And it's not like they fail because the high-end premium sensor or something is on the edge of what is technologically possible. They fail because the tac-switches, a cheap, well developed item, are of the lowest quality possible, maybe even designed to fail. As I said, I still have an MX Master and all my previous gaming and office mice (all logitech, including 2 MX 1000 which I still have somewhere) were retired after 7 years or so because I wanted something new, not because they broke.

                  "body": "That's exactly what it is about I think. They've already come out with better connectivity in the form of the Pro Lightspeed receiver. It provides up to 8khz polling rate for some of their higher end gaming mice, but I don't think it is backwards compatible with regular lightspeed mice. So they'd either have to build multiple variants of the powerplay for the different connectivity methods or include multiple receivers in the pad with a toggle between them. Removing the feature was the cleaner (and cheaper) solution for them, especially when you consider all the tech support mess it would cause for them when little Timmy buys the wrong one or has the toggle set wrong for their mouse.\n\nHowever, they easily could have just put a USB port on the powerplay for you to easily plug your mouse's receiver into as a middle ground solution. Practical and Future proof.\n\nThis things should at least be $30 cheaper than the outgoing model IMO with all the cost savings they've done.",

(That said, fairly inexcusable that they couldn't just have a USB C port on the powerplay hardware that you could plug your dongle into there.)\n\nHaving a built in USB cable instead of a port to plug into is an iffy decision as well. Usually a hallmark of lower quality products. That said, it's not terrible, and getting away from micro USB is a good thing. Just wish it'd gone USB C instead.\n\nPersonally, I switched to hard mouse pads years ago and have never looked back, so while I don't mind the inclusion of only a soft pad, they don't clearly indicate a compatible hard pad to use instead (as an add on accessory instead), which is a problem for me.\n\nThe rest sounds good, but those aren't minor issues.",

Its a common issue and Logitec does not sell replacement mouse 1 boards.\n\nLogitec uses the Panasonic EVQ-P0D07K as its mouse one button - its rated to 1 Million presses, which is 5-10 times less than the switches other mouse companies use, and you can\u00a0*easily*\u00a0exceed it with daily use after a year or two.\n\nI replaced it with a Kalih switch, which cost $0.29, that is rated for 10M presses. The difference in price between a 10M rated a 1M rated switch is often less than 5 cents at volume, 8 cents for a 20M rated switch.\n\nFinding that out thats the level of cost cutting, on Logitechs $100 premium mouse, is definitely a reason why I won't ever be buying another one.\n\nCounting down the days until the magnetic scroll wheel patents expire.",

This mouse was shit from the start (battery draining after only a couple days) and Logitech support could not help resolve the issue.  They then sent me a free G604 which was their new version of the same G602.  4 years later, all the rubber has peeled off the mouse (which is a super common issue) and now they don\u2019t make any such mouse with 6 thumb buttons.  They make other mice that have 10-12 buttons, but that\u2019s unnecessary in my case.  I only really want 6.   \n\nThe same is true of other companies as well.  It seems like they either make mice with 2-4 thumb buttons, or 10+ buttons.  Any lesser known reputable brands out there that might solve my issues?

It works fine for office work, but it's terrible for gaming as it adds a ton of latency.\n\nGaming mice use 2.4 GHz for the connection because it has the same latency as a wired connection, but as a consequence it drains battery far faster. Gaming mice, when used on that spectrum, drain battery in a matter of days, not weeks or months. PowerPlay is absolutely a creature comfort, but so is having a decent mouse in the first place. It means you will never accidentally be stuck having to play wired, swap a battery, or take a break to charge.",
