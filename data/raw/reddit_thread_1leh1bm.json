          "body": "One advantage is that 8k cleanly divides into 1440p as well as 2160 and 1080, so you have a number of resolution choices for games that don't require complex scaling (that inevitably reduces sharpness). In the long term, that seems like an interesting benefit, because you get a lot more options for increasing framerate. But it's a tough selling point at the cost these panels are now. Besides, I'd guess most potential customers of these just want to run it at full resolution for the sake of it. I've certainly had times I wished I could run my 4k monitors at 1440p without the significant loss of clarity that comes with it, though - 1080p is a huge jump down.",

With high enough density displays, we'd be able to use monitors in a simlar fashion to CRTs in terms of resolution choices because the pixels would be so fine that you'd never be able to tell what the native resolution was supposed to be.",
