These things were only ever used for special purposes such as viewing medical images, CAD, and the like. They weren't practical for gaming since no 3D accelerators existed that supported them.\n\n4K as we know it wasn't really a \"thing\" until 2007 when the first standards started to appear, but it was mostly just tech-demos, not commercial availability. Movies weren't made or broadcast in 4K until 2011. The first *consumer* true 4K monitors weren't available until mid 2013.\n\nJohn Carmack was pretty famous for using very-high-end gear such as big monitors and expensive workstations, but these were 1080p only, not 4K.

It took a while, about 4 years under PC conditions, but it happened.  The risk with LCD is low but it isn't zero.  What this _does_ mean is that when people say \"it can't burn in\", this is potentially fudging reality.  And that means claims about MicroLED aren't worth much.\n\n* Whatever testing they've conducted to reach a level of confidence about burn-in _has not been proven by hardware in consumers' hands for an extended period of time._\n\n* The only display technologies ever created which are truly immune to burn in are all **non self-emissive**.  Even CRTs develop \"phosphor burn-in.\"",

So it'll need to be an A/B comparison, specifically between OLED and MicroLED, in a brightly lit area.\n\nThey'll probably want to pass on comparing it to QD-OLED since it's the brightest OLED tech there is right now.  So that means LG.\n\nAnd the video footage itself will need to be essentially only daytime outdoors shots.  Anything high contrast would give the OLED display a chance as it would suffer less from its dependency on brightness windows.\n\nBut I feel like by the time MicroLED starts reaching a consumer-friendly price range, OLED tech will have drastically addressed its own lumens issues, making the fight that much tougher.\n\nFurthermore, MicroLED displays _do_ generate heat, and it's an easy guess that while it won't necessarily be as constrained as OLED, displays will be designed to keep overall brightness on a curve, just like OLED displays.",

I do a few things to lower the chances of burn in; for work I use a Mac and I have the dock and menu bar set to auto hide and I rotate between backgrounds every ten minutes or something. I also don\u2019t maximise anything full screen (I always like to use floating windows on MacOS especially on a high res monitor). I really thought I\u2019d get some burn in by now so had assumed I\u2019d only keep the tv for a couple of years but it\u2019s still perfect. My point is that with minor precautions, OLED burn in really isn\u2019t a big deal.

Eliminating the backlight and going with emissive elements allows much better contrast ratios, the problem with using OLED is that the organic layer tends to degrade over time. To combat this they are often driven more gently and have lower brightness levels than they could have if they didn't degrade.\n\nA MicroLED array tends to be much more durable than OLED and ticks most of the boxes well. The major thing holding it up is the price of large displays, if they can bring that down then it's probably a significant upgrade over OLED. This doesn't mean that OLED is bad or immediately useless, but you'd rather have MicroLED if the price point is similar.\n\nhttps://www.androidauthority.com/microled-vs-oled-displays-3378913/",
