Once released, their accelerated airflow generates rapid turbulence, disrupting the natural combustion process and quickly extinguishing the target fire.\n\n\nThat sounds kinda stupid. Ozone is extremely toxic if inhaled, so even independent of the aerosol they end up using, this tech might be even more hazardous than the foams they try to replace. I get that it might be able to put out a fire, but the point of dowsing it in a liquid is that it doesn't start up again. If anything, this could maybe rival CO2 extinguishers.\n\nEdit: no, not even CO2 extinguishers. On second thought, I don't want a conductive mist anywhere near electrical devices. Releasing Ozone in an enclosed space like a home/kitchen/office for small fires would also probably require you to evacuate for several hours until it's gone.",

I used to mig weld aluminum for a living, the arc of one of those welding guns is similar enough to lightning that it generates significant amounts of ozone due to the effect of the intense UV radiation on the air outside of the argon bubble. It would cause lung irritation if you had fumes flowing under your hood and inhaled them directly for an extended period of time, hours, but it wasnt deadly. or I'd be dead. I think something like this would be safe to use outdoors or in large indoor areas, or well ventilated smaller indoor areas.",
