                  "body": "To be real, it started in the late 2000s with an underground Bay Area hiphop artist known as Based God. He wasn't known for his lyrical skill, but rather work ethic and positivity. Originally, being \"based\" is remaining true (often to yourself and in a positive manner) despite all odds. Based God coined the term and embodied this. For example, releasing over 40 projects in one year despite constant negative criticism and never stooping to their level of hate because he would rather spread love. \n\nWhile he was never recognized for his musical prowess, his platform allowed him to guest lecture at places such as MIT, NYU, UCLA, Princeton, etc. Many artists within the hiphop industry credit him for his unique platform and \"based\" began to spread beyond his fanbase (some not even rap fans) and hiphop in general.\n\nHowever, similar to \"woke\", the term has been adopted by those who have no knowledge of origin and its taken on other meaning. The originator would detest \"based\" being used to support a person promoting messages putting down a fellow human, despite standing against criticism being true to the origin.",
