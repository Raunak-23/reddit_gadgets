Apple's goal with the iMac wasnt to market it to businesses and have every office in the world use mac, but for regular every day people to have access to cutting edge technology like the internet, but to do so in a way that looked cool and also was really easy to use and understand.\n\nThe iPod was a sales juggernaut and definitely pulled them out of the shitter, but the iPod was an iMac accessory and part of the budding apple ecosystem that focuses on the average consumer. its something apple still excels at today and why they cant be beaten.",

While the iMac was successful it paled in comparison to the iPod simply because Macs in general were pretty niche back then and even today don\u2019t sell that much volume compared to other manufacturers.\n\nWhat was important about the iMac was that it proved that Apple was going to be ok. They went from launching flop after flop during most of the 90s to finally landing on a compelling and successful product that showcased a focused vision.",

And remember this was before the App Store, the original iPhone was launched assuming you only had the apps Apple gave you.",

After the G3 iMac got killed, they did both the Mac Mini and the eMac to stay in the low-cost segment, and the Mac Mini has continued ever since.\n\nThe bigger issue was that the ordinary person\u2019s desktop to browse the web got disrupted by laptops pretty shortly afterwards, especially on the Mac side where there were far less driver wonkiness for users to deal with. Desktops pretty quickly went back to being a niche for gamers and professional users. The original iMac really hit a unique time, where a computer was a must for many new users because of the internet, but a good-looking LCD was still prohibitively expensive, so it had to be a desktop.",

The ones that went for $300-400 I could find required signing up for Internet service for 36 months ($720~ commitment). If you built your own system back then you would save a ton though. I spent about $700 building a custom rig in 2002 that held its own against $1500 systems from that era. Maybe some new old stock Pentium 1s would go for that if you could find them.",
