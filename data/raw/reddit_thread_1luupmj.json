Also, no slide over window anymore. So need another quick window for references, maybe a whole different app perhaps? You\u2019ll have to come up with some work around.\n\nThe way iPadOS is set up now it\u2019s all I really need, I used to need to use my phone for references, which could easily pull me away from work, but I could easily switch between apps with gestures and use it for references. There\u2019s enough screen real estate at 13\u201d that I don\u2019t need to do that anymore, but when I bought the iPad for how well it worked before the update with no compromises, I\u2019m just not going to update and if nothing gets improved for us artists, then they lost me, they\u2019ll lose a lot of professionals. They once again got blinded by the success and forget that they still haven\u2019t actually taken off in the art industry, just mainly online, this could\u2019ve been a whole separate mode like they made with stage manager and just do visual changes to something only a loud, minority of people were complaining about, which was with stage manager.\n\nIt\u2019s like if desktop art programs got rid of a ton keyboard shortcuts because most users have a tablet with shortcut buttons built in, there\u2019s still a lot of artists that rely on using a keyboard with their workflow, you can have both. No one was complaining about having the shortcuts, probably just wanting a more touch friendly UI depending on the tablet",

Anyone know of anything like this?\n\nMy living room has lots of windows and there's just no good wall for a traditional console with TV on top.  Above the fireplace is the only spot and I hate it.",

Never mind that we usually had more than one computer per person. When they finally arrived no one would touch them and they were just in the way. Well my supervisor decided that she was going to start doing some of her job from one of the COWs that was in our way, so now she is in our way too. One of the reasons why we were so dysfunctional was b/c of her, she in no way shape or form helped in our day to day job. She had a private office away from us. the area that was the weakest link in our department was the one closest to her office. She did not need to be in our tiny room with her COWs.",
