They\u2019ve just given Nintendo a powerful semicustom 8nm SoC that would be perfect for their needs",

The refresh used the same chip as the 2019 Nintendo Switch, a 16nm Tegra X1 (Mariko).\n\nThe Switch 2 is about to come out, and Nintendo is again using a Nvidia chip. This time it\u2019s actually a semicustom design based off of some much more powerful hardware that would never fit in a handheld or set top box.\n\nI\u2019m thinking that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been waiting for. Otherwise they don\u2019t have volume to justify spinning up a custom ARM chip. Nintendo leads with R&D and hopefully the results can be used in another Shield TV.",
