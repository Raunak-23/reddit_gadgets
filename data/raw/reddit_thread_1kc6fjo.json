If an American purchased a Leica product anywhere in the world and brought it back to the US they would still be subject to the tariff. If they purchased in Canada, they would effectively end up paying the tariff twice.\u201d\n\nAs bad as sony.",

They (or their customs broker and freight people) are lazy.\n\nThe duty rate on a lot of lab equipment was zero or nearly zero, so it was cheaper and easier just to import a bunch of stuff to the U.S. and then re-export it as needed. That gives you the freedom to sell it in the U.S. if you want.\n\nWith higher duty rates, you'd want to put it in an FTZ pending re-export, ship directly to Canada, or (as a last resort) file for drawback for re-exports.\n\nThis is Leica saying they don't give enough of a fuck about Canadian customers to set up a Canadian distrbution channel so they're going to keep supplying duty-paid stuff out of the U.S.\n\nSmart buyers in Canada will find suppliers in Europe willing to ship directly, which will piss Leica off but hopefully they're also too lazy to play games like cancelling warranties on grey-market equipment.",

The Stellaris systems had much better super res, nearly on the level of the abberior, and adding FLIM to STED was just black magic.\n\nWith all that said, we don't know if the research / commercial side uses the same import chain as the consumer camera division.

Moving or establishing a new Canadian port of entry may not just make sense if the historical sales in Canada don\u2019t create enough revenue or profit to cover the operational costs for selling into Canada alone.  I don\u2019t claim to know what 7% increase means in total revenue from Canadian sales, but given the population, I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s a giant number overall. Buildings, people, insurance, etc are expensive - unless the tariffs adds many millions of dollars annually that could be circumvented by moving or recouping - it likely doesn\u2019t make sense. But I\u2019m only making SWAGs without knowing the real numbers. \n\nRealistically since we know baseline tariff is 10% - using algebra one can probably deduce what that markup on Leica imports actually are since the tariff is applied to the wholesale price not the retail price. If you know the old retail price and the current retail price changed by 7%, you know that should be equal to some base price + 10% + some amount of retail markup.  If there\u2019s any published insight into historical sales in Canada - one might be able to figure out if this is price gouging or not. Until then my assumption is it doesn\u2019t make financial sense to move operations to Canada or recoup the tariffs paid - or maybe the 7% does factor in the cost to recoup tariffs.",
