For some of the driver flavours (there are several) some of that code is shared between Windows and Linux (the [PAL](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Drivers/pal))\n\nThis makes modifying their existing Windows drivers much easier since they're not a black box (although they're still binary blobs).\n\nThis is also why the SteamDeck works so well. Valve has made several contributions to AMD drivers on Linux to make it work flawlessly on their (battery-constrained) console.\n\nTo be honest, AMD Linux drivers are much better than Windows.",
