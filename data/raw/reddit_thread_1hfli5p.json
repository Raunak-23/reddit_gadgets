Having a phone with 5G was absolutely necessary. So, even though I want to move to a more rational, smaller phone I am stuck looking at only 4G replacements, which will not do. If there's another emergency I absolutely NEED to have communication due to my disabilities.\n\nI want to move away from my 4 yr old OnePlus to a more reasonable phone. And normally, I would not be able to afford it on my limited income. Having a Jelly phone would solve all my issues, with the bonus of having a quality phone with the latest tech.\n\nThanks!",
