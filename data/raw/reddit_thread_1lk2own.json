Maybe you're thinking of the 80% rule, which states that any device that continuously draws energy shouldn't pull more than 80% of the rated amperage limit? That puts a 15A breaker at 1500W (hence all the 1500W space heaters) or 1920W for a 20A breaker.\n\nThat being said, a device that draws over 1800W needs the right plug. If you've ever wondered why many outlets have an extra horizontal cut on the left prong, that for devices that can pull over 15A. Devices that do that however, are quite rare. I don't think I've ever actually seen one.",
