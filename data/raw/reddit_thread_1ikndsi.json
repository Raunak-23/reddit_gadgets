Yes, I don't need a focus on AI but this is the price of a higher-end phone *with* a focus on AI, if it's leaving off features then shouldn't the price be lower? Or is the article/device just BS?",

Mine was 350\u20ac. Flagships have a bit better cameras and wireless charging. That's mostly it.\n\n...it also has an IR blaster",

Also for the fact that there really isn't much valid criticism of AI tools outside of privacy and data security (many people view other criticisms as \"old man yells at cloud\" fallcies). \n\nThis skill is called \"inferring from context\" and is a critical part of reading comprehension in the real world.",

You can also buy a used IPhone, which has similar specs and features for a lower price. \n\nIt\u2019s just two separate marketing strategies. Apple like other luxury goods focuses on small yearly updates, similar to a car model that is updated yearly. Apple would just suggest buying an older model. Of course they are going to try to up-sale you, but everyone is marketing. Almost all apple products follow this model. \n\nAndroid phone companies focuses on providing a variety of options. You can buy a \u201cnew\u201d phone that may actually be a couple of years behind on the latest features of smart phones. They also market many other aspects that hit the variety mark. \n\nConsistency is a huge market appeal to apple products. It\u2019s why certain design elements are evident that they focus on this aspects. Yes, they may not have the latest features, but they aren\u2019t going to add a feature that may be just a fad. Updates to their OS tends to be incremental and well laid out. I cannot say the same experience with Android products. So it often just comes down to what people want. Consistency or options.",

Only downside to it I can see is the lack of waterproofing cause of the fan on the side. But there is no front camera cutout, and the bezzles are super thin still. There's no camera bumps on the back so the phone is completely flat all the way around. Has an audio port. 7000mAH battery. If I was in the market for a new phone, that'd be what I go with. Even if it's a \"gaming\" phone, and I don't play many games on my phone, it hits all of my checkboxes I want in one anyways.",
