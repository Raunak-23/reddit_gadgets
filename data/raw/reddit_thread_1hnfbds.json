Maybe just R&D and releasing something to recoup some costs, then come out with a mainstream model later. Also testing the water with enterprise adoption. \n\nOculus has a much better chance with their price point, but idk what's going to get them there. I bet something smaller, lighter, with better battery life and perfect hand controls instead of using controllers would help, but that's probably still a bit off. Also, obviously, some killer apps.",

Kids, roommates, friends, significant others, etc can dip in and out and watch what you\u2019re doing, ask what\u2019s going on, etc the same as they would if you were watching a movie. \n\nWhereas, VR is *extremely* isolating. The benefit is that the level of immersion, even in lower resolution games, is absolutely astounding. The problem is that the cost of that immersion is to be *completely* cut off from the rest of the world. \n\nLike, I think VR is awesome. I have had gaming experiences in VR that are unmatched by 30 years of playing \u201cpancake\u201d games, *and yet*, my VR headsets gather dust because it\u2019s just too challenging to find time where I know I can be **completely** isolated vs just booting up Steam and knowing I can dip out if something comes up.",

All you're going to end up with is people doing proof of concept apps for an echo chamber of users.\n\nOnly way it would get off the ground in that scenario if Apple were resolute on the pricing would be if they subsidised development and/or worked with a selection of key iOS/iPadOS developers to get their apps ported over.",

This passthrough AR is only really meant to be used indoors, whereas what you're after is the seethrough outdoors AR.\n\nWe need two separate versions because seethrough will be a lot more limited - you're adding photons on top of real world photons - you're always going to have limitations with image quality, color, and field of view. Passthrough AR gives you access to edit every pixel of the real world, so essentially you can make people invisible, remove a building, and just have virtual objects that are indistinguishable from real ones. Seethrough AR will struggle here, but I'm sure it will be very popular since it's the mobile outdoor version of this.",

Vision Pro is neat for watching a short video, alone, if you have an extra $3000 laying around. How on earth does this pass the sniff test?

It tools companies distributing Blackberries to pave a path to iPhone, workers bringing work home to drive PC sales, that sorta thing.\n\nApple tried to skip that step. A market *for them* does not exist yet.\n\nAnd the projected growth of AR is so much higher because it has more tangible usefulness for everyday living. VR is cool and fun, I have a few, I\u2019ve tried most since the 90s, when it works well it\u2019s amazing. But not as an everyday thing for normies.",

Next we need Valve to reenter the hardware vr market and then someone like Samsung to reenter with a budget solution like something using phones again.\n\nNintendo and valve didnt make handheld consoles/PC mainstream by releasing a $600 device, they did so by releasing something affordable, and then others stepped in to offer higher end and more expensive alternatives. This sounds like the same path VR should go by.",

Apple has absolutely said the Vision Pro was a stepping stone to glasses and that today it is only a device for developers and enthusiasts.  Apple knew it was not mainstream as they too are very aware of all the issues with current XR tech holding it back from mass adoption.  Will we ever get there?  Of course it will as the tech will only get better and will solve all the issues holding it back for many.  The real question is not if, but rather when it will all work in a way that most will consider dropping their smartphones for AR glasses.  I suspect by the end of the decade we will start to see the adoption growing in a major way and by 2035-40 most will have AR glasses. Guess we will see.",

HTC's has some decent options, but the availability is ass or nonexistent if you live outside of America.
