It fits comfortably in my pockets, I can pay without opening it, and scanning notifications on the external screen is a breeze.\n\nThat said, there are plenty of cons too. The cameras on this model are not great, the processor is slower than what I was used to from Pixels before that, and the usage of the external display is suboptimal (seriously: it's shameful how bad Google Maps uses the available space on it).\n\nOver the time I've had the phone the crease has come *very* noticeable and by now the phone doesn't fully open flat anymore. Neither hinders my usage of it, but YMMV. \n\nI've said since I got this phone that I love the flip form factor and am glad Motorola is providing good options, but the moment Apple or Google makes one I'd switch to that.",
