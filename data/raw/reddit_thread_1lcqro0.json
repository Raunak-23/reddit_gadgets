We want to catch your highest readings we can so we can give an accurate risk assessment. If you don't have glaucoma, this spike won't affect your IOP enough to be unreliable, and there's checks, retests, and other scans necessary before glaucoma is even diagnosed or any treatment is initiated. So no need to worry about that.",

You can gain a slim benefit of the time saved to put them in again, but for anyone who has worn contact lenses you're talking about literal seconds and all to give your eyes no break from them which is a bad idea.\n\nAlso there is precisely zero need in the world to notice the signs of glaucoma within minutes of it happening, none, ever. It's not like a brain bleed, or a stroke, in which detection the second it starts can change treatment success rates and survival massively. it's something that develops over time and being caught in weeks rather than months is maybe something that ends up being beneficial.\n\nadds a cost, provides literally no benefits, only has downsides.",

Your argument was as if magically doctors say don't do drugs, but then will provide you with black tar heroin and say it's cool, which is an awful argument.\n\nThis isn't a phone that you don't want that others do want and there IS an upside. a folding phone can provide a bigger overall screen space in the same smallest package. me not wanting it doesn't change that.\n\n>Personally I see my optometrist once a year\u2026not often enough for any sort of rapid diagnosis of glaucoma. \n\njesus christ man. Did YOU read the article? there are already contact lenses that do this, they just aren't designed to be worn at night. You can already diagnose glaucoma ridiculously easily.\n\n>Although there already are \"smart\" contact lenses that monitor the eyes for signs of glaucoma, the devices are typically only worn when the patient is awake. A new type of contact lens, however, watches over the eyes throughout the night, too.\n\nTHIS IS LITERALLY THE FIRST PARAGRAPH.\n\nNo making them wearable at night won't translate them to eyewear any more than the existing contacts do. NO finding out you have glaucoma at 3am and waking up with dry eyes and potential damage because you wore contacts over night rather than finding out at 10am when you put your day contacts in holds zero benefit.\n\nthis isn't an argument of 'a' contact that enables detection vs none and having to go to an optician or doctor. this is an argument of a lens that can already detect glaucoma... vs one you can wear at night that costs more, and detects a completely non emergent health issue that a few extra hours notice will provide zero benefit in any situation ever.\n\n>I\u2019m no expert as to whether that\u2019s a good idea or beneficial, but it is a thing.\n\ntwo people told you it was, instead of looking it up, you decided to try to counter with a thing. yes, longer term contacts are a thing, they are thinner, take more expensive materials to allow higher breatheability so that your eyes take less damage from wearing the contacts. the goal for longer term wear is as thin as possible with as few things blocking your eye from getting oxygen. A lens with more layers and substances so it can be a smart lens, is the antithesis of longer term wear contacts.",
