Then again I suppose that is the norm for mainstream tech outlets these days.\n\n> The large, bulky, and expensive mixed-reality headsets will eventually be replaced by a pair of smart glasses\n\nLiterally the first line in this article is wrong. Not only will mixed reality headsets get much smaller, but they are ultimately two separate product categories for different needs. Anyone in the AR or VR industry knows this - AR is the one for both indoor and outdoor usage, but the quality of VR/MR will always be so far ahead of seethrough AR that there will be people who prefer to use VR/MR when indoors.\n\nAlso why even mention expense in this sentence when AR glasses will be far more expensive?\n\n> The Apple Vision Pro experience could be \u2018squeezed\u2019 into a glasses form, but it will take several years for a quality product to arrive\n\nThat's a lot longer than several years away. Maybe 7-10 years? Even Meta's $25000 Orion AR glasses prototype isn't even close to Apple Vision Pro's experience.",

However, technology today means that the playing field has leveled out enough that to even have a first generation product like Vision Pro, outperform devices that cost factors more than it?\n\nI\u2019d say that people need to understand Apple shifting to in house silicon, to use these M(X) devices, that simply outperform expectations. All for a price point no where near as painful as the process of building a PC. Eventually, Apple will achieve the type of SoC to ensure they practically dominate the high end VR / AR markets.",

Satellite connection.\n\nThe problem with the Vision Pro is the price and even they know that, what I\u2019m going to find interesting is what will a Vision (non-pro)2 do to push the quo. That\u2019s when we\u2019ll get a peak into what MR/AR/VR will bring soon after. TBH I see AR glasses from Apple being a thing with the Apple Watch, Apple Watch buyers buy a pair of glasses that can use hand gestures from the watch to control the glasses and it\u2019s just a basic unintrusive UI that can give you information at a flick of the wrist and you can stream movies or something if you want. I really just don\u2019t see people wanting to have a AR UI around them when they want to use it. The average person is pretty lazy and would be pretty against having to wave their arms everywhere or put on an additional tech device to charge just to use the glasses. And you don\u2019t want to make them too bulky adding a ton of tech in there either, for everyday use simplicity is key and Apple has a way of doing that well while also tying it to other products to milk more money. I can somehow see Apple Watch-Apple Glasses-iPhone being the starter ecosystem thing for them and you gotta have all three for the perfect, modern mobile experience.",

The problem is that the device has too many problems. Walled ecosystem: I'm not paying apple to develop apps for a headset. Too heavy/bulky: it's not comfortable enough to wear for a long period. Short battery life: if you're going to give the damn thing a tether, offload compute AND battery and make the attachment bigger. Or hell, just make it a pc tethered headset. The newer apple computers are small enough to be portable anyway.\n\n\nAnd add all that to the price, no thanks\n\n\nAs a side note, there's plenty of room for improvement too. After seeing YouTuber reviews of the Orion, I'm pretty convinced that hand tracking will never be as good by itself as having a wrist band. In particular, for haptic feedback and hands-in-pockets controls, but I'm also assuming the gesture detection accuracy with a wrist band will be a game changer.",

          "body": "> That's a lot longer than several years away. Maybe 7-10 years?\n\nIt really did require Apple to invest way more in MicroLED. Their original plan to begin producing them might have cut some time/cost off, but without that investment the timelines are unknown.\n\nIt's going to be a relatively glacial progress. MR glasses have to go through 4K -> 8K -> 16K per eye to get to \"mainstream\". They also need an opacity filter to mix incoming light with pixel resolution - which doesn't exist yet.\n\nThe actual time scales for some of these projects are into the 2040s at this pace.\n\n> Literally the first line in this article is wrong. Not only will mixed reality headsets get much smaller, but they are ultimately two separate product categories for different needs.\n\nThe goal is ultimately for local dimming to merge the two. If the light blending filter that mixes incoming light with the display light is cheap enough then it can just shutout incoming light completely. This same optical component is what will ultimately create shadows and opaque objects for fully immersive experiences. The timelines for this could easily be 30 years away though, so you're probably right that we'll have two products.",

I would want to wear a body cam in public at all times just so i'm never accused of shit I never did, computer enabled glasses are the number 1 thing I would want this on because its seeing exactly what I see.",

VR/MR by definition put a barrier between you and the rest of the world around you, even if MR tries to integrate it.\n\nI also disagree that AR glasses will be more expensive.  I think mainstream adoption of AR will ultimately look similar to the thumbnail.  It will be simple notifications and static information, such as turn-by-turn directions or maybe a list of 3-4 of nearby resteraunts, not full resolution, dynamic video or animations overlaid on the world.

Great, useful stuff, but that would drive home the point that this is completely different to VR/MR because in this scenario AR would have no real focus on immersion. Depending on how you describe it, it wouldn't even be AR at all, like if it was a Meta Raybans type deal.\n\nI just dislike the narrative that people assume AR glasses are the be-all and end-all, and will replace MR/VR - it won't.",
