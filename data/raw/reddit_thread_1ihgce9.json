      "body": "Optometrist, here. I looked into all their marketing. \n\nIt seems Nuance is mainly aimed toward people who may not have hearing aids already, have issues wearing hearing aids while wearing glasses, don\u2019t like the look of hearing aids, etc..\n\nIt isolates and increases the volume of conversation and cancels background noise. Opticals would have a demo pair for customers to play with, much like the Ray-Ban Meta displays. They would simulate background noise by having the user wear a speaker around their neck.\n\nLike Meta, I would guess this is not going to be anyone\u2019s main pair of glasses or hearing aids and I suspect charging issues. But likewise, there will be a small influx of people asking specifically for this device. Usually, it\u2019s those who love dabbling in wearable tech and maybe people who know they are losing hearing but in denial about needing a hearing aid.\n\nAnd like for Meta, I bet some insurances will deny coverage.",

As soon as normal people see the hearings aids they start acting like I am below normal levels of intelligence. It is so frustrating and insulting so I just stopped wearing hearing aids. I would rather be treated normal and not hear everything than be treated like I have massive special needs. \n\nHearing aids aren\u2019t cool and society has a lot of work to do with accepting them. Hearing aids disguised as glasses is a great solution. But fortunately I have great eyesight so no need for glasses.",

Now imagine I have to recharge them and I can't wear the glasses part? Nor could I wear the glasses in the shower without the hearing aids.\n\nBTW, this isn't the first time a glasses and hearing aids have been combined, these existed back in the 70's.  My grandfather had one and he didn't really like it that much.\n\nHaving it being a \"smart glasses\" doesn't really make it more appealing to put up with the problem it has. Unless they can bring the price under $200... which is very doubtful. Regular hearing aids without all the fancy AI and Bluetooth for mild-to-moderate loss can cost more than $900... each.\n\nWouldn't surprise me if they price them beyond $3,000. No thanks.",
