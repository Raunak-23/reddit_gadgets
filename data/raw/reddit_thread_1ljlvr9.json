Well, unlike all of you, I'm not a spineless coward who deletes their post once they have -5 points because I know that these downvotes mean that I've upset you. And when you say something critical of someone that upsets them, you know that you've struck them at their core. Hopefully you've all learned something and can grow up and stop bullying in the name of \"being right\". Even if 1 person in 100 thinks something, you don't have to aggressively tell them they're an idiot or imply that they could maybe try dying, you can just have a good faith argument with them and try to understand where they're coming from. After all, just because half of an entire country thinks something is right doesn't make it right as we've learned from the United States of America where most of you reading this are from.\n\nBe better.",

Plus, it's not uncommon to reach for a drink or your phone with one hand while gaming. Or picking up the console by the joycon. \n\nWorse yet though, normally you'd have your fingers on the Switch 2 itself while holding it, giving the joycon some added support. However, the grips on the joycon, while nice for ergonomics, do make it so you'll have less of your fingers on the actual console while holding it. If you have smaller hands you may be holding it entirely by the joycon. That's going to increase the leverage on the magnets.",
