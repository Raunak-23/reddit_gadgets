A big part of that is security updates that keep people safe. This will likely get government attention as device makers move into the health and home safety markets. Most people justifiably don't want to junk expensive things just because a 1-2 yr warranty is over. Manufacturers get away with this in the healthcare industry because there's so many layers between the service and the consumer almost no one actually cares about senseless systemic waste. \n\nThe other big part of software updates is the over reliance on \"cloud\" to make devices work. You can have perfectly functional gear that becomes a paperweight in a day once a bean counter says to turn off the largely useless cloud infrastructure behind it.",

It may not be as secure as possible, but after a couple years of updates at the OS version level it'll be frozen at, most of the critical bugs have been discovered and worked out. Most apps will continue to be updated and receive bug fixes and enhancements, including many Google apps. If it's a quality app, it should gracefully degrade functionality, if possible, when the OS or hardware doesn't support a desired function.\n\nIf you participate in high risk activities where you need a secure phone, you probably aren't relying on a 5+ year old cell phone. Not that the phone becomes obsolete, but the hardware wears out. Screens crack, buttons fail, batteries go bad, phone carrier network changes, etc. It just becomes not worth it to continue to repair, or unreliable to trust for daily activities.\n\nFor casual everyday usage for communications, web browsing, playing games, etc it's quite likely no more of a security issue than anything else in modern life.",

Cellphones, headphones, speakers, all kinds of gadgets are powered by 5v DC power, and the same goes for the battery chargers for the litany of gadgets that use them. \n\nThe main reason for an iPhone and a Samsung (just one example, although quite a massive one) to have separate charging cords, and even different types for changing models, is to need, and have their respective owners pay for them separately. The waste of money and resources on this is just that\u2026.waste- on a scale that\u2019s hard to comprehend, and even harder to find much publicly available US material to begin to do so, for obvious rea$ons, of course.",
