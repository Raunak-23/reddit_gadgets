He\u2019s constantly improving his methodologies too. One of his recent videos goes into how he\u2019s updating his robot vacuum mopping tests because he doesn\u2019t feel they were fair so he\u2019s systematically going back through every robot mop and retesting them. \n\nHe also maintains a website where he ranks all robot vacuums and has various categories for budget and criteria like homes with lots of dogs or all tile or all hardwood or whatever. Incredible dude that is totally committed to a super confusing niche of gadgets. \n\nHis website\u2019s list (presumably contains Amazon affiliate links): https://vacuumwars.com/best-vacuum-cleaners/robot-vacuums/\n\ntldr: Roborock tends to be the best brand overall and their budget options usually beat out other brands\u2019 high end models. However, other brands may have specific patents for features/tech that specifically benefit your use case.",

It was like halfway down the page and hidden in between some other blocky pictures. \"See all Models\" is still a little too janky but yeesh--they definitely need better site design.",

Of course that sounded like horsecrap back then, and since then they added some mapping logic and now this new lidar system. So I think the real answer is, and always has been, they either were incapable of doing it correctly or wanted to do it as cheaply as possible, and sell us an inferior, and pretty expensive, product with some marketing snake oil to spin the flaws as pros.\n\nTL;DR - They lied to us.",
