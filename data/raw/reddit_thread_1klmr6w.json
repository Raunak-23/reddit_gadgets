Praise be to the many forum posts that have taught me. \n\nBut if you misread or misunderstand something and need to ask someone or make a post for clarification, so many people will just use that as a weird parasocial opportunity to try to dunk on folks simply trying to learn. And they get so god damn defensive about it, see my many downvotes lmao. Like it\u2019s somehow a personal affront that someone didn\u2019t know something you do. When people are rude RTFM assholes it doesn\u2019t matter if their actions are helpful, you drive away users from ever wanting to engage, especially people who aren\u2019t fortunate to have the same level of tech literacy or don\u2019t know where to look to find the information they need. It gives the community a terrible reputation. \n\nSometimes people have read the manual and misunderstand something or miss shit because they are human beings. I have dyslexia, I try my best but shit happens and everyone makes mistakes. People turn tech, especially Linux education into a dick measuring ego contest when if folks were normal it should be a collaborative learning experience. It\u2019s called nerds just be fucking normal nice people. Other spaces and hobbies online educate new folks happily, all the time. For some reason in the tech sphere when assholes burn out they don\u2019t step back from the community, they just start commenting shit like only \u201crtfm smh\u201d without actually seeing what someone was asking, and they contribute nothing but toxicity and drive away people.",
