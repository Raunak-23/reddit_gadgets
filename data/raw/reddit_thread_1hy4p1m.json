They ask)\n\n\nThen I got ahold of them to register a complaint and they clearly don't give a shit. The open is a good phone for the money but fuck that company.",

The build quality was okay, but there was a lot of plastic including the whole back. The glyphs were a neat concept, but ultimately useless. Had a lot of weird issues that while I can't be sure I'd attributed to their OS and software package I haven't seen on phones before or since. The specs were verrry *mehhhh*\n\n\nUltimately it was *just* enough of a let down to switch back to the Open (which is when I had the huge negative customer service experience). I'm hoping that it was just early installment weirdness (it WAS the North American beta, so maybe that explains the cell service and coverage issues)\n\n\nI'm absolutely going to be keeping an eye on Nothing going forward and hopefully the 2 or 3 are better phones because the first one wasn't it chief.",
