And even then, it was just full of a bunch of bullshit, apps, and music I had in other places (streaming wasn\u2019t really a thing yet). Aside from the pictures and contacts there was nothing to worry about transferring.\n\nMy best guess is there are lots of people running only 1-2 devices and it\u2019s likely the 2nd device is just a larger version of their phone (so a tablet).\n\nBecause in my mind, if you have a computer (and/or hard drives/SSDs), this is total non-issue. A phone to me is like a temporary capture/storage device, of course in addition to being a phone. It\u2019s great to have when capturing things on the go when you aren\u2019t running any other equipment that day (if you even do to begin with). If I really want that top quality lossless audio downloaded, I\u2019m obviously incapable of taking my whole library with me, but can certainly grab a ton. And even that matters a lot less when apps can auto-rotate tracks/albums in and out of local storage to keep stuff fresh or current. And the rest is\u2026 apps??\n\nBecause if it really is, exclusively, people\u2019s documented cherished memories through photo/video that is filling their phones\u2026 anyone who knows anything about data management, knows it should never be stored in only one place anyways (phone + cloud alone isn\u2019t sufficient either). \n\nSo then if the issue is just \u201cneeding\u201d access to every photo you\u2019ve ever taken while refusing to use the cloud for those small use-cases when you wanna pull up what you don\u2019t have stored locally\u2026 like, you are just being difficult on yourself at that point. Like your stubbornness to move it off and have proper backups is sort of the problem.\n\nBut hey, maybe that\u2019s just me.",
