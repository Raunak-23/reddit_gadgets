      "body": "From the article: At $799, the Phone 3 is priced to match the iPhone 16, Galaxy S25, and Pixel 9, particularly as Nothing positions itself firmly outside its midrange origins. Pei says the company feels ready \u201cto compete with products in that price level.\u201d Preorders open on July 4th, with general sale starting on July 15th on Nothing\u2019s online store and Amazon in the US. Nothing says the phone is fully compatible with T-Mobile and AT&T, with \u201cmore limited 5G support\u201d on Verizon.\n\nThis is Nothing\u2019s most expensive phone yet, but the specs should keep pace with the price on paper. The Snapdragon 8S Gen 4 chip isn\u2019t the most powerful one out right now, but its performance should handle all but the most demanding mobile games, especially paired with up to 16GB of RAM. Storage starts at 256GB, and you can get 512GB for an additional $100.\n\nThe Phone 3 uses a silicon-carbon battery, which is a relatively new technology that makes it easier to fit big batteries into small phones. Here, that means a generous 5,150mAh capacity, combined with a 65W wired charging speed and 15W wireless charging speed. The 6.67-inch OLED screen is more than twice as bright as the Phone 2\u2019s, and the IP68 water- and dust-resistance rating is a first for Nothing, too. All four of the cameras \u2014 three on the back, one on the front \u2014 are 50 megapixels, though it\u2019s impossible to say whether they\u2019re any good until The Verge gets to test the phone out properly. Nothing\u2019s camera processing has previously lagged a little behind the competition, so this\u2019ll be an area to watch.\n\nAll that is in line with other flagship phones, so what makes the Phone 3 feel like Nothing? That\u2019s where that new, gimmick-free Glyph design comes in. While previous Nothing phones have featured an array of light strips that can glow and flash in custom patterns for notifications and ringtones, those have now been swapped out for a small dot-matrix LED display in one corner on the back of the phone.\n\nThe Glyph Matrix is immediately less striking than older phones\u2019 designs and less unique, too \u2014 Asus has included dot-matrix displays on the back of its ROG gaming phones for years. Pei says that the advantage is that custom notifications can be \u201cmuch more immediate,\u201d with easily recognizable images or emoji tied to specific apps and contacts, rather than abstract animations that might be hard to grok at a glance.",

It wouldn't. First because it doesn't remove the option of Bluetooth, and also because there's a lot more people with wired headphones of some kind at their disposal than there is with Bluetooth headphones.\nAs a proof, most bluetooth headphones also include a headphone jack and oftentimes, even provide a better quality through it.\n\n\nNow, yes, many if not most mobile users are fine with watered-down, compressed sounds through Bluetooth. I mean otherwise people wouldn't use Spotify xD\n\n\nBut there was one time where 480p was fine for most, doesn't mean we stuck to this nor that it would be majoritarily accepted nowadays.\n\n\nMost likely if we asked people whether they'd want to bring back the headphone jack on their phone, the large majority would say yes.
