Early in the internet, people were gaming the search results by hiding an enormous list of every keyword people might search for on their pages, meaning they would get suggested for any query. So the algorithm was tweaked to avoid suggesting pages with just lists of stuff, which then also impacted recipes, that were just seen as lists by the programs, so they added the \u201cstories\u201d to stop them being auto cut out of results. Really did get out of hand after a while. I\u2019ve read about so many dead grandmas.",

So there's some blocks, and some blocks are owned by companies. Others dedicated to specific things (ie: military purposes, the flight industry) And then after a certain frequency+amplitude the things just become EMPs and can interfere with wired devices.",
