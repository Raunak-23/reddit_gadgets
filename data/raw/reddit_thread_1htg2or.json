I think Umax wasn't too shabby either, and some companies like Daystar and Maxxboxx made quad CPU powerhouses beyond anything Apple built in that era.\n\nBut yeah, the Motorola Starmax lines were notorious for being buggy piles of shit.",

Those days are long gone. \n\nI\u2019m in favor of more competition, but only if that means data portability and interoperability. \u201cCloud computing\u201d and SaaS can address some of this, but not all of it. \n\nI personally look at technology a lot more like \u201cmarkets\u201d and I believe in transparent, open markets. Somehow, the U.S. needs modern Anti-Trust laws that prevent these closed markets from continuing to grow and stifle innovation. Something to the extent that if a company creates an OS, it\u2019s not allowed to prevent buyers from installing other software or restricting its controls to other services and devices. The fact that Apple/Amazon restrict me from buying Kindle books on my iPhone/iPad is absolutely anti-consumer behavior. \n\nSimilarly, if a company is a \u201cMarketplace\u201d, like Amazon, or Uber, then it shouldn\u2019t be allowed to manufacturer its own products and undercut existing ones. \n\nUnfortunately, this is incredibly hard to define in the shifting world of hardware, software, worst of all, \u201ccontent\u201d. :/\n\nWe\u2019ll see if the younger generations can figure it out. God knows the older ones can\u2019t, or won\u2019t.",
