The phones are already blazing fast, have enough storage for anything you need, can handle any task or problem you throw at it. That\u2019s why all phone manufacturers do nowadays is upgrade the camera and try to plug AI features. It can already do everything you need or want from it. \n\nThe next big thing is supposed to be AR tech. Apple tried to do it with the Vision Pro but everyone hates it for some reason. The tech just isn\u2019t there yet and it won\u2019t see mass adoption or blow people\u2019s minds until it\u2019s as small and light as normal glasses but can do everything your phone can. And even then that\u2019s not really \u201cinnovation\u201d it\u2019s just a smartphone on your face with AR. \n\nWe have reached the upper limit of what computers and battery tech can do at small form factors and moors law is slowing down.

It's also really satisfying to watch YouTube videos on a larger screen. Showing friends pictures of things, I can unfold it and zoom easier. If you have parents that are farsighted and have to squint at stuff, it's nice. Also my phone is its own phone stand. You can also have multiple programs open on different halves of the screen. You can be texting friends while watching a video, you can be copying some information from an article into a document, all kinds of high-workflow type stuff that those realtor-type people would probably appreciate. Also nintendo DS emulation is awesome.\n\nIt's not for everyone, but it's a game-changer for those who utilize it.

Doesn't get affected by updates too rather actually seems to get better somehow. \n\nYou can watch movies or sports and it's a completely new experience. \n\nThe inner screen is just too good. \n\nWeight isn't an issue at all It actually feels lighter than my iphone somehow. \n\nThe outer screen is large enough so your eyes won't hurt. \n\nMulti window and multitasking is amazing. I can run 2-3 tasks in one go while my stock tickers are running in front of me and it doesn't feel weird. \n\nOnly downside is the front camera sucks ass. I'm on Honor magic v3.",
