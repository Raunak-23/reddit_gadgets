Also, Nintendo already launches brand new games day 1 at a ~$20 discount via the voucher, meaning their studios are managed and budgeted in a way that a $50 price tag at game\u2019s launch is viable and profitable for all of their models\u2026 so it\u2019s not like there\u2019s an inherent need for Mario Kart or anything to be $80 other than just pricing elasticity.",

I would wager that retail partners get ~8 to 12 dollars on a $60 game as their mark up not counting manufacturing cost, And switch cartridges cost more to manufacturer then disc games. I am also thinking nintendo raises the price $10 for games above 16GB that need the 32GB card because that is the real common factor between tears of the kingdom and Mario kart world. On switch there were only 4 games released on 32gb carts, Tears of the kingdom, Witcher 3, Final X/X2 (asia only), and dragon quest builders (Japan only). I would not be surprised if going up to 32gb adds another $3 to $5 ontop of the cost of the 8gb and 16gb carts nintendo normally used. And 3rd parties maybe just eat it because porting games like the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 cost far less than developing new games for nintendo switch/switch 2.",

Bottom line is that Nintendo can sell their brand new games for $50 a piece on launch day and they aren\u2019t folding studios and sending devs packing like their competitors - meaning their devs and budget are managed in a way that $50 games is a viable price point. I\u2019m not complaining that they\u2019re $60/70/80 (well, kinda on that last one), I\u2019m saying that the grounds that they have to do pack ins and reductions due to tariff shenanigans probably isn\u2019t the case. It\u2019s likely just to move product and post sales, just like the purpose of the voucher is - get you to buy two games instead of one, even if you woulda bought both at $60-70 anyway.",

The vouchers just give you downloads which are console-locked and can't be resold.\n\nPhysical cartridges also cost money (it used to be a considerable amount of money, depending on the size of the ROM chip), and are subject to tariffs. \n\nThere's another reason, and that is simply that if you adjust for inflation Nintendo games have been consistently around $80 for roughly the last two decades. I imagine they just like that price point.",

PCs have more flexibility and upgradeability, cheaper games, a bigger library of available games and free online play. Playstation needs PS+ for online play. \n\nPCs can do countless other tasks too. If you were to compare with equivalent ability, you should add *at least* a cheap laptop's cost on the PS5 side. If you do productivity tasks as well, now you need a console *and* a powerful PC or Mac. And just building one powerful PC is WAAY cheaper.\n\nPCs can be upgraded down the line with significant savings, because you can upgrade for example only the CPU and/or the GPU, and keep everything else. With consoles you have to sell the whole unit at a massive loss and buy a whole new unit of the new generation. And this most likely includes all the peripherals as well. And also backwards compatibility eith games is not guaranteed. Only *most* of the PS4 games work with PS5, not all.\n\nPS5 itself is a loss leader, sold at a loss to gain profits with PS+, peripherals and overpriced games. So comparing a loss leader without the profit products against a group of products (PC components) that are all priced to generate profit, is definitely not fair. Especially because most buyers of the PS5 *will* buy those other things too. That's why I'd say it's fair to use the 2nd hand PC component prices to compare the two. But I'd go as far that the price to beat should include at least like 4 years of PS+.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say the bang for buck king is PC in the long run, when you account for everything.",

That one single variable doesn't account for countless other things that have changed in the past two decades. Back in the 90s the market for video games as entertainment was basically in it's early adopter phase, and profit margins needed to provide cushion because they didn't sell nearly as many games, or devices to play games, services, subscriptions, merch, and all the accompanying sources of revenue that exist now. Not to mention developers had significantly different amount and quality of resources, tools, and proven IP or gameplay elements to depend on.\n\nI completely understand some people are willing and happy to pay $70, $80, or even more on \"upgraded/deluxe\" versions of games, but it's seriously out of touch with reality to assume the more casual audience would be on board with that pricing. I know even with the $60 price tag of switch games I found myself passing on loads of first party titles because to \"try\" a game that I wasn't super into at that price point was not worth it.",

You know that, or at least you should. \n\nNowhere has there been a discussion of:\n- reducing overhead costs\n- minimizing COGS\n- improving strategic stock reserves\n- supply-chain resilience measures\n- working capital squeezing\n- any other financial management tactics \n\nYour initial claim was:\n\n> Increasing profit margin is literally the only safeguard for businesses operating in inflationary environments.\n\nSo, if the entirety of this initial claim hinged on the obvious banal truth \"changing costs also impacts profit margin\"; then, thanks for saying nothing of apparent value to what was a nuanced discussion.\n\n\n>I'm not sure what we're discussing.\n\nEither do I. \n\nHave a great rest of your day",

Until the PlayStation came out they were mainly competing with just Sega.\n\nWith the emergence of PlayStation, N64 ended up slashing fhe prices of most of their games to $60. PlayStation was able to sell cheaper games that looked better and they could price them cheaper since they were put on a disk.\n\nFast forward to 2000-2001. The PS2 and Xbox releases, making even more competition for Nintendo who just released GameCube. Now having to compete with TWO consoles, Nintendo slashes their prices AGAIN for brand new games to $40-$50\n\nSo all the talk of \u201cinflation adjusted\u201d is nonsense Because as time has gone on Nintendo has been able to lower their prices just to have a chance in the market. They can\u2019t compete hardware wise but they\u2019ve been able to hang around because of their price as well as their exclusives.\n\nNow they\u2019re pricing their games at $80. Not just the brand new releases coming out but also the 10 year old games they\u2019re re releasing for switch 2. \n\nAdjusted to inflation or not, any games costing $80+ at any time period is awful and the only way to fight it is with your wallets. Which has been proven to work in the past.",

Especially since a number of games actually extended the capabilities of the consoles by including extra memory or auxiliary chips. Variable pricing was therefore the norm at the time.\n\neg: Super Mario Bros 3 isn't possible with only the base specs of the NES. It included extra memory etc. in the cartridge.\n\nSega Genesis was a very solid competitor to the SNES in the US, selling almost as many total units. Games were priced about the same as SNES ones as well, as shown in this 1993 ad:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SEGAGENESIS/comments/1hlb8gs/pages_from_a_toys_r_us_catalog_1993/\n\nPlaystation \"won\" mostly on the back of their system being far easier to program for and including an onboard audio chip. (Though I'm sure CDs being much cheaper than cartridges helped) Therefore a lot more developers made games for the PSX  (Something like 10x more games...) The actual games had a tighter spread in price, but were still variable from 40-55 as seen here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/n64/comments/yw5pmp/console_wars_ps1_had_a_lot_more_games_but_when_it/\n\nThe extreme high-end prices all died with the game cartridge, but the variable pricing remained to a degree, even into the PS2 era. Games for that were anywhere from 40-60 USD. It wasn't until PS3/360/Wii era that you really saw the overall market tighten up on pricing and really cement in that 59.99 msrp on consoles for AAA.\n\nIronically enough, PC is where prices were much more consistent over time: 49.99 for the vast majority of things until Diablo2 broke the psychological barrier by releasing at 59.99\n\n>$60 then was $60, just like $60 today is $60.\n\nWhat are you talking about? Your average fast food worker when the SNES came out made under $5/hr in the US and today the pay in most places is 15+ ... that is a huge difference.\n\nLets break that down into hours needed to work to buy a $60 game back then vs today: My first job was in fast food for 4.25/hr which would be a little over 14hrs to pay for a single $60 game. Fast food in my area is now offering 15-19/hr so lets say 15 -- that would be only 4hrs worked to earn enough for one $60 game.\n\nSo you were absolutely \"paying that price\" back then.",
