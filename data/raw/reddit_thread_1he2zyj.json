There's literally no way it can happen because either the laser is good and it's a carbon copy of the original, or it doesn't come through at all and the disc doesn't play due to read errors.\n\n\nAll that said, it was probably still a placebo effect lol.

Then after the first couple years of headphones and speaker products the next big thing was putting Beats brand audio into phone handsets which led to HTC acquiring a majority interest, Beats was able to walk away from Monster with all the IP, take manufacturing in-house, buy itself back from HTC, then sell to Apple a couple years later for a legendary profit, leaving the nepo baby son to cry into the fine print he never read in the contracts that let Dre and Iovine do all that.\n\nMonster's reaction was funny.  They tried to double-down on celebrity branding so hard it was ridiculous.  Who wants Beats by Dre headphones when you can get the Earth, Wind, and Fires by Monster!  Or the Xzibits!  Or who can forget the Nick Cannons with Bluetooth calling and noise cancellation for only $400?\n\n\"Hey, I saw that Xzibit had this show *Pimp my Ride*, let's do that\" said someone who had just seen *Pimp my Ride*.\n\n\"Yes, pimping is a great idea, approved\" said Noel Lee, probably, the guy who pimps his shitty cables to the world.\n\nSo they found a family living on the street in Chicago who makes all their small children breakdance on the corner for money, branded them as the Monster Kids, and got Xzibit and the West Coast Customs guys to build them a custom van so they could more \"comfortably\" drag a van of school-aged children around all over the country to breakdance at events and trade shows.  Don't worry they were being \"home schooled\" in their van by the parents who put them on the corner to breakdance.  \n\nYes that actually happened.  I couldn't make that shit up if I tried.  It's an awful company.",

          "body": "Back in the old day we had different connectors for each new spec. You could use passive adapters to convert devices, but it was super duper easy to tell if your port or cable supported certain features because the HDMI cable couldn\u2019t plug into a DVI port (for that matter a Dual-Link DVI cable couldn\u2019t plug into a single link DVI port). And as a bonus the ports were usually (though not always) different enough that even the dumbest people wouldn\u2019t try to plug the wrong thing in and could tell that two things weren\u2019t compatible with one another.\n\nThen somebody decided that every standard needed to use the same connector for the rest of time. Which is theoretically convenient in that old devices can plug into new devices, particularly in the case of HDMI where the popular existing connector was retained. But now in the world of USB-C you have absolutely no way of knowing which devices and cables support which standard. Is it full-speed USB 3 or just USB 2.0? Does this cable support video and charging or just data? Can it do power delivery and if so what is the capacity? Or is it Thunderbolt instead? Then you\u2019ve got the cheap gadgets that charge over USB-C but *don\u2019t* support Power Delivery, so they can\u2019t communicate with any of my USB-C chargers or power banks, I need to dig around to try to find a USB-A to USB-C cable and USB-A charger any time I want to charge those devices. And that\u2019s not even talking about the countless products that use USB-C connectors but don\u2019t follow USB standards.\n\nUSB-C was supposed to make everything simple and foolproof, but we\u2019re pretty much back to the point where you need to keep specific cables for each device because they all have different capabilities and aren\u2019t compatible, except now it\u2019s worse than it used to be because all the cables and ports look identical despite having wildly different features and capabilities.\n\nAt least with HDMI they usually either label the ports on the devices or you can guess based on the specs of the device (like resolution and refresh rate). Cables are kind of in the same boat as USB-C since ones made in 2003 when HDMI was little more than an alternate connector for DVI and ones made in 2024 for 8K TVs look exactly the same.",

So instead of 8K120 or whatever, you can link 3 x 4K monitors to each other, at 60fps or so. \n\nAlso some of that bandwidth could be used for higher-res audio for home theaters or have a single port for video and networking (ethernet).

                  "body": "Yeah, for now it's kinda pointless, with the only exception being if you have it hoooked up to a PC with a 4090 or the 5090 released in January.\n\nI have a 50\" TV as my monitor, about arms length from my face, and switching to a 1080P desktop feels just as bad as switching to something like 800\u00d7600 back when I was used to 1080P. So I can easily imagine 8K being great for desktop and me getting used to it, again shifting my idea of \"large enough\".\n\nBut I sure don't have a 4090, rather a 660Ti, so I only game in 4K if the game is 2D, and watch some 4K content but not everything works. Can't say I really know even just 4K gaming at its best... still, 8K probably does look great, so if you already have the GPU, paying a little extra and getting something like the 65\" Samsung QE65QN700C instead of the 55\" version might make sense.\n\nThough, if all you want is movies, TV, live broadcasts, YouTube... who knows how long will it take for all content to catch up with 8K. You will most likely buy a new 8K TV and still be waiting for 8K content by the time it's about to die on you. Since they will likely start making all non-subpar TVs 8K within a few years, I don't see how it makes any sense. You can't even hope for 8K console gaming to become a thing.",
