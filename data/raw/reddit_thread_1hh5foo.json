Like, 1% of 119 EUR is 1.19 EUR, 16 * 1.19 EUR is 19.04 EUR. 19% of 119 EUR would be 22.61 EUR.\n\nThe gross price is 19% higher than the net price, therefore, the net price is 16% lower than the gross price.",

Same principle.\n\n\nIf a business is running a sale like \"We gift you the 19%VAT\" as the German electronics chain Mediamarkt is doing frequently, the price you pay at the Cash register will be 16% cheaper than the usual sticker price. \n\nSaying \"I got 19% off\" would be wrong, as you paid 16% less.\n\nHowever, saying \"I didn't have to pay the 19% VAT\" would be correct.

So every year when rates increase the companies will make up reasons why they didn't make enough money for their infrastructure and blah blah blah crap. \n\nFun fact: in some areas power companies will actually charge you even if you install solar and power yourself 100% off grid. And if you make enough solar power to send BACK to the grid, they will still charge you a connection fee.",

The Reagan Tax cuts only accelerated this.\n\nCitizens United was more of a nail in the coffin than the inciting incident.   Lobbying has been considered legalized bribery by the public since (long) before you were born.\n\nAre you a lobbyist? Why are you specifically defending it?

Until about a year ago, some places were ridiculously overcharging their customers, especially the grocery chains (OP got a decent deal here). Problem is, Germans on average are notoriously bad at comparing prices. Secondly, self installation is crucial: once you involve an electrician, it's borderline impossible to break even. It's not so much the work but they'll horrendously overcharge you for any materials, markups of 300% are the norm rather than the exception for smaller jobs. Adding insult to injury, the German electrical code *still* requires an RST20i3 outlet instead of a regular Type E (SchuKo), even though the Federal Network Agency called bullshit on it - obviously, nobody gives a damn but it's been a cumbersome issue for renters because it's a backdoor for landlords to deny them.\n\nLong story short, if you can self-install things are simple. I get about 1000kWh a year out of a 600VA inverter. About 250kWh go to the grid, so I use about 700kWh (excluding losses). Even if electricity prices weren't as high as they are in Germany, it's kind of a no-brainer.",

Really?\n\nI mean, international shipping often is surprisingly expensive, especially for low volume. But also, I'd think it's more a \"it's so expensive, we won't bother with even offering it/we won't even bother finding a shipping company for it\".\n\n> b) economies of scale? What does this have to do with buying kit in Germany and shipping it to any other country \n\nMore that your local demand is too low to have anyone put in the work to optimize things, while demand here is so strong that people have bothered to work out deals with shipping companies, for example, and for that matter, for shipping companies to be interested in working out a deal in the first place.\n\nThe point is that is it a bit of an unusual product that you can't just feed through the normal logistics for consumer product delivery, in that it is very bulky and also somewhat delicate, so you need to work out solutions for efficient logistics, which only is worth it if there is considerable demand.\n\nAfter all, they were considerably more expensive here not too long ago, too, but the price has been dropping steadily over the last few years, with somewhat of a peak when the Russia/Ukraine war started.\n\n> solar panels do cost about 100\u20ac per 500W panel in any other country\n\nIf you buy a pallet? Seriously? That is very surprising indeed. As you can see, mydealz currently lists a pallet (36 pcs) of 445 Wp panels for 1985 EUR incl. shipping, so ~ 55 EUR per panel. With VAT, that would be ~65 EUR. There is even currently an offer from Hornbach (hardware store chain) listed for individual panels for 54 EUR at the moment (that would be for pickup from the store).\n\n> It does make zero sense that no one imports it from Germany, unless it is special price only for Germany and any business that wants to export it gets higher price\n\nIt certainly isn't, though, apart from the VAT exemption. There are other subsidies available, but those are paid out to the entity operating the solar system.\n\nAlso, I just looked at one of the offers on Mydealz for a Hoymiles 800 W inverter from elektroland24.de, they do offer parcel shipping to \nEE / FI / GR / IR / IT / PL / PT / HR / LV / LT / SK / SI / ES / SE / CZ / HU\n for 34.90 EUR, the inverter is priced at 105.99 EUR without VAT, and the article description even explicitly notes that a different VAT rate might apply for delivery abroad, so you certainly can get one of those delivered to your door for less than 250 EUR, and presumably, you could order more than one for the same shipping costs.\n\nBased on the article descriptoon, they even seem willing to deliver \"balcony systems\" abroad, but the shipping costs aren't specified.\n\nNow, I know nothing about that shop, but at least it doesn't seem like there is noone who would sell to other EU countries.",

[Source](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2024/07/22/germanys-solar-market-faces-price-wars-consolidation/)\n\nWorking directly with one of the largest players in the industry, our projections also show a drop. This is just facts in the PV industry. It's cooling down on residential side. Utility is still doing quite well. Because the installation cost if far cheaper large scale. Just because 300-600w balcony installations are on the rise, doesn't mean much, big picture. \n\nI'm just telling you the way it is lol. Like these are as accurate projections that the big players in Europe go based off. \n\nAnd that's good data point for large scale installations in China, the raw materials are cheap now. Crazy that someone made a bid that low. Would love to see the technical details of the system.\n\n\nEven $120-190 per KWh is still good for storage. We are also talking about 10000+ cycles, which is 20+ year lifetime if running 1.5 cycles per day. The BESS Industry is exploding and there so much potential in the technology. And there also are limitations. Like almost no one is really getting 98% uptime. Maybe 95%, there are issues with reliability since the product isn't mature.\n\nI'm not going to share any actual quotes for obvious reasons, but I'm completely confident that my numbers in terms of pricing for EMEA and US are accurate today. There's also no tariffs in EU.",

Yours is far better. Glad we are on the same page about the numbers!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of residential because of the cost compared to utility scale, but hopefully it will bounce back in Germany. If you are curious, I can find the reason for the shrinking market, it's not inflation. \n\nWe are seeing this similar trend in other countries like Denmark as well, but there it's for different reasons. \n\nThe way how I describe current state of energy storage, is to compare it to fluorescent light bulb. Sure, it's far more efficient than incandescent bulbs, but we have issues with recycling, cost, and durability. The \"LEDs\" of energy storage are a few years or  decade off, where the chemistry is cleaner, and price even lower. \n\nRenewables aren't ready to tackle cold winters yet alone. And we've seen an incredible amounts being installed in the last couple of years. It's time to take a breather and also evaluate what the grid needs to stay stable as well.",

Energy cost in Germany is insanely high, highest in the world.     \nThats the main reason.     \n\nA typtical small household consumption of 2000kWh in Germany would cost about 600-700\u20ac per year. A typical solar set for balcony installation will cost 170-250\u20ac (~800W peak). That set will produce about 800-1000kWh per year.\nDepending on the base load, expect to use about 30-50% of that for your own consuption. Thats about 150\u20ac saved. Or about 250\u20ac saved if you have a high base load (home server, charging of electric bike/car). Thats the same amount of money that such a solar set would cost.     \n[calculate that for 30 years, a typical life expectancy. 4500\u20ac saved against 250\u20ac paid]    \n\nYou are allowed to install up to 4 panels with 2000W peak (total) with an inverter throttled to 800W (that could output unlimited power to a battery, but only 800W to the grid) without consulting a professional, without needing a permission.      \nBuy it, install it, plug it into the wall, thats it.      \nSuch a set costs about 380\u20ac right now. 900\u20ac with a 2kW battery. Solar is insanely cheap and worth every cent, due to our high energy price.\nThe german state even subsidized solar panels for balcony installation in the past. Thats currently paused, due to our funding crisis. But they are still tax exempt.    \n\nAnybody who says \"solar is not worth it\" or \"its bad for xy reason\" didn't do the math and/or doesn't know our local energy costs. Its more than worth it and in combination with a battery, you can produce about 50-80% of your own consumption yourself.     \nCombine that with am electric vehicle and an even bigger solar array on the roof and the savings would be enormous.",

So, why would they undercut a competing plant if they are already selling everything they are generating at the same price as the competing company?\n\n> There is currently a glut of solar generation capacity that will compound this too.\n\nYes, bringing more cheap generation capacity is what will reduce prices because it prices expensive generators out of the market.

The situation is more like \"I produce apples at 1\u20ac/kg, but literally everyone else can produces the apples for 0.01\u20ac/kg\". \n\nIn most markets, your expensive orchard would likely just go out of business. Or, if they're savvy marketers, they'd convince some small segment of customers that their expensive apples are worth it. If they do the latter, other producers might increase their prices _some_ (because hey: we're not charging as much as you! Still a good deal!). But as a general rule, the market doesn't rise to the prices of the most expensive provider.\n\nEnergy markets though would set the price of all apples currently for sale at 1\u20ac or a bit more.",

That simply doesn't happen most of the time; market segmentation is a thing, for one.\n\nIt only happens if that seller is successful enough that the rest of the market essentially goes \"wait... we've been leaving money on the table\". And if it's only a _segment_ of a market willing to pay 1\u20ac/kg, then the other sellers realize that too, attempt to address that market with _some_ apples (maybe a \"premium\" brand), and the overall price of apples might rise to some extent because it seems more compelling to pay 0.10\u20ac/kg if 1\u20ac/kg apples are around.\n\nI swear, y'all like to talk theory but if you've ever built a business in a competitive landscape and had to actually test pricing models and figure out what you can sell at to maximize profit, you realize that markets aren't platonic ideals and that they segment and shift and tend to drive costs downward as more competition arises.",

That simply isn't how markets work.\n\n> If a 1\u20ac/kg apple enters a market where apples have been selling at 0.05\u20ac/kg, you think that producer will sell enough apples that everyone else, without any collusion, will just raise their prices as close to 1\u20ac/kg as they can?\n\nThat is not the situation that we were talking about. And it is not how any of this works.\n\nThe merit order price is not \"the most expensive offer on the market\". The merit order price is the most expensive offer *that is required to meet demand*. Just adding an additional expensive offer doesn't change the market price. It's the other way around: Adding demand causes the price to rise, and when the additional demand causes the total demand to exceed what the cheap suppliers have to offer, then that is where the market price rises to the price of the next more expensive supplier.\n\n> you realize that markets aren't platonic ideals and that they segment\n\nYou can't segment kWh supplied to the grid.

Not because cheap generators sell cheaper than the one market price, but because additional cheap generators ultimately end up meeting the demand by themselves, so that the expensive generators become irrelevant, bcause the most expensive generator that is required to meet the demand then is a cheap generator.",

The situation is more like \"I produce apples at 1\u20ac/kg, but literally everyone else can produces the apples for 0.01\u20ac/kg\". \n\nThat makes no difference, as long as those who can produce them for 1 cent a piece can't produce sufficiently many to supply the demand of people willing to pay 1 EUR.\n\n> In most markets, your expensive orchard would likely just go out of business.\n\nNo, it wouldn't. If there are 9 producers who can produce a million apples at 1 cent each, and one that can produce a million apples at 1 EUR each, and customers wanting to buy 10 million apples and willing to pay 1 EUR per apple, then the expensive orchard will stay in business and sell apples at cost, and the others will be getting rich.\n\n>  Or, if they're savvy marketers, they'd convince some small segment of customers that their expensive apples are worth it. If they do the latter, other producers might increase their prices some (because hey: we're not charging as much as you! Still a good deal!).\n\nNo, that comes on top. What I am talking about is completely equivalent products, which includes that it is seen as equivalent by the customers. \n\n> But as a general rule, the market doesn't rise to the prices of the most expensive provider.\n\nIt's just that that is just wrong. That is literally how all markets work. In economics, this is known as the [market clearing price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_clearing). See also [the law of one price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_one_price).\n\nNote though that the price doesn't rise to some theoretical \"most expensive provider\", neither for apples, nor for electricity, nor for anything else. If I build a power plant and offer my electricity for 10 EUR per kWh, that won't cause the market price to rise to 10 EUR/kWh. It's just the most expensive provider *that is required to meet demand*.\n\nIt's maybe easier to understand if you don't think of it as \"the most expensive provider\", but rather as \"one identical price for everyone\". It just follows that that price then can not be lower than the most expensive provider that is required to meet demand, as the most expensive provider will not supply anything if you don't pay the price that they are asking (think gas fired plant that won't sell electricity cheaper than the gas that they have to buy to produce the electricity), and as long as someone's demand isn't met, they'll be willing to pay anyone the market rate.",

If enough is built then the high costs producers will \"fall of the supply curve\" and go out of business.\n\nAs an aside -- this is the problem that nuclear power faces (in the USA).  In the good old days the marginal (highest cost) producer of power was a gas turbine generator  (which is expensive).  With the development of CCGTs (and the low price of gas due to fracking), and now solar and wind power, the cost of marginal power has decreased, so nuclear power plants generate much lower revenues (than historically) for the same power output.",

No, you cannot sell the 800W directly when using the easy way, that is: Buy the panels + inverter, mount them, plug them into any socket.      \nThis is only allowed if you follow two simple rules: First, you have to self-register with your state and second, the state then has to check if your power meter is modern enough to not run backwards. If it is, they'll change it for you.      \nThen your panels power output will just \"stop\" your power meter as long as you generate enough power for your own consumption, any overproduction will not be metered and you'll just gift it to the power grid company.       \nThis is limited to max 4 solar panels, max 2kW peak, max 800W output of your inverter to your socket/plug.      \n\n2. You can go the more difficult way and apply for a \"real\" solar array, which will earn you money. This could technically be the very same 4 panels/inverter combo from the previous point, but with major differences: First you'll have to pay a professional to install and check everything, secondly you'll have to get a bi-directional power meter, third the state will check if it got installed correctly, if the local power grid can handle the overproduction, etc, its a lot of bureaucracy. And quite expensive.      \nIn the end, you'll earn something like 7-12c/kWh produced and pushed into the grid.       \n\nSince the second point is expensive and takes a very long time to get approved, people tend to install big arrays instead of small ones if going down that route.      \nThe first one is a quick self-installation with almost no approval required, but you can just lower your own consumption, not earn money by selling power.",

The other one is wide out in the open, and will almost certainly get solar and a storage battery when we get the roof replaced, because it almost certainly would produce more power than it uses.

And in practice, your average household will consume a large part of the generated electricity anyway ... so people usually don't bother with the burocracy to get paid for the usually pretty small amounts of electricity that they end up feeding into the grid. Some see it as a donation towards the fight against climate change, I guess.\n\nI mean, these systems under optimal conditions will generate maybe 800 kWh in a year. If a household uses 600 kWh of that, that would leave some 200 kWh that are fed into the grid, so they could get maybe 15 EUR for that.\n\nIt should be noted, I guess, that you are only allowed to connect one of these systems per electricity meter, which, usually, means one per household. Or rather, that applies for the simplified process (i.e., plugging it in as a layperson and registering it with the national database is all you need to do), an electrician in principle would be allowed to hook up as many of them as you want, but then you also would need to ask the utility for permission and stuff, so that doesn't really make much sense and you'd rather just install a regular solar system instead.",

Also, it's trivial to just short out the connection to make sure that there is no potential there before you work on a part of the grid, in case some random inverter's anti-islanding doesn't work as intended, and is sensible as a safety measure anyway.",

Again, see PE videos for the texas example.\n\nI haven't watched the video, but those problems generally were about how they are (were) *not* random. And also, primarily about large installations, not small balcony systems. Specifically, that in the past, it was required that solar inverters would drop off the grid if the frequency deviated too much, which would cause large number of generators to drop out at the same time. That is a problem if those make up a significant proportion of the grid. Which is why nowadays, the design goal is to not do that.",

We, as in, electricity consumers, are the ones *buying* it for cheap at that time. Consumers both within Germany and outside of Germany.\n\n> Either way it\u2019s not economical and results in high, high costs for consumers.\n\nThat doesn't follow.

It's *some* producers of renewable energy. Specifically, ones that were subsidized under the EEG, where the form of that subsidy is a fixed price for electricity fed into the grid for a certain number of years from the install. Some of the early installs still receive relatively high prices from that. And also, the flip side of that negative price is that those producers get paid exactly the same fixed price when they feed electricity into the grid at high price times, which often is less than market price at the time. So ...\n\n> It\u2019s absurd.\n\n... no, not really.\n\n> The German electricity system only works because we have neighbours who are willing to put up with us.\n\nNo, that's just propaganda bullshit. We do have more than enough powr plants to meet all of the demand. We just aren't stupid enough to run a gas power plant when we can instead buy cheap excess wind power from Denmark, say.\n\n> If the did as we do and relied so heavily on solar and wind we\u2019d be in a really bad situation.\n\nNo, we wouldn't. We would just be buying even more cheap renewable power from them, because a larger area means a higher chance that there is wind or sun *somewhere*. And if not, we'd just be using our backup fossil plants for the moment while we expand renewable generation, electrification, and storage.",

To restate the obvious: solar, wind, coal and nuclear produce *electric power*. Only 9% of the gas used in Germany is used to produce electric power. 91% of it are used for non-electrified processes, be it to heat private homes or for industrial processes.",

Usually I am there maybe 5 or 6 Weeks a year. So overall, they produce more than needed. The cool thing is the analog current meter is running backwards if I produce more than I consume. So this thing is acting like a unlimited battery. I try not to go negative at the end of the year, because I have absolutely no clue if my energy provider will pay me instead of the other way around lol (need some research..). So now I just bring my EV\u00b4s whenever they are low and let them load there in winter.",

These rules can vary significantly.\n\nWhere to find accurate information:\n\n-  State energy agencies: These agencies provide information on state-specific solar policies and incentives.\n- The Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (DSIRE): This online database provides detailed information on state and federal renewable energy policies.\n\nIn summary, while some local regulations or utility company rules may exist, the vast majority of states support and encourage the use of solar power.",

They create shade, which can also improve your energy usage profile, jut by cooling the area normally exposed to the sun. \n3. You are not spending on an installation so their price point is significantly lower and you are not so worried about not sucking every penny from the sun. \nFor sure, angling the panels would potentially increase their efficiency, but at their price point and considering how expensive electricity is in a lot of Europe, the savings are still very substantial and close to a no-brainer, especially if you have a south-facing balcony.",

Putting up solar panels is a double whammy for us because it gives us shade that reduces the heat on our homes while also helping to power A/C systems in the hottest time of the year. Our peak energy usage coincides with peak sunlight mid summer. The whole duck curve thing is a problem, but we can make up for that in different ways.\n\nIn a place like Germany it's much more likely that you want to keep the heat in while not having AC at all. So peak power usage comes at night in the winter. When sunlight is already limited and at a bad angle. This doesn't really help you much outside of simple small reductions during low power times.\n\nAgain, offsetting any cost at all is great. Utilizing renewables is also great. I'm just not sold on this being a major contributor to power usage in places that need nighttime generation more than anything else.",

The supposed problem presented in the video is when the solenoid stays powered on from the back-feed when the RCD has tripped. Which it doesn't with an inverter with anti-islanding, as those used for balcony systems are required to have, which is exactly what I said. The RCD trips, the inverter detects that the grid is gone and powers down, so no more power is being fed into the output side of the RCD, and thus no problem.\n\nAlso, it's just irrelevant for Germany, as the type of RCD that has this problem at all isn't allowed here anyway. In fact, the UK might be the only (ex) EU country where those are allowed.",

I mean, with 400 Wp panels, you'd need 24 hours at maximum sunshine to fully charge that battery from those panels. So, realistically, you'd need a few days to charge it if you at the same time had no consumption, and in a normal houshold, you'd never fill it to even 50%, and on most days no more than 20%. That really only makes sense if you can charge from the grid at extremely low prices and then use the power when grid prices are much higher than the price while charging. And even then, 9.6 kWh probably wouldn't make sense for an average household.\n\nHere, you can regularly buy two glas panels (~ 400 Wp per unit) plus 800 W inverter as a package for ~ 220 EUR incl. delivery. Add another 80 EUR or so for mounting material (which isn't included as it varies a lot how you mount the panels), so a total of ~ 300 EUR.",

That's called backfeeding and it's very bad, unless there's a very different grid design in germany/spain/etc. \n\nWhile they say the panel will pay itself back in ~6yrs, you'd have to offset the cost of a battery too and that's probably just as much as the panels, if not more. The \"400w kit plus battery\" is 1,699EUR \"on sale\", if you assume you can average 2000kwh/day for 80% of the year with no panel or battery degradation over time, it'd take 28 years to pay that back based on the cost of electricity where i live. \n\nIt's not to say there isn't a sensible solution in here somewhere, but rigging the numbers like this is why a lot of people don't trust the numbers at face value, myself included.",

How does feeding 800 W into a connection cause more load anywhere in the grid than drawing 2000 W from the same connection?\n\n> It is also critical to balance production and load to avoid instability.\n\nYes, obviously. But it is trivial to balance out 1.2 GW in a system that never drops below 30 GW of demand, especially so when that 1.2 GW is well distributed all over the grid. You obviously can't \"overfeed\" 30 GW of load with 1.2 GW of generation capacity, and as far as local load fluctuations go, plugging in a 800 W solar generator is equivalen for the grid to switching off a vacuum cleaner ... and, surprising as it may be, the grid stability is not in danger because people can just buy and use vacuum cleaners.\n\n> I think renewable energy is the future but you can\u2019t just dump power into the grid with nowhere for it to go.\n\nOf course, you can't. But you trivially can dump 1.2 GW into a grid with continuous > 30GW demand, and especially so when distributed all over the grid.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that you can't just draw power from a grid with nowhere for it to come from. That's trivially true. But that is not a reason why there is a huge problem with people buying and installing cooktops that they can switch on and off whenever they feel like it.",

And in practice, it doesn't even need to, as consumption obviously isn't zero in households at noon.\n\nAlso, it's just peanuts. The 1.5 million balcony solar systems at peak 800 W produce 1.2 GW in total. Total load today at noon was ~ 68 GW, so there is exactly zero problem with \"getting rid\" of that power, and it would be stupid to store it in batteries if you can just use the otherwise idle grid to move it to a consumer that needs it.\n\nAlso, with increasing electrification, consumption in homes during the day will go up. My own heat pump, for example, always produces hot water around noon, that alone is ~ 20% of the daily electricity consumption during the summer.",

In fact, there is most wind when you need heating, because wind is what cools buildings. Just a few hours ago we had ~ 48 GW of wind production at ~ 67 GW of total load.\n\n> the prices can go literally through the roof.
