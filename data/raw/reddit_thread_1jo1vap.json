Their phones and TVs both use the standard Chinese manufacturing concept of lower prices which is seen in their \u2018feature laded\u2019 but poor performing and poorly manufactured products. Had a TCL 55\u201d TV for a year. Not only did it have terrible backlight bleed, I had to disable its wifi as it kept sending location data without my consent to some random location. It was only $199 though and I was starting a new job with not much money.\n\nTldr; its TCL. Dont expect them to not lie",
