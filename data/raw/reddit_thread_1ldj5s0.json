What matters is the improvements in and tradeoffs between power, performance, and area. When the device structure changes, you can get a leap in improvement for the same transistor \"length\".\n\n\nNo one in the industry really cares about this.

          "body": "The marketing label of a process node, like \u201c2nm,\u201d no longer reflects the actual physical dimensions of the transistors as evidenced by metal pitches still being around 20nm you are correct. However, it signifies generational improvements in performance, power, and density. the real determinants of chip efficiency lie in the standard cell libraries and design enablement. Factors such as cell height, track count, transistor arrangement, and routing congestion play a far more critical role in actual area efficiency and performance than the nominal transistor size. \n\nAdvanced architectures like GAAFETs may reduce transistor footprint, but without well optimized libraries and physical design strategies, those benefits can\u2019t be fully realized. Moreover, system level innovations, such as chiplet integration and 3D stacking, increasingly contribute more to real world performance gains than simple transistor scaling. Ultimately, a smaller transistor isn\u2019t inherently better what matters is how effectively it\u2019s used in the design ecosystem, and that\u2019s where the library and design tools make all the difference. \n\nSamsung has the same metal pitch as TSMC but draws more power for the same level of performance.\n\nIf you count the market as not transistor but a(unfortunately not standardized) \n\ntransistor type\nCell library performance \nPower use age per mm2 per work done\n\nThan you will actually find that it tracks pretty well..companies like intel stayed stuck in 14++++ for that reason their libraries barely changed then they changed their name to fit better with TSMC which only IMO ruined what TSMC has pretty much standardized for itself and what you can expect",

              "body": "It\u2019s not even about marketing, Apple typically waits until a technology is perfected (or until they can introduce some twist to turn it mainstream) before they jump into a new market.\n\nFor several years Apple was still making flagship phones with LCDs when the competition had switched to OLED, and they didn\u2019t even introduce an always-on OLED until a full decade after the competition, but you\u2019ve probably never seen an iPhone with burn-in. The Apple Watch was late to the market but now a decade later it\u2019s the only smartwatch anyone still talks about. The HomePod was super late to the market and admittedly that was an example where their tweaks and improvements to the smart speaker concept didn\u2019t really make it a success but people seem to like to use them as AirPlay speakers. Even the iPod didn\u2019t come out until many already considered the MP3 player a dead fad, but it was so fundamentally different from mainstream flash players (and more sleek and user friendly than the few hard drive jukeboxes that predated it) that it rewrote the entire rule book and now many people think it was the first MP3 player. And of course the iPhone had been rumored for like half a decade before it was finally announced.\n\nNowadays they\u2019re not *quite* as good at that strategy as they once were, as the HomePod and Vision Pro prove. Even when it\u2019s technically superior than the earlier efforts by other companies that doesn\u2019t always matter and they seem to be really bad at marketing new ideas now that all the big visionaries have left the company. But either way the reason Apple doesn\u2019t have a folding iPhone yet is because they\u2019re not confident the technology is there yet, and competitors products have proven that true. Apple has never really cared about being first to market, they want to be successful and ensure that the technology is viable.",
