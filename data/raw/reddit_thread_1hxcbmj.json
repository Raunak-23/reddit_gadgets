Usually around 70-75c with all fans screaming.\n\nMy 4080S FE runs around 60c maxed out and is whisper silent. Huge difference. Granted I don't have a non-FE card to compare against, but this FE cooling seems to be better than any I ever had aftermarket. Looks way nicer too. I plan on always trying to snag FE cards in the future after this experience.",

The custom PCB for the 5090 is likely pretty expensive to manufacture compared to the standard nvidia board since it would require new tooling. It could also be the case that they simply cannot make this PCB form factor at the scale to meet the demand for the 5080. \n\nSince the 5090 is a lower selling card at a higher price point, it\u2019s easier for them to offset a higher cost of component production without hurting their profit margin.
