I think they just assumed it had to be me and I was a kid so I caved. They were talking about the mountains of different trouble I was in, how I'd never touch a computer in the district once they removed it, blah blah blah...\n\nThen I told them they'd never be able to. They were like wut. And I explained that it was actually all over the network, hidden files in other hidden files in case I got caught and because different computers had different permissions, and they'd never find all of the redundancies even if they tried.\n\nThey let me remove it all, I got in zero trouble, and was never banned from the computers",

Everyone was told to change their passwords when they logged in, but several of us realized that a bunch of people would rarely/never be in there, so we logged in as various teachers and other students and immediately changed *their* passwords, then logged off and got on our own accounts.  When any of us finished an assignment, we'd log off our own account and explore this new 'internet' thing on someone else's account.  Sooner or later someone managed to break the network with something they downloaded, but as far as I know they never figured out who.  This would have been Windows 3.1 or maybe NT, so *network security* was a pretty unknown thing for most people back then.",

A few kids at my school and I all used the unrestricted network drives too for project64, quake, some game boy emulators - our desktops were ultra restricted, but you could use internet explorer as a file manager, so pretty sure the share drive was found by going down the alphabet past e: seeing if anything pops, and then word started spreading during early release / study hall, we\u2019d all go to a football coaches class that had computers and spend the day in there - eventually we filled up all the drive space and it locked. Our school IT had screenshots printed of basic file properties showing what account created the files etc and we all got in trouble - I\u2019m wondering what year or how non existent your IT guys knowledge was to think you withholding file locations would be any kind of threat, unless you had permissions to alter logs or did some actual hacker man shit? It\u2019s hard to believe a school with functioning computers would stoop to that kind of appeasement to a student threatening their expensive computer system- like I\u2019m surprised they didn\u2019t threaten to expel and sue you if you tried to big dick them like that",

I wasn't parading or beating my chest, it was like mutual defeat. No more Bomberman, but no trouble. None of this would have been that hard to do then, I got caught, it's the single dumbest thing I did on computers like this isn't a small story in a million of my hackerman escapades, everyone's disbelief is kinda funny to me.

Pretty sure I was in a mountain of shit, they just realized they were in it with me too. Not that they couldn't surmount the work of a nerdy kid, but then they'd have to acknowledge it. And yea somewhere with decent network security even then, not possible, but it was Florida. Some of my classrooms were trailers, that's all I have to say I think lol\n\nEdit for more explaination. Timeframe, this was before everyone learned html for Myspace. Emulators suckkked then, Bomberman chugged. The redundancies weren't like a death note poison pill in case I got caught lol, it's so I could play in different areas of the school with different access, it just worked out that way. I expected them to find it, but not catch me. And I wanted no interuptions in my Bomberman. There's a shit ton of files in an emulator, and they all scream gaming if they have intelligible file names or icons. So I'd modify them all so that it wasn't sticking out. Then I'd make them hidden, stick them all over the place individually, etc. as long as you don't break where the programs are pulling the files from, nbd. If I found that a directory or folder of games or whatever had been deleted, it was probably in two or three more accessible places to me to replace it.",

It\u2019s in those small moments that we will be able to retain our hope and sanity.

I\u2019ve seen way to many companies - and I\u2019ll throw medical providers into the mix - have it that a compromised system can wreak absolute havoc and cause a data breach by exploiting a single system and spread from there.\n\nBut let\u2019s ignore that for now and talk about the ICU device monitoring my vitals.  Given it needs to be smarter than just a beeping machine, they typically are tied to a patient and have information about the patient\u2026 name, ID, access to post the data somewhere, etc.  So the data is no longer just anonymous data being sent but potentially all your info now as well.  \n\nSo why care?  Well let\u2019s say data gets out there and/or is a breach of the company that\u2019s collecting it that isn\u2019t HIPPA certified because it\u2019s being hosted unknowingly in a location that isn\u2019t as secure (seen this more times than you can imagine).  Now additional data about you is being exposed without your consent or knowledge and who knows how much of that data is now exposed, or what.  \n\nThe whole hiding by obscurity because of all our data being out there isn\u2019t as obscure as you realize.  So now my patient info is out there - maybe the last 4 of my social, a patient ID, DOB, the doctor I see, etc.  nothing stopping someone from contacting a healthcare provider to get even more information about me from the provider given I\u2019ll have most the info to reach out.  Maybe even get access to online systems with the questions they would ask to sign up.  \n\nBut let\u2019s just be ignorant and figure we are good because we don\u2019t understand the implications\u2026 and as a result figure if we don\u2019t see or hear about things - it won\u2019t impact you.",
