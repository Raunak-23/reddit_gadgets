Thats gonna make them feel appreciated. \n\nI had a pizza party every week because no one could stop me.",

This isn\u2019t a slight against Biden, tariffs are notoriously difficult to undo once they\u2019re implemented and often stay around for decades.

So, they get left in place.\u00a0\n\nNone of that is accounting for the \u201cdownstream\u201d damage (affiliated industries that are not the protected ones) that is caused by them though, and in 2025 the fallout will be extreme because all the above means that these tariffs will likely be around *for a long time.*\u00a0",

Undoing the tariff policies all at once would have caused significantly more damage to those very same industries that had just a couple years prior spent enormous sums of money and resources to adapt, and make the domestic market even more unreliable to put roots into.\u00a0\n\nThis is of course not universally true, when Biden removed Trump\u2019s washing machine tariffs prices dropped domestically because it was a dumb tariff (and caused dryer prices, which weren\u2019t even affected, to go up). And business leaders in many industries did pressure Biden to remove the tariffs on China, but the administration found that the tariffs, having already been in place for so long, would be too difficult to dismantle unilaterally. So he dismantled them piece by piece, like with aluminum and steel sanctions, etc.",

A complete lose-lose. \n\nThat being said, as someone in manufacturing, this isn\u2019t necessarily true. The retailers, consumers, and manufacturers all know the tariffs are happening and what they will cost. If a tariff is rescinded, the retailers are going to ask for a price reduction. They also want to actually sell through the product so it\u2019s likely the price will come down as well. This is a lot different than material costs going up because it is significantly less transparent in the end costing. In some limited cases the price may remain high, but if the retailer wants to remain competitive in their market, they will reduce the price to meet their target margins when the tariff is removed.",

So buy up what you can, update, make sure you have workable parts etc for 10 years cause a 6k gpu, 2k computer, 50k used cars, hard to find lumbar or metals, etc are allllllll happening soon. \n\n\nI have a 4090gpu but a 3950x cpu. It\u2019s great still works, but has to upgrade as I was thinking this for about 3 months now with the tariffs. So, 9950x, new fan, new mobo, new ram, new psu which came to 1350~ USD. With my 4090 the SAME model I got for 1700 is now 3200. So upgrading was easy but I feel bad for anyone who needs a gpu right now. It\u2019s not gonna get easier or cheaper. 4070ti super is prob best bang for buck right now. \n\n\nAlso grab a ton of external hdds to back up\u2026 anything. If power or shit gets wild we might need offline media. Who knows. I have 500 gigs of AI models downloaded for local use. Am I going crazy hahaha",

When Trump set the bar on the floor the Democrats could have tried to do something actually decent rather than meekly step over the bar, but again and again they chose to offer people nothing but threats and finger wagging \n\nPeople think nobody in government is going to help them or do anything to improve their lives and the Democrats are doing their best to prove them right. Just being the \"We won't make it worse but we won't make it better, either. Show up or the worse guy is your fault\" party is a bullshit way to lead.\n\n  \nBut everyone is out here constantly blaming everyone but the people who got us here. Yeah it's a college kid's fault that Biden and Harris slow walked Musk and Trump actually facing consequences for their crimes. It's a college kid's fault that the Democrats spent the last 4 years with a written roadmap of what Republicans are doing now and did absolutely nothing to prevent it from happening. It's a college kid's fault that Biden welcomed a man who committed a violent coup back into the white house with a smile and a Welcome Home. It's the college kid's fault that Democrats are deciding that transgender people might not deserve human rights after all because 80 year olds in charge of the party say that being \"woke\" will lose elections \n\n  \nGod forbid you actually blame the people with all the money and power",

My problem with the protests were both how they were handled but also what they wanted disregarding reality/nuance of the situation.\n\nUnfortunately for Gaza protestors, they refused to acknowledge that they were stuck in a hard place. There was no option that gave them what they wanted. They either got status quo or by not voting they got what they have now which is actual genocide for Gaza.\n\nSo please don't tell me they were passionate about the issue. It was a game for them. They didn't give a shit about Gaza in reality considering how they decided to vote. Because if they were truly passionate, they would have realized the reality above and still voted for Democrats while continuing to protest as that was the only option that got them closer to their goal.\n\nOh btw, where are those protestors now? If they were truly passionate why they are not protesting Trump's choice to erase Gaza off the map.\n\n> The Democrats are absolutely terrified of offending Republicans, what if they moved that attitude to where they actually cared about the people who aren't voting for Nazi shit instead of chasing Nazi votes while telling everyone else to fall in line or else\n\nLike what? Democrats had decent proposals in place for economy, to improve social services and to ensure America had long term growth for high skill jobs. Just because media didn't report on them doesn't mean they didn't exist.",

Your friend, as you already know, is very wrong. It's extremely expensive to fit a facility for manufacturing these days including not just the building/location but also the infrastructure, the machinery and tools on-site, the technical infrastructure on-site, the power availability and personnel able to work at the location with expertise needed. And that doesn't even take into account the shipping/logistics needed, the sourcing of materials needed, all the back-end systems tied to and appropriate support of the same, etc. No company I have known keeps idle locations for manufacturing, it just isn't a thing, or even if so, would be such a niche market that it would only make sense for that single product. \n\nTurnover of a new facility takes a long time as well, even with a fantastic timeline of construction, fitting, staffing and training, you're looking at 5 years or so, maybe less if you just so happen to have a pretty well fit used factory land in your lap, which also never happens. \n\nEvery major manufacturing company these days sources from around the world for most products even, \"made in the USA.\" It's just the way things are now. Rubber from one country, steel from another, wiring from another, chipsets/electronics from yet another, and on and on. Tariffs make NO sense to keep things here, it just causes everyone to have delays or find alternative methods and places to source from which may be more expensive or worse quality. The price of everything must go up, and the sales for things thus also come down. It causes massive shifts of demand on products because it forces long term equilibrium of the product markets into a spiral. It can even cause the reverse of what people here think, meaning a huge loss of market share for products made in the US, because most companies rely on a worldwide market, not just within our own country.\n\nYou are 100% correct. Your friend has a rude awakening coming his way, I wish his company luck if the consensus where he works is the same mindset he has.",

So Canadians or Mexicans (assuming Mexico applies 25% tariff) consumer prices go up 60% because now the whole vehicle gets tariffed again on import to can/US. \n\nNow F150\u2019s are $115,000 base price and Canada and Mexico consumers stop buying them. \n\nSo now fords demand drops in both the US, Can, and Mexico because they\u2019re unaffordable so the factory scales back production and lays people off.\n\nAs a result they also start losing some of the economy of scale so the price of the vehicle rises even more.\n\nMeanwhile Canadians and Mexicans just buy Toyotas now because they\u2019re significantly cheaper compared to something made in the US.",

Purchasing power goes down when prices go up so naturally people are going to sell shares because there is going to be an instant, if not temporary, drop in purchasing as people buckle down. The market selloff is because anyone with a brain knows the tariffs are going to hurt the economy so they're getting out before their investments tank. Otherwise they can keep their shares and the market stays relatively steady until the next quarterly earnings reports and then watch their shares tank.\n\nBut eventually people are going to start buying things again and there's going to be a balance companies figure out where they can raise prices and lose some consumers but still make massive profits off the difference. Look at all these media streaming companies raising prices twice a year. Yeah, they're pricing some people out but who is left is more than making up the difference.\n\nThere might not be a guarantee that prices increases will offset demand, but there's no guarantee they won't. Corporations will ensure increasing revenue and profits as well as they can, though, so if some people can no longer afford their products, they'll make the difference up on the people that still can.",

Cleveland-Cliffs, which wants to buy Pittsburgh\u2019s U.S. Steel, surged upward by nearly 18%. U.S. Steel rose almost 5%. Nucor increased almost 6%, and Steel Dynamics rose about 5%.\n\nNow why would anyone assume tariffs paid to the US Treasury would increase profits for a given company? It's because investors know how businesses work. If there is any reason the price of a product will go up, a company will install an extra increase to drive profits. It's happened since those tariffs went into effect in 2018. It's going to happen again now.\n\nTime will tell. I'm sure there is going to be a dip in stock prices temporarily since the past couple days have been brutal for the markets. Once that levels out and tariffs start to really hit consumer goods I can all but guarantee that we'll see companies who have products affected by the tariffs showing record profits and earnings.\n\nBut it's like you stopped reading my post when you saw some buzzwords you wanted to see.

We set up a time/date and I'm on my way.\n\nSo by the time I get it, it's damaged because it was poorly packaged and was probably bouncing around in the giant box truck they used for the delivery service. Long story short, they not only replaced the set (which, of course they did) but upgraded me to the next series that had a few extra features. All of this was their own doing because \"they wanted to make everything right.\" \n\nYou can fault them for shitty prices, but Best Buy's customer support is pretty legit.",

So, we ventured into a Best Buy.\n\nWe walked in and it was a ghost town.  I'm not sure there were 2 customers in there and from how it used to be (like 10 years ago), it seemed more....dimly lit?\n\nAnyway, as we're walking towards the back where the laptops are, we start to hear an annoyingly high pitched alarm going off.  Sounds like someone opened a door/case they weren't supposed to or something.  It's not going off right next to the laptops, but close enough to hear it constantly.  So we start checking things out.\n\nFind out that looks/sounds good, but the RAM is ridiculously low (IIRC, it was 4gb).  But, that's an easy fix....if it's upgradeable.  So I ask one of the sales guys if he can get some more info on that laptop.  He pulls out his phone, pulls up bestbuy.com, and after 2 seconds, says, \"it doesn't say here that it's upgradeable, so it's not\" and walks away.  Awesome.\n\nI look it up myself and it is upgradeable, but even better, one model up from there is barely more money and is already upgraded.  I try to find that sales guy (or any sales person) again to see if they can get the next model up for us and they've all vanished.\n\nAt this point, that alarm is still going off, they don't seem to have what we want, so we went home and ordered the next model up online.\n\nAnd that was the last time either of us have been to Best Buy.  It's not that we're actively avoiding it, it's just...there hasn't been a reason to go",

      "body": "I used to work at Best Buy from 2010-2014 and the store was always PACKED with people buying stuff and looking at all the new stuff we had. We had 5 or 6 registers at all times and there was always a ton of people working every department because of how many people we needed for covering all the customers. \n\nI went back for the first time a few weeks ago to get some AirPods for my brother in laws birthday and it was absolutely terrifying how empty the place was in the middle of the day on a Saturday with pretty decent weather which was our busiest day. Not a single other person in the place, just the security guy at the front that directed us to the customer service desk to get what we want since they don\u2019t have other associates in store. \n\nIt was sad and depressing to see the state the store is in. The prices cannot compete with online stores at all so them increasing prices will make it even more barren than it already is post pandemic.",
