While modern NAND flash memory cells are very reliable, that type of storage doesn't have anything like the same lifespan as magnetic tape does. That means there's a good chance that the MED becomes junk long before a normal tape drive would because the internal SSD has failed.\n\nbut SSD failure is only going to lose the most recent \"warm\" data, no? much like most backups, there's a recent time period you lose for a failure - swapping out the SSD module might not be as easy as plug and play, but there's really no reason for it to be \"linked\" to the tape drive considering they need to be fully independent anyway.\n\n>Still, needs must as the Devil drives, or so the saying goes, and Huawei's only doing this because it feels it has no choice. According to Block and Files' report, the first range of MEDs will arrive in 2025, with capacities up to 72 TB, with a power demand of just 10% of that required by equivalent disk drives.\n\nI'm confused - are there any enterprise 72TB HDD on the market today? As far as I'm aware the largest is a 32TB drive. And 10% of the power demand seems like a pretty big benefit for enterprise at scale.\n\nIt honestly sounds like Huawei has come up with a neat intermediate solution between spinning platters and pure tape drives for occasional access data for SME, but for some reason it needs to be framed as \"no, no, no - they *must* be doing this because of sanctions! It's a bad thing!\"",

      "body": "I've long thought that something like this makes a ton of sense.  Storage tiering isn't a new idea, I remember reading about hierarchical storage systems 20 some years ago that combined cold archiving to tape with hot/warm HDD access in a single file system.  Hell, the idea is used with OneDrive and other cloud storage setups for \"download on use\" file sync.  Compellent SANs would do more performance oriented tiering, spreading blocks across SSDs, 10k RPM, 7200 RPM and 5400 RPM drives.  Even Microsoft has had a tiered storage setup available since Windows 2012.\n\nWhere this gets more interesting would be how much intelligence can be baked into the drive shelf itself in combination with the size of the SSD for hot/warm data so that you could get very good predictive transition from tape to SSD.  It basically comes down to something like if you need block N, X% of the time you also need block N2 and N3, so we'll grab block N first and then grab blocks N2 and N3 after so that if you need them they're already available on SSD.  With large enough SSDs, you can afford to have the X% of time be a pretty low number.   And with enough compute intelligence in the system, you could get much more sophisticated analytics on when to pull data, when to write it, etc.\n\nThe hard part might be keeping the data on tape from getting fragmented.  Like if you get your block N and make some change when its on SSD, great, but you'll want that on tape eventually but you can't write N' in the same place N was located, it has to get written in a spot further down the tape reel where the tape hasn't been written.  For some very infrequent blocks this might not be a big deal, but over time it seems like there would be a lot of tape movement and potential for shoeshining.  Ideally you might want to rewrite the entire tape periodically so that the data was stored in as few feet of tape as necessary and with the most likely needed blocks up front, but this seems hard to do without a second SSD/tape in the mix.",
