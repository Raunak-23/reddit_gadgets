It will eventually be a case study in business schools, if it isn't already. Just an amazing confluence of greed and incompetence. \n  \nThey eventually admitted they fucked up, then finally got rid of the shit CEO (and CTO too, IIRC). The new CEO appears to be trying to right the ship. It remains to be seen how well he will do.  Killing this product is a good sign. \n   \nI would love to find a WiFi sound system that's as good as Sonos used to be.
