MrMobile recounted it died 3 times in one day from garbage battery life and google maps would crash from overheating. This is unacceptable for an $1100 phone in 2025.\n\nIt doesn't even use the new battery technology. It's literally just an s25 and they removed 30% of the battery to make it thinner.",

I'm incredibly happy and content with it. Without having to open it up too frequently, the screen folding becomes less of a concern. The narrow aspect ratio of the front screen is a big thing that I was worried about only to find that it enables me to type one handed. Battery would be stellar, I'm sure... If it weren't for requiring a constant Bluetooth connection to my Dexcom sensor. But even then, it still works incredibly well for what I use it for.  I'll agree though. My S7 and subsequent Iphone XR were both great. My last phone was an S22 ultra which, looking back - I really just didn't take full advantage of its features, used the stylus like 4 times in 3 years. And the obscenely large footprint of the phone eventually ended up being just a hassle after it was all said and done and I'd been dealing with it for 3 years.",

                              "body": "I will say that this is one of the higher-end phones that I've ever justified the price on - granted, there was a promotion and I wasn't too upset on having the phone for 36 months. YMMV.\n\nThat being said, one of the big things to consider with the flip vs the fold, even though they're completely different phones for completely different types of users. With the fold - everything primary-function-oriented can be done, exclusively from the cover screen. I've gone days without actually even thinking about opening the phone up. That is not the case at all with the flip. To do pretty much anything on the phone, you pretty much have to open and close it... Or keep it open all the time, negating the key feature of the phone altogether. But the point I'm trying to make, even though they both have the folding screen feature. One is going to see substantially premature wear on the screen/hinge vs the other as far as opening/folding tests go. It's just not one of those big things that people really think about. Food for thought.\n\nI do a degree of repair/troubleshooting in my line of work, and I'll say that while I don't see a lot of Galaxy ZFlips come through with issues - a related phone - the Motorola RAZR. Is easily one of the worst offenders that I see fairly regularly, with hinge/creased screen problems. Could be a design issue, could be a proprietary manufacturer issue. Something is telling me this specific case is the latter.",

I think a good move for phone manufacturing would be to see a yearly mandatory poll being publicly released on their website every year with points they plan to upgrade or improve on, maybe even trial new ideas there, before they jump the gun, to see what customers actually want and what they don't. That way they can make informed and real changes, not gimmicks.\n\nThe most important factors these days that most seem to be crying out for are, bigger batteries, better cameras and more storage.. Simple. The rest is secondary. \n\nSlim phones, AI in every corner, and the latest high end Snapdragon 8 Elite are no longer that important. Slim is no good if you're squeezing a tiny battery in, when people want longevity. Phone processors now are so good you don't need the latest and greatest. They're fast enough for anyone and gimmicks just seem to annoy people. AI, not everyone wants it so give people the choice between a model implemented with AI and one without, for a lesser cost on the latter. Give people the choice instead of forcing it on everyone. Also, technology advances seems to have slowed to an all time low because all we're seeing every year are tiny iterations, and they're struggling to produce anything with the \"wow\" effect, which is why they're resorting to gimmicks. There's no real jumps anymore so it's not worth the upgrade every year, or even two. Not like the good old days where every year was way better than the previous.\n\nMaybe it's time for them to start releasing phones every 3 years rather than 10 different models a year. That way we feel like we're actually getting the jump in tech we deserve and not flooding the market with dozens of wasteful makes and models of phones people don't want.",

The last Android phone I had was the Motorola super slim Verizon variant (SLVR or RAZR Droid) with a Windows Phone full theme. Terrible battery life, but decently enough hardware that I could handle it\u2026\n\nTried out a few times on my friends to see if Galaxy is worth it. Absolutely not. Don\u2019t even get me started on the UI. It\u2019s like watching someone go \u201cyour iPhone can\u2019t do that!\u201d before asking me an hour later to make a call because their phone died from how much GOD DAMN DATA THAT ANDROID SELLS TO PAY FOR YOUR FREE PHONE OS.\n\nOnce I went back to iPhone I never looked back. I enjoy knowing iCloud has my back with frequent password changes, seamless integration, and that my phone just freaking works.\n\nSent from my 16e",

On paper, this may feel like a downgrade to some...but I am looking so forward to having a phone that doesn't feel like a brick in my pocket and annoying to carry around...or having it fall on my face and leave a bruise when I'm using it laying in bed.  I've slowed down phone upgrades lately (used to be on the yearly bandwagon s7-s8-s9-s10+-s21u-s23u (only because the camera failed in the s21u)...but I've hated how heavy and unwieldy these big phones have become and have been pining for a high-end phone that's small and light.  \n\n  \nWhy choose the largest model?  Samsung annoyingly locks the best screen, cameras and storage out of the base phones- I need at least 512GB storage.  Otherwise, I'd just choose the base phones with maxed out storage.\n\nI still have my old S10+ in a drawer and took it out to inspect it....and man, that phone was amazing.  I didn't appreciate it at the time, but that phone is one of the all-time greats.  And I definitely can't believe the S25 edge will be thinner and lighter than that phone.\n\nLooking forward to seeing if the S25 edge can recapture some of the S10+'s charm/magic.",
