I'm aware that they weren't running at 60 FPS, and the *momentary* frame drops I ran into from time to time didn't bother me in the slightest. I cut my teeth on games that went into full-on slow motion on consoles when too many enemies were on screen. I've got zero reason to revisit those games even if it's higher FPS, and even if I was struck with the sudden irresistible urge to do so, I have an OG Switch that's perfectly capable of running them, and it's running custom firmware so I can do so with mods if I so choose. As for Arkham Knight? If I wanted to play *that*, I'd play it on PC.\n\nThere isn't a single game for the OG Switch that is going to sell me a Switch 2, because I can already play them and the performance issues that others seem to think make them unplayable are simply the cost of playing on a console to me. The *only* thing that will sell me on it is more *actual* exclusives that I really want to play and a damn decent discount on the console itself, likely some holiday sale bundled with a game.\n\nThat said, if such a deal crops up, I'm tempted to snap one up sooner than later specifically to make sure I have easier access to homebrew/custom firmware when someone figures it out, because while the exclusive games will be a huge draw for sure, the more powerful hardware allowing me to turn it into a portable emulation machine that can run PS1 games without slowdown like they ran into on the OG Switch would be a solid win. Until then, Bananza looks fantastic, and I *would* love to play it, but it's not going to sell the whole kit to me. I'm gonna need a new Zelda title that *isn't* another BOTW clone or open world style. A traditional Zelda title, or at the very least a full port of the 3DS OOT/MM remakes. They're going to have to beef that library up if they expect me to pay that much for the hardware alone.",

That's not all that important, frankly. The games ran fine on the OG Switch. The additional features for some of them are downright laughable. I legitimately hung out with a bunch of friends watching the Switch 2 Direct, and when they literally dropped \"BOTW in-game GPS\" we all busted up laughing because it was so fucking STUPID. We were far from the only ones to have that reaction. \n\nUltimately, the patches up the frame rate and resolution slightly and maybe staple on a few new features that, in the grand scheme of things, range from neat but not really that important or game changing to \"It's hilarious that this got past the planning stage it's so asinine.\" If you want to pay an extra $80 bucks to replay existing games that run perfectly fine as-is, be my guest. For those that never had an OG Switch and picked up a Switch 2, it's awesome that they already have a huge backlog. Me? I'll wait until the library justifies the price tag, and unless they shadow drop something truly legendary in the next few months, that's going to be a long while.",

They weren't the least bit interested. This is the mindset of the average switch owner. Not wanting to do any extra steps that require even the most minimal thought. The war Nintendo, Denuvo, and others have waged is simply about anti-consumer policies and being able to chip away at peoples rights. They want hegomonic control over the industry. Which means you, as a customer, don't actually own what you buy. This is the direction the industry has been moving for a while. Look at the 3ds now. The eshop is long gone, carts are outrageously priced, and owners are left out in the cold.",

You conflated doing less with the idea that their terms are unenforceable. Their terms are likely enforceable legally. They're pretty careful to change them in compliance with local laws.\u00a0\n\n\nThe idea isn't that they would do less to avoid liability, the idea is that they warned you of what the maximum consequences could be so you can't claim you weren't warned about the penalties. The liability shield comes from if you try to claim that their action has other consequences other than accessing their store. If they say they'll just shut your connection down then they have to defend themselves from claims that they did more in a practical sense.\n\n\nIt'd be pretty simple for you to sue. Buy a Switch 2, get them to brick it, sue them. You'd push the industry back and likely have your expenses paid for if Nintendo is on such shaky ground.",

                          "body": "Sega fixed \\*almost\\* every launch screwup they'd committed with Saturn. But one big one was they didn't have the online service ready at launch and had publishers remove online capabilities from most of the launch titles - instead of leaving it in with a way to play online once the service was ready.\n\nThus games designed for online play like Armada, had to have multiplayer on one screen because the online function was ripped out of it.\n\nSega didn't have the money to buy DVD reader mechanisms or to pay the per unit license for DVD playing, so they sunk a lot of their funds into pushing CD-ROM technology to 1 gigabyte as the GD-ROM. They should've found the money somewhere, somehow, to get DVD into the Dreamcast.\n\nThat was the #1 killer feature that pushed Playstation 2 sales in Japan. Many homes still didn't have DVD players then and a combo game console + DVD player cost less than they would separately and took up less space.\n\nThey also planned on GD-ROM being an effective anti-piracy method because PCs can't read the discs, and access to GD-R discs and burners was tightly controlled. But they left an unintentional backdoor by making the consoles able to read CD-R. That got exploited to load software to stream the content of a CD-ROM out the serial port. Then people figured out how to compress essential content and edit games to remove the need for non-essential stuff like music - to squeeze games down to fit onto a CD-R. Dreamcast is the one time game piracy really did hurt the market for a console because it took hacking and modding to rip the games while anyone with a CD burner and download bandwidth could get the games for free to play on a stock console. Playstation and Xbox required modding the console to play pirated games.\n\nSega was boasting about the numbers of Dreamcast units sold, to stores. They weren't counting the sell-through numbers to customers, which is what Sony and Microsoft did. Dreamcasts were sitting on store shelves while customers were buying the other two and getting a \"free\" DVD player built in.",

If you rip your own games, don't buy used, don't resell your cart after ripping it, there is no risk of ban.  \n\nCarts have individually identifiable serials. If your serial doesn't appear on multiple consoles (IE you ripped your games so you can keep your physical carts at home) Nintendo has no way to detect you are using a MIG.  \n\nEveryone that is getting banned is because of piracy, not self dumping. There may be an edge case of someone buying a dumped used cart whose keys got shared online, but that is now a real risk of buying Switch games used, even if Nintendo doesn't admit it.",

That's how rumors work in general. Lol.\n\n> There's a large number of possible lies someone could invent.\n>\n> ...\n> \n> The probability that any one person invents a specific lie (say, story S) is P(S), and it's small.\n\nIn any focused niche, the space of plausible lies is tiny (e.g. obviously nobody will claim \"I used a piracy cart so Nintendo made my Switch 2 explode into flames with a remote update\" or \"I never used any piracy stuff and only played my own brand new games but Nintendo bricked my system on purpose anyway for no reason!\"), people will converge on the same rumors cuz again, that's how rumors work. The combinatorial space of all \"possible lies someone could invent\" is irrelevant, we aren't randomly sampling from that space: humans don\u2019t roll a cosmic d20 or quantum RNG to generate fabrications, they copy what\u2019s trending, what\u2019s emotionally satisfying or what they half remember from someone else.\n\n\"P(S)\" can be enormous once a rumor is circulating (often close to 1 among the sub-community exposed to it, e.g. PizzaGate). Just making up 1% makes no sense, in fact the whole crux of this argument is baked into assuming P(S) is 0.01.\n\nPlugging a made-up tiny P(S) into a textbook independence formula is just cargo-cult math in this case. \n\nIf P(S) \u2248 0.8 because everyone\u2019s seen the same Reddit thread, P(S)^5 \u2248 0.33... which is utterly ordinary for example. Change the premise to a less cartoonishly assumed one and the \u201castronomy\u201d disappears.\n\n> Which leaves only two realistic possibilities:\n>\n> 1. They coordinated the lie in advance (collusion), or\n>\n> 2. At least one person is telling the truth.\n\nNope this is a false dichotomy, there are ample other possibilities like a rumor cascade, karma farming, just plain trolling and so on.\n\nThe most important telltale sign is that without knowing how many mod-chip users exist and how many bricks have actually been verified, frequency claims are empty... I.e. you are basically just pulling this out of your ass. \n\nTl;Dr this is just the \"THERE ARE MILLIONS OF UFO REPORTS, IT ONLY TAKES ONE TO BE TRUE FOR ALIENS TO BE REAL, YOU'RE SAYING THEY ARE ALL LYING?\" argument repackaged.",

It wouldn't get banned unless two switches were both running the same unique ID at the same time. So the product could result in a non-compromises switch running an authentic cart because the person who dumped the cart also happened to be online.\n\n\nDef recommend hacking your old switch though, trivially easy, running mods is cool, and Nintendo internet is dogshit anyways. If you're playing to play with friends online, not as worth it, but at least with the switch 1, you can isolate custom firmware from original firmware and just boot into regular mode. This is how a lot of streamers who play modded stuff operate, because also visual mods are less likely to get hit, it's mostly just been inauthentic unique ids. For pirated games, there's usually only the original dump, so everyone is running around with the same game ID, which makes it easier to flag.",

I can get why someone would rather get something like an MIG over trying to set up something like an environment that lets you have both the sysNAND and emuNAND environment .. but at the same time it comes off to me as people who are willing to take shortcuts and compromise their actual console/accounts just for one of the more obvious gains from what homebrew tends to motivate (sailing the high seas).\n\nAt least that I've heard, there are already holes found in the Switch 2 but it hasn't exactly led to anything super-fruitful yet .. but I'm under the impression that using the MIG will make it that much more obvious for Nintendo since they've been watching that thing for ages from even the original Switch (in fact, something similar happened with the 3DS where successive updates for \"stability\" would actually render DS and 3DS flashcarts as unreadable/unusable until the users spoofed the cartridges anyways).\n\nFor the people still trying to use the MIG with the Switch 2, it might as well be the equivalent of walking around with a \"KICK ME\" shirt and those people wondering why they're getting kicked.",

Nobody else is this draconian. If you mod a PS3/4/5  and later clear it off and update Sony doesn't ban you. The console will only get banned if you are actively running a modded system online. To retroactively ban a system that has ever been modified offline is a massive overreach IMO, and I'll tell you why.\n\nLet's say I have a Switch 2. I use a MiG switch once or twice offline, never connect it to the internet. Years later I factory reset it and sell it on, having no idea what's going to happen to the future owner. They buy it, take it home, use it for a day or two. What happens? Well because I used a MiG switch in it once or twice 5 years ago their new console (and potentially account by then) gets banned. They plead their case with Nintendo only to be told to pound sand.\n\nThis policy doesn't hurt MiG switch users primarily, it hurts people who later get screwed by Nintendo by buying Switch 2 consoles that are either already banned or imminently going to be if taken online.",

I'm not insulting your intelligence, people can and do use it in this way, I'm one of them. \n\nThe entire point of this article is that Nintendo is banning consoles for using it for piracy, and when it's being used for legitimate purchases games. No one would object to people using it for piracy getting banned. It's the people that aren't using it for piracy catching bans that is the entire issue. \n\nYou can put your fingers in your ears, close your eyes, and go \"lalalalalalalala I'm not listening lalalalalalala\" all you want. But that doesn't make you right. You are, in fact, being a Nintendo bootlicker. People using it legitimately, are getting banned. They weren't on the original switch. That's the point despite your attempt to suggest otherwise.",

Even the OG Switch homebrew scene had a whole workaround where you set up a second run environment on your device and only did homebrew stuff on that, so you still had a clean \"official\" firmware if you wanted to play online.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, I have zero interest in playing any of the Switch games online. I'm not a Splatoon kinda guy, and if I wanna play the new open world game, I'll be doing it solo anyway. Mario Kart is fun, but it only holds my interest for so long. I like Pokemon but I'm far past the point where I'm gonna chase a complete pokedex, and I don't have any friends to battle with, so again, swing and a miss.\n\nIf there's a legit working flash cartridge that I could use to skirt around that ludicrous $80 price tag, not being able to play online would be the smallest price I could ever pay. Then again, once they find a way to put custom firmware on the thing, it's a simple matter to manually update official firmware to make sure you can play the latest games, and you won't even *need* a flash card.\n\nI know Nintendo is trying to make the online play with discord voice chat some huge deal, but I'm not buying into it. I'm here to play Donkey Kong and whatever new Zelda and Animal Crossing and Kirby and hopefully a new Bayonetta and Astral Chain.

Hell, violently expelling someone from your home is not even vigilante justice. Self-defense is not vigilantism.\n\nLocking someone _else's_ doors, throwing them out of _their_ house, or locking up _their_ belongings when you caught a whiff that they were doing something bad-- even illegal-- in it, on just the basis that you built the house originally before you sold it to them, that's certainly vigilante justice, though. That's not _Nintendo's_ Switch any more that Nintendo's hobbling.\n\nYes, it's Nintendo's network that the Switch is being denied access to, but that gets to my other point, that the obligations are murkier (at least for the sake of argument-- everything's allowed with a EULA, but what's in the EULA is the point of contention) when the hardware is so irrevocably married to the software and the service, to the degree that the hardware-- paid for in full-- loses significant bullet-point functionality when it's kicked off the network post-sale.\n\nIf you had the choice to run Nintendo accounts and Nintendo's store by Nintendo's rules, or Off-Brand Bob's Switch-compatible Account with Off-Brand Bob's Switch-compatible Software on Off-Brand Bob's rules, or even load your own OS onto it and just use the hardware you bought, that'd be an entirely different matter. There'd actually be a highway in Nintendo's \"our way or the highway\" ultimatum, and fair play to them. The user would still have full, practical use of the hardware they bought, regardless of anyone's post-sale decisions. If the only way you can actually use the WiFi hardware you bought is if Nintendo's on the other end of the connection letting you, or the only way to set up a device is by begging Nintendo for a thumbs-up during setup, that's effectively yanking what's already been sold, after the fact. While it's *by way of* refusing to interact, accessing paid-for features at all depends on the interaction. That dependency is not a necessity or a natural consequence. That was a decision Nintendo made.\n\nAnd I'm not advocating for software piracy. If I'm reading the article right, this thing (does? could?) trip when you have a peripheral plugged in-- a peripheral not made by Nintendo, not necessarily containing pirated IP, maybe not even containing any of Nintendo's IP at all.",

The idea of \"They aren't obligated to allow you\" is kind of goofy-- they need not \"allow\" in the first place. I'm not saying they should jump when they aren't. I'm saying they shouldn't when they are. They don't need to do a single thing when something happens that's none of their business. They _are_ doing something when someone plugs one piece of not-their-hardware into another piece of not-their-hardware, though. They're not obligated to do that, and they can be criticized for doing so.",

This ban is specifically targeted at people using flash carts or jailbreaking systems. Two things used almost exclusively for piracy. Sure maybe like 4 people who can\u2019t use digital games and also need to have every single cartridge they own on them at all times now have to spend an extra $15 on a case that holds 48 cartridges. But 99% of the people affected by this policy are doing something illegal.\n\nNintendo is not obligated to wait until after people pirate their games and then launch full investigations and lawsuits to stop them. That is an absurd expectation. Nintendo is not waiting until they suspect people of piracy and then just banning them. That would be totally unacceptable and illegal. Nintendo is saying in their terms of service, \u201cthese are programs and devices used almost exclusively for questionable purposes. You are not allowed to use them AND retain access to our online services. If you do we will block your switch from online services.\u201d That is completely different from what you are saying they are doing and totally acceptable.\n\n>a blanket prohibition on third-party peripherals is well into the \"None of Nintendo's business\" category.\n\nCmon, dude. It\u2019s fine to not be informed about this issue, but if you\u2019re going to formulate an opinion about it at least do 5 or 10 minutes of research. Nintendo is not doing this. There is no blanket prohibition of third party peripherals. I have no idea where you came up with that idea. The console just came out like two weeks ago and there are already a ton of third party peripherals. They all work fine and no one is getting their Switches banned over them. Literally the only peripheral I can fine that is getting people banned are the flash carts.",

If there weren't things like firmware signing that keep you from using the device with another provider, it'd be perfectly reasonable to say that if you don't like Nintendo or Nintendo doesn't like you, you're free to walk. If there's practically nowhere to \"walk\" to, though, because any software or service has to be blessed by the hardware manufacturer, there's a case to be made that refusing to provide services that provide basic bullet-point functionality is not just opting out, but is taking away what the buyer already bought and paid for.\n\nIt's kind of like when car manufacturers tie features like remote starting into a cellular-connected app, then plead that *of course* they should get control and recurring revenue off of it, because connection is a cost and updating the app is a service they provide, ignoring that they're the ones who chose to tie the features solely to that infrastructure when options like IR or RF remotes were entirely viable fallbacks.",

If Nintendo denies a user access to update the firmware on their device, thus preventing them from playing newer software titles, they're still in essence limiting the device that the consumer owns, and that seems like a pretty clear conflict with EU law.\n\nI'm no lawyer, and not even an EU citizen, so take it with a grain of salt, but based on what I've read about their consumer protection laws and simple logic, it's a fairly easy conclusion to come to. They might be able to ban you from online play if you modify the software/firmware or are using an unauthorized device because it could enable cheating, and preventing you from cheating in online play is one thing, but locking you out from purchasing eshop titles, updating your firmware, or even sharing virtual game cards with your friends would be another entirely.",

They've done it to other international companies that are just as large, and all have capitulated, because they know that losing the EU market would mean a massive hit to their bottom line and a huge backlash against them in public sentiment for being shitty.\n\nThis is not just a US circuit court. This is the EU, comprising multiple nations, and they've set a precedent in the past that they do NOT give a shit who you are. If you try and pull some shitty business practice that will hurt the consumer, they'll give you one chance to reverse course or be run out of town.",

Or if a DLC comes out for the new Pok\u00e9mon game. You can't buy it or download it because you have no access to the eShop.\n\nAdditionally, you might also lose access to some Switch 1 games, which requires updates. I've seen people say that MK8, Captain Toad and both Zeldas require a update to play. If you're banned, you can't download the update and, thus, can't play these games.",

          "body": "99% percent of the time that wording is used specifically as some kind of legalese protection to skirt around potential prosecution. Just look at the OG Switch custom firmware situation for a prime example. When it was first cracked, there was an opensource community custom firmware that very publicly stated they didn't support use of their firmware for piracy and forbade discussion of it. There was also a company that sold a closed source firmware and boot device to enable it, and their firmware very specifically included software *intended* to dump cartridges and install pirated games. The gentleman in charge of the second example found himself arrested, charged, and fined millions of dollars, among other consequences. The former was able to continue on unscathed. Of course, despite the official stance that they didn't support piracy, others were able to look at the source code and create software that enabled dumping and installing of games, and thus it was possible, and still is. \n\nThe manufacturers probably phrase it specifically so on their site to put some distance between themselves and those that would use the card for piracy. If the card itself doesn't enable the dumping of games then it's a pretty solid cover. They can simply advertise it as a way to put multiple dumped titles on a single card for easy transport and play when you're traveling/on the go so you don't have to fumble around to take out and put in a new game card and put the other one back in a storage case or what have you. Just put all your owned games on one single card that you can use to swap between them on the fly and not have to carry a case of games with you in addition to the system.\n\nAn article discussing the product has to phrase things this way to avoid defamation lawsuits from the company. We all know what the more likely use of the product is, but if they're not enabling game dumping and advertising their product as simply a way to combine and transport multiple games that you already own, someone calling it a piracy device would open themselves up to legal action.\n\nIt's simply the world we live in.",

Of course they won't be up *forever*, but for now, their track record is pretty good.\n\n[Edit: As a comparison, Steam is only ~5 years older than the Wii store]\n\n> As far as a portable console goes, I\u2019m really only willing to buy games if I can play them indefinitely. \n\nYes, because removing access to games played on a computer or a living room console is much more ok than doing so for a handheld...\n\nWe see from your history that you won't buy a Switch 2 because you're mad about the stance they're taking on piracy, why are you still interacting with these news at all?",

This is the same system they use to stop people from running homebrew, cheats for online games, or pirated games. But, this would also be an incredibly stupid descision that wouldn't really benefit them in any way.\n\nIf they just remove it from the store, that only means that you can't buy or download it anymore. If you already have it downloaded, it should still work as long as you don't delete or uninstall it. But, you may not be able to move it to another console if yours breaks or you decide to upgrade. If you have a (true) physical copy, then the base game lives on the cart, and it should work as long as it's plugged in, but you will still be missing a lot of content from DLCs and any updates that weren't pushed to the cart before it was taken down.\n\nBut what others are talking about is that nowadays the physical cart basically just has a web installer and a physical activation key on it, and not a functional copy of the game. The web installer is just a shortcut to downloading the game from the store, and the activation key basically just tells DRM that you \"own\" the game as long as the cart's plugged in. So, if the game was removed from the store and you plug that cart into a console that doesn't already have the game installed, it won't be able to do the download. In this case it \"feels\" like having a physical copy of the game, but functionally it's just a shortcut to a digital download that could potentially disappear.",

Of the top 10 best selling consoles the only thing close to a current console is the switch, sitting comfortably in 3rd place. \n\nNot only that, but the more hardcore gamers are kinda desensitized to being fucked over by the industry these days. And during the last few console generations most of those gamers moved to xbox, PS, or even PC while nintendo tried to uphold a \"family fun for everyone\" attitude with weaker \"more affordable\" hardware. Which leaves most of current nintendo players in two camps: normies ala \"bought switch to play animal crossing during covid\" and nintendo ~~meatriders~~ fans, both of which don't really care much about the rest of the industry and are only now facing these realities. So it's less that people are acting like nintendo did it first, more that this is their first time eating a shit sandwich. \n\nand there *was* outrage over price raises from xbox/sony for online services, price raises for games, and over physical media not actually physically containing the media. I'm not much of a console player in general and even I was aware of these outrages. \n\nand on top of that we all know that $70 new games from everyone else will eventually find themselves at reduced prices, but $70 nintendo games will always be $70 until the system reaches EOL.\n\nthere's at least a tad more nuance than simply \"to reddit, it's never a problem until Nintendo does it\"... but yeah seeing the response to nintendo following xbox/PS footsteps makes me wish there was a similar/stronger reaction when those first started with some of this BS.",

This is the most surprised Pikachu face thing I've seen people complain about. Don't get me wrong, the fact that Nintendo's cutting off network connection makes it very difficult if not impossible to recover is pretty nasty, but the fact that this thing triggers that reaction is the least surprising thing ever.",

I\u2019ve seen people mentioning that this was happening on consoles when the 360 was out, which is true. The difference then was that an online ban didn\u2019t potentially deny access to most of your game library. You can spend a lot of money, get an online ban and it\u2019s just entirely gone. Until you buy another Switch of course, which is the reason they are console banning and leaving accounts alone.",

I don't know if that's for every game or just once, but if this is supposed to be a form of software activation then I'd expect it for every game.\n\nAlso, every Switch 2 game comes with firmware that the console will install before you can play. So their approach seems to be that someone might get away with piracy for a while, but then they're stuck once they try to play something new.",

I'm mainly explaining their thought process. Understanding through dialogue does not necessarily equal agreement and endorsement.\n\nThose who do these feel they're within their rights to do whatever they want with their purchases, including making backups of their physical copies, legalities notwithstanding. I believe it's fine in EU at least. The mig switch, in their thinking, is simply their way of using property they rightly own.\n\nNowhere did I claim that they should not be banned. Nintendo is well within their rights to block them from using their online services, provided the penalties are cleay stated. The device itself remains perfectly usable for playing with the mig, and any switch 2 games that have the full game on them which should be perfectly legal for most jurisdictions.",

You bought physical now live with the limitations of the physical games. You get to carry them around and have to manually switch them out.

When Tears of the Kingdom leaked, streamers immediately jumped at the chance to run the leaked copy on emulators. This, naturally, gave Switch emulators a major boost in popularity. With how litigious Nintendo is known to be, the community was playing with fire, and they got burnt. If I\u2019m Nintendo, I don\u2019t give a single shit about game preservation reasons if people are using these emulators to pirate and play games a week before they\u2019re released.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to justify Nintendo\u2019s actions, but people need to quit pretending that these emulators weren\u2019t being used to pirate new and unreleased games.",

It's been a frequent complaint for decades at this point how many older games Nintendo just won't release for any new consoles. People are already playing roms of these games on their PCs, but they may also want to use their new Nintendo systems to play them. \n\nI haven't actually used one of these game cartriges that stores downloaded games before, but I have played roms on my PC of old Nintendo games that were never re-released, like Ogre Battle 64, which I also own on the N64. If they ever released it on the switch, I would buy it in a heartbeat, but Nintendo, for whatever reason, has tons of games they just never want to let people play on a newer system.",

The MIG was legit just a nice convenience I didn't expect to be so controversial. I'm just your average gamer who heard about it from a YouTuber and decided to give it a try.\n\nBut yeah, the Switch 2 will be safely moddable eventually.

But if they're so stingy about it, then really the best options are 1) not buy it at all, and just emulate their games (in which case, there's little point in buying them) or 2) get a modded console and use it as a homebrew/piracy machine.

Personally I think that should be on the account level not the system level though, since what happens when someone else buys the console used. But I have no issue with them banning accounts off there online service. \n\nIt\u2019s not only a Nintendo\u2019s money thing it\u2019s also a user experience thing. Say you\u2019re using this mig flash cart but it\u2019s a modified game rather than a straight copy of yours. Now let\u2019s say it makes it so in a shooter game you can auto aim or see through walls, all of a sudden you now have someone exploiting the game an making the experience worse for everyone else. If you ever played a multiplayer game where there are clearly cheater it\u2019s clearly a poor experience when there are enough of them.\n\nWith this said they did have language in there terms of service to brick the console fully, I think the second that happens even once someone needs to harass there government and sue the, and get some reasonable laws in place, remote bricking something you paid for in general if the assumption you will own with no lease agreement seems like a clearly bs thing.",

AND it wasn't nintendo that started that crap! for literal decades game discs, especially for consoles with DVD drives, have literally been just a key on them and the whole game downloaded from the internet. i remember buying portal on PC with the orange box and literally the only thing on the disc was an installer for steam. every single game that i bought came with a code i had to enter manually after i installed steam. and then when i bought portal again on xbox 360 literally the same thing happened again, there was no game on the physical disc, just a license file, and the entire game downloaded from Microsofts servers. even though the game was downloaded entirely on my 360s hard drive, i still had to put the disc in the drive to play it. absolutely no difference between that disc and the switch 2 key-carts. i remember games in that same generation and the next where only the first part of the game was actually on the disc and the rest had to be downloaded. it would allow you to play the fist maybe half hour of the game while the rest downloaded in the background, but if you had a slow internet connection and it didn't finish by the time you finished playing the content on the disc, to bad you had to wait.",

Now they submit patents after filing lawsuits, and nitpick how their users use the devices they've purchased from them.\n\nI don't use Apple devices because of their oppressive environment either.

If I\u2019m selling as an unlocked switch; will I be good to show the serial number in the eBay listing?\n\nLike, even if I don\u2019t sell it as an unlocked switch, there\u2019s still a chance of the above happening. Is there anything I can do in this regard?\n\nI\u2019ve never hacked my switch myself, I\u2019m in the UK and it\u2019s on the latest firmware if any of that matters",
