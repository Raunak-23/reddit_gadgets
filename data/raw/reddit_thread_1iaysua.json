              "body": "A battery runs at basically a steady voltage (usually referred to as the nominal voltage). It technically varies a little over the discharge cycle, but batteries are designed to spend the maximum amount of time in a big relatively flat area of their voltage vs. charge curve.\n\nAnd that same voltage is required to charge it (by forcing electron flow to go in the opposite direction and reversing the chemical reaction that releases energy when you use the battery).\n\nFor a big scale example, our car has an 800V battery pack. If we were to plug into a 400V fast charger somewhere while on a road trip, the car has to somehow convert that 400V DC into 800V DC in order charge the battery. (EDIT: And it has a very clever way of doing that using the inverters for the rear wheel motors.)\n\nThe charging limit in discussion here isn't about charging speed (though limiting charging speed also helps prolong battery life), it's about charge percentage \u2014 how much the reaction has proceeded in one way or the other.\n\nLithium batteries tend to be happiest to be around 50% charge, according to most of what I've read. But that's not very practical for a device you want to use. So a lot of folks charge up to 80% and stop there. It's full enough to get you through most daily usage, but still saves wear on the battery by not charging that last 20%.\n\nUsing our car as an example again, we don't charge it to 100% when we're just using it for commuting, errands, and local travel. Just up to 80. And we try to keep from going below 20%. (Not a hard rule, of course, and road trips see us charging higher and going lower sometimes.)\n\nWith something like the Steam Deck, if you're using it docked or plugged in a lot, it'll really save on the battery to not charge above 80. (And you can always remove the limit before travel or expected heavy use days.)",

                  "body": "> Lithium batteries tend to be happiest to be around 50% charge, according to most of what I've read. But that's not very practical for a device you want to use\n\nYeah this is correct, although within about 30-70% (+/- 20% either side of 50%) there's negligible impact to the point it's not even worth considering. So in an ideal world we'd keep all our usage in that range, but obviously that means we can only use 40% of the capacity which is quite wasteful\n\nBetween that and 20-80% (+/- 30% from 50%) there's a *little* impact, but it's pretty small. It's not zero or negligible, but it's still low enough that it's not really worth worrying about - and gets us up to 60% of the capacity being useable, which is a good compromise for day-to-day usage for most devices. This is where the \"80% charge limit, try to put it on charge when you get to 20%\" best-practice comes from\n\nOnce you get up to 10-90%, though (+/- 40% from 50%) then there's quite a noticeable impact on longevity/degradation. There's still a noticeable benefit vs using the full 0-100% charge capacity, but it's really starting to ramp up\n\nAnd then 0-100% gives you the worst possible degradation, which can be somewhat mitigated with charging strategies (charging slower, managing voltage and heat, minimising charge speed at the extremes of range etc etc) but still isn't ideal\n\nThe result of considering all of the above is that 20-80% is generally the \"best of both\" range - you still get a good amount of the maximum possible run time but it's pretty gentle on the battery. Pushing to 15-85% or 10-90% work too, but you start getting a more noticeable impact. Limiting it to 25-75% or 30-70% has benefits but not really enough to be worth limiting your run time for",

But for those of us who do care, it's nice to have this option because it means I *don't* have to carefully nurse the battery and eg remove it from charge myself.

And so I use it because it has no noticeable impact to my day to day use of my device at all.\n\nI do ***not*** use this feature on my phone - I paid for the whole battery, and I'll use it.

          "body": "It's kinda both\n\nModern devices do manage the battery better than in the days of yore, but they have to strike a balance between battery longevity (years/cycles) vs battery life (hours per charge). Therefore while they do reserve some space at the top and, particularly, the bottom of their charge range, they also still provide most of that charge range to the user.\n\nWhich is to say, you can probably actually charge from something like ~5-10% up to ~98% of the battery's actual charge range (reserving more at the bottom because discharging to true-0% is much worse for the battery's long term health than charging to true-100%), depending on the use case and specific chemistry of the battery\n\nThat's fine, it gives an acceptable compromise - you reduce the risk of the battery becoming damaged by entirely discharging, and get noticeably better longevity in exchange for ~5-10% reduction in battery life. It removes most of the bigger risks and causes of the worst degradation, without wasting a ton of battery life.\n\nBut there's still an optimal range within that - from about 20% to 80% of the battery's charge range - whereby you get even better battery longevity... at the cost of losing 40% of your battery. In an ideal world this makes your battery last longer, but you have to compromise quite a lot in exchange. Your battery might last for 1200 cycles instead of 500, but you lose 1 hour from your 2h30 gaming time. That's too much of a compromise for most users, who would rather have that battery available to them\n\nWhat many manufacturers are starting to do is offer the user the ability to *optionally* charge to either 80% or \"100%\" (minus the bit that's always reserved). This allows the user to choose between \"I'm near power today or not planning to use my full battery anyway, and prefer to preserve battery health/longevity\", or \"I'm on a plane and want maximum runtime, I'm happy to take the tiny hit on battery health today\", depending on their use case\n\nA car is a great example of this - I drive an EV with a range of about 300 miles, but 99% of the time it's doing maybe 10-50 miles in a day. So 99% of the time I'm perfectly happy limiting my charge to 80% and putting the car on charge before it gets to 20%. Sure, that gives me an effective range of about 180 miles (220-240 if I need to go below 20% unexpectedly) instead of 300... but if I'm only going 30 miles, who cares?\n\nBut I don't want my car to limit me to 240 miles ALL the time, because on the days that I am doing a long journey I'd much prefer to do a one-off charge to 100% and have 300 miles available that day\n\nThe same applies to phones, consoles, and pretty much anything else - the user probably wants the *option* to use the full battery when they need it, but most users will prefer to protect their battery health a lot of the time too, when they don't need the maximum runtime.",

Both for tech support and physically literally haha. \nImho also i can't exactly call a laptop a pc, not like a desktop machine at least.\n  \nLike i said, i expect the only power that is actively going on a properly shutdown laptop, steamdeck, tablets, phone or a desktop amongst other devices to be the tiniest amount necessary to only use the power button which engages everything else. Maybe a whopping two whole buttons like a steamdeck to alternative power on in a bios/boot menu mode...  \n  \nNothing else, no other lingering data, no processes nor connectivity whatsoever. So if a battery drains fast while properly shutdown, that doesn't sound right to me.\n  \nPs, Physical switches are just a neat extra step/option to ensure that one can physically disconnects a powersource to enforce a true off off.",
