I am having a hard time justifying a like for like side grade (800$) over just getting a big screen beyond 2.\n\nthis is one of those things people who haven't tried using vr as a display, or even modern vr in generally can't wrap their heads around, they are VERY capable of replacing monitors, in the case of bsb, it would hit around 100-150 nits at max, with a normal limit of 70~ nits, and reviewer's who didn't know ahead of time had no idea it wasn't hdr, for me to get the same class of monitor as that costs around 1500-3000$ and because it would be static instead of constantly shifting pixels (like with a hmd and you shifting your body slightly all the time) burn in will happen regardless of what you get, but it would take a hell of alot longer with a dim/far less heat producing oled in a light controlled environment.\n\nnow, keep i mind, if apple vision can math the quality of their reference monitor, at least image quality wise, they can produce it for cheaper, sell it cheaper, and expand the ecosystems.\n\nand this is the major thing people don't understand because of current vr reporting, the first company that gets mass adoption will add several trillion to their market cap, people with any amount of future vision see it for what it is, they just cant predict when, facebook is trying as hard as possible to brute force it, I would argue bsb is already there but the buy in cost is a hard swallow for someone who is new. \n\nI honestly believe the thing that would sell people on vr more than anything else, would be a 2 person demo, one person is across the store, and you are seated on a ok couch in an otherwise crappy apartment, put the vr on and you have 3 modes, full pass through, well furnished apartment, and theater mode, and your friend is right next to you. watch the same show, movie, or hell just play a game with each other, that would be what sells it for normal people to make it their everyday life thing. \n\nthink of it this way, at 1/3 or less the cost of a high end tv, you can get better than a high end tv, and that's just current pricing, realistically, we will hit a point where optics are at their peak and you can't really get better, we are already kind of there where people with access to pimax 8k and bsb2 choose bsb2 over pimax even though pimax is objectively better on all other specs, because how good the optics are in bsb2, at that point the panels are just a module, see pimax as an example of that, where the upgrade comes from a new module, and at that point you are talking about 2 1 inch displays, you may not know this but most of the cost for a display is all in the fact you can only get so many of them off one sheet of motherglass, you would get around 1300 displays, or 650 sets of vr displays in a sings 800$ 55 inch motherglass space. if we hit the point that vr is everywhere, the prices for certain aspects for them will become a 1 time cost, and then crashing for everything else to become a commodity.",

I honestly don\u2019t see it coming, VR just generally is one of those things that sounds amazing until you realize that your phone or tablet or laptop is more practical to use.  Even gaming, which is by far its most mainstream use, has struggled to get all that big in the scheme of things.\n\nI also honestly think it\u2019s more than just needing a killer app. The technology itself has a lot of baked in inherent problems for average consumers:  \n\nIt\u2019s *always* going to be isolating and require everyone have a headset on to share experiences; it\u2019s *always* going to have battery issues; it\u2019s *always* going to cause people to feel like the person wearing it is isolated from everyone around them; it\u2019s *always* going to mess with your appearance; it\u2019s *always* going to be less convenient to carry with you than a phone or a laptop/tablet; it\u2019s *always* going to have input limitations.  \n\nThese are things which can\u2019t simply be iterated away because they\u2019re fundamental to how the technology works.  They can be improved, but not *removed.*\n\nPass through can help the person wearing it feel less isolated, but it won\u2019t change the fact that people around them will want to see their actual eyes and know they have their attention when interacting.  Making them lighter and smaller can help with comfort and travel convenience, but battery packs will still have to be a thing and anything shaped like goggles or glasses will be harder to fit into a bag or your pocket than a laptop or phone.  \n\nBy the time you solve enough of these problems sufficiently to go mainstream, and basically come out with smart glasses, you have a a very different product that will be severely compromised in many of the things VR headsets try to accomplish.  I\u2019m convinced VR is just a stepping stone to AR for mainstream consumers, and that it *will* remain a fairly niche technology.  \n\nAnd even then, I think they may well struggle to gain mass adoption.  People absolutely *loathe* wearing anything on their face, many will prefer sticking plastic lenses in their eyes over wearing glasses *to be able to fucking see.*  It\u2019ll have to offer a lot for consumers to get over that inherent problem.",

To go line by line:\n\n>Isolation isn't even necessarily a barrier to mass adoption considering headphones can't be shared and are used by a billion+ users worldwide.\n\nThe key difference is that you can easily just change audio sources to output sound through your speakers when you want to share music or video.  That is definitionally impossible with VR experiences, you either need to be wearing a headset yourself or hand your headset to someone else.\n\nYou can't iterate out of that problem, it's baked into the technology.\n\n>Battery life could be solved with unforeseen breakthroughs in battery technology. \n\n We **are** getting breakthroughs in battery technology all the time, and they are used to power devices that demand more power than ever. Battery iteration isn't isolated from all other product iteration.\n\n A breakthrough that is so large it makes sticking long-lasting batteries into something as necessarily power-hungry and lightweight as a headset is just shy of \"cold fusion\" territory. It's possible, but either so far away or so speculative that it's not really worth talking about.\n\n You're going to be dealing with a short battery life, and/or the need for wires/packs, for the foreseeable future.\n\n>Future improvements to Vision Pro's EyeSight display can enable people to feel like the user is not isolated from them.\n\nYou're dealing with deeply ingrained issues of instinct and cultural norms.  People *want to see your eyes,* not representations of them, and to know that they have your undivided attention.  This is not going to change anytime soon, and better feeds of your eyeballs projected onto a screen won't really fix that. \n\nYou're going to need to be taking them off whenever you interact with people unless you want to get the same reaction that you would when chatting while staring at your phone or computer screen.  Which is a pain in the fucking ass for something strapped to your head.  Speaking of...\n\n>Messing with appearance, perhaps with regards to eye makeup, but messing with the hair will be solved as they slim down.\n\nEye makeup, yes, but also foundation smudging off is going to be an issue after a while of use.  You're probably going to develop a ring around where the goggles rest.\n\nHair is the biggie, though, and it's not going to be solved by \"slimming down\" anything due to the need for a strap going around you head.  A lot of hairstyles will simply be a non-starter for use with headsets since it will just squish them down, and any time you have to put a strap around your head it's going to mess up your hair getting it off.\n\nThere's no iterating yourself out of that issue, it's a matter of physics.\n\n>There isn't much need to carry them with you like a phone - they are meant to be stationary devices.\n\nAre they, though?  Because certainly that's not how Apple has tried to sell their headset.  Use when traveling especially has been a major part of their pitch.  \n\n>Input limitations exist for phones too. They are very slow and bad at productivity and multi-tasking. \n\nLimitations, sure, but I just fundamentally do not agree that it's remotely comparable.  It's been clear since Blackberry fucking imploded in the late 2000s that digital keyboards aren't actually a real problem for most consumers, and large chunks of people at this point literally prefer to do as much of their computing on their phones/tablets. \n\nMeanwhile headsets just do not have any workable method of input other than physical accessories, or the holographic garbage that Apple tried to make work on the first Vision Pro. \n\n>VR/AR combined with future EMG advancements has the potential to leapfrog all other forms of input in speed, multi-tasking, efficiency.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you're expecting me to take \"EMG advancements\" seriously as a possible solution to this then we're back in \"cold fusion\" territory.  \n\nIt further solidifies my impression that people who think VR is going to take off are kind of stuck in a mindset that refuses to admit it hasn't turned out to be the magical wonder technology that Sci-Fi stories depicted.    \n\n(And once again, I think AR glasses are a different story and more likely to take off...but they're also different product entirely, that VR is a stepping stone towards)",

Desktops and laptops remain by a large margin the productivity device of choice.\n\nYou say Vision Pro's input is garbage, but a common sentiment among those that have tried Vision Pro is that it's the most personable personal computer they've used, to such a degree that people describe it almost like mind reading because of how seamless the eye-tracked interface is. The speed leaves a lot to be desired, and that's why I mentioned EMG. Time will tell how far EMG goes, but if the potential is fully realized then it would leapfrog over not just smartphones but the age-old mouse and keyboard that is considered the fastest input we've invented.\n\nIf it goes smoothly, EMG will allow a user to type with their hands in their pockets or resting behind their head while lying down in bed at faster speeds than a physical keyboard with much less effort than either physical or touchscreen typing since you'd barely be moving your hands and fingers, perhaps not even moving at all.\n\nThese things have been demonstrated. It's physically possible. The question is how can this generalize to the wider population, be affordable, be mass producible, and so on? That's the tough part.\n\n> And it further solidifies my impression that people who think VR is going to take off are kind of stuck in a mindset that refuses to admit it hasn't turned out to be the magical wonder technology that Sci-Fi stories depicted.\n\nI mean if you look at Ready Player One as a basis, then all of the hardware already exists in places like Meta and Apple's labs, usually relegated to separate prototypes. So it's physically possible to eventually get there. Funnily enough on the software side I've already experienced every experience and activity described in the Ready Player One book and movie - that's already happening today, just at a much lower fidelity and scale.",

Also frankly most people just don\u2019t like wearing things on their face.\n\nAnd I think this is an issue even AR glasses with struggle with breaking through.  People don\u2019t like wearing glasses *when they need them to see anything,* and you\u2019re expecting them to wear your product?  I think AR glasses are more likely to go mainstream, but even then I think there\u2019s a good chance they just\u2026don\u2019t.

I expect it's the same for Apple.\n\nI personally expect both will have mass appeal in the 2030s as VR/MR headsets will be very capable computing devices for productivity and media as well as social, entertainment, and fitness devices with major advantages over TVs/Phones/Consoles. AR glasses will in theory eventually allow for people to do everything they already do on a phone in a more convenient and faster format and it would be an audiovisual AI assistant for almost any task, a navigator, and a capable computing and media device, and could potentially allow superhuman vision and hearing.",

(And I'm sure other stores have similar prices, unless you're going for OLED or something obscene like 100\" or some shit TVs are very inexpensive these days)\n\nHell, i have an MSI ULWHD curved gaming monitor and it was 700 bucks. Not even over a grand... Apple vision is more expensive than all the TVs and monitors in my house combined at this point lol",

The  iPod was simply one of the first MP3 players to hit the sweet spot for storage capacity, physical size, and nice user interface.\n\nA lot of people say that athe iPhone was the first smartphone, but even that isn't necessarily taking into account all the devices that came before it. There was devices like the Palm Treo incorporated things like a cell phone, PDA, and other functionality into a single device. The iPhone iterated on that and made it so much better, which is why it was so popular. But the demand was already there waiting for someone to have a clean interface.\n\nApple basically takes products that are well understood and creates better versions of them. But there is no existing device that's just a computing oriented VR headset. Even the market for VR headsets in general is rather small, and if you take out the gaming aspect, there just doesn't seem to be much of a use for them. Maybe in the professional market, for things like employee training or visualizing 3D environments but they don't seem to be focused on that too much either. Their entire focus seems to be a replacement for monitors while you are seated at your desk working on basic office applications and browsing the web.",

It\u2019s really not THAT big of a deal for me, vast majority of my use is in my sim rig for gt7 and as-is it\u2019s almost perfect for stationary use. I also understand the necessity for the cable, if only for power. An on-board power source would add heft to a, let\u2019s face it, already bulky hmd.\n- weight. Again, not REALLY an issue, for reasons I\u2019ll get into below weight isn\u2019t the most common factor for me coming out of headset and breaking immersion, but (I haven\u2019t looked at specs, nor do I have any other hmd experience to reference) the PSVR2 isn\u2019t exactly light. Even with the cable tether/lighter device it isn\u2019t something I find myself wearing for 2-3 hours at a clip\n- lack of spatial awareness. I totally love strapping into my rig and flipping the headset down and completely losing myself in gran turismo, it\u2019s so easy to lose myself in the game, which is good! Except sometimes I wish I could, like, see where a water bottle is or something. I envision a way to display some sort of marker in-headset to signify a specified location in the real world. It\u2019d be cool to be able to, like, stick a small sensor or something on a water bottle so I could see where it is. Longer sessions of drunks rock and gt7 are often interrupted by trying to find something in the real world more often than anything else. And I get that\u2019s a me problem, not a device/tech thing, but it\u2019s my biggest complaint.\n\nThat turned out longer than I thought.",

There wasn\u2019t anything specific I did, but there wasn\u2019t anything I couldn\u2019t do that I wanted to, and it worked pretty smoothly. I definitely noticed when I took it off, but then I also notice pain in my back and wrists after spending hours at my laptop.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you what any specific person will use a Vision product for, any more than I can tell you what your most important use-case for your laptop is. What I am comfortable saying is that whatever people want to use Vision products for, it will involve far less friction to access on an Apple Vision device than on any other current headset (it remains to be seen how smoothly Android XR works). This is what Apple is selling, and it is perennially undervalued by enthusiasts willing to put up with all sorts of hassles and roadblocks to do stuff with VR/MR.",

The Vision products are simply not for them, any more than a MacBook is designed for someone who enjoys compiling their own Linux kernel.\n\nPlease try to evaluate the AVP in the context of all the other products they\u2019ve ever created - Apple tries to build things that the average person uninterested in the guts of technology can just use. They charge a premium for that ease-of-use, and they actively try to create public desire for their products via pricing and the illusion of scarcity. \n\nAnd it\u2019s working once again - in the public\u2019s mind, the AVP is now positioned as crazily overpriced, but much higher-quality and desirable than the alternatives, like a Bentley SUV compared to Honda and Hyundai SUVs. If the price of a Bentley came down to 2x or 1.5x the price of a Honda CR-V, then a *lot* of people would be looking for a way to afford the Bentley. Apply this to consumer electronics and you have something that looks very much like what Apple\u2019s done in computers, mp3 players, phones, watches, headphones, tablets, smart speakers, set-top boxes, and now MR headsets.\n\nGiven that Apple successfully follows this playbook time and time again, it\u2019s kinda surprising to me that so few people seem to actually grasp this. Ive seen multiple generations of tech writers tie themselves in knots because they just can\u2019t grasp this basic concept.",

What these journalists fail to realize is that Apple had only enough parts for around 500k units to be manufactured in its first year, and that was because the supply chain for MicroOLED displays is still very immature. \n\nVR only had its first consumer run in the 1990s, as the 1980s days was purely enterprise and arcade solutions. After the small 1990s run, no one attempted VR again until the 2010s. Investment over time rather than time by itself is how technology matures, so it's no surprise that VR hasn't taken off yet since it's immature technology with a lot of future advancements cooking behind the scenes.\n\nThere is no expectation at Apple that AVP2 will be a hit. Perhaps not even AVP3, because that's the Pro line. Apple intends to release a non-Pro line at some point, and they're well aware that it will take multiple iterations to be a hit because the path to maturity is quite long.",
