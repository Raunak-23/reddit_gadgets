Not continue doing business as if the level of quality has remained the same. Especially not if the businesses \"outsourced\" are doing everything, and doing their best to keep the quality consistent, whilst being consistently undermined by the necessity to subsidize the now effectively superfluous business.\n\nAnd to be clear I do have some in mind when I say this but it is probably not who you think because it is complicated.\n\n\\---\n\nMore succinctly there are only so many OS' and many more manufacturers and those manufacturers make small parts that go in to the final devices, and that is like the early auto industry, but when the OS' are actually the same and are only being differentiated by legalese (or \"code\" which is exactly as superfluous as legalese) and effectively what is happening is, in addition to the quality going down, that quality is going down because quite literally what is happening is they are selling bits and pieces of what should be a whole, and charging a premium for that. Selling less for more and selling pieces that are [indivisible](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=r1gKk072c2Q&feature=shared).\n\nTech got too good too fast and the \"first sin\" was probably between Nintendo and Sony (and Sharp, etc)\\*. But their [same logic](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0tZQelavEklUqEarDo1phN) has been applied to the entire tech industry from beginning to \"the last mile\" and has from there infected the rest of society and well \\*gestures broadly\\*\n\n\\---\n\n^(Art makes the invisible visible.)\n\n^(Words and numbers are one thing, but art beats both.)\n\n^(Language and math can both be art but not all language or math is art.)\n\n\\---\n\nedit:\n\n^(\\*It goes back further than the modern tech industry, but it is complicated.)   \n  \n^(And even in that specific case attributing blame to certain companies does not explain) [^(the truth)](https://www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/1m76fvc/comment/n4sv2q6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)^(.)\n\n^(Because) [^(the problem is the same as it always is)](https://archive.org/stream/sinandsocietyan00rossgoog/sinandsocietyan00rossgoog_djvu.txt#:~:text=PREFACE,%20133)^(.)",
