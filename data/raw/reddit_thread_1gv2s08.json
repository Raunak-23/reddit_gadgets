It had a semi-transparent mirror that directed about 1/3rd of the light (~1/2 stop) to an SLR-style focus module, then the other 2/3rds to the main sensor, which provided a live view stream to an EVF. This meant you got DSLR-standard AF speed in both stills and video, which at the time was the desirable outcome.\n\nBut SLR focus is no longer the benchmark for AF. On-sensor phase detection allows mirrorless cameras to focus across most of the image (not just a few fixed points), and with tracking AF and now subject recognition, this is far more flexible and delivers a much higher hit rate than DSLRs could.\n\nIt sounds like you're proposing something slightly different: directing some of the light to an optical viewfinder, while also allowing some through to the sensor (which sounds more like Canon's Pellicle film SLR). I suspect you'd end up either with a viewfinder that was unacceptably dark or an AF system that struggled in anything less than perfect light.\n\nSLT was an interesting idea (and allowed the continued use of DSLR lenses) but it looks even more like a dead-end, now that mirrorless focus (and lenses designed to be focussed that way) is working at the very highest level.",
