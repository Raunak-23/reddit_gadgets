You\u2019re forgetting that children don\u2019t have the same pessimistic standards as people like you. Children still have magical experiences with things adults could care less about, and in the end, Nintendo is a company for children first and foremost. The camera is there for the kids that will have fun with it, and you as an adult can ignore it and have the exact same experience on your switch; I don\u2019t really see the issue here tbh",
