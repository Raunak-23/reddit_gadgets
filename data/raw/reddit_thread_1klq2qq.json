We see examples in the past and today of people being denied access to many, many things that will make them productive members of society, for lack of a better term. For ease of focus, I'm only talking medically. Everything from crutches to pacemakers to hearing aids.\n2. I linked an article about this exact subject. Read it. When the company deemed the medical devices allowing people to regain sight weren't profitable, they turned them off without warning. Want a more recent example? DOGE cut funding to a wide swath of medical research mid-study - many people are currently stuck with devices in them that don't work, unsure if they'll even be removed.\n3. I think you're missing the point. My original comment was that governments adore cutting social safety nets so that people have to look to private alternatives. It happens with medicine, it happens with hospitals, etc etc. You *cannot* talk about tech being beneficial without talking about access. So, if the government goes \"Hurray! Robot arms are a thing! Screw old prosthetics!\" well, guess what? Robot arms are fucking expensive and your funding (that your taxes cover!) doesn't cover the gap at best or straight up vanished at worst.\n4. So, now we're seeing in medicine what we see elsewhere: The rich don't break a sweat, the majority have to take on debt or worse - remember the guy who died *rationing his insulin*?\n\nWith that, I'm done saying the same thing in three different ways, respectfully. Have a great evening. Play, read or watch some sci-fi for increasingly prophetic takes on the near-future. I recommend Transmetropolitan.\n\n![gif](giphy|8GWsFYsl1dfjy)",

Maybe you're too pragmatic of a thinker and the miscommunication led to some friction.\n\nIn the question of 'is it agreeable to take away benefits from disabled people if they regain their ability\" *your* points would be a slippery slope fallacy. Slippery slopes are not illogical themselves - your points aren't necessarily wrong - but you are not answering the actual question being asked.\n\nI don't know if you get impatient with philosophy or what have you, but its a little ridiculous not to respect the fact that not everyone is attempting to get the same things out of a conversation that you are. I think about 99.9% of people recognize that the appropriate response to someone having a conversation you don't want to have is to keep scrolling, not come at them with a bulleted list of why their musings aren't logistically sound.",

Smartphones, we can\u2019t live without it, almost part of us. Same with apple watch. Already wearing it the whole day, technically part of us too. All of this is a slow preparation for the brain interface. Public isn\u2019t ready yet so they go step by step. End goal is trans humanism or the moment we become real slaves to the authorities. \n\nMay be a stretch but i think there\u2019s a reason why hollywood has been pushing superhero movies this last decade or so. They are all augmented beings with \u00ab\u00a0super powers\u00a0\u00bb. They want to make it seem cool but it\u2019s an unconscious preparation for trans humanism. If mass population think its cool to be augmented, then it will be easier for them to sell the brain interface. Even Klaus Schwab, founder of World Economic Forum said in an interview that this is the next step for the human species. You can find it easily on YouTube.",
