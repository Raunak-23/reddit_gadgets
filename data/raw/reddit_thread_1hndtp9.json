I'm sure that's what every industry is planning to do.\n\nEdit: and then of course the board partners are going to increase prices on top of Nvidia's MSRP and blame the tariffs.",

Consodering most AAA bloated games aremt worth playing though, I'm not sure I'll upgrade from here unless there is a massive price drop. I've had no issue running everything at 4k 80 fps+ on ultra. And most games i enjoy are AA or indie anyways.\n\nPersonally I don't see a 5090 selling to consumers for that price. Maybe crypto farms or AI systems. But there is literally no reason to get a 5090 when a 4090 will likely be fine for the next half decade.",

I have a couple friends who have Ryzen 7 and i7 9900k and 16GB with their ROG 1070's and maintaining 60fps even at 1080p in games like Warhammer Space Marine 2 on med-low settings is challenging at best.  \n  \n1070 is still a solid card for general 1080p gaming that's for sure, and as long as its not being bottlenecked by the rest of the components it is one of the cards that has held its place for longer than most. But even the 20x series cards are starting to show their age on newer games esp. at resolutions over 1080p. And lowering the resolution sucks on modern monitors as they look blurry AF outside of their native.  \n  \nGame developers have also gotten lazy and code is bloated. Faster hardware means they can just bury more dead bodies in their code and say its the norm. They are to blame as well.",

Leftists weren't the ones who secured Joe Biden's win in 2020, and they weren't what made the difference in 2024. Unless by \"the left\" you just mean the usual Democratic base, which is primarily comprised of liberals. \n\nDems need to stop sprinting to the right during general elections. Harris somehow won over fewer registered Republican voters than Biden did in 2020. Her strategy of campaigning with people like Liz Cheney -- a person who is hated by the right for being a \"RINO\" and the left for being, well, Liz Cheney -- was evidently uninspiring to both Republican and Democratic voters.\n\nI'm not saying the Dems need to run a socialist, much as I personally would be for it, but they need to stop trying to pander to the cult of Donald Trump rather than appealing to their own base. Blaming voters for not showing up is only half the story. We have to focus on *why* people were unmotivated to turn out for Democrats this time around. \n\nThat lack of interest was probably a combination of A) people forgetting how bad Trump was the first time around, B) legitimate complaints about inflation and stagnating wages (which, to be fair, is not entirely Biden's fault, but the incumbent will suffer when the economy feels like shit even if GDP is fine), and C) a lack of any sort of inspiring message beyond \"I'll be better than that guy.\"\n\nAgain, I voted for her, don't shoot the messenger here. I'm just saying that running to the right inherently alienates part of the Dems' own base every election cycle, and it's clearly not a strategy that works anymore. They need to do a better job of appealing to their own base and working to get them to turn out and vote.",

The collective is nothing more than a mass of individuals and if everyone thought like you then nothing would ever get done, we'd be living in a dictatorship if we even had a civilization at all.\n\nIgnoring all the other times when personal responsibility is important, voting matters because it communicates intentions. If you hate the system then by all means, spoil your ballot, it'll be recorded as such. But voting for a third party, an independent or even just the lesser of two evils will also communicate that intent, that preference. \n\nIf people see a third voice gaining votes, it not only emboldens them but it also emboldens the people behind those parties. \n\nBut if you refuse to vote, you are not counted and all that matters is the mandate of those who voted who said that Trump is what America wants. Trump is what America stands for. \n\nAnd if that is what you stand for then you should have voted for Trump. And if you stand against that then you should have voted for anyone who stands against that.\n\nBut if you don't even turn up to vote then you are very clearly saying that you don't care, you don't give a fuck.

The democratic voter base is not composed of the leftists you see on reddit, Twitter, or bluesky, they are closer to the middle.\n\nA significant reason for the democrats' loss is that the left-wing media (both mainstream and alternative) is far more progressive and far left  than the average democratic or undecided voter. The left-wing media failed to rally around the Kamala and to provide her enough support during the elections.\n\nYou could argue that the media's role is to hold candidates accountable, and that's valid. However, once the candidate is chosen (primaries, anointed, or whatever ), the entire left-wing media should coalesce around that candidate to ensure victory. Criticizing or scrutinizing the candidate is appropriate during the primaries or after they've taken office, but during the campaign, the focus should be on pushing them forward.\n\nMost voters can't explain, in any amount of detail, Kamala's proposed economic policy or other any policies. Instead most voters vote based on vibes, and media portrayals play a huge role in shaping those perceptions. A big reason won is that right-wing media portrays him as infallible and to them he is the chosen one. While that kind of personality cult is not something the dems should to aspire to, the democrats could learn from how the right consistently supports their candidates.\n\nIn the future, if the democrats want any chance at winning an election, they must align with their key voter base, center-left liberals and not reddit socialists who don't vote anyways. They also need to work exclusively with media outlets willing to align with the party's messaging and rally behind their candidates.",

It's why I bit the bullet and built my new PC back in November. Dude at Microcenter made a comment about the price and how good of a PC it will be and I told him I was buying now instead of waiting to see 5000 series cards because of Trump's promised tariffs. Dude just scoffed and said, \"ya prices will go up for a few months but then we'll just start producing CPUs and GPUs in the US, and prices will go back down.\" Ya bud, sure they will.

Remember, you can pay a Chinese worker 1 USD/hr and not have any benefits, and they will happily make the same GPU that a USA worker would make for 20 USD/hr and have Healthcare benefits and days off and a retirement plan that all have to be paid for by the company.\n\nA USA worker costs significantly more than a Chinese worker. Which eats profit margins. So, when you have a USA made GPU, prepare to spend 2x the cost of the same GPU produced in China *even with Tariffs imposed*.",

To plan, finance and build a factory in the USA would take much longer than 4 years, by that time the president, who's ass the company is kissing, will no longer be in office.\n\nEDIT: Also forgetting all the produce thats grown in Central America and imported into the USA.  You cant move this to the USA because we can only grow in season.  If your country is located near the equator, then you dont really have seasons and can grow all year round.   So hooray, an AMD CPU only cost $200 because its built in the USA, but bananas still cost $10 a bunch.",
