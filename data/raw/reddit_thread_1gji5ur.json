Makes sense since the default SSD is also 4x the size (2TB) and the GPU is much faster, so it needs to pull textures from the SSD faster\u2026",

Either way, platform exclusives will continue to dwindle in share, and the target specs for most AAA games will remain mid-range.  Most end users, history has shown, can convince themselves to be satisfied with sub-optimal resolution or framerate, which means the idealized versions of the games will likely permanently remain within the scope of good PC hardware.",

I bought a slim last year and it runs 120 hz and looks vastly superior to my series X. \n\nThe only thing I could see as a benefit for you with an Xbox is getting game pass through them and being able to play most titles on the pc, but it has to be on windows. \n\nBut back to what the intent is going to be, I highly recommend a switch for its ability to accommodate multiple players, the ability to be portable or tv connected, and the fact that you can play actual M rated games that are the same as the PS and Xbox versions (unlike how it was with the Wii)",

                  "body": "It's always in their business plan. The original had a hardware refresh. It was \"PSX\" but that, it was \"PS1/PS one.\" I think that did well and they've followed that release life cycle since. \n\nThe PS2 had the slim version.\n\nThe PS3 had a slim and pro version. \n\nThe hardware refresh isn't always just a power bump. It depends on the technology advancements. Like the bump in specs may be because advancements allow for it at little to no additional cost.\n\nFor example, if you cut a tree to make a chair then you see how you could cut the tree more efficiently to increase the stability of the chair, why not? Especially if the major cost is the tree itself, then just give people the better chair because you can't cut less of a tree.\n\nThis refresh was clearly and openly expected because they provided their business plan to their shareholders, publicly. They gave time tables for when they were expecting the mid life refresh and when they were expecting the next gen.",
