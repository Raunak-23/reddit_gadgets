It's a little bit (not quite 100%, but close) like Nvidia vs. AMD: Like it or not, most things are developed with the most popular platform in mind and are almost always not options on the other.  That's why I use Chrome.\n\nFor what it's worth, I recently built a new PC and I took advantage of Chrome's built-in \"migrate everything\" option, and it migrated uBlock Origin just fine.  I'm not saying that means anyone can find a way to install a \"banned\" plugin but it certainly looks like a loophole.",

They analyze your watching, search and ad interaction habits to further categorize you in hopes of better reaching you with emotional appeal in ads. They aim to find what tugs at your heart strings and captures your attention. \n\nThere's some major flaws with that though. The first being that a lot of people react negatively to ads like this, as pointed out in the article. Secondly and most importantly, you need to have advertisers to fill all these categories and not just one or two of them. People get ad fatigue from seeing the same thing over and over. It's a turn off. 200 million devices sounds like a lot until you realize every other platform (including apps on their own TVs) all competing for the same advertisers. Ad budgets won't just grow infinitely to support all of these new outlets.\n\nNetflix has 70 million ad supported subscribers and they're platform agnostic. Hulu has another 37 million. Disney Plus has 157 million. Roku channel has 145 million including native device and app users. I'm not even going to get into all the other tv manufacturers. Ad dollars are spread thinner than ever.\n\nOf all the companies, I will note that Pluto has somehow cracked into local advertising while others seem to flounder there. I don't know if they're more accessible, work with a third party or how it happens but it's refreshing to see small local businesses rather than 3 commercials in a row for the same irrelevant prescription or product.",
