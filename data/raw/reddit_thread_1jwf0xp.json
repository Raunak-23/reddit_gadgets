It was CNNs, typically for predicting the machining quality of microscale femtosecond pulsed laser ablation of beams shaped via spatial light modulators.\n\nBasically: put a shaped window in front of your laser in the shape you want to burn into the surface, the shape at the surface will be a bit distorted from your window shape. So you need to adjust your window shape + pulse power to get the shape at the surface you actually want.\n\nWe really should have done the reverse transform with a CNN, i.e. have the shape you want as input and predict the ideal window shape, but we couldn't get that to work back in the day. I think these days I could probably have gotten it to work, but I was pretty new to deep learning back then.",

I would constantly tell my brother/sisters/cousins.. older people, about all these ways of doing things & they were not interested. Like how many older people prefer iPhones because they offer the required usability for most casual users.\n\nI'm not that tech outed yet that I don't need an android anymore.

Instead, it has an incredibly slick grip. Haven't dropped it and don't plan to, but this means I'm buying a case for it which I was hoping to go without since the phone, y'know, closes.\n\n- Closing the screen sometimes does stuff I wish it wouldn't. Like backing out of this comment with no prompt so I had to retype the whole thing.\n\n- It isn't practical to close with one hand. No snapping shut like an old flip phone. On the flip side, it doesn't wiggle at all when open, but behaves like any other solid-screen phone.\n\n- I'm not sure what the specs are for the external screen glass- it picks up fingerprints like crazy but they also wipe off super easily. It's almost a weirdly nice little ritual to wipe it off on a sleeve/hem when I close it?\n\n- I haven't found any cool uses for half-open mode yet besides being a camera stand/clock.\n\nPros:\n\n- The \"seam\" is a non-issue. If you run your finger across it (such as while scrolling) you can feel where it is, but you can only see it visually in certain lights. \n\n- Ohmygod icanputit inmypocket. Without worrying about it being bent or bumping things.\n\n- The external screen is far more functional than I expected. Still mostly a novelty, but allows for checking notifications and time and whatnot without opening it. Mostly redundant because I have a connected watch, but still handy. It will do apps as well, but I haven't tried.\n\n- You can customize which stuff is accessible on the small screen, both with and without your PIN.\n\n- Being able to stand does make it great for photos or alarms. Can't use it as a \"tent\" on the bedside because of the charging port, but that's a minor quibble.\n\nIt has a few software things, both good and bad, that are common to Motorola devices (I don't like that it doesn't have a photo gallery like LG, only Google Photos).\n\nThose are the things I noticed- other people might have a different focus. I couldn't tell you how good the cameras are, for instance, because I don't have much of an appreciation for the differences there.",

              "body": "Also just got a razr+ 2024 and I'm a huge fan. Really happy with it. It's definitely not nearly as polished as a Samsung phone though. Just a bunch of little bugs here and there (and some big ones, like Bluetooth pairing issues; supposedly resolved in the Android 15 update that's making its way out). \n\nAs the other commenter mentioned, the front screen is very functional. I often don't have to open the phone when I get some notification. Which is just like every other phone, obviously, but the point is that it being a folding phone isn't a huge deficit.\n\nYou can definitely notice the crease in the screen, especially with a white background. Not sure how it compares to other foldables, but it's easy enough to ignore. \n\nThe camera is servicable. Again, not as good as a Samsung phone, but it's rare that I've wished it were better. \n\nThere are a few things weirdly lacking - some of the UI is chunky, the settings app is totally black and white making it hard to navigate. The UI for customizing the front screen is great though, and a lot of the moto stuff is fun. It relies on Google apps for a lot of things, which I didn't like - calendar and files are examples. I removed those and use open source alternatives. \n\nI didn't think I'd be considering another razr for my next phone, but I am now!",

It's pretty cool sometimes when you're walking around a city and need directions to just have Google Maps running on the front screen.
