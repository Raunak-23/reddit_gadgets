Our 3D printed microscope uses a single 3D printed objective lens with a 2.9x magnification and a numerical aperture of 0.07.\n\n  \nThere are dozens of camera microscopes, offering 2 orders of magnitude higher optical performance with dirt cheap injection molded lenses, that cost less than the camera module alone selected by the writers.  \n  \nA $40 student microscope goes to 640x with illumination and is another $20 to add a camera.",

Using their methods, you can make it *yourself* in under 3 hours instead of possibly trying to call manufacturers for a quote on making the lens you need. It might take a week for the lens to finally be made and have the payment go through and then possibly another week for that custom lens to finally get to you\n\nThat\u2019s 2 weeks\n\nThat\u2019s 336 hours\n\nNow it can be made in 3 hours\n\nThat\u2019s impressive\n\nThat\u2019s faster than most shipping options for things that are already made in bulk or in warehouses",

This model is fairly common in research labs in the UK because with a bit of tinkering they can perform similarly to a piece of equipment which is 100x its price. They can also be run from batteries and they are compatible with traditional objectives. The team are increasingly working to deploy them in low-income nations and actually making good progress on this. I did a PhD on low-cost microscopy for diagnosis in low-resource settings and this is one of the most interesting devices in the field I think.",
