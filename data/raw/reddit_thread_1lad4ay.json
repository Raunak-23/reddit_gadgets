It is a struggle to get things sharp in lower light if you need the shutter speed, though that's probably less of an issue for landscapes. \n\nIf you want to go completely off the rails with zoom though, you can get a 150-600mm lens (300-1200mm full frame equivalent) for \u00a32000 rather than \u00a320,000.\n\nBut if a smaller camera gets you out more because it's easier to carry, then that just means more photos. A decent photo is better than no photo.",

The devices are not limited to this approach, but they do an incredible job with it. This has given them the ability to charge these outrageous prices for them, despite the competition being able to deliver equally, and often more capable devices at a lower price.

I\u2019ve found iPhone photos, while technically great, lack a certain \u201crealness\u201d because they do way too much post-processing. It might not be a sharper image due to small sensor size, but apple\u2019s ai is going to juice it up to what it thinks it should look like, which gives photos a very flashy, processed look you won\u2019t get with unedited film. \n\nFilm renders very differently and to many, has a more pleasant look than digital. Fine-grain film with good lenses can create incredibly sharp, beautiful photos that you just can\u2019t get out of a phone camera, while phone cameras will give you more immediate tools to use within a scene but force a lot of its own software magic into your photo, for better or worse. \n\nAn iPhone will take great photos for you, but shooting on a standalone film camera will make YOU take better photos with it, if that makes sense. That\u2019s my two cents, hope it\u2019s helpful!",
