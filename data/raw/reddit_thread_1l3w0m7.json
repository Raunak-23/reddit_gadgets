Advocating for consumer rights and protections for an industry that's profiting off of your likeness and data is what needs to be done. No one should be forced to buy a \"dumb phone\" either because of the dystopian shit they've been doing for decades. You also act like this ONLY applies to phones. Nevermind how much of your daily life is being tracked and logged through vehicles, computers, and etc.\n\nI guess \"dumb\" computers exist too, but as tech progresses, older tech starts to become unusable. Go ahead and get online with a Windows 95, 98, 2000/ME, XP, Vista, 7, and 8 machine and within LITERAL MINUTES, you've already been compromised without needing to even open a browser, despite that hardware would barely, if not be able to function with today's standards. Yet the Internet is becoming a requirement for life as it wasn't before like many other things in our daily life that didn't exist, and wasn't deemed important to have generations ago, but life and tech moves forward and is supposed to make our life easier.\n\nBy all means though, keep trying to state what's important or not, while using the same tech. If you want to go back to the stone age, be first in line. There's plenty of things that are not deemed necessary to your life, but I guarantee you hypocritially use them as well.",

It was on my phone and I was able to disable the app and it never bothered me but my dad's phone which was a bit older had this and even if you cleared the data, turned off internet access and disabled the app, it still managed to come back somehow possibly due to limitations of the older android version. I used to do this every time I used my dad's phone and the next time I saw it would be back. And the ads were full screen too. Hopefully it would be easier to disable it completely on the samsung devices using the new android versions and they don't manually block it from being disabled.",
