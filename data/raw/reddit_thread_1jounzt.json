      "body": "From the article: AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains an incredibly popular CPU, especially among gamers. But it seems not every buyer is having a good experience. There have been over 100 cases of owners whose chips have died after working for a short amount of time, and for no obvious reason.\n\nReddit user natty_overlord compiled a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASRock/comments/1i5iy9a/update_and_summary_on_the_dead_9800x3ds/) of all 108 Reddit posts involving a Ryzen 7 9800X3D that died. The chips passed POST and worked for varying amounts of time before dying with no signs of failure.\n\nWhat's interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on. 98 of the cases, or 82%, happened on Asrock boards, though that could be due to their popularity as a more budget-friendly board maker. Tom's Hardware notes that the company released a new firmware update for AM5 motherboards in February that improved boot problems in AMD 9000 series CPUs. Whether those issues are related to the dying chips is unclear.",

The article doesn't really need to mention that the percentage isn't related to the 108 its clearly defined by not including them together.

They start out saying there are 108 cases of 9800x3d chips that have died, followed by saying 98 of them, or 82%, occurred on ASROCK boards. They directly link the 98 to the 108 with their wording, \"What's interesting is the brand of motherboard these failures occurred on.\"\n\nThere is then a break in the article with a tangentially related link.\n\nAfter the break they then mention 22 other motherboards. However, no where in the article do they mention that there are any other CPU models involved. So someone keeping count is now wondering how 108 dead CPUs are connected to 120 motherboards, leading to further confusion.\n\nThe article would have had more value if they simply said: \"120 AMD processors have recently died, 98 of them on ASROCK motherboards. Here is a link to a Reddit post about it.\"",

Arguably worse, but the Ryzen 9000 series scandal is just the most recent one.\n\nIMO, if you get a new CPU. AMD or Intel. Take some time to learn how to undervolt that particular platform. Whether it\u2019s applying an offset in PBO, some adaptive voltage sorcery for intel, wtv. There\u2019s guides everywhere. Try at the very least to maintain stock clocks at a lower voltage.

If you got an x870e board your an early adopter and they sort the kinks out. Did the same when I got my first x670e, took about 2 months and no issue after. Nirmally tomahawk is there zero extra crap board and have less issues, same as the pro gaming. The higher end board like the carbon and up have issues at first. Only takes a minute to update bios if need be, my boards OC usability is amazing and I love it, same as my am4 boards. Only issue I've had with the aorus master cards Is GCC not working correctly. But normally a rollback works. I'm just saying what I've had no problems with vs people with gigabyte boards that's sucks, overpriced strix that do nothing different or better, asrock (except taichi). In the systems I've built there's been alot of issues but no where near  with msi boards. Everything will have things that miss QC unfortunately though, or user errors where they're mixing ram, changed a setting and made it completely unstable, but that's an every day thing.",
