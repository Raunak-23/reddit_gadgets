The 7900xtx is at least roughly comparable to a 4070ti.\n\nThe bigger thing is that GPU\u2019s other than XX50/XX60 series cards are actually available. Prices are still inflated from MSRP, but inventory does exist because they\u2019re no longer all being bot-purchased for crypto mining. You also can buy a used GPU again without it being more likely than not that it\u2019s toast from running at 100% load 24/7 mining crypto - and those burnt out mining cards were still selling for MSRP and above on the secondhand market in many cases. \n\nRight now if you want/need an upgrade because your card is very out of date you can either buy a used 40-series that wasn\u2019t used for mining at a reasonable discount from someone anticipating the 5000 series release, or you can have a better chance at scoring a 5000 series card because fewer people are trying to do a single generation upgrade. There aren\u2019t miners instantly buying up all the inventory, and even if it\u2019s still not perfect or even great there are at least some anti-bot/scalper practices in place at most authorized retailers nowadays. \n\nTo be clear, most people will still end up paying inflated prices over MSRP if they want a card now and that sucks. Availability is also pretty limited for XX80 cards and above, which motivates scalpers to keep buying up retail inventory as it hit the shelves. This sucks, and there\u2019s still a lot of progress to be made to get back to the \u201cbefore times\u201d when you could find aftermarket cards in stock within $100-200 of MSRP. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s at least a dramatic improvement from how things played out from 2020-2024 and hopefully the trend continues in a positive direction.",

Let me ask you something, You are currently considering upgrading from a 2080 to a 5080. If your logic is true then shouldn't your 2080 still be lasting you for another generation or two? Do you really think you got significantly more mileage out of the 2080 than you would've gotten out of a 2070?",

A 5070 is not as performant as a 4090 UNLESS you use DLSS and frame gen, and then it's only technically. If you just think about it, frame-gen is adding extra (fancy super-special-AI-interpolated) frames. They can literally just make it add 200 frames arbitrarily. It doesn't equate 1:1 with raw horsepower. With ray-tracing things get even murkier.\n\nBottom line, at the end of the day the average joe gamer isn't going to notice a huge difference, especially talking about single-player experiences, but as soon as any level of competitive multiplayer comes into the conversation, players will notice things like ghosting, smearing, and lack of clarity for certain features (like text, crosshairs, grenades, etc, for example) when moving their view quickly. Not to mention consumer TVs have had their own version of frame-gen for over a decade (those cheap \"120fps\" 4k TVs all use smoothing and interpolation, which is all frame-gen is, just fancier and more advanced), which most users that would fall into the latter category turn off immediately because for fast-paced games it looks like crap.",

Then, isn't that already possible because you can just lower the graphical settings to a level that is achievable for your hardware currently?\n\nUnless, what you are wanting is for Devs to better take advantage of the current hardware by optimizing their code and not use buggy engines like UE4 (I am assuming this is what you want). However, what exactly are you hoping to be achieved if, theoretically, devs made their code perfectly optimized? I know you don't want to use AI trickery but are you hoping that this perfect dev code can uplift performance on all GPUs dramatically like taking a RTX 4090 that is performing only at 20FPS with path tracing on Cyberpunk to something like 60FPS or more if code is optimized? \n\nThis draws back to my point about what exactly your argument is about because if you don't think we should achieve more than why can't you be satisfied with 20FPS on Cyberpunk with full path tracing without DLSS? Why can't you just turn down the settings to something even like 720p and get great performance? But, I bet the image wouldn't be great and you would feel like you would be leaving performance on the table and would feel that you're not experiencing the artists full creative vision. \n\nHow about devs just stick to 1080p 30fps targets for their games and make sure the textures are medium quality and maps are semi open world. Then, we wouldn't have to worry about upgrading hardware and we can let devs spend more time expressing themselves making great stories/games than worrying about graphics or FPS? \n\nAll in all, to me, this is what you sound like:\n\"Gah, these incompetent devs! If they actually knew how to optimize their games. I would be getting better performance on my games along with retaining image quality without these stupid tricks!\"",

There are a number of reasons these things don't happen - from time and budget constraints to using an engine you are unfamiliar with and therefore not doing things optimally within that engine. \n\nAdditionally, if they're using something like Unreal, the foundation of that engine is developed by Epic and has been iterated on for 27 years. Even though developers can tweak the engine, Epic is responsible for maintaining most of the core functionality. In that case, any performance optimization issues for the engine out of the box fall on them. I wasn't JUST talking about optimization. Sometimes, an engine settles on a particular method for doing occlusion, but that method is really bad and slow, and there's a much more performant way of doing it that would require a rewrite. This is just an example.\n\nEither way, I obviously don't have data on this in terms of how much performance could be gained, and I could be completely wrong in thinking this issue could be optimized out of if the standards stayed where they are now. I'm definitely not blaming the devs. I think it's just a confluence of factors.\n\n\nTLDR: Yea, maybe you're right.",

Stop acting smart because you think you're the only person who knows what quantum tunneling is.\n\n\n\nGraphics look pretty damn good already. We dont need to keep reaching for better and better graphics. You didn't address a single thing I said about modern game engines like Unreal 5 having less optimized graphics toolkits that take way more compute time to do sometimes worse versions of same thing as previous generations. \n\nProbably because you don't know anything about this, and you wouldn't be able to sound smart.\n\nThere are entire youtube playlists ripping into the laziness of large mass market engines like this. Game developers used to have to come up with novel solutions for rendering, culling, etc. With higher level tools and systems being built on top of lower level ones, everything costs more compute, and nobody knows how any of the lower level stuff works anymore. There are a lot of black boxes in our toolkits. So many inefficiencies and poor design choices just buried under higher level code. But again, you can't sound smart if you talk about something you don't know shit about, so you may as well ignore these criticisms.\n\nLet's not try and fix any of that. Let's instead create an advanced algorithm that guesses the graphical output we are looking for because that's cheaper than hiring developers.",

There are other cards aswell, and the 5090 is not going to be weaker than the 4090 in any way. \n\nAnd to answer your question, they gain more from memory, and here comes the big one, TO A POINT. Once you go over that point you need a more powerful gpu. A 5090 and 32/64gb of RAM (don't know the precise numbers for these games) will give you more than a low tier gpu coupled twice or four times as much.",

          "body": "Here is the question and answer from the interview: \n\n> Reporter: I have a question regarding gamers and consumers. We noticed a significant gap between the RTX 5090 and 5080. The number of CUDA cores in the 5090 is more than twice that of the 5080, and the price has doubled as well. Why did you create such a large difference between the flagship and the near-flagship models?\n> \n> Jensen Huang: The reason is simple. Once someone wants the best product, they will always choose the best. You know, the market isn\u2019t so segmented. And our enthusiasts, if they want the best, they won\u2019t settle for something slightly better or save $100 by choosing something a bit worse. They just want the best.\n> \n> Of course, $2,000 is not a small amount, and it\u2019s certainly a high value. But keep in mind that this technology is being used in your home theater-level PC setup. And that PC\u2014where you\u2019ve probably already invested around $10,000 in your monitor and sound system\u2014will definitely need the best GPU. So many of our customers are simply after the absolute best.\n\nhttps://www.szyunze.com/jensen-huang-talks-rtx-5090-price-at-ces-2025-interview/\n\nHe isn't talking about jumping down to a 5080. He is saying that people who are buying a 5090, want the best possible. If you are spending this kind of money for the best possible, you don't want NVIDIA to create a worse flagship, so it can be a little cheaper. That is what the non-flagships are for. \n\nNow, I do think there is a ton of stuff that can be argued, is that really the lowest price they go without needed to drop performance? Is that really the best care that they can make? But in general I get what he is saying. People buying flagship level products want the knowledge that they are buying the best possible.",

They have money and are willing to spend it on the best they can get their hands on. Therefore, the $400 price increase is not going to make an impact on them.\n\nIf the 5070 was a $400 increase over the 4070, it would simply price-out most of its customer base. They wouldn't be able to afford it and therefore just wouldn't buy one.\n\nBut it is unlikely that anyone who intended to buy a 5090 at $1600 is unwilling to do so at $2,000. It's a particular clientele that's less sensitive to price. That's what he's saying.",

I'm very skeptical that it will be, but we'll see for sure when GN and others start putting out their benchmarks.\n\nI have no doubt they're charging a big markup. I'm sure they are on a lot of their stuff, but especially the 5090. They have no competition on the top of the stack. Nobody looking to buy *whatever* the best option is has another option. AMD isn't even competing in tier this time as far as I know. On top of that they get the \"AI Enthusiast\" type that might like the jump from 24 -> 32GB VRAM. Though I also know some of them who are just buying multiple used workstation GPUs to get 48GB+ total.\n\nEdit: Don't get me wrong. I don't like the price, I obviously wish it was cheaper. I wish they had more competition from AMD and Intel to give all of them a reason to compete on price. But so far, at least in the tier of cards the 4090 was, and the 5090 should be, they have no competition. They are free to dictate the price at whatever they think will sell sufficiently.",

If the 5090 had a 50% increase on performance over the 5080, who is going to say they should be priced at the same value? If the 5090 costs $400 more, then the only way you have an argument over the price is if the benchmarks show a sub $400 value of proformance over the 5080. But until then, you can't just point at the prices and complain until there is a reason to show the price increase isn't justified.\n\nThe CEO has a point where the people who NEED a 5090, have the money for a 5090. If you can't even afford a 2560x1920, 120Hz monitor, then not only would you not be able to afford a $2k GPU, but you won't NEED it anyways. My monitor has those specs and the 4090 I have can easily handle it, and I probably didn't need it. But a 4080 probably would have done the job at a lower cost. So unless you have the money for 4k, high frame rate monitor to where a 5090 is needed, then why complain about the price of a card you don't need. Again with the Ferrari comparison, if you don't need 700 horsepower, race tires, and competition suspension, why even co sider buying one when a Civic is why cheaper and can do what you NEED it for.",

Since the 900 series it's generally been about a 50% increase in CUDA cores (30% for the 3000 series, 68% for the 4000 series), which resulted in about 35% better performance in single precision processing power (62% for the 2000 series, 20% for the 3000 series, 70% for 4000 series).\n\nI think, combined with a much larger gap in memory bus width than usual between the 5080 and 5090, we can probably expect a doubling of the processing power between the two cards if not even a bit more than that.\n\nIt's difficult to say how that will translate to FPS differences but the 5090 really should be able to process twice as much data as the 5080.",

Like, if you want to use your GPU for literally anything else, you're kind of SOL with AMD. Even if AMD made an objectively superior product, people wouldn't buy it either because of driver instability issues, perceived issues from their past, or just because everyone is already using Nvidia. That's why AMD wised up and quit making high-end GPUs. They realized that nobody was buying, so it was a waste of money for them.\n\nHopefully, having a unified architecture helps change things for the better, so they aren't spreading their resources too thin. Despite having billions of dollars, it's such an expensive industry that, for a company doing what they do, they really don't have many resources.",

A long time ago I worked as a carpenter\u2019s assistant and the tools he had to buy or rent to run his business added up to hundreds of thousands. Now here I am in ML engineering (i run a small boutique AI consultancy) and I can buy a literally top of the line GPU that satisfies all my local compute needs for less than 10 hours of billable time? That\u2019s insane.\n\nIMO people buying a 5090 for gaming are like white collar workers who buy tricked out F-350s. No judgement \u2014 I love fancy electronics AND trucks lol \u2014 but these are serious work tools and their pricing is generous when looked at that way.",

One such explanation is that they're reducing manufacturing capacity for consumer gaming devices in order to allocate more for the explosive demand from corporations due to AI. If they're making fewer gaming cards, especially ones at the high end that seem more for show than to fill a real demand in the market, it makes sense to raise the price to the highest level they can to sell the specific number of cards they intend to manufacture. This is basic demand curve stuff.\n\nOr it might be simpler than that, and they'd just rather sell half the number of cards at three times the profit. This is very plausible for high end luxury products, even if it means making you upset that you are personally priced out.\n\nIf you set aside your personal frustration for a moment, there are actually a lot of interpretations that aren't \"oh Nvidia must not want to make money\"",

AMD has always focused on the business aspect first as it is what makes them the money to put R&D into their GPU side to be competition against a company that only focused on GPUs for the longest time. But even during that time they have outpaced the top CPU competitors by a large margin, which is insane seeing as how far ahead Intel was just 5 years ago. Hell AMD was close to being erased from existence just over a decade ago.\n\nWhere AMD has excelled in the GPU market was creating graphics that can be within reach of their competitors while their hardware has less power draw, less heat build up, and comes in at a more affordable price. It was for these reasons Sony and Microsoft went to AMD graphics for both of their most recent gen consoles.\n\nAMD is winning the mass market game, full stop.  To say Nvidia doesn\u2019t have competition is hilarious as AMD has been slowing taking that via a different route than their performance driven dominance in the CPU market.

It's a \"if we build it, they will come\" market: as long as Nvidia continues to provide ever-increasing amounts of compute power, people will always find ways to use it. And GPUs evolve at a *way* higher rate than CPUs these days.\n\nAMD managed to carve themselves a market share in the CPU space because Intel was arrogant, focused on raw profit squeezing and barely innovated, allowing AMD to catch up. It's that simple. Intel's 8th gen was telling in that regard: in one generation they suddenly upgraded their i5 lineup from 4 cores/4 threads to 6/12 to match Ryzen 1000, showing that they had the tech to do it for a long time and *actively chose* not to use it until forced. \n\nNvidia is also quite arrogant when it comes to pricing, but their one key advantage is that they NEVER take their foot off the gas. They use their dominant market position to invest obscene money into R&D and create new products and features that their competitors can't even hope to replicate quickly, always remaining 1-2 steps ahead. How long did it take AMD to finally realize that good AI upscaling required dedicated accelerators? 7 years? They're about to release a generation that has upscaling at a level as good as Nvidia cards had in 2020, while Nvidia has taken *another* step ahead by switching to the transformer model. They do not allow AMD to have feature parity for even a single generation. And that's while gaming is their second or third priority, mind you - in the datacenter compute space they literally have zero notable competitors and still push the tech forward in a big way every generation.",

However, Nvidia's stock price has literally 10x-ed since the AI craze started. Even if the bubble bursts and Nvidia's valuation gets cut in half, it still leaves them 500% better off than when they started, and they were already pretty damn wealthy before AI.\n\nIMO what will really carry Nvidia in the long term is Jensen's reputation. He's now known as a visionary who predicted the AI boom 10 years beforehand and positioned his company perfectly to capitalize on it. He also has the bonus points for being Nvidia's initial founder who brought them to this point from the very beginning, rather than a normal mercenary bean counter CEO. That buys enormous trust with both shareholders and end users.",

And they can't exactly easily return units in bulk.\n\nIf I'm Nvidia, I'm seeing that a good portion of my products sold at a premium price, justifying that price. It doesn't matter on the accounting that large quantities were bought by single individuals, just that they sold.\n\nNow over time, market research is showing that my products are actually selling for up to double the price, so the following release, I double my prices. Then the scalpers buy and increase again.\n\nAnd it goes on and on and on.\n\nAnd even if 70-80% people stopped buying from scalpers, the scalpers still bought from Nvidia.",

They both have to use DLSS to run the game at upscaled 1080p to get decent performance, which looks fine, but it feels ridiculous that their multi-thousand dollar latest hardware builds still need to play at lower resolutions to get high frame rates and then people still say lower end hardware is fine for 4k gaming. \n\nIt isn't. \n\nThe trillion dollar company behind this racket has convinced us that artificially upscaling a nearly 20 year old resolution standard is better than buying hardware that can support current day resolutions at current day frame rates. The marketing is really convincing, but stop drinking their kool-aid - the 5090 is still going to be UNDERPOWERED given the astronomical price. They can't support current gamer demands without cheating with software and marketing trickery, and they still want to charge $2,000 for their best effort, and they've got basically everyone fooled.",

But the remainder of the games I play (overwatch, rivals, valorant, fortnite, seige) I'm typically in the 240s. But this 13th gen is much better than most of the 14th gen counterparts, I've tested as well. For instance, the 14900KS was significantly more power hungry but it wasn't as OC friendly as 13900KS and the 14900K never once beat a single benchmark. \n\nAs for your second point, I completely agree with you, it's a shame, I do believe the 4090 is the last real hardware we got. Even AMD was using similar software to upscale the lower resolution multiple times over. It's a gimmick, if you think about it, eventually when hardware that can achieve that, they'll downplay what we currently have (i.e. fake frames, fake performance and etc.). And coax the masses into immediately rushing for that. It's gross.\n\nEven for me, I probably won't entertain the GPU trend this launch, I'll wait until the refreshes come out and etc. It seems all of these guys have something that's wrong each time around launch date.",

It wouldnt be much of an issue in many games probably, but for multiplayer games I wouldnt recommend it. And because multiplayer game nowadays lean towards the competitive side (because people probably want it like that), I would only recommend it for single player games. And even there we have to see how much of an issue it will be. In Valorant or CS2 I have like 5-6ms system latency. My monitor is an oled. If it will be around 50-60ms system latency, it will be a big deal and not usable for me. But thats just me, there will be scenarios (and I guess that will be only single player games) where it probably isnt an issue. I have a 4090 now and probably upgrade to the 5090 when it releases, I just dont care about frame generation or dlss. For me, nothing changes in that regard. I will put the raw power to use.",

And the AI fakes them by interpolating existing frames, it can't actually know what the image should look like. So, for example, and object quickly moving around in a circle can wind up moving in a square because the algorithm would just \"interpolate\" it moving directly between the 4 points it sees in the native frames, not knowing about any intended curvature in its path. If it moves fast enough (and the native framerate low enough), it'll just be shown moving in a line back and forth.\n\nAnd Reflex 2.0 is even worse, as it's doing the opposite - looking at previous frames to guess what's going to be on the edges of the screen. If a new object shows up or an enemy changes direction it's going to guess wrong and display the wrong information. In worst cases it may end up like an online game with bad lag where network code makes everything appear smooth until you're shot by an enemy whom you didn't even see round the corner.",

They'll even put a footnote on the menu that for best enjoyment, a ton of ketchup from home is required.\n\nAnd, of course, this is *already* happening in the world of gaming, with upscaling and framegen being required in modern AAA titles even for top end GPUs to compensate for cut corners in optimization, and TAA being required to compensate for cut corners in graphical fidelity.",

If it introduces noticeable input log then no, I don't care for it.\n\nAs for AI being prioritized, I'm indifferent about it. AI has come a long way and I'm willing to give one generation a test-run to see how it does.\n\nI would imagine it's similar to Lossless Scaling, which works great for *some* titles but does introduce **significant** input lag. Nvidia, however, now has hardware dedicated to these kinds of AI tasks and hardware dedicated to a task will *always* outperform any software-based solution. Sort of how FSR always has been and always will be absolutely inferior to DLSS.\n\nSo, if Nvidia has somehow managed to reduce the input lag and any blurriness isn't too bothersome, I'll happily give them credit. If it all turns out to be the sucky wucky, I'd imagine they phase it out for the next generation.\n\nBut this whole \"fake frames\" stuff is a bit silly.",

I think people need to realize that it's not that the prices are rising that's the issue, it's their socioeconomic status that is falling. But really they're both sides of the same coin. Not being able to afford eggs and milk signals that you've fallen out of the middle class. Same for everything else that would expect from a typical middle class lifestyle that's falling out of reach. I think people would behave differently if they saw themselves as lower class instead of the illusion that they are still middle class. Shit's fucked. There should be a class revolt but people are still thinking it's fine and then complain about prices.",

Basically the card still sucks at raytracing in that game without dlss imo. Raytracing performance on all video cards has been meh for years. Comparatively if the game goes from 21 to 28 fps you are technically getting a huge percentage increase in performance (30%), so from that perspective it is decent, but no one is likely going to care because it's fps is so low.

They all decided to raise their prices to \"follow inflation\" and now Ubisoft is going bankrupt and a bunch of other companies are seeing failures but the prices aren't coming down yet.\n\nInstead they think they can \"refocus on quality\" or some bullshit. When the reason they're failing is because indies beat them on quality sometimes, but above all they beat them on pricing by a landslide. And yet they're not willing to give up on that.\n\nThat's not limited to games. Price gouging is going on in a bunch of markets and in some cases it's definitely impacting sales. But companies have capital to burn so they keep trying until they have to give up. And maybe a little bit of hubris or pride in there too? Having to admit you were wrong as a capitalist must be tough when you're used to bending everything to your will.",

Also, AMDs inefficient GPUs are also in a very similar boat to Intels CPUs often drawing 50% more power for identical or marginally higher performance compared to Nvidia's offerings. I also went with an AMD GPU for the first part of this generation but the best thing I ever did was sell that garbage and switch to the 4080 instead, I had so many annoyances and issues with the 7900 XTX that made it suck despite the $200 savings and the 4080 has just been bliss comparatively.",

These chips are more complex than ever, harder to make than ever, and can't be shrunk and optimized for double performance year over year. The fact of the matter is that a 2080 can still play basically every triple AAA game at 1080p at reasonable framerates, and that card is 6 years old. A 3080 can play all AAA games at 1440p at reasonable framerates and it's 3 years old. And they're both overkill for anything older than 2020!\n\nCards did not used to be relevant this long 20 years ago. You used to buy a card, be able to play the latest and greatest for 3 years, play the next 3 years with much lowered settings, and then basically send it out to the pasture. Now, getting a 6 year old card and expecting it play everything is the norm. Hell, even a 1080, a card that came out nearly a decade ago, is still respectable in most cases.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, the top end is now luxury, instead of simply cutting edge. It's like complaining that you can't get a super car when in 90% of cases you're not going to even going to use half it's performance. \n\nI can't afford a 5090, and I don't care. My 3080ti can play everything released today at 1440p, my current monitor resolution, at minimum 60fps if not more, at at least high settings if not max. And I'll likely be able to expect that for the next few years. If I want more, then maybe I'll swing for a 5080, which is the same price I paid for my 3080ti. And then I won't have to worry about being able to play stuff at 1440p *ever again.* 4K becomes a reasonable option for 90% of games native. for the remaining 10%, I have to use some upscaling, which was expected anyway because they're doing essentially *ground truth light simulation* for rendering anyway, something that would have been thought impossible 10 years ago. \n\nI just think people aren't being looking at the reality of gaming, which is easier to get into than ever. It used to affordable to go for the top end, but that top end was ephemeral at best. Now it's not, but it's gonna last you much longer. Most people aren't even interested in it.",

The third party models of the 5090 will probably be more like $2499 or higher. It sucks but it\u2019s the way things have been moving based on consumer demand for over a decade now.",

The wealth gap keeps rising, companies keep raising prices, and consumers have less buying power year after year. I agree that this is the way things are going and have a basic understanding of the economics in play, but that in no way means that consumers should just be silent and accept it.",

The thing is, the writing has been on the wall for longer than people realise for top end consumer Nvidia products. It started with the first Titan, a $999 card released over a decade ago that cost the same as the 690 you mention and was released afterwards but was essentially just a 'full' 680. They then experimented with different Titan models and price points ranging up to $2999 (about $4k in today money) for the Titan Z (and later Titan V) and the previously mentioned final Titan, the RTX. These are what the x090 models are now. The regular consumer top end cards are the x080 models.\n\nNvidia seems to have found its groove with their model line that works for them now. They've moved the Titan naming scheme to the mainstream consumer realm and priced it slightly lower than a 'true' Titan would be so that they can disable some of the features that used to be enabled in Titan models are now only available in business cards.\n\nGraphics cards now cost significantly more than they did a decade and a half ago, across the board. They're much more complicated now and, unlike their CPU counterparts, they still see significant performance growth with each generation. Like some people say; Moore's Law is dead for CPUs but is alive and well for GPUs. The most important component in a computer in terms of gaming performance is now the GPU. Everything else is just an accessory for the GPU now and they're priced accordingly.\n\nHowever, it's not all doom and gloom. If you look at the equivalent to the 'normal' top end card from the generation you've referenced, the 680, it was released for $499 which is about $950 in today's money. The 5080, today's equivalent model is $999. That's pretty decent pricing.",

If the position is, well this is the best of the best, and the components and things in the card actually justifies the price tag... then what are we arguing here?

Well if you've got somebody that can afford it and wants to spend that much on the best... then why can't they have that if someone will make it?\n\nIf the price is **not** justified for what's actually in the card, then we have an argument.  It's like arguing, well why are you selling a Lamborghini for a half a million dollars?  Because look at what's in that car and its performance.  Of course it costs that much.  Do we refuse to make them because the price tag is ugly to the average consumer?  It's not for the average consumer.  Is the argument that we shouldn't make or sell them just because you can't afford to buy them?  Why shouldn't we?\n\nI want to hear *why* the price tag is what it is, and whether or not the components and the R&D for what Nvidia spends on its technology actually justifies it.  That's the more \"valid\" argument to be had.  Why should the top of the line card gimp what's in it to be less than what it *could be*?  When they release so many SKUs for these fucking things, something should be sitting at the very top and have ALL the things in it.  The only case to be made for why you can't or shouldn't do that is if you won't be able to sell enough of them to justify making them, or if there's an actual safety issue or something with them like them catching fire or whatever.",

They'd make more money, with less hassle, simply selling the chips to industry. The consumer GPU market accounts for only 10% of their earnings, but probably closer to 90% of their hype. You are all mad, and constantly angrily posting meme's, and threads and whatever else stomping your feet that Nvidia isn't selling their GPU's to you cheaper. That is exactly the type of hype Nvidia is after. Makes them look like the unattainable best. As far as they are concerned it is the best of both worlds. They are gouging you on the front end and reaping unparalleled hype on the back end, nonstop, 24/7, 365. Nvidia would appreciate it if you all *never stopped complaining*. You want to punish them. Buy AMD/Intel without making a peep. Just buy it and move on. Everything else benefits Nvidia.",

And yes, that meant that you got (up to) 20% more FPS out of the 3090 than the 3080.\n\nThe situation with the 5080 and 5090 is very different.  2x the VRAM bus width alone is huge for GPU compute workloads.  I'm not sure how much of a gaming difference there will be between the 5080 and 5090, but it's going to be significant.  However, the difference in performance when it comes to non-gaming workloads (3D modeling, AI/ML, etc) is going to be huge.  \n\nEven though there will be a tangible advantage in gaming going with the 5090, I stand by my statement that these xx90 series cards are more professional workstation GPU's than gaming GPU's.",
