I know someone that is a beta tester for that machine.  that print cost them $100 in ink. to do the relief it prints many layers over and over to build it up.  a small ink set is $250 and that print demoed uses about 1/2 the ink.   They are marking up standard UV ink hard and putting it in sealed cartridges at a massive premium.   Standard UV ink is about $40-$60 a liter.   this setup gets you about 100ml for that same price.",

In the \"cheap printer, expensive ink\" model, the printers are *extremely* cheap, sometimes even less expensive than the ink refill itself. They're intentionally heavily subsidized to lock the consumer in. This printer is far too expensive to make the model work.\n\n>Usually UV printers are in the $30,000 to $50,000 range.\n\nAnker is marketing this printer to makers for home use. It's not the same as a $50k machine aimed at manufacturers, like the Casio mentioned in the article.\n\nAgain, did you read the article? It explicitly mentions this.\n\n>>UV printing isn\u2019t a new technology. The process uses UV-curable inks to apply layers of color onto a surface that can dry almost instantly when subjected to specific wavelengths of light. This means it can coat practically any surface, from paper to wood to acrylic. You can find a fair number of desktop-sized UV flatbed printers ranging from $2,000 up to $7,000. For something that offers 3D texture, you normally have to shell out a lot more money. Back in 2018, Casio showed off similar 3D printing features with a $50,000 UV printer. That sort of tech is now far more affordable. Anker calls its latest eufyMake device the \u201cfirst\u201d 3D texture UV printer for home use.",

                          "body": "Okay, let me clarify something here.  Most current UV printers are very large format sign printers, like for billboards, and they can even cost over 6 figures.  Flatbed printers of this type were initially dreamed up as DTG printers, and they were quite expensive because t-shirts are always a money maker, it wasn't because the printer was cutting edge technology.  (Casio was way late to the game, btw.)\n\nWell before 2018, [Direct Color Systems](https://www.directcolorsystems.com/about-2/) were selling units based off of the Epson dx5 printers that could go higher than 5mm.  Iirc they were around $25,000 - $45,000 and were made to withstand commercial production, but no bigger than any non-Kornit DTG printer or 40W RF laser system at the time.  I checked them out at every trade show I attended, but there is limited ROI for commercial printing applications, and bespoke items take too much human time to actually be profitable. \n\nAt the same time, Roland was selling a 20\" solvent printer/cutter using the dx7 printhead for under $10,000, and a professional vinyl cutter or sublimation system was under $1000.  \n\nThe markup was only\\*\\* because of wanting to cash in on the folks that were coming from Cricut vinyl cutting into the \"professional\" market who didn't have the space or clientele to screen print or print billboards, and who saw the DTG printers as their golden ticket.  Those first A3 sized UV flatbeds looked nearly identical to the DTGs as well.  I never saw those little phone case sized UV printers at a trade show, that market was (and still is) dominated by sublimation, which was not only faster and cheaper, but the customer could send a photo from their phone to the queue while standing in line and it was ready when they got to the front.  That entire printer/heat press/software system was less than $3000 and extremely portable.  What system do you think the Cricut moms bought into?  What is the marketing strategy of this printer again?\n\n(Sublimation was a cheap way to get into the business, but it wasn't cheap to stay in because of proprietary printers, ink, software, and specially coated blanks.  Guess what Cricut marketed to their maker-moms after the big sublimation patent wars were sorted out?)\n\n\\*\\*To be fair, most of the DTG/UV printers like that at the time were assembled by hand in the US from off the shelf Epson printers without Epson's permission, so some of the cost was actual small-scale labor, fabrication, and electronics.  And the high cost of all professional systems includes in-person training and human tech support from your regional reps at nearly any time of day or night.",

                      "body": "I know ink print heads more than I'd like to admit due to grad school and some of my jobs. While there are a lot of patents around ink print heads, there are a lot of brands out there and with respect to printing something as simple as a UV ink (i.e. not particle loaded, normal viscosity range ~10-20cps), you can pretty much use any branded print head.  Print heads are usually manufactured with a semiconductor/MEMs-like process, so open source for print heads are much more difficult. However, finding the cheapest COTS printhead and building around it is likely, you can find a variety of projects on hackaday for example. \n\nA big challenge with any sort of ink print head is that they dry out and fail. You can do things to keep them from drying out, but from a consumer perspective we are spoiled by low maintenance devices and ink print heads always have *some* routine maintenance such as flushing with a solvent made for the ink, or keeping it plugged in to occasionally jet and refilling the ink as an operating cost even when you're not using the printer. I wouldn't put it past the open source community to find innovative ways to keep printheads from drying out, I did my own sort of 'hacks' at my job, but IMO it's a matter of scale, and I'm not sure if there will be a large enough community to maintain drive in open source UV printers.",

Desktop or mobile.\n* **Keystroke Injection** Instant DuckyScript payloads. No recompiling\u00a0or reprogramming, just click run! And with industry-leading 890keys/sec speeds.\n* **Lots of Payload slots** Basic model comes with 8 slots. Elite has extra storage allowing up to 200 slots!\n* **Global Keymaps** With 192 keymaps already built in, you can target machines across the world.\n* **Built in IDE** The WebUI not only provides 100% of the controls, but also gives you helpful feedback to catch syntax errors while rapidly building payloads.\n* **Mobile Payloads** Cables with a USB-C active end, or Directional C to C, can automatically transmit to mobile devices with a USB-C connector. Connect just the active end!\n* **Stealth** The implant stays dormant until a payload is deployed. No logs. No detections. The cable behaves just like a normal USB 2.0 cable. (5v charging, 480mps data transfer) Spoof any USB identifer (VID/PID), extended USB Identifier, and network MAC address.\n\n* **Hardware Keylogger** Elite models contain a passive hardware keylogger designed for FullSpeed USB keyboards with detachable cables. Store up to 650,000 keystrokes. For tested keyboards & more info go\u00a0[here](https://github.com/O-MG/O.MG-Firmware/wiki/Keylogger).\n* **HIDX StealthLink** Elite models: setup a bidirectional tunnel from Target Host > [O.MG](http://O.MG) \\> Control Machine.\n* **Encrypted Network C2** Elite models: Use an encrypted connection to access & control your O.MG from anywhere. Then disable the onboard WebUI to hide and protect your O.MG on untrusted networks. Compatible with any server that runs python.\n* **Self-Destruct** Make your legal team happy by ensuring sensitive payloads & loot are gone, and the O.MG Cable is fully inert. (recoverable with O.MG Programmer)\n* **Geo-Fencing** Trigger payloads or other actions based on location. Keep your tool from falling out of scope! Ex: self-destruct if someone takes the [O.MG](http://O.MG) Cable home.\n* **WiFi Triggers** Trigger payloads at long range with a single beacon.",

          "body": "3D printing is also a business I've been in for nearly 20 years, and I'm sorry folks, those of you that are trying to envision this machine like a 3D printer or that it could be improved with the ingenuity of the 3D printer/open source community are out of your element.  This is not new, look up DIY DTG and see that there are limits to what is possible.  The electronics and print heads are always going to be proprietary.  The reason why printheads are so expensive is that the manufacturers shut down 3rd party sales years ago, even though they didn't make their own specialty ink, wide-format machines at the time.  They also have electronic lockout systems on them now, as do the ink cartridge readers and ink counters.  The only way to get an OEM printhead from the manufacturer is to have proof of purchase of the machine it was originally installed in, or through one of the few companies authorized to use those heads in the machines that they manufacture.  \n\nThe popularity of this KS will wake the dragon.  Eufy/Anker will have to abide by whatever deal they made (or will be forced to make) with the printhead and print engine manufacturer.  If they are not transparent with that information, then there's a real chance that this machine could be a brick once their supply of printheads runs out, plus it could get tied up in lawsuits like Stratasys vs. Bambu or Sawgrass' patent suits against...everybody. \n\nAnyone who's been in the small-scale commercial printing space knows this already, but the rest of y'all need to understand it as well.  I'm still watching this thing and might buy it, but I may also decide to wait until Christmas when all the OG backers are selling because they can't get parts or support.  One thing I am confident in with the 3D/open source community involved is that the machine itself will be able to be used even without the proprietary software or server communication, and I have a lot of practice working on printheads.  \n\nP.S. - For the newbies that are interested in this thing, inkjet printers have very specific temperature and humidity requirements.  Only one reviewer I saw mentioned that, and most of the others appear as though they had these machines in their garages.  You can't keep it in a garage unless it's temperature controlled, and the little carbon filter is worthless, just like FDM or Resin printing, do not keep this thing unventilated in a living space.",
