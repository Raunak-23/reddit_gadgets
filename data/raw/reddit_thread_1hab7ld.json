I sit about 2.5 feet from a 55 inch display, so 1440p is never going to work for me again.  There are a lot of games that simply cannot be played at anything above 4K60 so that's where my standards have settled.",

It basically means I can still easily identify individual pixels, in an era where that's simply not the norm any longer.\n\n> They even make pixel density calculators for this reason.\n\nI got it for two reasons.  Secondarily, because if I'm staring at a display and I'm reaching \"retina\" levels of clarity, then that means I am leaving some of the display's resolution off the table for no damn good purpose.  The solution to this _is not_ to run games at a lower-than-native resolution, because outside of the idealized scenario where I'm literally using e.g. 1080p on my 4K display, the imperfect divisor (1440p on 4K for example) means I am corrupting the 2D matrix of the game's output and that _does_ manifest visually, even in a hypothetical scenario where the 1440p is still technically \"retina\"\u2014it manifests as moir\u00e9 and aliasing that would not be present on a pixel-perfect output.  When a good display comes out that offers about 6K of resolution, I'll probably be done chasing the perfect combination of resolution and FOV.\n\nPrimarily, I've been on a large-display-as-monitor since 2010.  Once you've experienced it, you don't go back.  The impressive FOV gives any game a visceral quality that you can't achieve without it.  A bit like tapping into the potential of VR but without all the headache and ritual.  And non-gaming productivity is crazy enhanced with a screen this big in front of you.  I couldn't imagine trying to get anything done while squinting at a 32 inch monitor.  I view that prospect with probably the same dubiousness that someone on 32 inches regards the thought of returning to the good old 17 inch days.  The average user might imagine that the solution is to use two+ monitors.  To me, that'd be like taking this big, crystal clear screen and taping horizontal/vertical bars to it so I can partition it.  I thankfully don't have to.",

I run mine at 20/50 brightness for day to day usage, and despite the fact that many elements are on my screen for 12+ hours of every day, I have yet to burn a single thing in.  I use full brightness for things like movies and HDR gaming, and in the latter case I take precautions to avoid static GUI elements.  These are things I understood in advance that I would need to do in order not to ruin the display.  The flipside argument is that I could easily just keep nits below 800 to mimic LG's limitations and then my display would be almost completely burn-in proof just like LG.  But I have the option to not do that.\n\n> odd pixel shape that gives small text a pink hue.\n\nSpeaking as one who is far pickier than 99.9% of folks, overblown.  Also solved by MacType.  The reliable red and blue edges of text with a traditional submatrix is far more noticeable and only gets a pass because it's familiar.\n\n> Apparently Samsung has recently made a QD-LED display that won't have any potential for burn in.\n\nX for doubt.  If it's based on OLED then what it almost certainly means is: _\"We've put a hard cap on maximum brightness and if we figure out it's still not foolproof then we'll lower it again and again via forced firmware.\"_  Samsung unfortunately sucks.  I didn't let this dictate my choice of TV, though.  I was just very careful about what updates I gave my display.  If I'd held off because of the known quantity of burn-in concerns, I'd still be waiting today, whiling away my days on a miserable QLED.",

And anyone suggesting that you're gonna gain from going over 240hz doesn't understand that it's actually a step backwards considering the additional processing power you're gonna have to throw at it to have it run at that framerate, which in turn usually means less eye candy as you're gonna have to compromise settings for literally nothing.\n\nIt's like driving a car going 305mph and going 320 mph in another one.

When you move the mouse around quickly, you can very easily see how many cursors there are on the screen at 60 vs 120.

I can easily see the difference in real world games.\n\nIf the image is scrolling horizontally at 960 pixels per second, and you're playing on a 1080p 60 Hz monitor, that means the monitor effectively looks like a 120 by 1080 pixel resolution monitor. At 480 Hz, it looks like a 960 by 1080 image.\n\nYou could say higher than 480p resolution is niche. Higher than 30 FPS is niche. HDR is niche.\n\nThe thing is, these ultra high refresh rates are just bringing us back to the status quo of motion clarity of games in the 80's played on CRT. Maybe that isn't important to you. That's fine. But it's simply not true that \"There's absolutely no point in it.\" Even an untrained eye can easily see the difference in at least some situations in some games.",

                          "body": "You're missing the point. Whatever gains you have are negligible to begin with. And even if they are significant, they are for a niche category of gaming and even then, it's pointless because what are you expecting to gain exactly?\n\nI grew up in the 90s, watching video tapes on a small TV. The sound quality was horrible, the TV's quality was dogshit. Yet the whole experience was great because if the movie is good enough or the game is good enough it really doesn't matter if you can differentiate between someone's nosehairs or not. Sure, the added steps to higher resolutions, pixel shift times, latencies, refresh rates, etc absolutely add to the experience. But at some point (in this case 240hz) the added frames are adding fuck all to the experience and that's only IF you can actually push these numbers which is going to require the best of the best hardware and even then the vast majority of games aren't gonna run even remotely close to 520 fps to fully benefit from it. Hell 240 is a huge stretch for the majority of games.",

There are monitors with \"Retina\" resolution where any higher pixel density will be indiscernible at an average viewing distance. Why not improve refresh rates until we get to a similar place?\n\nI think the *relative* importance of high frame rates is underestimated when compared to other factors, such as resolution. In some games, especially gamepad-driven side-scrolling games, a 1080P resolution at 480 Hz will look better than 4K resolution at 120Hz, despite both having the same GPU workload in pixels rendered per second (and even if you are viewing the 4K display from a close enough where the resolution increase over 1080P is clearly visible). I think ultra-high framerates are less important in first person mouse drive games, because side to side movement tends to be jerkier / less consistent so your eyes won't be directly tracking the motion of the scene.. \n\nThe original Super Mario Bros has clearer motion on a CRT than on any modern full-persistence screen.\n\n> IF you can actually push these numbers which is going to require the best of the best hardware and even then the vast majority of games aren't gonna run even remotely close to 520 fps to fully benefit from it. Hell 240 is a huge stretch for the majority of games.\n\nThat's currently true for most AAA games, but most of the games I play aren't. Not every game is going to max out every aspect of the display, and some games will benefit more from ultra high framerates than others. \nAnd there are techniques for frame-generation that will enable ultra high frame rates even in AAA games (These techniques are much better than the motion smoothing done by TVs).\n\nAlso, I agree with you that every doubling of framerate is less important than the previous doubling.",

I remember the first Full HD monitor i got. That was a significant step. My first 120hz monitor was a significant step, OLED is a significant step.

So which are those amazing side scrolling games that people play on their 9800x3d / 4090 combo to run at 480hz? People are gonna buy top tier hardware and a 480hz monitor to play side scrolling games? lmao\n\n\n\n>That's currently true for most AAA games, but most of the games I play aren't. Not every game is going to max out every aspect of the display, and some games will benefit more from ultra high framerates than others.\n\nNone of the top 50 most played games are benefitting from these monitors, Not even close. And even if some did, people generally don't have the hardware to push those framerates. \n\nYou're arguing, nitpicking very, very niche reasons why these monitors make sense. But in the grand scheme of things, they are absolutely not worth any investment unless you're some incredible side-scrolling game enthousiast who has epileptic tendencies with lower framerates. \n\n>And there are techniques for frame-generation that will enable ultra high frame rates even in AAA games (These techniques are much better than the motion smoothing done by TVs).\n\nNo, they're not. You're talking frame interpolation. That's not true 480/520/whatever hz. That would be even more silly. \"Boy i can't wait to run this 520hz monitor at half it's framerate and double it with this technique to not render it at it's native 520hz and not benefit from the added frequency at all!\" \n\n>Also, I agree with you that every doubling of framerate is less important than the previous doubling.\n\nThis is always true. Regardless of the number. \n\nLook, i'm fine with these monitors being produced and hitting the market. I'm fine with people buying them (do whatever u want with your money) But there's not a single person who can convince me that these monitors are going to add to the experience. It's like audiophiles, who i'm somewhat one of. Getting a dedicated sound card for your PC is almost never an added experience. Only purists are going to find SOME benefits to it and even then it's close to non existant.",
