The US is at a major cost disadvantage when it comes to battery production, as it just doesn't have the capacity and the cost difference on both raw materials and labor cost is substantial.\n\nYes, firmly agree on all points here.  The US had an opportunity to secure materials in a future-forward posture but leaned into what would benefit the unions and status quo.\n\n>Also by US manufacturing it reads to me that you're comparing specifically to CONUS-based manufacturing, regardless of badge.\n\nYes, but that line gets blurred often because assembly vs. manufacturing is a grey area for most of the automakers these days.  Tesla is the most vertically integrated and make a ton of their own components.\n\n>I personally do expect US-based EV manufacturing to have razor-thin margins until the required battery and motor capacity gets built out, which given the current infatuation with \"light\" trucks, just isn't happening.\n\nThat's exactly right, and it's why Tesla stands out from that crowd because some of the legacy-made US EVs still sell at a loss, whereas Tesla makes a fat profit from every car that they deliver.  Those margins are tighter now given the current economy but the picture is much worse for the legacy automakers.\n\nFord was losing so much money on Lightnings that they halted production in Q4 last year.  A headline about that has limited traction here on Reddit but stagnating Cybertruck sales get everyone excited.  The CT is a piece of shit btw.  I had res'd two of them years ago and when I saw the final product I canceled.\n\nEdit - I went to go look up how much money Ford was losing on their EVs and [found an article](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/24/business/ford-earnings-ev-losses) addressing Q1 last year:\n> **New York CNN** \u2014 Ford\u2019s electric vehicle unit reported that losses soared in the first quarter to $1.3 billion, or **$132,000 for each of the 10,000 vehicles** it sold in the first three months of the year, helping to drag down earnings for the company overall. \n\nAnd that was before Trump canceled the EV tax credits.",

The interior of a nice byd or zeekr is going to be nicer than a Tesla in terms of luxury features and other flourishes.  They  may not have the same quality consistency problems on fit and finish that Teslas do, I just haven't seen enough reporting on that to know for sure.  Part of that is because China just doesn't have the same social media situation that the rest of the world does.\n\nAgain what I'm talking about is the quality and performance of the battery, BMS, motor controller, infotainment package, and safety systems around all that.  It's reasonable to care about fit and finish but if your car has a battery fire randomly start when it's just sitting idle for a few days (again, like what just sank the Morning Midas) you're probably going to care more about that than panel gaps and USB ports.",

The buyer is happy.\n\nSmall Undetected Changes:\nOver time, tiny cost-saving shortcuts are introduced: cheaper materials, thinner plastic walls, less adhesive, cheaper paints, looser tolerances. These changes are small enough not to be noticed immediately.\n\nCumulative Degradation:\nEach incremental change by itself may not trigger alarm bells, but after many iterations, product quality has degraded substantially \u2014 often without the buyer noticing until customers start to complain or failure rates increase.\n\nDelayed Discovery:\nBy the time the buyer catches the degradation, they\u2019ve been receiving subpar goods for months or years, and the factory has been pocketing the savings.\n\nBuyer Vulnerability:\nFactories assume many Western buyers don\u2019t have the time, resources, or technical ability to inspect every batch, so the incentive to slowly \"fade\" quality is very strong.\n\nThe reason that Chinese products have this reputation is due to quality fade. It isn't that they aren't capable of producing a high quality item, it is that they try to maximize profits by producing lower quality versions that resemble higher quality products. This isn't exclusive to chinese manufacturers, but China being the world's largest manufacturer it is prominent in people's psyche.",

The Chinese have had nuclear submarines since 1980. Nuclear fleets need logistics to support it. Making a nuclear carrier would be liken getting a good gpu without the power supply to use it. Nuclear subs are designed to complete their objectives alone. Carriers need half a dozen other types of ships and air compliments, both of which the Chinese never had until now. Even their UAVs and AWACs were considered pretty sub par up until 2020, when the KJ-500 was seen. \n\nAny naval buildup being successful is reliant on following the right steps. Most carriers are barely operational as it is (looking at India sending its fleet out with barely any support). The Chinese use of turbines in their first carrier makes a lot of sense as well, the rest of their fleet has no forward base and no support to function that far. It also decommissions the carrier for a year or so every 2 decades to replace the nuclear fuel. Given the age of the type 1 and functions of the type 2, it makes no sense to use nuclear fuel for ships with limited lifespans and limited range. The type 1 carrier would need replacing before the end of the decade at this point and it only has probably another 20 years tops. I haven\u2019t even touched on costs, but there\u2019s a whole host of issues and strategic implications why they only considered nuclear carriers now. There is a big misconception that nuclear means better which it doesn\u2019t.",

The USA created aircraft carriers with nuclear propulsion with zero experience making nuclear aircraft carriers and it was done with less knowledge and worse technology than we have now.\n\nWhy do you think this would ever be an issue for any modern superpower to do what another country accomplished in 1965? France completed one in the early 2000s and the Soviets had a half constructed one when they collapsed.\n\nHave you also considered how exactly is China going to get a nuclear carrier to study? You think the USA will just casually sell them one? China doesn't have a F-22 or a F-35 they could just  engineer a stealth fighter from but yet they still built and designed the J-22 and the J-35. Curious isn't it? Countries being able to design things on their own using known scientific principles without a direct reference?",

The Chinese have had nuclear submarines for decades at this point. The reason why the type 3 is not nuclear is that it\u2019s not intended to go across the pacific.

And if someone takes an idea and does it better or cheaper than the person who came up with it, well I'm sure the guy who created Hydrox cookies will buy them a drink at the bar, it's a natural process, in my opinion.",

Nobody is arguing that anyone should have permanent ownership of an idea, which patents respect - they expire after 20 years. Just like gunpowder eventually became knowledge for everyone, so will every patented technology. Even more so, with the semiconductor industry, we generally begin licensing technology immediately, meaning its benefits become global immediately; you just need to toss the patent-holder a few bucks here and there.",

The reason most other commercial companies failed to redevelop these technology is generally because it won't be commercially competitive against the incumbent, but since China is being blockaded anyway, this actually creates the perfect environment to redevelop the technology. The blockade is what creates the market opportunity, as China have a really big vested interest in making this work, the company that is trying to get this work done will get the full support of China.\u00a0\n\n\n\nSure there might be missing bits and pieces that they would have to redevelop, and lots of it. But once you know that something is possible and a general direction to go to, it wouldn't take as much time as the original invention to reinvent them from scratch.\u00a0\n\n\nReally, the only thing that can prevent this rise and sabotage China's attempt would be to lift the trade blockade, just at the right time, so the company dissolve itself before they reach their goal. That will kill the Chinese market for their sub par hardware and makes the company unviable. But that will only do so much",

Most of its chip factories were constructed in the past three years, and they boast far superior design, management, and process standards compared to factories built years or even decades earlier. These new facilities also leverage higher levels of intelligent management, leading to greater efficiency, higher production output, and lower production costs.\n\n>China has already established a complete chip supply chain, including design software, production equipment, chip design, wafer manufacturing, chip packaging, testing, materials, and industrial gases.\n\n>Additionally, the competition among dozens of chip factories within China is driving prices lower and improving quality. This intense internal competition is a key factor behind the rapid growth of Chinese chip products in global markets.\n\n>By 2026, competition in chip manufacturing is expected to extend into advanced manufacturing technologies. By 2028, China is highly likely to account for roughly half of the world\u2019s output in advanced chip production\n\nSource: https://thechinaacademy.org/the-chip-war-is-nearing-its-end-as-china-chips-in/\n\nBut you are somewhat correct. Right now China is at 7nm trying to get decent 5nm yields. While TSMC is at 3nm rolling out 2nm.

But at the end of the day it's a system integration job (think: ASML machines) combined with some proprietary technology and methods. Meanwhile the Nvidia GPUs are completely proprietary and 100% a design job, meaning it's far more theoretically complicated.\n\nIt should be clear to anyone that design>manufacturing, always. R&D is always academically harder (and thus \"more advanced\") than production, and I'm saying this as a plant engineer. Design and R&D always precede production, because duh? How else would it even work?\n\nChina is behind on the design of the chips more than anything else, not production. That is the NEXT hurdle. It doesn't matter if you have competitive chip designs if you can't make them or make them fast enough.",

My guess\u2026 off nothing changes, about 10 to 15 years. Maybe less.",

However, a recent Geekbench listing suggests its performance is closer to that of the 13-year-old GeForce GTX 660 Ti or the 10-year-old Radeon R9 370. \n\n> On the surface, the specifications and benchmark results suggest that the G100 is a severely underpowered GPU \u2013 at least a decade behind modern offerings from Nvidia and AMD. However, it seems unlikely that a 6nm card would actually ship with such outdated hardware in 2025.\n\nI kind of concur with the article that it's unlikely these specs are representative. Why would they spend on 6nm just to launch a card that has specs likely comparable with mobile SOCs that China is already pumping out en masse? \n\n> What likely happened here is that the test was conducted during the sampling stage, where unoptimized firmware and drivers resulted in the low reported VRAM and clock speeds.\n\nPerhaps they just had minimal capabilities enabled to sanity check a sample unit, and accidentally uploaded the benchmark. \"Unoptimized\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here.",

However, I\u2019d like to highlight a few challenges:\n\n\n\n(1) Market Performance: Chinese GPUs' performance still lag behind top-tier products from Nvidia and AMD. This limits their appeal in the global market. However, I've noticed some Chinese users purchasing these GPUs as collector's items to show support.\n\n(2) Game Developer Support: Most Western game developers do not optimize their games for Chinese GPUs. On the bright side, Chinese game developers are working on producing more high-quality games, which could help.\n\n(3) Restricted Access to Advanced Lithography: Due to well-known U.S. sanctions. Need to wait for Chinese EUV.\n\n  \nMaybe I can get a laptop with Chinese CPU and GPU within the next decade.",

              "body": "Thanks for your reply.\n\n\n\n(1) The issue is that Chinese GPUs are currently far behind, and their cost is also high. Most supporters purchase them to show goodwill rather than actual gaming. In addition, the government focuses more on subsidizing non-gaming specific chips. So, I don't think the market will change as quickly as some posts suggest.\n\nSince you mentioned BYD, I\u2019d also like to point out that BYD has been working extremely hard for almost 30 years to become a game-changer in the automobile industry. I would expect a similar timeline for Chinese GPUs to reach dominance.\n\n\n\n(2) I believe this is not just a GPU issue but also a game development issue. In-game performance depends heavily on developers\u2019 optimization. I consider this to be the biggest challenge, since I have tasted strong negative sentiment toward China during my stay in the U.S. The good news is that once the \u201cbroken window\u201d effect takes place, the situation could improve quickly.\n\n\n\n(3) I agree with your first and second points. However, each has some minor issues. \n\nThe first one relates more to common production problems, which can be improved through continuous manufacturing over 1-2 years.\n\nI am 100% sure the second approach is the main focus. I've seen many professionals return to China for semiconductor-related research, including my former Ph.D. supervisor. I have no doubt that the U.S. sanctions will eventually fail. However, even after EUV is developed, it will still take time to shift into mass production phase of both the machines and the chips.\n\nRegarding the last point, manufacturing facilities require regular maintenance, which makes the demand similar to that of developing the entire system.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I expect 3-5 years for EUV and chip production, an addition 2-3 years for GPUs to catch up, and another 2\u20133 years for global game developers to adapt.\n\n\n\nAnyway, credit to Trump(\u5ddd\u5efa\u56fd) and Biden(\u62dc\u632f\u534e), for ending the debate over self-sufficiency in China.",
