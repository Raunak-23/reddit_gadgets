They did practically everything you could think of that would qualify as a smart watch: heart rate, stress, quick reply texts, check calls and decline, weather widget, social media notifications, music controls, news headlines...they even told me when someone (and who) unlocks my door. \n\nThe referenced photo may not be a Galaxy Fit, but a similar form factor isn't probative of them being a smart watch. I actually really enjoyed how lightweight and feature-rich mine were for 10-20% of the price of full-sized watches. \n\nEdit: I think that's a Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 4. Definitely a smartwatch.",

Instead you had to send the user through file picker APIs that returned abstract IDs (don't recall the name) instead of file paths.  (Those were always awful to deal with so the first thing we always did was copy the file into the app directory for future use.)  In theory, forcing apps to use that approach should have been an improvement since it was the only way to reach files in cloud storage; but every provider we tested ended up needing slightly different code to get a local copy of the file so it still didn't just work.",

Wired headphones also just work, and can be \"paired\" with infinite number of devices. They work on planes if you want to watch a movie from the plane entertainment system. If you only have wireless headphones, you have to watch your own media. Having a headphone port on a phone doesn't mean you can't use wireless headphones. However removing the port means you are stuck with wireless only (unless you carry a dongle).\n\nIt's also backwards compatible with a zillion devices. My gym has a speaker system that the instructor needs to plug in a device so that they can pipe in music (relaxing music for yoga and trademarked Les Mills music for other classes). The stereo system uses a standard 3.5mm jack for audio-in. Instructors have to bring their own dongle (because people would lose or steal the dongle if the gym provides it). The 3.5mm cable is zip-tied to the stereo. Instructors have been bringing in their own iPods or dongles.",

You are not.\n\n> what difference is 1mm thickness going to make?\n\nYou are asking this as if it's a completely negligible difference. My phone today is only 8mm thick, so 1mm is 12.5% of the total, that's not insignificant.\n\nNow, would I be fine if my phone was 1mm thicker? Of course. But how about 2mm? Or 3mm? Where does it end? I've had like a dozen smartphones of various thickness, I survived through all of them. The point is I just prefer thinner/lighter over thicker/heavier, and I don't particularly have any need for what thicker/heavier would gain us... like more battery life, I'm fine with my battery life as is.\n\nThat's my opinion. You have your own opinion. Neither of us are weird for these opinions. Grow up.\n\n>Do you wear skin tight pants or something?\n\nNo, I just don't like thick/heavy shit in my pockets, and there's nothing weird about that.\n\n>Also, the parent comment complaining about the thinness has over 600 likes, so your take is still the outlier.\n\nLet's take it a step further... this comment is on an article about this product existing in the first place. They wouldn't be making these if there wasn't any market for it. I'm not an outlier in the slightest.",

My iPhone 11 Pro and 15 Pro are literally 1mm thicker than my iPhone 7, and the difference was immediately apparent when I first got my 11 Pro.\n\n>I was using performance as a catch all. I mostly meant battery.\n\nOK? Those two things aren't the same thing.\n\n>I'm just annoyed that they're already so thin you can't lay them flat without a case on them because of the cameras.\n\nOK... but you don't seem to have any issue with the phone being bulkier, so just use a case and problem solved? My wife has a case for her phone specifically so it can lay flat. Solved issue.\n\n> I say it's a novelty because you failed to articulate any reason why you NEED it to be even thinner than it already is.\n\nNo, I didn't fail to articulate my opinion at all, actually. Just because you don't agree with my point of view doesn't mean you just get to arbitrarily invalidate it.\n\nWhy do you need more battery life? Because you want it. That's it. That's all the explanation needed. And I'm not questioning you and calling you a weirdo for wanting something I don't want/need.\n\nWhy do I want my phone to be thinner/lighter? Because I want it. That's it. That's all the explanation needed. Why is it so hard for you to accept that I want something that you don't?\n\n>There's a mountain of difference between the added utility of not having a briefcase to hold your phone you can now fit in your pocket and shrinking making something a hair smaller.\n\nSo the point just went completely over your head, huh?\n\nWhere is the line with you? I asked this question and you never answered. Just 1mm thicker is no big deal, you say... right? Well if 1mm thicker isn't a big deal, what about 2mm? What about 3mm? Where's the line? Where is the limit? No really, give me a real answer.\n\nI'll give you a preview of my response... whatever you think is a fine size, I want it thinner/lighter. Imagine that, people have different opinions. I don't have a problem respecting yours... what's so hard for you about respecting mine?\n\n>Clearly you have the soft skinned type of job that likes razor thin bendable phones\n\nHey look, more baseless insults from the guy who claimed he was the one interested in having an honest discussion. What a surprise.\n\nI worked on TV sets carrying heavy equipment around all day when the iPhone 6 came out, the thinnest model iPhone there ever was. I never had a case on it, and never once had an issue with bending. Imagine that.\n\n>with no battery life \n\nThis is objectively false. Like what phone are you even using today that this is such a problem for you? It's not 2012 anymore. Most people today do not struggle with battery life like you seem to be.\n\n>and companies prioritize your wants and needs \n\nDude there are sooooooo many phone models available today. If one model doesn't meet your needs, don't get so bent out of shape about it. Just go buy a different one. This is an absolutely insane take you've got going on here.\n\n>because you can afford such novelties\n\nSo do you not own a smartphone or something? Most people can afford phones. I get that some people can't, but me being able to afford a smartphone doesn't put me in some elite class... the vast majority of people have them.\n\n> It's just annoying for those of us that work for a living.\n\nUh.... I do work for a living. Thanks. I don't know where you are getting the idea I'm some rich person without a job.",

One time I asked \u201cwhy this direction? Are consumers even asking for this?\u201d\n\nAnd the head of product said \u201cthe consumer has no idea what they want.\u201d And the head of marketing chimed in \u201cit\u2019s our job to tell them what they want.\u201d\n\nI sat back and pondered that for a minute. Year after year the company would push new cool shit, and consumers would absolutely eat it up. It was wild how good the marketing team was at what they did. \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. At the end of the day when you take into consideration a development cycle, which can be something like 3 years from idea to production\u2026. If you\u2019re just responding to consumers today, you\u2019re gonna be 3 years too late when the product hits the market. So there\u2019s some merit to what they do when designing the next generation of product.\n\nAll that said\u2026. Sometimes products totally flop. Just the way it is\u2026 product development cycles and marketing is absolutely fascinating sometimes.",
