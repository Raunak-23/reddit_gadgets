Play a game long enough and you will absolutely hear the same background chatter lines over and over and over again. You simply cannot have so much background chatter that there is no overlap and no repetitions. IMO this is the perfect use case for AI generated voice stuff especially since it can make NPCs respond better to the going-ons of the main story. But  obviously do not touch any named characters with this. Leave it for nameless background NPCs only. Using AI generated lines for names characters breaks immersion IMO because it will inevitably get a bit weird with the responses. But it should be fine for Random Nameless Peasant #43 to generate some lines about how his pockets have holes or he heard someone took care of the nearby bandit camp yesterday.",

In reality, the AI features will disproportionally effect and be useful to the smaller companies and make them more competitive with the larger companies. The large companies will of course still try to sell $70 slop and microtransactions on top. But Ai will only make the market more competitive. Smaller devs that create and sell games at lower prices with be able to make higher quality products than they would otherwise. And this in turn drives prices down. Of course most AAA will try to maintain their high prices, but in the end they'll prob just hurt their bottom line doing that. \n\nNot saying this in any way benefits workers AI would replace. just pointing out facts and likely outcomes.",

I dunno, I guess working directly in game dev I\u2019m a bit more helpful but these new AI based cores are better for more of the Machine Learning style brains and AI from my understanding. These are tools we can develop and use in game dev to make them more performant and give us room for the other nice bells and whistles. Currently behavior trees are pretty much industry standard, maybe a state machine for simpler logic. They still require a decent number of ticks and when multiplied across multiple npcs in game it can add up. You start to hit a limit at how quickly your game can run when you have complex AI mixed with the high end graphics mixed with audio, etc. I think GPUs have already hit more of the upper limit on what they can do with ray tracing and lighting and handling beautiful graphics. \n\nNow the next logical step is to take some of that burden off and simplify some things like AI behaviors or maybe even frame interpolation through ML models that make the program run even faster. I can think of one form game that would benefit heavily from that: VR. \n\nWith VR basically needing to render two different views in the game simultaneously some sort of AI based frame generation would give some massive performance gains and let developers add some really detailed, large worlds into them. \n\nCombine that with the level of artistry you can see in Half life Alyx and I think you\u2019d have a pretty amazing experience.",

The deeper point is that the push for gear is ignoring the reason why gear is bought in the first place, the games.\u00a0\n\nThere are plenty of video essays on the topic of the inflation in video game engine inefficiencies, driven mainly because of these spec heavy, AI heavy GPUs. Where are the games that are actually pushing realism? Even CP 2077 isn\u2019t that visually impressive given the amount of horsepower that was needed to run other visually impressive games a decade ago. Yes the textures are sharper and light can bounce in real time instead of relying on a dev to bake them in.
