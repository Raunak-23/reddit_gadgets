He\u2019d love to play Windows games, but we can play most of them with him on his Mac Studio. He wouldn\u2019t want a large desktop but would be happy with a mini PC.",

I understand that PC gaming is often less value for money than comparable consoles, but unless you\u2019re particularly drawn to the mini PC concept, I don\u2019t see much reason to buy it. You could either get a PS5 and get comparable performance for half the price in a larger package, or you could buy a regular desktop PC for roughly the same amount and get better performance. If you\u2019re on the Nvidia side, you\u2019ll get upscaling that\u2019s more competent, and if you\u2019re on the AMD or Intel side, you\u2019ll get a much better deal. Well at least I think so, or how much would it cost to build a comparable desktop PC to how much one of these costs?",

It\u2019s going to depend a lot on how expensive that GPU is and how interested people actually are in this sort of mini PC concept.\n\nAs for the games that can run, probably most games as the 4060 is capable of running a vast majority of titles that have come out recently. I just think that we rely a lot on upscaling for these lower end GPUs and if you\u2019re forced to use the basic FSR 3 upscaler from AMD over something like DLSS 4 from Nvidia you\u2019re going to have less visual fidelity than comparable NVIDIA powered PCs.",

Not your fault, so is the article. This is not a gaming PC (it can game, but it's not a gaming PC). This is an Productivity, and AI machine through an through.

Lets forget about the RAM, lets forget about anything else. Just the raw CPU horsepower.\n\nYou keep saying things about a laptop that will smoke this, and no, they don't exist. At least not without a major markup. Trust me, I handle procurement for this type of stuff, and I have tried. We have been waiting for a top TDP AI MAX system since the announcement of those chips because they offer unmatched performance.\n\nNow add in a GPU somewhere in the mobile 4060/4070 class and the lowest latency RAM possible on the entire x86 architecture at the moment.\n\nI encourage you to check out AMD's spec sheet for the AI MAX+ 395. This is no ordinary laptop processor mini-pc. This processor is more akin to a Detuned Desktop 9950X than it is to any laptop chip.\n\nhttps://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-plus-395.html\n\nAnd no, handling and rendering 8K video on a mobile system is not child's play. At least, not if you want it done in a reasonable amount of time in a system that isn't thermal throttling. Yes. I could easily build a PC that, while slightly larger will out perform it for similar money. But warranty is a huge deal, and going through a single company is WAY better than dealing with many.\n\nFWIW, we were about to buy the HP system with similar specs when those became available. This let us order first, so we took a risk. I don't own a Framework device, nor own any stock in the company. They are simply the first to the market with a full TDP AI MAX system.",

If they used socketed RAM, significantly hurting the speed and defeating the point of going with Strix Halo, they might as well go all the way and use a socketed AM5 processor as well right, to not \"tarnish their reputation\"? But then all Framework is doing is making a prebuilt MiniITX PC with standard parts with their own custom case and motherboard. What would be the point of that as a product? There would be zero repairability advantage over a standard MiniITX machine and they wouldn't even be cheaper compared to going DIY or buying from their larger competitors.\n\nSomething like this is the only way a Desktop Framework PC makes sense really, creating a device which would sell regardless of who made it, but make it as repairable and upgradeable as they can. Other brands would put this in a non-standard miniPC motherboard form factor, Framework made it so you can just buy the board standalone and throw it into virtually any PC case, with all the header and connectors following standard practice.\n\nOf course we would all prefer the RAM to be modular, but this product could not exist without the RAM being Soldered. Just like we would love our Laptop CPUs to be socketed, but the whole Framework lineup wouldn't exist if we insisted on that.",

There's just only so much you can do to manage signal quality at those speeds, the shorter the distance the better, and needing a socket, pins, pads, and the geometry of the sticks, there's only so far you can go.\n\nI'm guessing there will be some DDR6 motherboards with soldered ram marketed as premium gaming boards for maximum transfer speeds, but I doubt DDR7 will even work with the current stick based form factor of ram. Maybe a flat panel that plugs in on the back of the motherboard directly behind the CPU. Soldered CPUs might also start showing up for the same reason",

It's notable because it's based on *Strix Halo*. If you go back to all the various threads regarding product launches of Strix Halo handhelds and laptops, they're filled with people asking for it to be in a mini PC. That's the market Framework is choosing to capitalize on, not simply general use office or gaming PCs. \n\nThat SOC does not and most likely *cannot* exist in anything except soldered BGA form with soldered RAM. As a result, if Framework wants to cater to the Strix Halo mini PC niche market, then modularity is by necessity going to be more limited than ordinary desktops - which I'm pretty sure most of the prospective customers in that market understand.\n\nIf Strix Halo didn't exist, Framework almost certainly would not have entered the desktop market either.\n\n>Lastly, you got a link to that Linus video?\n\nSure, here you go.\n\n[My Framework Investment Should NOT Have Worked Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lErGZZgUbY)\n\nThe part where they discuss upgradeable RAM starts at 7:25.",

You can already build a Mini-ITX machine in this form factor with whatever parts you want.

They made the motherboard fit a Mini-ITX footprint, meaning you can put different hardware in the case or transfer the board to an off the shelf option. They kept the storage and wireless card socketed, used industry standard connectors, headers, and components where possible, so you can use a standard PC power supply with the board, use standard fans, etc. They even exposed a 4x PCIe slot on the board, even though there is no room of an expansion card in the compact case.",

I think this would look nice in a home theater set up. Could double as a karaoke/light gaming box for game nights. \n\nWorking with mITX was such a pain I would pay a premium not to have to do it again...",

(Skip 3.0 that never happened.)\n\nExpressCard 1.0 is essentially a single lane PCIe 1.0 lane plus USB 2.0. ExpressCard 2.0 bumped up USB to 3.0 but made the PCIe 2.0 upgrade \\*optional\\* so the few devices using the new standard might only have PCIe 1.0.\n\nExpressCard 4.0 should utilize the full 54mm width with all the extra used for PCIe lanes, at least version 3.0. It should also be backwards compatible with all ExpressCard 2.0 and 1.0 cards. Make the connector with a step and guide rails so old narrow cards will be guided to the right spot, and old 54mm cards will plug right in as they do in previous slots. A PCIe x4 3.0 connection is faster than USB C.\n\nFramework's laptop modules aren't revolutionary. They're just USB C devices or adapters inna small box.",
