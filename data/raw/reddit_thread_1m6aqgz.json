It isn't necessary. GPUs and upscaling tech has advanced to the point that even GPUs considered mid range are fine for 4k, let alone 1440p, and the vast majority of gamers are still on 1080p.\n\nI built a brand new setup this summer to replace my old one and I had been planning to use the 9070 XT for 18 months or so and then replace it with AMDs next flagship but so far it's handled everything I've thrown at it in 4k just fine so I'm not even sure I will bother next gen.",

Here\u2019s how it usually goes:\n\n- nvidia set new performance standard (and price point)\n\n- half way through the generation, AMD release slightly lesser product for marginal price cut\n\n- nvidia release a refresh/price point gap filler that directly competes with AMDs product \n\nThis basically creates a loop where people wait for AMD to release something knowing full well that nvidia has a product waiting to fill a void. True competition would be getting a like for like product that offers substantial financial incentive to buy. The last 10 years have simply been quarrels over marginal differences in 600-1200 cards.",

          "body": "The rumors when AMD canceled their high end RDNA 4 chiplet designs, was that they moved the resources over to UDNA development and were planning to pull it ahead as much as possible. \n\nCurrent rumors are that UDNA might enter mass production as soon as Q2 2026, (obviously take published rumors with a grain of salt, they are not always accurate)\n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-udna-radeon-gaming-gpus-enter-mass-production-q2-2026-sony-ps6-expected-to-utilize-next-gen-architecture/](https://wccftech.com/amd-udna-radeon-gaming-gpus-enter-mass-production-q2-2026-sony-ps6-expected-to-utilize-next-gen-architecture/)\n\nThe latest Nvidia rumors I heard were that the 50xx series Super cards would be launching end of 2025 possibly December. \n\nIf both of those rumors do pan out to be true it seems likely that UDNA will be launching in roughly the mid point between the 50xx series Super cards and the 60xx series.",

And I'm sorry but I don't believe the 90 series extra performance somehow is magically special (coming from a 90 series owner).\n\nAs for things being better value, it is all relative. Nvidia made the price gap smaller on 80 vs 90 series, and not in the consumer friendly way. Not to mention some people don't have PC budget for 90 series, or some plan ahead knowing they will upgrade earlier and therefore buys a lower tier model (that still has great performance btw..)",
