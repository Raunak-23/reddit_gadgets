The reviewers are doing their job by pointing out that the mobile 5090 is nowhere near the desktop version because Nvidia will continue to market it as if it is to people who don't know any better and manufacturers who charge as if it has a full 5090 in there.\n\nTo you they are pointing out the obvious, but most people would not know the difference between them since Nvidia insists on calling it a 90 class chip. The same people who may look up a review before buying one.",

Seems like the obvious solution and would still have the \"5080\" in it which is the important part. It is the same graphics card/processors after all isn't it? Just massively underclocked to keep the heat down. Makes no difference to me because obviously laptop versions are a slowed down version but to a person new to pc gaming it'll help them a lot. Would help with googling too. \n\nI dont think it really does help them much more from the marketing side compared to if they put an \"M\" at the end so they should just do it.",

That group wants a gaming PC but is intimidated by building a desktop so they get a laptop instead. \n\nMy cousin bought a 3070 laptop and used it for like 6 months. He came over with it and my 3060ti desktop was beating his in performance by like 5 to 10 percent in a game we were playing. Then he put on his undervolt/overclock settings, and so did I, and the gap increased to 10 to 15 percent. He assumed 3070 is faster than 3060ti because the number is higher. That's the type of person they are trying to trick.",
