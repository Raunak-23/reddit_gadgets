Plus, the eink screens are slow and not really meant for what people use phones for. It works great for reading in my experience, not much else. Not to mention screen fragilty most models have issues with. And price tags on the devices. So while I would be ecstatic for an eink phone, it wouldn't be able to replace my current phone, there would have to be some drastic improvements. Even as a dumb phone i'd be hesitant.",

You ever hit a Polaroid on its edge prior to developing? It delaminates in a similar fashion, but the laminate became more stable once the developer paste was spread through the laminate. Neither the screens, nor the undeveloped film, were intended to be handled outside of their cases, so they didn\u2019t see it as a big issue.\n\nI know, because I worked with the same engineers at Polaroid prior to the company shutting down, and then again when I developed the distribution packaging for their 6\u201d screens to travel from the screen plant to the customer who installs them into their devices. At the time, that was mainly Foxconn, but some manufacturers were taking smaller scale screens as well (like the Pebble watch).",

My quibble is that they are making a device that's called \"Minimal phone\" that they purport is a minimal phone but\u2026it's not even close to that.\n\nIf this device ticks the boxes that people want then that's a good thing but don't misrepresent what it is. It's an e-ink tablet with other functions such as cameras and a phone.\n\nThe Light Phone is *much* closer to a minimal phone than the Minimal Phone. By the way, I also think the Light Phone is far too bulky and could be trimmed down quite a bit but it certainly is a very interesting device..",

A minimal phone is\u2026a phone.\n\nThis seems to be in a very odd space where it has cut down physical aspects, but still quite large. It has a simple display, but still has stuff like both a back and front camera. It has a keyboard which takes up a large amount of room, especially that huge navigation bar. Not to mention the gigantic bezels.\n\nIt seems stuck between a modern smartphone and a large e-reader tablet, I think they could have gone much further in making it minimal and then they would have had a compelling product. This is just a crappy smartphone without many of the benefits of being truly minimal.\n\nI can get behind the e-ink and keyboard parts but drop the cameras, thin the bezels, make that nav bar more part of the keyboard, drop the idea of it *also* being an e-reader. Someone who wants a true minimal phone would probably want it to be mostly a phone with a few extras rather than a e-reader with a phone tacked on.",
