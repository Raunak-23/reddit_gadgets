Pretty much all products do, weather it be the specific parts or due to the raw materials.\n\nIf all of those rods were to suddenly become unavailable new, or were to have their prices multipled because of tariffs, do you think the prices of used rods won't also *immediately* sky rocket?\n\nSame goes for things like seeds, backpacks, discs, yes even gun supplies, will ALL be impacted. \n\nThere is pretty much no product on earth that is *exclusively* made in the US, down to the raw materials. Like for a bullet, sure maybe the bullets are *assembled* in the US, but the infrastructure to gather the raw materials that actually make up that bullet simply isn't available in the US, it's shipped from other countries, that are all getting large tariffs.",

Most notably, the \"Just make it in the USA\" section, and all the sections where they interview the company \"Hyte\" and go through their numbers. It's not just going to be complex parts that are screwed by this.\n\nHyte makes PC cases, they're pretty much just metal and glass, maybe some rubber gaskets, and according to the numbers they give, they go from making 5 bucks per case they sell, to losing almost 100 *per unit sold*.\n\nTo use your fishing rod example again, think of EVERYTHING that makes up a fishing rod, every little piece, every single raw material. It could be dozens if not HUNDREDS of companies who, at some point, have contributed some part or material to some component in that rod, and at some point those companies either had to pay a tariff, or are based in the US and source all their materials in the US.\n\nSomething as simple as paint, the labels on the can, the ink in those labels, the printers that print them, the adhesive that sticks it, the parts in that printer, the metal the can is made of, every single chemical or dye that makes the paint function, ALL of it needs to be based entirely in the US, with parts *also* made from raw materials harvested in the US, and that's just for the dang paint on this fishing rod.\n\nSo with tariffs, that paint gets more expensive, the metal it's made of gets more expensive, the line gets more expensive, workers in the US require higher pay, building manufacturing is more expensive in the US, everything. And that cost simply gets passed down the line to the consumer, for every part that has gone up in price.\n\nWeather you pay a tariff directly at checkout or not, you're paying the cost of it.",

Despite pretty light usage, I\u2019ve had to replace the hand grips and thumbsticks after they started falling apart.\n\nAnother thing that doesn't get mentioned enough with controllers is how the face buttons often feel loose.

Support was no help and told me to seek return via Amazon, Amazon said talk to 8bitdo support. Just bought another and returned defective.    \n2nd ultimate c had a weird issue tied to software. It wasn\u2019t a software bug. The triggers could not be set to a value lower than ~10 without them bugging out in game. If I had them set to 11, no prob. Small issue but i still returned.   \n3rd ultimate c has had no issues so far, about a year after purchase. I\u2019ve only had to recalibrate once.    \n\nI also My first ultimate c had really nasty buttons that would scrape. Like the plastic mold was defective, and a bumper had no tactile response but still showed input. Instantly retuned, and have had no issues ~a year after purchase.    \n\nI use the ultimate wired as my main. I mainly play fps.    \nThe only reason I kept the ultimate c was because I enjoy playing rhythm games with it. Clone hero and fortnite festival feel so good with the ultimate c over the ultimate wired.    \n\nThe software is alright, it works. I only use it on console and save profiles to carry over to pc. The software on pc looks sketch.    \nThe ultimate c had lighting bugs that were later fixed via update.\nCalibrating the ultimate wired is great, you do through the app and there\u2019s visuals. Triggers and joysticks. 4 profiles.    \nThe ultimate c on the other hand is weird to calibrate. The documentation doesn\u2019t show how to, and I had to look it up. It also has you calibrate the triggers and joysticks at the same time with no visuals or any indication it has completed a calibration step. It has no app support aside from updates.    \n\n\nOne weird bug on both is that on Xbox, I can\u2019t select the \u201cmute mic\u201d option via the Xbox menu.    \nSince the ultimate wired has a mute switch, and when I play festival/clone hero I don\u2019t use a mic, it doesn\u2019t bother me but it\u2019s soemthing to note.    \n\nI don\u2019t notice a big difference in stick accuracy vs the first party Xbox controllers tbh. And I\u2019ve never had a stick drift issue since xb1 onwards even though I play a lot of fps\u2019. Ny 2 controllers (since ~2013) I\u2019ve broken have been because I dropped them and the trigger/bumper have gotten damaged.    \n\n\nWhat I thought was no drift on the first party Xbox controller was just a forgiving deadzone. Being able to set it to 0-100 with no deadzone is weird at first. Very responsive. The deadzone on the Xbox cons feels like ~20 on the 8bitdo?    \n\nI won\u2019t go back to controllers without this customization though; Trigger and joystick deadzone options, in-app calibration, and profiles.    \nHall effect or tmr joysticks/ triggers, and micro switch buttons.",

Some stuff is going to take decades to build up factories & the skill required, and that's assuming companies even bother due to the increased cost of running businesses in the US. It also doesn't help when all the factory tools & raw resources are tariffed just as much as the finished goods.\n\nIf you want to bring manufacturing jobs into the US, you need the carrot to encourage factory building and training, and the stick to tariff finished products, but not the raw resources/tools that the factories use.
