So I would sort of expected if they're running an old DOS system it's not properly issuing HLT's. This means the CPU effectively doesn't get to idle which would drive power usage up significantly on modern hardware.

                      "body": "There are advantages to virtualization, however it not only depends on the application but the hardware involved.\n\nTo give an example, an old customer of mine used a stenography machine that outputted on 3.5\" floppy disc's. The software to output transcripts only ran in DOS, nothing else. The key dongle demanded serial and output was txt files or parallel port postscript printer. Finding a serial, parallel, and ps/2 ports on a modern board is asking a lot. Then you have getting the files off that computer and onto something with internet access as most clients are now asking for digital files. Virtualization means USB is translated before DOS sees it. Making using a modern machine a lot easier and cheaper. Pass through folders mounted as drives means you can pass files to the host which is on the internet. This application demanded virtualization as the old hardware was going extinct.\n\nIn other cases an \"upgrade\" actually reduces features or gets rid of something a shop actually needs. So you maintain old software in virtual machines that fit on a USB key and replacement  just involves installing the virtualization software on the new machine.",

Their booking software was custom built on DOS. Original dev long gone. \n\nThe computer finally shit itself and they had to upgrade. I had to go through the (very basic) code and figure out how to get it running on the new machine. Ended up just using DOSBox to run it and built a batch file to launch it with all the settings they needed. \n\nIt was really fun figuring out how it all worked from knowing nothing about it.",

Certified and tested hardened hardware takes time to reach the market, generally 10+ years, so once it gets to actual costumers it's already outdated compared to similar, not hardened hardware.\n\nFor example, Perseverance launched in 2020: it's CPU is a radiation hardened, underpowered version of a PowerPC G3 processor that was launched in *1997*. The radiation hardened version launched in 2001 but the first time it flown was 2005, 8 years after the launch. Ingenuity, that landed with it, was a revolutionary and very experimental probe in that sense because it didn't use radiation hardened electronic but only shielding and indeed used an off the shelf 2014 SoC and so it was much, much more powerful than Perseverance.",

The 3270 terminal was also designed for building menus and grids, and minimising data transfer by being able to update individual areas of the terminal instead of the whole screen.\n\n\nAnd OS2200 is a transactional operating system. The whole purpose of the OS is to crunch numbers in real-time in a multiprocessor multi-user environment.  \nYou don't have programs or apps, you have tasks and activities. They are pushed to a queue with very limited ability to run persistant background processes - it has fine grained pre-emptive thread scheduling and enforces trust at a fundamental level, with every batch job compartmentalised and unable to manipulate data outside of its container. Your nuclear missile silos, weather observations, and pretty much the entire airline industry runs on this (United and Air Canada had a hand in its development in the late 60s).\n\n\n\nBoth are very very application specific, doing what they need to do fast and efficiently.",

Our OCT is running Windows 10 and shows incompatible with 11. Our ultrasound is on Windows 7 and our old IT guy had horror stories of making it work with even just 7, there\u2019s no chance of upgrading that one.

Our pneumatic tube system was also second hand.\n\nThe software for the elevator is apparently designed for elevators of any length. After hitting the brakes it reboots and speaks all the floor numbers \"first floor, second floor,\" etc. But it actually says all the floor numbers in its programming. So it rapidly keeps counting upwards until I think 20th floor, then it counts off every tenth floor, I think until 100.\n\nThen the door opens and maybe it's between floors. \n\nManagement couldn't replicate the problem so the lab staff avoided that elevator, but it continued to be used by patients, nurses, doctors, and other staff.",

Only potential 'gotcha', which is a big one, is that it requires a parallel port security dongle that, so far, no dongle crew knows how to bypass.\n\nMy software license agreement grants me source code access upon the original (now long-gone) company's demise. Of course, they 'couldn't find it' upon their closing up shop, as they had migrated to Windows. But the Windows program doesn't do all that the DOS one does.  Anyone know Pascal?\n\nAnother video interface device I use is an XP computer with DSP cards. It's running the version used in point-of-sale computers, so it got updates for a while after standard XP left the chat.\n\nBoth of the above devices are never connected to the Internet, or even to a network.

      "body": "But fundamentally, why? Why haven't these systems updated? Why aren't they running a Unix based OS like BSD based (older or about as old as windows) or Linux (which was fairly new around 98/xp)?\n\nThere are many known vulnerabilities to old versions of windows and potential for more still up to win7 or even 8 at this point. However windows is known for excellent backwards compatibility. Why haven't companies invested in the resources to update these systems? A lot of them are running 24/7 but how many have actually been running nonstop for 20 years, without any power outage or downtime for maintnence?\n\nAt some point the computer hardware is going to die before the programs do, so why not update the OS as you replace the hardware?\n\nThe issue I see with these ancient systems is theyre all built around proprietary corporate structures. As a result, once the company said good enough, the contractor who set up thr software moved on, leaving no instructions on how to upgrade once things fail. Fast forward 20 years, now that software is the only thing keeping the system alive, with various tricks to fix whatever faults come up, ending up costing a lot to maintain thr system when at some point it must be cheaper to just redo it (at least in theory). But then its working with ancient hardware thats no longer compatible with modern hardware, not because its old but because its proprietary, closed source.\n\n\nOne example can be a train scheduling system- flipping track switches digitally to control the flows of trains, get them to leave on time, etc. I'm pretty sure theres transport tycoon games out that have turned that job into a game, which can run automated on a raspberry pi. A raspi (or if needed a larger dev board) can easily be adapted with some circuitry to work with any hardware interface, and running linux on an SD card or m.2 device, it can easily be swapped out for newer models over time. It can run an embedded version of linux to ensure constant uptime. It just needs someone to integrate the new hardware with the old, non replaceable one (in this case the signaling wire for the train tracks)- a step requiring companies to hire contractors for, and I dont think theyre willing to do that, probably not making enough income to pay contractors to replace the old system thats likely costing them to run.\n\nNow step back 20 years and assume thr company behind making the signaling system wanted their software to be essentially open source or open documentation. Now, over time, a community of developers who enjoy trains or signaling systems or what not can be fascinated by this old software, using it for their own model sets _and iterating off of it_. Over time when the old in production system starts to fail, now the company can hire a contractor, but at a cheaper rate because the contractor wouldnt have to start from scratch making the updated software.",
