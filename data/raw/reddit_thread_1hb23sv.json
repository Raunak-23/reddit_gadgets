Maybe some will come in cheaper, but I absolutely expect this to be the better build quality, better screen quality, higher base spec choice and push well into mid $2000\u2019s for a decent spec build.  There are already Laptop options with a 4050 or 4060 that push low to mid $2000\u2019s.  AMD isn\u2019t going to sell a good CPU with integrated 4060 for less than a good CPU and 4060.  The point is to be more efficient and easier to cool.  At least at first.  Come in as the form factor choice for a generation or two, then trickle down to the budget performance choice.  But there is no way they undercut pricing on a quality CPU/4060 combo and ignore the premium market while they hold a monopoly on the best performing all in one.",

Rumored to be AMD\u2019s flagship processor of the new Strix Halo line, it appears its integrated GPU can go toe-to-toe with an Nvidia RTX 4060. However, there\u2019s also a massive catch.\n\n\nCurrent AMD desktop GPUs may not be the very best graphics cards in the world, but they have been holding their own in terms of raw power. However, it\u2019s the company\u2019s ability to embed its Radeon GPUs into its Ryzen CPUs that has proven a winner in the laptop and handheld spaces. Nearly all the best gaming handheld devices use an AMD CPU with an integrated GPU.\n\n\nAs the company takes over the portable PC space, its new AMD Strix Halo hardware could significantly increase performance. OneXPlayer recently launched impressive Strix Point handhelds, and Strix Halo could improve upon that further.\n\n\nHowever, the catch is that we might never play games on this specific chip. The cumbersomely named Ryzen AI Max+ Pro 395 is potentially only for enterprise or development hardware.\n\n\nAMD is still trying to make inroads into the artificial intelligence market, and having a laptop chip as powerful as a laptop RTX 4060 onboard could make a big splash.''",
