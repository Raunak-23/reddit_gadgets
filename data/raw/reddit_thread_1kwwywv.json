Mine won't take more than 475watts, still getting 98-100% stock performance (although this is highly dependent on your luck in the silicon lottery). Even if you don't fine tune the undervolt, you can probably get 90-95% of the performance for 80% of the power.",

If this were available at under $1999 (1764 EUR), it would be snatched up within seconds. Looking for one myself to run a local LLM.",
