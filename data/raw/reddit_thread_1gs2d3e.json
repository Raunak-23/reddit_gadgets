Swipe text is a must.  But every time a new colleague sees me pull this thing out, let me tell you, it turns into an excitable conversation.

      "body": "Why? Why does apple *need* to do the SE or any product?\n\nWhy do so many articles, analysts, web commenters, YouTubers, and TikTokers have this mindset? This particular article reeks of entitlement, but it's hardly unique. So many opinions seem to suggest that Apple somehow \"owes\" people something, whether they're actual users of Apple products or not. For example, someone might say, \"Finally, Apple gave us an affordable Mac\u2014now give us an affordable iPhone,\" despite never planning to buy Apple products in the first place.\n\nWhy do people feel entitled to products they\u2019ll never use, seemingly driven by groupthink? It\u2019s like saying, \"The Toyota Corolla exists, so Ferrari and Lamborghini should make affordable cars,\" or \"Voice recorders and speakers are cheap, so Teenage Engineering should lower their prices.\"\n\nPeople love to criticize \"stan\" culture when it comes to celebrities, yet there\u2019s a similar obsession with tech companies. The tribalism, the love-hate dynamics, and the irrational demands need serious study. A great example is JerryRigEverything. He\u2019s like the tech version of those UK vs. US chocolate debates\u2014people love a product if it\u2019s presented as being from one place, but dismiss it as \u201cnot up to standard\u201d if they\u2019re told otherwise. The whole thing has gotten bizarre.",
