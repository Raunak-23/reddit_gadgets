You also make it so that your weight cannot move by stuffing all the air gaps between equipment with soft things, like your poncho, waterproofs, spare clothes and anything else soft.\n\nYou test it by jumping up and down with the bag on. If you feel anything moving in there when you jump, you have dead weight and you need to fix it.\n\nThe difference between a bag that is packed in this way and a bag that just has stuff thrown in and able to move around is like night and day. The well packed bag that avoids dead weight is barely an inconvenience (Up to a point of course, there is no trick in the world that is going to make you not notice 55kg) whereas the badly packed back with lots of dead weight is a relentless torture device on a loaded march.\n\nPack your bag so you have no dead weight, and your back will thank you in the future when you are old (Or at least it won't be as bad as it might be).",

Top in this case refers to it in a 3D sense in both the horizontal and vertical planes, so further up the back towards the head and also closer to your back (The idea being that the \"Front\" of the pack is closest to your back) in the horizontal sense.\n\nThe reason that you put the heavier things nearer the top (In the vertical sense) is that the top is essentially the middle of the back for most people and in a process I myself do not fully understand, it counteracts the motion of the hips when walking, leading to a more stable weight on your back. There is a downside to this which is leaning over and picking up the bag is harder but that generally is a lesser consideration.\n\nIt should be pointed out clearly that **even** weight distribution with all air gaps packed out so it is immovable weight is the actual sought after end result. Your bag should not be top heavy even with the heavy items at the top, but if that is not achievable, it's better for the bag to weigh a bit more at the top than at the bottom.\n\nMy PTI instructor said it best. \"If your bag feels like its stuffed full of heavy pillows you have done it right\".",

It worked pretty well from what I saw of it. It kept the forces on your shoulder relatively constant. \n\nExcept...no one walks (let alone hikes) with a consistent cadence so it's never truly in sync. This means you'll likely be working against it as much as it's working with you. And, as anyone who has done backpacking knows, you don't backpack with enough speed to throw your pack about. The added weight of a system like this would be more noticeable than the benefits.",

When walking horizontal energy to move pack is going to remain constant.\n\nHowever it takes energy to lift the pack on each step up to thr peak. Then when at peak, gravity does its job and drops the pack, so a person has to expend extra energy to counteract the kinetic enrergy of the pack coming back down, so there is absolutely a savings considering just the mass of the pack. Its why a lot of hikers will try to move smoothly with no bob to achieve a smiliar thing. Where the benefits come over just forcing yourself not to bob is that our natual human gait has evolved to use our muscles most efficiently with a slight bob, so forcing no bob saves energy, but we lose muscle efficiency. This prototype pack could help maintain those energy savings while allowing you to walk with a normal bobbing gait for muscle efficiency\n\n\nOf course, whether that energy savings can counteract the energy needed to haul the extra frame and battery weight is another matter",

      "body": "The trouble with backpacks is the center on mass changes as more and more item are placed in the backpack.  This causes you to lean farther forward to compensate for the center of mass moving farther away from your body.  The farther you lean forward the more strain that goes on your lower back.  The closer you can get your center of mass straight up and down lowers strain on your back, because when your spine is aligned more of the weight is distrubuted over your whole spine. It appears by the picture they are using a weight attached to the frame and that the hiker is still leaning forward to compensate for that weight.  But the weight has a center of mass much closer to the hikers back than a fully loaded pack, thus less strain on the hikers back.   If you pack your pack with the heavy objects as close to your back as possible that would reduce the strain on your back.  But that is not easily done.",
