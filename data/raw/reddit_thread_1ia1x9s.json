Apparently it did need a little machine oil every three years or so lol. Pretty sure it's supposed to be every 6-12 months but it still works! \n\nBut yeah, those cheapo inkjets die on purpose. If they *actually* ran a decent maintenance process they'd keep the print heads running for years. Instead, they just DUMP ink every 6-12 months and waste the hell out of it while doing almost nothing to actually keep themselves alive. \n\nBut then you might keep it longer lol. Can't have that! \n\nMeanwhile there's a HP 1020 Deskjet printer from 2006 still running at a nearby store lol. The internal page counter either broke or rolled over because it should be WAY higher than the ~50k pages it reported when I checked. \n\nThey use 2-3 cartridges a month pretty consistently. They rent expensive equipment and print out the entire contract every time someone rents something. That should be a few thousand pages a month. \n\nI mean I'm not *sure* they bought it in 2006, but the owner is a good friend of my mom and he said when he bought it it was the very newest (small) model. \n\nThe thing should be at somewhere around a million pages....\n\nIt sounds fucking ridiculous and I'm sure someone will come along to tell me I'm lying, but I've been there. I've seen it! \n\nWhen I have to go back again (it's pretty infrequent) I'm going to try to remember to check the tag and see if I can find a manufacturing date.",

There's about six screws and the power cable to the mainboard.  It's trivial.\n\nAnd opening the case is about maybe 8 screws (which are captured, so you can't lose them) and some strategic prying to get it open enough to pop off.\n\nThe shit that's hard is doing keyboards.  You have to gut the laptop, including some individual components and removing some small lead wires.  The wifi chip antenna leads are this impossible snap connector that's the worst to get connected, and they know it because there's a kludgy bracket you screw down that secures them.\n\nAlso, the ribbon connectors on the last one I did were like 3-4 different kinds with different unlock/releases and no indicators marked in the case/mainboard.  So its a bit of guesswork and luck unless you've done that one before.  Even the service manual is like \"release the ribbon cable\" generic.\n\nAs someone who only occasionally has to fix them:\n\n1) Make the top shell of the body removable for keyboards or touchpads.\n\n2) Use easier connectors with a common retention mechanism.\n\n3) For the dumb wifi antenna connector, use screws to hold the terminals to the board.  Please.\n\nModular laptops is a great idea, and I'm all for it, but as someone with little personal interest in a modular upgradeable laptop outside of RAM/mass storage/battery, I look at the ones I manage as mostly single-use/disposable.  They get issued to a couple of users in their life and within about 5 years, sometimes less, they're just worn out -- hinges, keyboard, battery, screen-related issues.  I only even do batteries rarely.  A total refurb at that point is just too much of my labor and about half the cost of new in parts.  A replacement at that point is a saner option.",

Had a bad one and the first replacement I went to pop in, I bent the connection point on the wifi module. It would never connect to the cable again. Thankfully we had extras because people destroyed laptops constantly. \n\nOn another 5580, I couldn't get Dell to replace the wifi module under warranty because every time they heard blue screen, they went right to software. Did some crash dump investigation and it was pointing to wifi. I put their image on it and it would still blue sceen, but they still wouldn't send me the Wi-Fi card. So I took another Wi-Fi card to test and tada, no blue screen. After escalation and arguing, they agreed to send it, but if I called back they wouldn't do anything else for the issue.",

          "body": "[From their blog:](https://community.intel.com/t5/Blogs/Tech-Innovation/Client/Modular-PC-Design-A-Sustainable-Approach-for-Enhanced/post/1657681)\n\n\nModularity can be approached at three levels depending on manufacturers' product positioning, market dynamics, costs, and other factors.\n\n\n1. Factory Modularity is a level of modularity that can only be exercised at the factory. For example, whilst ordering a car the manufacturer provides different choices of engines. Depending on what the user decides, the factory fits the car with the requested engine. This level of modularity can only be exercised at factory setups hence the name. This level of modularity provides for flexibility and high levels of design reuse and hence lower costs, manufacturing carbon footprint and scalability benefits.\n\n\n2. Field Modularity is the next level of modularity that provides for field-level changes but does not require a factory setup, yet might still require skilled labor and a specialized tools to make the necessary upgrades or changes. For example, quite a few cars provide different tire sizes as options. When a customer decides on a specific set of tires, sizes, and wheelsets, the dealer - not the factory - gets involved. The cars are still manufactured with the standard set of wheels but based on customer requests the end dealer swaps the factory-fitted wheels with custom ones. These changes still require a field specialty setup but can be done effectively outside of the factory setup.\n\n\n3. User Modularity is the last level of modularity that allows the end user to change the settings or components within a product at will at the convenience of their home or office.  Good examples are WiFi dongles, user upgradable memory and storage, etc. These provide the ultimate level of modularity to the end user, do not require the intervention of the dealer or the manufacturer, and can be done using standard tools by the user anytime during the effective lifetime of the product.\n\n\nETA: so in essence it's not going to be Intel that can file patents but the laptop manufacturers. HP can create their own design and patent that. Whilst Lenovo could easily create a very similar design, the modular components will most likely be the same form factor. Or at least one of a few different form factors like with desktop motherboards. Some manufacturers might try to make their own form factor like Apple always do. So you're forced to purchase their parts.",

If companies adopted this idea then they would be able to file their own patent for their machine. But it wouldn't block other companies from using the same modularity model in their own laptops.\n\n It's similar to when Chromebooks first started. They just got classified as laptops rather than being in it's own category. So whilst Lenovo can patent their design for a 2-in-1 360 Chromebook, HP can do the same as long as the design is clearly unique. So the people designing the aesthetics of the laptop will be the people creating the unique factors that would be patentable.",

Doubt on the toughbook? The latest model has user replaceable and upgradeable modules called xPAKs, RAM, keyboard, battery, caged SSD, reinforced locking port covers, webcam with privacy cover. All in a package slightly bigger than a decent sized textbook. It is not wafer thin though so the battery should last a days hard use. And you can run it over because the name is literal.\n\n\nThese assholes have had the disgruntled people telling them smaller, sleaker, and non-repairable are bad for x y and z reasons and they are only now caring because costs have finally started to affect some of them personally.",

      "body": "There was an attempt to do similar for mobile phones in 2017 with Motorola Moto Z family, which had mods to add to the phone.\nIt won't work very well.\nI can give some reasons: poor reliability when components are not all soldered on a mainboard. Connectors can corrode, components can slightly move due to shock or vibration and stop working which would require nontechnical people to pay for service.\nComponents made by third parties and not validated by manufacturer give all kinda of compatibility issues.\nSee the memory for desktops as example. Your pc may not boot, cpu maker will push firmware for cpu, mainboard maker needs to include it into a bios, you need to have it applied to make that memory work.\nDropping the device (e.g. on a bed) may make some component stop working or have glitches.\nE.g. in a tablet, the display ribbon may move and stop working until fixed.\nProblems caused by specs, see intel Devsleep issue on some early ssds causing intensive nand wear (GBs per minute). Having the laptop maker certify its own ssd storage rules out these issues.\nThe laptop maker gets the blame if a component is not working well, such as slow ssd makes the laptop freeze or feel slow.\nUnable to make thinner designs if the connectors can't be removed. They moved away from VGA ports, USB A connectors and used USB-C for a slimmer design. They now use USB C also for charging.\nTinkering with the laptop makes it prone to break things. Plastic clips or screws in plastic can be fastened just a few times before they break or crack the plastic.",

People with performance-intensive jobs get laptops that will do performance-intensive things up front.  Even tired batteries don't seem to be a big deal, they're accustomed to plugging in.  I'm surprised they don't gripe about this more, but those that do I'll swap the battery.
