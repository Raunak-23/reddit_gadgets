A 2.5 lbs device with a 10\u201d screen is a failure has a handheld. And eGPU support is going to make this thing so expensive that you may as well just build a desktop and buy a steam deck instead. You\u2019ll end up with better portable *and* desktop experiences.\n\nEdit: also under 11\u201d is small for a laptop, especially a gaming laptop. Companies tried 11\u201d ultrabooks and chromebooks for a while. There is a reason 13ish inches has become the default \u201csmall\u201d laptop size.",

                          "body": "The Steam Deck's hardware is really showing its age at this point. Its CPU/GPU are far weaker than any of its competitors, and that 1280 x 800 90hz screen is downright pathetic compared to the others who are all running at least 1080p 120hz. Plus it still can't do basic things like run gamepass.\n\nEven SteamOS isn't the selling point it once was since most of the other handhelds can now run it too. And the others can dual boot to give you the choice of either that or Windows depending on what you're trying to do at that moment.\n\nThe Deck was a great starting point for this category of gadget, but really the only advantage it has at this point is the track pads. Which others like the Zotac Zone have now adopted as well, so even that's no longer a big deal at all.",
