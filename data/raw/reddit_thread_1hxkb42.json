I've never used anything less since.\n\nI was holding off on an RPi 5 (even though it would neatly complete my collection of a first-batch RPi 1 that I beta-tested, an RPi 2, 3 and 4... which I have loaded into a 5-bay 19\" rackmount for Pi's).  Each of my Pi's has a job, each of them is basically a server for half-a-dozen services, and each of them is limited most by the RAM.\n\nSo I have ordered one of these 16Gb versions now that they exist (and I hate that these things just appear on the market without warning... how many people are now looking at an RPi 8Gb that they splashed out on for Christmas?).  It's going to run my Wiki, my VPN, my TV and Plex NVR, my Flightaware and SDR, my HomeAssistant, etc.  The reason I had to split those services between RPi's before... RAM.\n\nI probably won't be buying the RPi 6 when it appears... they've changed the way they operate to be entirely commercial now, and there's almost no service I'm interested in offering to my local network that would need more than a Pi 5 speed.  But I would hope that it would START AT 16Gb RAM.\n\nCurrently sitting on a 4-year-old laptop that has had 64Gb all that time (and even that is Kingston Fury RAM so it doesn't become a bottleneck).\n\nYou don't need 16Gb for minimal PC usage, but the second you're actually using it 16Gb should be the absolute minimum nowadays.  Just Chrome alone can suck that up in an extended session.  But if you intend to actually use the machines for anything proper, RAM is far more important than CPU speed once you hit a certain point.\n\n(P.S. work servers that I manage are currently using 256Gb each and I still don't think that's enough).",

I use a Nooelec for the FlightAware stuff, but the other ran it fine for years too.\n\nThe other antennae / SDR are there to run RTL-433 to pick up a bunch of random devices (temperature sensors, weather stations, car tyre pressure sensors).\n\nI use the local FlightAware web interface to browse the data for myself, and obviously it feeds into FlightAware's main dataset.\n\nThe only other thing I did was add in a decent GPS dongle: VK162-based USB GPS Receiver -  an IPX6 GPS receiver with 1 to 5Hz update rates that can receive GPS, GALILEO and SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN) signals.\n\nThis lets me add in MLAT data into FlightAware and because I use it via GPSD, other things can also query it (e.g. for time synchronisation or location).",
