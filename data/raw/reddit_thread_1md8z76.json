It\u2019s a prototype\u2026 of course it looks rough. You should\u2019ve seen the original Oculus prototype before Facebook got involved. It was literally duct-taped together. Even the early Valve Index units had circuit boards glued to the front.\n\nThat said, with the rapid progress in transparent and flexible displays, we\u2019re not far off from truly functional AR/VR glasses that don\u2019t come with all this bulk.",
