Mostly used it for photoshop, dreamweaver and pagemaker so most of the space was taken up with image files so even as mp3s I couldn\u2019t store unlimited albums and there weren\u2019t any portable players.

The reason it costs more is because you have to double the number of pins, which also means double the number of wires. So not only the port itself, but also the cables become more expensive. If you don\u2019t do this and have a symmetrical cable with more than 2 pins and plug it in the wrong way there\u2019s a good chance you fry something. So you make an asymmetrical port that can\u2019t be plugged in backwards. Another thing that increases cost is that by making the connectors double sided the manufacturing becomes more complicated with tighter tolerances required. You could make the port bigger to give more room for error but that\u2019s going to increase material costs and take up more board real estate. \n\nThen after the standard becomes accepted and cost doesn\u2019t matter as much nobody wants to switch to a different design because it breaks backwards compatibility. \n\nAnother reason it ended up this way is they just didn\u2019t realize it would be such a big issue. At the time most connectors were trapezoidal in shape which made them easy to distinguish the correct orientation at a glance.",

                  "body": "Ignoring the obvious waste reduced by standardized devices that used USB for charging, all sorts of products used their own propitiatory cables. Digital cameras had their own cables, Mac and PC keyboards required active adapters, MP3 players, various toys, medical devices, every manufacturer was just out there winging it. People had drawers full of random cables, for fear of needing that one specific one. When you got rid of an old device, all the cables that went with it were basically useless. \n\nThere was no confusion with USB cables for USB 2.0. You only needed to see the physical connector to see if one side was USB-A or USB-B. USB 2.0 was still a 4 pin connector, just like USB 1.0 and 1.1. It wasn't until USB 3.0 that you actually had different cables, and worst case was that a 3.0 device would fall back to 2.0 speeds. \n\nUSB-C has some issues that could have been avoided with mandated labeling on the cables themselves, and using much saner naming/versioning for to consumers, but even then, USB-C helped replace all of the different chargers for higher powered devices like laptops.\n\nThe idea that it caused waste is just pants-on-head. Things were far worse before USB was around.",
