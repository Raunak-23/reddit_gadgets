Consider that generation the current rising ceiling.\n\nAll the kids being born after his generation are being born into an era where games have a lot more relevance and appeal. Until his generation literally starts to die of age or lose interest in games entirely. The pool of people who are likely to buy games should just be increasing. \n\nUnless a company or the market fails drastically somewhere, every subsequent console generation should be performing substantially better than the last. \n\nIt should be the expectation. Theyre gaining exponentially more relevant market. But its always played off as a suprise that growth is still happening lol\n\nAnd thats before we even talk about wider distribution, looking for more literal markets to sell.\n\nEven if an entire generation or even 2 decided \"this sucks\" the number probably still goes up lol",

                                      "body": "Why do you keep using this weird phrase, \"The suggestion of a trend\"?\n\nThat phrase doesn't really mean anything, and 2 or 6 or 10 or even 20 consoles having an issue out of several million isn't a trend, *nor* does it remotely suggest one. Those are just pretty typical end of the MTBF bell curve numbers \u2014 if this is a problem and not human error.\n\nWith *any* piece of equipment, with any component going into a bigger piece of equipment, there's going to be a certain number that are on the edge of tolerance or on the edge of failure, but in completely undetectable ways. There is no amount of QA process that can remedy this; it's just kind of a fact of making something. It doesn't suggest bigger trends. \n\nWhen our iMac came in 2001 and the hard drive died in it after a couple months of working fine\u2026that was frustrating, but not indicative of some kind of negligence on the manufacturer's part. Just a component that tested as working but was apparently on the edge.\n\nIt is irresponsible of a tech journalist to publish something suggesting that there are larger trends based on what is essentially statistical noise and gossip on a site where people post anonymously.\n\nLike all journalists, their job is to increase people's knowledge about the world. That includes sharing knowledge about normal manufacturing flaw rates that they ought to possess, if they're at all qualified for their job.\n\nIf a pattern emerges of an actually significant number of units all with the same issue \u2014 and with some degree of certainty that user error isn't at fault \u2014 then it starts to get outside of the territory of normalcy, and it becomes worth reporting on.\n\n----------------\n\nEven when there is a trend, it doesn't always suggest negligence. When every single one of the dozen to two dozen Dell Optiplex GX270 desktops we had at my workplace in 2006 needed a motherboard replacement because of bad capacitors\u2026that actually did suggest that there might be a larger issue. (Though it could still have just been an issue confined to that run.) Even then, it wasn't necessarily one the manufacturer should have been able to catch, given that the failures all happened after about 4-5 years of use. I don't see any reasonable way to test for this sort of failure before shipping out.\n\n(Though it *is* probably something their supplier should have caught while stress testing their capacitor designs.)",

There's a ton of bunk and hooey that passes around as \"common knowledge\". (Also, this isn't a clich\u00e9 that I've ever heard. It's an almost preschool-level concept of what a \"trend\" looks like.)\n\nTwo occurrences of *anything* is basically never enough data to suggest a \"trend\". It's just far too little information. Even for something *very unlikely*, it simply happening twice in close succession doesn't suggest a \"trend\". Because with enough chances to occur, you're basically *guaranteed* to get clustering of low-likelihood events now and then \u2014 especially if your line of demarcation for a cluster is a number as statistically insignificant as *two*.\n\nAnd for something that has sold 5.4 million units, you are guaranteed a few instances of almost any imaginable flaw. If there start to be hundreds and hundreds of reports, *that* would actually start to suggest some real design flaw, significant manufacturing error, or run of bad components \u2014 as opposed to expected random failures.\n\nTwo heads ups in a row on a quarter doesn't suggest a trend, certainly. Not if you know anything about how the world works.\n\nAnd if you know just a little bit about how manufacturing or electronics work, you also know that a few reports of any particular uncommon flaw on a product are *basically guaranteed*.",

Today I plugged it into the Dock, and played 15 minutes Mario Kart 10, with my wife and the console froze and gave me the too hot temperature reading and it shut itself down.\n\nWhen I held the console in my hands, it was fuming hot. Whatever internal cooling Nintendo came up with is clearly not working.  I could understand if the game I was playing was something like Cyberpunk, but it really baffled me that Mario Kart would get the console to generate so much heat...\n\nI have a ba feeling about this.",

I'd also much rather have a slower refresh speed monitor with vrr vs even an OLED without vrr.  \n\nThere's lots of very in depth analysis on digital foundry especially cyberpunk going into detail about the performance.  It even regularly beats out the Xbox series s because of how good dlss is even though it's running at a lower internal resolution and consuming a fraction of the power.  DLSS makes it better than all of the other handhelds available because they currently all only have fsr3 at best which is trash.",
