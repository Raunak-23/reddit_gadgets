I get it's a niche thing, and I am one of those avid users of the spen and its Bluetooth functionality. In fact i am writing this with my spen. It's the main reason I went with an S24U over the S25U but in the same breath, if you are paying a premium price for a device, they shouldn't be removing useful hardware and support and if they do, it should be replaced with something more useful and powerful. I can't imagine the bluetooth spen costs all that much to manufacture and implement either. Especially since they have been doing it for over 10 years",
