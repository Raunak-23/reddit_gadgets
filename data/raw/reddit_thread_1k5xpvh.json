So initial orders may have been a little slow, but it really caught on once people started trying it out. Switch being a known quantity and very popular they *should* have been expecting a better out of the gate response with their estimates this time.\n\nAlso, Nintendo being Nintendo, was that 500,000 in the first month bavknin 2017 all they could move or was that all that was available? I don't know for sure which. If the latter that needs to be accounted for as well. My 30 seconds of research didn't turn up what sort of supply was avaliable at the time.",

I wasn\u2019t trying to stir any debate I was just trying to understand and I have gotten a lot of opinions that changed my mind at least somewhat. I could see my take as reductive if Nintendo didn\u2019t do something similar before but the Wii had excellent GameCube support because at the heart the Wii was just a super beefed GameCube. If there plan is to make 98% of games backwards compatible and will improve their selection over time then I will retract my criticism of the backwards compatibility.",

Steam Deck's less powerful and jankier than that and isn't really portable enough to be something I can comfortably lug around wherever, so it's basically no man's land territory for me.\n\nAlso, don't have to mess about with tweaking settings to get games to run okay, it's (probably) more powerful, switching between docked and handheld is seamless, first party games, etc. As for game sales, while Steam definitely has the advantage there, a lot of third-party games go on the eShop for cheap frequently. For example, right now you can get Diablo 2 and 3 for \u00a317, Skyrim for \u00a316, Hogwarts Legacy for \u00a312, Doom for \u00a34, etc. you aren't paying full price for every game on there.",

HOWEVER I do understand that with the switches experience the games should be more optimized.\n\nIt's apples to oranges since we're comparing an x86 PC to an ARM games console, but at the very least third party games do seem to look and run meaningfully better on Switch 2. You could argue console optimization plays a part in that, but the end result is ultimately what matters.\n\n>I\u2019m probably just the wrong audience which is why I don\u2019t understand because I just can\u2019t fathom paying that much extra for a handheld device because of Nintendo exclusives but I\u2019m sure there are people that would\n\nI mean, the lowest end model of the Steam Deck is only around \u00a350 cheaper and that's with a worse screen and no dock included.\n\nAs for the game prices, I mean, yeah, it's a little bit of a piss take but Mario Kart World comes cheaper if you get the console bundle so there's that. And I'm in the UK, where Nintendo is actually much better than most other gaming companies about doing currency conversion instead of just going \u00a3 = $. So even MK World is basically just the same price as a lot of the other full-priced games on PlayStation. (Though to be fair, Valve is also better about it so it is a bit of a wash)\n\n>I expected it to sell well just not this well considering the switch 2 doesn\u2019t even have full backwards compatibility with switch games. Which to me is probably the worst thing about it imo.\n\nIt's not an arbitrary whitelist or anything though, Nintendo is trying to get everything up and running. Just some compatibility issues to hash out, which is pretty common for backwards compatible consoles.  We'll have to wait and see how it shakes out at launch but I suspect it'll be fine in the long run even if not everything works completely 100%",
