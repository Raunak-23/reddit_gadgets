As long as your population isn't frothing at the mouth in rage that they can't get one, you can ask whatever you want and get big tech to pony up. That's why it could never kill trade, it's only really viable for luxury items being sold by companies who are pretty close to the limit of their current market area.",

Bait, meet click. \n\nIf you believe the cynical view or a generous view, this is about clout.  iPhones have a much greater chance of being a long term investment and require more expertise overall. $1 billion investment in a 401k is a better investment than $1 billion in a 2% savings account, for example. Apple is still trying to lowball them no mater whose side you are on.\n\nMy only beef with this is calling something so transparent as bizarre.",

The article mentions Indonesia as a market for 246 million people, but that's not exactly true, Indonesia might have nearly 250m but the vast majority of the people can't afford iPhones. What if a country like Mexico (I think Apple already is putting some production centers there) asks for it? Mexico might have a much lower population but the iPhone market is much bigger (currently about twice as Indonesia), as it's a richer country. Same with Brazil, nearly three times the Indonesian market. Maybe even some eastern EU countries?\n\nDo it, countries.",
