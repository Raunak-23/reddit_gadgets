              "body": ">Communication has always been terrible with them.\n\nI have an alternate take, maybe with rose tinted glasses, but something I really belive to be true.\n\nThey are the best from the big 3 console market players at communicating things without exaggerated hype or making fans guess what they mean.\n\nMicrosoft and Sony are happy to tease their products and new consoles and let fans build their hype over incomplete information, or limited information. Most other major player console launch was marked with people having to guess or decrypt what some features would mean, console version capabilities and limitations and how they eoukd fare vs the competition. Most of the time a clear picture is only provided by 3rd party websites, post launch reviews or other similar sort of media.\n\nNow Nintendo doesn't take part of that game. They will talk to consumers when they feel it's the correct time for them, and not fall to temptation to build hype with vague information in between. Their launch communication will provide a clear picture of what the product is, their gimmick vs the competition and what to expect from it. Reviews post launch won't uncover for the most part new stuff or shocking limitations cause it will be made clear by Nintendo what the product is. They will talk less, and less often, but when they do they will nail the pin in the head and not dance around the subject.\n\nAnd breaking the above rule that's one thing that made the Wii U a failure. They failed to communicate clearly what the console was and aimed to achieve, it's features and 3rd party communication ran wild with it, instead of Nintendo taking the active voice.\n\nI honestly preffer their method of talking when they feel like they should and not when people try to pressure them to, and try to make them in control of their own narrative instead of relying to hype or hear say. And that's why most Nintendo fans can really on the good old method of if Nintendo doesn't say something then it's not oficial, or otherwise they woukd say it themselves.",

I guess my point was I definitely wanted to see the Switch 2 be a little more capable than the steam deck and it doesn't look like that's going to happen. I'll still probably get one and enjoy it, but just nitpicking. I trust the MP4 will be optimized well. I just hope to never experience a AAA title perform that bad on a console again.",
