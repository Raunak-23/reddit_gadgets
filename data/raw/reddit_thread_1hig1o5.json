      "body": "I actually worked at a Walmart for about six months. \n\nPeople saying they want to use the cameras for workplace surveillance aren\u2019t aware that your location and activity are already being monitored. Most employees opt-in to clock in and out using an app. Even if you don\u2019t use the app for this, you still basically need the app anyway for their ongoing learning / training mandates. The app has location tracking and it\u2019s pretty tight (I would test it to see how far from the door it would allow me to clock in\u201415 feet past the entrance inside.) \n\nEven if you don\u2019t have a cell phone they will give you a device such as a company cell, or radio. As an employee, you are being constantly observed. \n\nThe store I worked in was packed with cameras. I\u2019d guesstimate they numbered more than 300. These aren\u2019t just cameras up above the aisles. They are above all the self-checkouts, behind counters, and in the staffing areas. \n\nThat store had a two-person security team who spent much of their shifts sitting in front of about a dozen monitors.\n\nOne very, very big concern for corporate is a mass shooting within the store. During training we went through three different segments focused on mass shootings. This included two computer-based segments and one store walk-through and drill to locate the best safer spaces during an emergency. \n\nI cannot stress enough how concerned they are about this. The only thing that worries them more are spills. \n\nWhat body cams can track better than any app is an employee who walks away from a spill. When you report to work they don\u2019t give you any \u201cspill time,\u201d so a jug of milk busting during your shift can totally offset the rest of your day. I had one jar of salsa break on me, and the next 2.5 hours were spent dealing with that alone. There is the ideal Walmart that is presented in a training program, and there\u2019s the real one you work in where you actually can\u2019t find any of the bullshit you need to quickly clean a spill. \n\nThey say the cams are for safety, but they are really there for liability reasons. That\u2019s it.",

The other issue I've personally seen was a really good friend's mom when I was a kid who was pretty high up in the grocery store Union. There was a couple of years of turmoil before all the Union stores were bought out by non-union in our state and during the time of negotiations before then she was constantly being blocked from working. The Union paid some wages, but not enough to live on during that time. As a result, she nearly lost her home and I do remember discussions of filing bankruptcy, but I don't know if she did or not. Collective bargaining can do great things, but a large enough organization is always going to start acting in its own self interest regardless of the personal costs to individuals in that organization.",

Think of where the big 3 are located. The workers in manufacturing are a part of the UAW. All good. However, when it comes to discipline or reprimands, the unions are pretty soft on their own. I have heard of stories about workers showing up drunk, high, etc many, many many times. In any other job this would have you fired immediately. But because the unions fight for this employee, they stay on, and their quality of work suffers greatly. If someone shows up drunk to work 6 times, or you find them doing blow in the bathroom, there is a serious problem there. That employee is endangering themselves and their coworkers with their behavior. This is not an uncommon story in the UAW plants here. The unions literally refuse to have some of these really, really bad employees fired. So in this situation, unions are enabling the poor behavior by the employee.",

He's just trying to do his job.\" So employee continued to engage in unsafe practices, union leader didn't do anything, and the show went on. Like I said this was a retailer, so different industry.

Union fees were over $100/month out of my $900 paychecks, which was far too much at the time.\n\nAdditionally, as a hard worker seniority sucks, unions seem built around benefiting the employees who have stayed longer vs the ones starting out regardless of work effort. \n\nBy far my biggest complaint was the forced working hours. You HAD to work 5 days every week, which meant you could not get unpaid time off if it meant working less then that or you would get hit with a reprimand mark. Sure, after a year you can get a week long paid vacation or whatnot, but until then if you needed more then 3 days off for any reason in a week it was the equivalent of calling out. \n\nJust not a good experience all around. Costco by the way and I was maybe 23 at the time.",

Also, the floor of a Walmart might be one of the filthiest things ever made by human hands. \n\nAlso, where\u2019s the broom? Oh snap, the one close by has no dustpan. \n\nBetter find a mop. Looks like that\u2019s another thing that wasn\u2019t left where it was supposed to be. And the last employee to use it didn\u2019t wash it out. \n\nThen you need to report the lost merch to the team lead. \n\nAll of this inside a store the size of a football field (probably larger than that even.) \n\nAnd you will have customers approach you during cleanup to ask for help finding the Betty Crocker Double-Fudge Brownie Mix while complaining that Walmart is \u201calways moving things around.\u201d (Walmart is constantly shifting where they place certain merch\u2026.the shelves are a rental market.) \n\nSo yeah, 2.5 hours. One small jar.",

It fuckin sucks. \n\nI've never worked at Walmart, but had similar experiences in another chain, only I didn't work in food, so spills weren't often my area and I had a union which luckily backed the \"don't have enough in X department, put more hours out, don't take from y department to back-fill\" as well as the \"absolutely no work not clocked in\" stuff. Which happily my direct lead also heavily backed and reminded the owner multiple times of. \n\nA GF worked at Walmart, night and day comparison. Though my store often had equipment not be properly tagged out or put back where it should have been. My dept wasn't too much better as stock carts were limited and unassigned, and my dept used a *lot* of them as we had no night shift. So at end of shift we'd often hide 6-8 of the things somewhere in a corner people rarely frequented from other depts, so we'd not be stuck hauling hundreds of boxes by hand. \n\nRetail is a weird mess.",

      "body": "Honestly, Walmart\u2019s explanation makes no sense. Why bodycams when their stores have security cameras in every corner of the buildings? They specifically state this is for loss prevention and employee safety. If a customer is already getting physical/violent in a store that puts Big Brother to shame, I doubt a body cam is going to be effective in deescalating the situation\n\nI have a feeling this is so Walmart can invasively monitor their employees at all times",

The eyes in the sky were really just to alert, and draw attention not to produce crystal clear evidence in court. for that you just have a couple employees watch someone stuff space jam DVDs down their pants in person. Then you ask them politely to come with you to the security room, show them the tape and ask them to sign a notice that they've been banned from Walmart.

Walmart is not going to spend the money to store 40 hours of footage a week per employee, much less on some kind of system that would be judging efficiency. You're thinking of Amazon.\n\nDealing with the public since the pandemic has been insane. All the stupid entitled \"You can't make me wear a mask!\" people have continued to show disrespect to customer facing employees.

          "body": "At my Walmart, there are a lot of cameras attached to the ceiling, above the cash registers, the self-checkouts, the entrances/exits. Problem is, there are very brazen criminals who don't care. I personally witnessed a bunch of criminals just rolling out their full carts without paying and the staff and even security guards couldn't do anything. \n\nI doubt body cams will be a deterrent to these criminals though. They don't even bother wearing hoodies anymore to conceal their face. The only thing that would scare criminals from attempting theft are actual consequences to shoplifting. \n\nRecently, there's been good change though. In California, criminals will now be arrested even if they only stole less than $950. For a few years, stealing stuff was just a misdemeanor as long as it's less than $950 and so criminals didn't care because there's really no real consequence for their actions. Now it's different, hopefully this will change things.",
