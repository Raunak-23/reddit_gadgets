They also have an OS. \n\nAll of those things would need to be bought and configured separately, adding a hefty load to already-struggling public school IT departments (and teachers dealing with it).",

Great idea for schools.\n\nI can guarantee (cause I know a few) that there are more than enough companies willing to provide all of the things you've talked about as a package to schools, which would still cost less than Chromebook or iPad (remember: The sticker price is only part of the cost. Walled garden and spying are another) and be a better experience for the schools.\n\nBut hey, let's write free ads for the two tech monoliths instead like you did. Certainly far better.",

I haven't bought another because the price is a bit prohibitive if you need all the included peripherals and my projects typically need them. I agree though that the Pi Zero series is awesome, just not for the desktop experience since the peripherals and RAM aren't nearly enough. I guess my thoughts more accurately are that the Raspberry Pi is overpriced for a mini computer for how little it provides for quality of life. If your prohects don't need the extra peripherals though (like for automation, routers, etc) then they still have great options...I just don't use those.",
