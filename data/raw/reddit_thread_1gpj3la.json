I went from a 1070 to a 3070 a few months ago, that's double the performance (in some cases even more) for about 200 bucks. \n\nPro tip; look for advertisements of miners. They already made money off the cards by mining means they often sell cheaper. There is still the popular believe that those cards would be more abused and worn down, although this is very often not the case. Instead of overclocking the cards for max performance the emphasis is now on under-volting them to get the best cost/benefit ratio. Which is actually great for videocards longevity. Less volts means less heat means less wear and tear.\n\n Tell them you want to underclock your card and ask them what settings they found optimal. Also ask if they made any modifications to the card, like replacing the fans. If the card is underclocked and no modifications were made; buy em! If not, look further.\n\nThink of it this way, who is more likely to keep their cards in the best condition? Someone who tries to make money off them by using them in the most efficient matter or the person that bought it with their fun money?",

Based on the same architecture still, but the components on the silicon may be in different places to better make use of the smaller die area. Those differences will determine how easily a higher sku chip can be used on a lower tier cards, though often this is what leads to the 70Ti and super cards - they use a cut down 80 series chip which will be slightly better still than the full fat 70 series, and makes use of the excess they can't package into a 90 or 80 series, say if some of the cuda cores are defective or the interconnects for a memory module, they can simply work around it because the silicon already supports more than they need.\n\nThe same is true for the high end cards - those themselves are just cut down enterprise/professional GPUs. The 4090 is actually just the lower binned chips from the RTX6000, which supports double the memory and about 1500 more cuda cores, but will run you 5-10x the price because it supports professional workloads.\n\nIt's becoming less relevant as more architectures move to a chiplet style design like AMD and Intel have been doing with CPUs, and to an extent Apple with their silicon. That way you simplify the manufacturing to just the individual components for instance cude modules, rt modules, memory, cache, and combine them into the final GPU.",
