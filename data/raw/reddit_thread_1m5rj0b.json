              "body": "E.T. is a pretty good 2600 game.  It gets a bad rap mainly because it was release just as the Video Game Crash happened and because it's not a pick up and play game.  Someone absolutely must read the manual to understand what to do.  There's also one fiddly mechanic that's easy to work with once you know how, but could be very frustrating if you don't.\n\nI had a lot of fun with it back in the 80s and I've replayed it a few times more recently.  It still holds up.  It's honestly one of the more advanced games for the 2600.",

(the 2600 version of Pac-Man is arguably shovelware to capitalize on Pac-Man Fever)\n\nThey were so confident they could sell this version that they produced more carts than there were consoles existing at the time expecting it would be a system seller.  And they sold a ton of them.  It's by far one of the most common carts out there even after throwing a bunch in a landfill.  Unfortunately consumer confidence plummeted due to stuff like this and the market being flooded by a lot of 3rd party shovelware. It took Nintendo and their Seal of Quality system to revive the home market.",
