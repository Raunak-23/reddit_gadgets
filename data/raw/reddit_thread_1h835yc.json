The only thing I can think of that could be transformative would be something with AI like [this real life filter applied to GTA 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50zDDW-sXmM), but in real time, and stable enough to work consistently on the entire game.

Landscapes are pretty realistic but any moving element, including people, animals/creatures, and vegetation, still looks low-fidelity because of the difficulty of fully modeling movement. Yet AI can generate random video already that is extremely realistic. \n\nThere are other fundamental problems IMO that don't have to do with realism of images, however. For examples, games have settled on a janky style of camera movement that is not very natural; that turns me off from a lot of first-person games, to be honest. I think that could be changed technically now. Games also have a hard time figuring out how to represent the real visual experience of looking at far-away detail (in real life, you can look down the field or track and see detail without sacrificing your awareness of your more proximate context). I think it's inherent to 2D representations.",

Pc hardware has hit the point in the iteration where both high performance and high power draw are hand in hand for graphics. The next leap would likely be making the power draw more reasonable.. But I'm pretty sure we are at the point where the average person has to look at investing in their home wiring and circuit breaker to safely utilize a high end gaming rig. 1000w+ power draws. And then there is the internet infrastructure needed to enable VR games to be played at low latency. My bet is the next jumps won't happen until the average person can afford them. The jumps will be VR for the masses, hardware that can accommodate the multiple hurdles with individual differences between eye balls and how each person has slightly or very different visual acuity, and controls and interfaces that improve the immersion.\u00a0",

The only way VR takes off is if it\u2019s based around universal standards and protocols. A virtual bookstore shouldn\u2019t have to work with a proprietary system that a single company devised. I\u2019d love to window shop on a portal site (like a VR implementation of Yahoo\u2019s early days, when it was just a directory), where it\u2019s an honest to god mall, and you walk past stores, and they have their window displays of whatever they\u2019re promoting, and you walk through the doors and now you\u2019re on their VR site. You could go to the mall with your friends, but everyone else in the mall is just generated for the purpose of making the mall not look empty. \n\nI hate going from website to website to website, to see what they\u2019ve got. I want to look in a window and go, \u201cOoh, dishes are on sale.\u201d Give people everything that\u2019s great about the real world without any of the hassle of it. No people, no parking, you don\u2019t have to worry about your kid getting eaten by the escalator. And if you\u2019re just looking for clothes and you don\u2019t need the whole mall, filter it and now you\u2019ve just got just clothing retailers. And whoever created the mall can sell preferred locations (read: anchor stores) for a price. Go to the food court, place an order at the local Chinese place you like, and it\u2019ll be delivered in forty minutes. \n\nIf Second Life didn\u2019t suck, this would have been the logical conclusion. Like I said, everything good about the real world and none of the bad. Where Zuckerberg fails is that he\u2019d have you shopping at a mall with a bunch of randos, because he still believes in human interaction, and he is wrong. That\u2019s why people think Metaverse and they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, Zoom with cartoonish faces and bodies. No thanks.\u201d",

If you wear glasses, you'll need to shell out for custom eye pieces to swap for the shitty magnifying glasses included. Getting it to focus properly takes longer to work out than the likely amount of time of your play session. Taking turns? Do this over and over to adjust for each head.\n\n2. People seem to celebrate the focused point eye tracking. It's garbage and makes everything have a fuzzy appearance in the periphery. One of the first things I turn off in games are depth of field. This is somehow a worse version of that.\n\n3. Even though it is considered light, it really wears heavy after thirty minutes or so. It will never be a replacement for long gaming sessions for this reason.\n\n4. Needing basically an entire room dedicated if you want to be able to get the full immersion experience, otherwise you are just playing a game with a cumbersome tv helmet.\n\n5. This one won't apply to everyone, but I legit did not know they were harmful to children's eyes under 12. The biggest reason I even gave it a try was to do something neat with my kids. You can't (or shouldn't).\n\n6. Cords. Fuck cords. You'd think a 20 ft cord would be ok but understand you lose your own height of that measure in addition to being a safe distance from hitting your tv or other furniture. You also need slack to move around safely. In the end you are confined to an imaginary 4ft by 4ft area of play. Anything outside of that ends up cutting the game display, turning on the pass through camera abruptly, and getting you killed.\n\n7. It takes three to four times longer to perform any task that isn't a button press as you random swing your hands through the air trying to figure out what shitty position is necessary to complete whatever you are trying to do. It's cumbersome and just not there yet.\n\n8. When I go to play a game it is for rest and relaxation. Stress relief. Escaping this world. Most people I've personally ever gamed with do too. VR might be immersive from the point of view of your eyes and somewhat the motion controls, but otherwise everything about it just reminds you of where you are and breaks immersion. It's self defeating.\n\n9. This is probably the biggest reason. There's too small of a market share to be profitable for AAA companies to shell out games.\n\nFor these reasons, until everything works for every customer or these companies give swappable parts instead of relying on the one size fits all, everything needs to be flawlessly wireless, and there needs to be more comfort and ergonomics taken into consideration before it ever takes off. Even facebook selling headsets at a loss with supposedly the best headset out there can't get it done. It's niche at best even in its current form, which I'm led to believe is waaaaaaaaaaay better than 10 years ago.",

Many people have kids and pets that don't give a second thought to running through cords, the setup time, swapping users, etc.\n\nThe 3D effects are cool but it was a slog to do anything. I tried playing with a controller after and my experiences with these games instantly improved. Once the \"new\" wears off, as it is definitely neat, the detriments start to become more apparent in a real scenario.\n\nI just wanted to toss my opinion out there. There's so much hype and talk and it just really was not a great experience. I bought no mans sky, tetris, and another I dont remember off the top of my head. No mans sky probably offered the biggest difference as tetris was still tetris with some cool 3D effects.

Wireless PCVR is very much a thing, and I'd argue that it's actually more accessible than the corded versions due to the offerings from Meta being the most sold headsets and the cheapest. Sure, you need a strong network, but when that's set up, it works well.\n\nHeaviness of the headset is obviously subjective, but I haven't had any issues since I got an aftermarket strap w/ an add-on battery. Some might struggle with this, but others probably won't. Again, this should get better with the tech\n\nNeeding a full room is a drag, yes. I will say though, I've managed to enjoy myself in the living room of an apartment without it taking away too much from the experience. This and the set up required are things that won't go away unfortunately \n\nImmersion is where I fully disagree. Sure, some games struggle from unintuitive control schemes or relatively poor graphics (almost always caused by the performance demanded for rendering a scene in both eyes at a high resolution), but the immersion is *unreal* in the right games.\n\nThe sense of scale seriously just can't be explained until someone experiences it in the right environment. Playing the Outer Wilds was what did it for me. It transforms the planets which are unique, to insanely exotic areas where your own sense of fear and scale takes over. Suddenly, (mild planet design spoilers) >!Walking on the inside wall of a planet orbiting a black hole is not just unique, but massive and terrifyingly high!< \n\nHorror / tense shooters are an obvious fit as well. In a weird way, almost every game becomes a tense experience through VR. Half Life Alyx is a great example of this. \n\nI will say though, devs are still learning what feels good in VR and what doesn't. 2 handed guns feel pretty bad generally, as can melee combat if implemented poorly. Archery and pistols feel great generally.\n\nI do agree though that not every game would be best experiences through VR. I'm not sure I'd want to play a long RPG or Stardew Valley-esque game in it. Strategy games as well\n\nFor all those reasons, I really hope it takes off and grabs mainstream adoption, because it is so deserving of games that can make use of it.",

                                  "body": "First, thank you for such a well thought out reply. I appreciate your points and have little to add from a PC perspective. Personally I will never give Meta a penny no matter how accessible or affordable it is. I really don't mean this as a jab at anyone, but it pains me that they are the current holder of the best cheap headset. Also the fact you have to have a facebook account just to use the thing keeps me away as I never have, and never will have a FB account. I digress.\n\nI think the biggest take away I got from your info is that fast paced, short session quick match games seem to offer the best experience. I limited myself to games that weren't VR exclusive and thus was unable to test out that type of game. Some of them looked fun. If your goal is 30 min to 1 hour and on a wireless headset I could see the experience being better.\n\nI also appreciate your short analysis of different game type controls you mentioned. I honestly haven't come across info like that. There is zero chance I would ever play a horror game lol, I don't enjoy jump scares and stuff. I watched people play VR resident evil and I just don't hate myself that much lol.\n\nAnother point you made makes a ton of sense regarding genres. The types of games you mentioned, like long RPGs, or long games in general, definitely hit home for me. Perhaps in the future I will give it another go and try some shooters, but that sweet ass pathfinder game is more what I'm into. I don't play shooters very often.\n\nI too hope that it progresses, there's so many annoyances to deal with from my perspective. I also hope the controls advance. Everyone seems to echo the handheld controllers but I would much rather prefer a pair of gloves that track my finger movements. Part of what kills the immersion for me is that. If you want me to grab something, i should be able to open my hand, reach for the object, then close my hand. None of this every button changes the context of your movements mess. It's not intuitive and just feels like I'm trying to play a game with extra steps.\n\nAgain thank you for the insight. I hope I wasn't too wordy, I struggle with that, but wanted to clarify and such.",

And I don't see anything wrong with them innovating in a way that a) delivers value to users and b) as a result, makes people feel like they have to buy new hardware to have new experiences.\n\n\nRT and VR are both legitimately neat and innovative tech.\n\n\nRT and VR are also spaces where companies have vastly overpromised and tried to drum up customer interest in order to sell hardware that doesn't deliver much now, banking on the idea that they will eventually become \"the de facto way to play games\" in future.\n\n\nYou could say the same of the 3DTVs. Companies really wanted to sell new TVs, so they made cool new tech, then spent a fortune \"pushing\" it to customers...it didn't take. But if it did take, customers would have been \"forced\" to get a new TV if they wanted to watch the new programs that took advantage of that tech. Obviously, no one is literally showing up to your door with a gun to make you buy a TV, so I don't mean \"forced\" literally.\n\n\nWhen the N64 came out, it \"forced\" players to upgrade from the SNES in that not upgrading locked you out of all the modern games and the experience of 3D gaming. Now, was that a bad thing? No, not at all. N64 was rad and pushed the industry forward substantially.\n\n\nBut for the past 10 years, there hasn't been that kind of significant leap in the space. There have just been incremental improvements that gamers can take or leave, depending on how much they care about graphics.\n\n\nSo these companies (like Meta and Nvidia) are trying really, really hard to make the next big thing, and they are selling the promise of the thing for a lot of money while they wait for the market to catch up.",

              "body": "Speaking from experience, I *just* replaced my 10-year-old custom built PC because my graphics card was so old it was no longer supported by the manufacturer, and a game that I wanted to play required a newer driver set which was not available for my GPU. Up to this point, I've been playing a lot of modern games and getting surprisingly decent performance out of them. Some looked better than others, and some I was able to get nice visuals out of at the price of a little frame rate loss, but it held up surprisingly well. For what I spent on that PC a decade ago, I now have a modern machine that I expect to last me another 10 years or so, and it's running games that the previous one was choking on slightly at medium settings at a buttery smooth 60 FPS at max settings.\n\nEven prior to this upgrade, I've been saying that consoles are becoming less and less appealing if you really enjoy gaming. Yeah, there's a handful of exclusive titles, but more and more these days *everything* is coming to PC even if it's delayed a little bit because deals are cut to give consoles a bit of an edge due to timed exclusivity. Then when it *does* come to PC you get to putz with the settings and possibly make things look and/or run even better than it did on console, play with mods, all that fun stuff. To top that off, especially these days, upgrading a console means that if you want to continue playing your older games, you have to hold on to the previous one and your games because backwards compatibility is simply not a consideration anymore it seems, or you have to buy a new version from a digital storefront that's been specifically made to run on your new console even though you already own it. Upgrade your PC? Here's everything you owned through Steam, GOG, Epic, etc., and it probably runs better now. Enjoy!\n\nThat's not to say that consoles don't still have a place, but back in the day they made a lot more sense, because PCs simply didn't have the kind of power dedicated to gaming that consoles did for the most part, or it was overly complex at a time when not everyone was super computer literate. We're slowly reaching a point where buying a console is going to cost almost as much as buying a decent gaming PC, and it's going to do far less. That's not necessarily a bad thing for people who just want to plug and play and use it as a media center, but it's eventually going to hit critical mass where a console is basically \"Here's the same hardware but with proprietary software and more restrictions\" and it's going to be very hard to justify console over PC. I grabbed a PS5 about a year ago and I'm honestly starting to regret having done it, because the exclusives that I wanted to play on it are all now on PC, and I have more than enough PC power to run them just as well.\n\nHonestly, I'm about to tap out on the idea of consoles outside of Nintendo stuff, because they tend to do stuff that out there and innovative and have vast libraries of *actual* exclusives. PS4 and PS5 were bought for at-the-time exclusives that no longer are and of the one or two games that actually are... I can't really justify the price tag. When consoles start delivering diminishing returns on generational upgrades is when they start losing the battle with PC.",

It is that the technology just doesn't exist.  \nWe will still get more powerful consoles as technology gets cheaper and we get more powerful hardware but the difference is really not that big.  \nWe are at a point where we just get improved versions of stuff we already have. There is no big leap anymore and at the moment it absolutely doesn't look like there is going to be one in the foreseeable future.\n\nThat was different in the past. The early 90s to mid 2000s were truly a magical and very wild time for computing development. That was when those big leaps between generations were made. \n\nps one was a shitty 33mhz chip that actually needed an extra coprocessor to handle the FMVs on the discs  \nps 2 already had a 300mhz cpu, networkign capabilities and a bunch of other stuff.  \nand then the next generation with ps3 and xbox 360 we suddenly had 64 bit multicore systems.\n\nAnd ever since then we just got more of the same in more powerful. The biggest leap we got was the fast storage interface with the current generation and that's cool but it's not exactly something revolutionary.\n\nno raytracing and pathtracing are not the net big thing out there. The industry tried to sell it to us as such but it just isn't. For the moment we are basically done with our hardware. Smaller and more efficient is what we do currently.\n\nMaybe at some point some manufactureer might be bold enough to go for a radically different architecture that allows for a bunch of new stuff but since that would kill nearly cross platform portability of the software i really don't see that happening.\n\nThe wild times are just over and we are shackled down by standards of times gone by and we ain't brave enough to toss them away.",

But even the PS2/Xbox are almost 25 years old lol. The 360/PS3 felt like a good jump, with more online focused play and HD. But yeah, I haven't been as excited for a console release since the 7th gen. It's always better, but I've never been wowed as much as the 5th-7th gens.",

We all thought that skyrim characters responding differently based on your status and actions was mindblowing - ten years from now the current 'can't be beat- games will look old and stupid. 'Must have been the wind' style immersion breaking stuff will seem so obvious and annoying when we've played games without it.",

Figures aren't exact and vary, but that seems to be generally true.\n\nThe issue with your argument (still) is that you are making massive assumptions about the market. Mostly that, again, reducing the price will result in a massive uptick in sales. Honestly I blame the way we teach economics. Students are taught the basic supply/demand curve stuff which becomes the \"a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing\" problem.\n\nIm really not interested in taking this argument further because you keep repeating the same exact mistake.\n\nSuffice it to say, that if sony or microsoft decided to take an additional 200 dollar hit on each console, they would have to expect AT LEAST a 200 dollar uptick PER CUSTOMER in revenue from licensing and direct sale from their own studios. That is an absolutely absurd figure that you are just assuming is true without evidence. \n\nWhat you aren't getting is profit margins. If you shrink profit margin too much, then it doesn't matter how many units you sell, it'll never cover the losses. Thats why there are Ferraris and Renaults. You can't sell a ferrari for the price of a standard car and make money.",

These things make it extremely difficult for devs to release a product that is performant AND beautiful with a reasonable budget. Each console has its own hardware features and APIs that must be leveraged to maximize performance, each requiring its own variation of the source code to do so.\n\nI think we would be better off if the consumer/marketing fervour for both non-exclusive games and mind-bending graphics was curbed so devs could focus on delivering a higher quality gameplay experience.\n\nAside from market pressures driving a desire for graphics and multi-platform availability, it is unreasonable to ask a company to build a machine for a budget price-point that can run ANY code at some target frame-rate. It\u2019s up to the devs at this point. Funny enough, the constraints of earlier console were a blessing in that it forced a creative optimize-first mentality. The consoles we have now are so capable that the new constraint is generating a game with enough high-quality content to justify the purchase of such a powerful machine. Funny enough, this constraint doesn\u2019t force devs to optimize for elegant code/asset solutions, but instead for logistics and pipelines during the development phase to enable the creation of a complex experience with the input of many different people. A totally different challenge for a totally different machine.\n\nHopefully the atmosphere changes because we could have some very high fidelity games at 120fps with smaller gameplay scopes to enable quicker dev turnaround time and higher overall quality.",

For instance, voxels have had immense scalability, but most people didn't like the blocky textures they resulted in.

In a lot of ways the PS5 is very similar to the PS3, which released almost 20 years ago. 20 years before the PS3 was the NES. So the rate of change has radically slowed down.\n\nIt's possible there will be some giant breakthrough in the future like quantum computing that will change things, but it seems just as plausible to me that things will just get slowly more powerful and better the way they have for the past 20 years.",

Standard SSDs is such a leap in loading times and zone sizes, but has been hard to adopt just because most games still have to function on previous gen machines due to slow console sales. VR is not being widely adopted. HDR tvs at peak performance are expensive. CDs opened so many doors in terms of the structure and size of games, but what's next on that front? Beyond bigger discs and bigger drives, where do we go next?\n\nSo yeah. Console releases should reasonably slow down until some kind of new evolution happens.\n\nEdit: The latest revolution was the Switch being a console you can plug into a TV and get a semi decent image. And Sony was ahead of the game on it with... Vita, right? It at least had the outputs i think. Or was it before that? Anyway, I don't think they'd solved battery life and the games were still behind in terms of power and fidelity. I think we can all agree that Switch made it into the lowest acceptable level of fidelity and convenience. It struggles to run things but it's certainly funding the research of how to do it better.",

Embracer Group and other private equity firms are basically holding back the industry because all they care about is cost cutting and delivering the bare minimum. Once that shit gets cut out, we will start to see more innovation and it is likely to be neural networks trained to generate specific effects in unique scenarios to deliver visuals previously impossible to do with traditional rendering techniques.",

Out of the two, Wii never caused anyone to feel like it was anything special, but VR has consistently blown minds and caused people to burst into tears, in a good way.\n\nI think that your examples were great leaps, but smaller than VR because we already played arcade games, so having them at home is just taking the same experience and applying it to your couch. CRT 480p TVs to HD TVs revealed plenty of extra detail, but at the end of the day it's just extra resolving power of graphics and art and doesn't change gameplay. \n\nYour Zelda example is where things really took a big leap, it was both a graphical and gameplay change but even still the control scheme and output device (TV) still remained the same or similar.\n\nWhat makes VR so different is that it is a radical change in control scheme *and* the only form of digital media of the last 100+ years that goes outside the rectangular box that all prior media was displayed on. With VR there is no TV, no screen, just a seamless 3D view.",

I assume you are younger because it was a massive moment to go from coin-operated games in a laundry mat to being able to play at home. It changed everything. It wasn't a simple change-of-screen, it was a change of life for a gamer. We were no longer restricted to weekends, business hours, and pocket change. We could play anytime we wanted, and all night long.\n\n I'm curious play what has brought some to tears to people in your VR example that has you passionate. For me, an old timer, Strapping a screen to your head, and using head motion as a joystick is still just a neat concept. Its like Virtual Boy when I first tried that. It's still clunky and uncomfortable to me.\n\nHowever, In 1996, as a kid, seeing Mario side scrolling through a digital coloring book leap into full-fledged exploration just like I did in the backyard running around, was absolutely my teary-eyed moment.",

Half Life Alyx especially the moments with the striders as it's an overwhelming feeling, and Star Wars Vader Immortal as it brings the fantasy of being a Jedi and standing before Darth Vader to life, for the first time.",

But, the current issue is they run ARM instructions only.\n\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 3 chips are capable of running emulators very well. 3x-5x native resolution on PCSX2 for example, at about 7 watts only.\n\nHell, they've even been able to run Windows games at about 720p and a little higher, using a Windows emulator package.",

If most games for a console were capable of running at like +60 FPS, and use VRR displays so it doesn't have to be locked, consoles would look like a much more attractive prospect to me.",

That\u2019s why the games looked great for their time (especially post-N64 being a disc - GDR - based 1Gb format) to make games do what was pretty damn good looking at the time.\n\nThe problem is gaming PCs are mixtures of Frankenstein specs, speeds of memory, speeds of processors, numbers of cores, models of video cards, etc.   So many sliding options\u2026 which is why your can always tweak another setting to make things look amazing.",

I get the game and popped it in excited to start playing. Said I had to update/install the game, freaking 97gb and almost 3 hours install time. WTF. Fine, whatever I waited. Once done, I asked the nephew if he wanted to play split screen multiplayer. Selected multiplayer and I have to pay to play. Now Im getting annoyed. Decided to play campaign mode instead. Clicked on it and said I have to download it, another hour. MOTHERFCUKER. I almost beamed the controller at the tv. What's the point of me buying the disk version instead of digital then??

Now they can really only sell you performance upgrades.\n\nNintendo is not part of this as much, but the same rules apply. They have graphics to still sell you and performance they still deny you to sell later because of price points they want to reach. For good and ill.\n\nI am chasing experiences at this point.

Holograms cannot be invented in the next 20 years, so VR has 20+ years to improve until consumers want to buy in.\n\nYou bring up Google Glass and stuff as examples of glasses-like devices that people don't care for, but that's precisely because they lack value. What if VR was in a sunglasses-like form factor? Now you have value combined with a decent form factor rather than just one.",
