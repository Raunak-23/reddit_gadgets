They could've probably sold twice as many, but if it's at a 20% lower price, that might halve their profit margin, so they would've ended up with the same consumer GPU profit but fewer wafers allocated to data centres where they have even larger profit margins.\n\nPretty much the only reason they're releasing consumer GPUs at the moment at all is to stay relevant in the consumer GPU market. If it were purely about immediate profits, they'd either dedicate all their wafers to data centres or only sell consumer GPUs at even higher prices to match data centre margins.",

But you could get one at MSRP just a few months after release and it remained available at that price until the 50 series dawned on the horizon. Mining on the 3090 was never cost effective, that only affected some particular models that happened to have a good performance/price/energy usage ratio.

However, there\u2019s still some incentive and we\u2019ve absolutely seen more housing units being made in recent years. \n\nI guarantee you if COVID 2027 comes around and it kills half the population home prices will indeed drop. \n\nProbably GPUs too, for that matter.",

Demand is far greater than production capacity at every cutting edge node currently. Add onto that the crypto booms and now AI bubble and you have even larger demands from groups willing to pay much more than your average gamer. Look at how much people around reddit were losing their minds over a 2k prosumer GPU, that honestly was quite a good deal if you looked at it beyond just gaming.",
