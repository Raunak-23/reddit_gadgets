              "body": "The point the article makes is that they're pushing the envelope in a way that isn't actually very productive.\n\nGen 5 PCIe drives tend to be bottlenecked not by the PCIe speed but by their own thermal throttling, at least in large file transfers where you can actually make use of the extremely high consecutive transfer speed. So rather than bumping the protocol to PCIe 6, it makes more sense to invest in controllers that produce less heat, or improvements in heat dissipation.\n\nAdditionally, as the article points out, in real world scenarios the latency of the storage medium is now typically much more important than its read/write bandwidth. Optane was much better in this regard than NAND flash SSDs, but sadly that technology is basically dead. So rather than pushing on a metric that is likely to matter in the real world (latency), the drive developers are pushing a metric that is already near impossible to fully utilize (bandwidth).\n\nOf course, technology makers are free to experiment with any technology they wish, but it's reasonable for tech journalists to point out the flaws in what they're doing and to warn consumers about getting over-hyped about a technology that probably won't benefit them.",

      "body": "Jeremy Laird clearly doesn't understand the difference between theoretical and real world. There has NEVER been a full 100% bandwidth device. EVERY storage device since inception has to interface an encoder. In the PCIE 2 days, the encoding scheme was 8b/10b which had a hefty overhead penalty. With Gen 3,4 and 5, the PCIE standard moved to a very efficient 128b/130b encoding scheme, so the overhead penalty is now less than 2%. \n\nHe also clearly doesn't know what the bandwidth is for. ***And it's not for gaming***. Believe it or not there are other uses for a computer. If ANYONE has ever edited video or analyzed databases or even machine learning you would know that PCIE is the only standard for PC based computing that opens up bandwidth to Storage, GPU's, Networking and any data transfer device.",
