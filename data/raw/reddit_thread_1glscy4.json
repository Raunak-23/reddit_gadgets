They do not read up on anything or dont even care, they vote mostly based on who promised the moon and beyond in their marketing.\n\nSame thing in germany. Like my mother is working near minimum wage and is close to pension, actually wants to go early into pension, but owns a house with solar, though its close to a river so its at risk of flooding if climate keeps getting worse. Yet she votes for those people that want to cut benefits for lower income people, are against solar (so will probably cut tax benefits for it, last time I checked they literally had politicians that say maybe the reason for climate change is solar collecting the sun energy and thus heating the planet lol), want to raise pension age requirements and dont give a fuck about climate change and especially not floodings. Oh and also while I havent read much about tariffs with them, they want to cut farming subsidies so most basic food becomes way more expensive.\n\nWhy she votes for them? Their tiktoks are great at blaming immigrants for everything and promising the moon.\n\nBtw. caselabs went out of business because of trump back then already.",

In factorio there are massive differences with memory and cache performance. One of the tricks to get the most out of your CPU is running under Linux with hugepages enabled, notice that a lot of the fastest individual runs are on linux. The benchmark is now also mixes results from 1.1 and 2.0 if you don't filter out old results, which has big differences in terms of performance optimizations. And it sadly doesn't list memory timings or speeds - the listed memory kit on the runs is just based on the model number, not what the kit is actually running at.\n\nIn general, one has to be careful trusting benchmarks from strangers. You never know what else they were doing on their system at the same time. One of the advantages of factoriobox is that it is very reproducible when running locally.\n\nAs well as the fact that it obviously doesn't measure performance for anything but factorio. Its not relevant at all for anything else.",

The core parking is a result of your OS and driver working together, and in windows the OS is perfectly capable of waking the parked cores to handle non game threads if there's enough load on the v-cache CCD. That will always be better than running everything on the one CCD. Especially since the vcache CCD on the 9950 should have a slighly higher clock speed out of the box than on the 9800\n\nWhich means the  9950 should also be slightly better for gaming, but without a good non gaming reason to buy it, the 9800 should perform basically the same for cheaper. And without the potential headache of cores not parking correctly.",

          "body": "On default probably. If you're willing to finagle it, you can *probably* get identical or slightly better performance than a 9800X3d by disabling half of the L3 cache on the 9950X3d. It'd behave like a 9800x3d but it'd have an additional 8 cores.  the #950X3D was always slower because windows scheduler doesn't do a perfect job of using the right cores/cache and it wastes time to communicate across. \n\nFor those wanting an ELI5... Its like having two identical towers and your operating system accidentally sent info to the wrong tower(even when it was told not to), but that tower processes info anyways just as well. Then that tower needs to communicate with the other tower to be sure, and then its good to go. rather if it was processed in the correct tower it wouldn't need to check, it just goes.  Hence #800X3d tends to do better in most games. If you turn off a tower completely though windows won't accidentally send the data to the wrong tower, but you still have extra infrastructure of roads(cores) meaning you could see improvement in the X950x3d since its basically a x800x3d now. \n\nFor the discerning buyer... while the 9800x3d is better than the 7800x3d, its overkill in many ways. We're basically approaching the limits of gains from CPUs for gaming. Yes you can get an extra ~50-100 frames in 1080p low gaming. Except you need a monitor that can handle that jump from 500-600fps. If you actually play on 2k-4k ultra settings like a normal person though, you're going to get like ~1-3fps gains. Like sure the 9800x3d or 9950x3d is the next \"king\" but if you can get a 7800x3d or 7950x3d with mobo for cheap you're not missing out. \n\nThe real gains of upgrading from a lets say a 7800x3d to the 9800x3d is more about what zen 4 architecture supports vs zen 5 architecture. I.e. PCIE 5.0 lanes and higher supported ram speeds. Faster Ram will get you more gains in the FPS department than a CPU swap most likely.",

I hope somebody takes the time to concretely benchmark the past issues, the alleged fixes, and how the new chip fares in that regard.\n\nResources for those of us who are, shall we say, \"sensitive\" to theoretically subtle drawbacks are extremely rare.  I'll point to TVs as an example: Samsung are somewhat infamous for instituting non-defeatable characteristics into their TVs, designed to trick the vast majority of people even if it simultaneously ruins the entire package for the <1% who notices what's going on.  QLEDs all use dithering and global dimming which essentially cannot be defeated even in the service menu.  To me, those are basically dealbreakers, but I guarantee you almost nobody is even aware.\n\nThat's why I just can't buy simple or theoretical assurances that known issues in prosumer hardware are going to be solved, when those issues clearly never were big enough to ruffle too many feathers and actually ding sales.",

      "body": "I\u2019m amazed at the lack of understanding of tariffs here and the rest of the world. We suffer from crippling tariffs on many US made products that are exported, yet we let that same product come into US for free. This has cost the US in terms of jobs moving to some of those countries. Harley couldn\u2019t sell their bikes in India by Indian law. They agreed to change the law in exchange for opening the Mango market here. Once they changed the law India charged Harley a 150% tariff. This caused Harley to assemble bikes in India, thus depriving Harley workers in the US of those jobs. All of this time we allow Indian made motorcycles into the US for zero duty. The PM of India cut their tariff by 50% just because Trump told them that turnabout is fair play. How is any of the tariffs we pay to sell in other countries while their countries product can come to the US for free? What blows me away is wondering how we got here in the first place?\nWe may pay a bit more for certain things, but we\u2019re not exporting as many jobs. Strategic tariffs are a good thing. Free trade is a buzz word that has no real world applications.",
