If the fragrance is an issue, which you can just buy fragrance free, it might be a little higher than that.\n\nSo let's just go real high and say it's 5% of the population has a hard time with most deodorant. They can just buy aluminum and fragrance free products which is probably not that expensive. I don't know about everyone else but I buy regular stick deodorant and it lasts a while and I use it daily. There's no way this machine will be better or cheaper.\n\nAt the end of the article it says it will retail for $250. Even if you buy the fancier stuff and it costs $10 and you go through it like crazy so 1 every 3 months that will take you over 6 YEARS to break even. I highly highly doubt this will last 6 years, probably won't even last half that. Even if you go through 1 a month which is absolutely insane that's still 2 years.\n\nMaybe this product does work but it sure as hell not cost effective.",

      "body": "\"Here's how the technology is claimed to work \u2026\n\nTwice each day, the user starts by holding the PlaDeo gently beneath each clean, dry armpit. A silicone gasket creates a 1-cm (0.4-in) gap between the device's main body and the underarm skin.\n\nPressing and holding the power button causes the PlaDeo to start producing ionized gas (namely cold atmospheric plasma) for 1.5 minutes. Should the user be prone to particularly stinky armpits, they can boost the time to three minutes per pit by pressing the button twice.\n\n\nIn either case, the plasma in turn produces chemicals known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). These kill odor-causing bacteria like Staphylococcus hominis and Corynebacterium xerosis, mainly by rupturing their outer cell walls. The ROS also break down any VOC molecules that those microbes may have already produced. But thanks to the 1-cm gap between the device's plasma emitter and the skin, the ROS are claimed to not harm the skin cells.\"\n\n\n\n\nWow. So convenient to have a mid day pit wash and dry followed by a 3-6 min plasma session.",

And a stick costs $10 but lasts forever. Like over a year. \n\nThe only requirement is to apply it after you shower. It has to go on wet, clean skin. And use a lot of it, liberally cover the entire armpit and then some. \n\nIf you do that, you can sweat through your clothes, and not only will you be stink free, your clothes will smell fresh too, cause there\u2019s nothing around to cause an odour. I have confirmed this with my wife, after I drenched my shirt\u2026 it didn\u2019t smell at all and neither did I.

It\u2019s a pretty basic application of logic to realize that even if this device operates perfectly, a cheap stick that does the same thing better is going to be preferable in every way. \n\nApply logic a little further and you\u2019ll realize that this review is much more helpful than a review from somebody who has used this device but doesn\u2019t know about mineral rock deodorant. They might think this device is an amazing breakthrough in technology that totally justifies its exorbitant $250 price tag for people who can\u2019t use conventional deodorant. In reality a $10 alternative already exists for those people. You could find that person\u2019s positive review and choose to pay $250 for this device, and be very happy with it\u2026 blissfully unaware that you could have paid $10 for a much more convenient option. \n\nHonestly I was just trying to be helpful and save you that. But it would seem my use of the word \u201creview\u201d has motivated you the opposite way somehow, as you seem very emotionally invested in wasting your money. Try this thing out and let me know how well it does at killing those bacteria for half the day, with a 1.5 minute application time, for $250. No matter how well it does, I\u2019ll keep using my stick that works for 48 hours, applied in 15 seconds, and cost $10.",
