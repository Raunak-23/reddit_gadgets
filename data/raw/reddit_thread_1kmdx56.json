      "body": "From the article: Sony has sold 77.8 million PlayStation 5s since the console first went on sale in 2020 after shipping 2.8 million units in its latest quarter, the company announced. That figure lines up remarkably well with PlayStation 4 sales which hit 79.1 million units in approximately the same amount of time. However, Sony's full year fiscal 2024 PS5 sales of 18.5 million were down compared to the 20.8 million it sold in 2023.\n\nGame sales more than made up for that though, rising nine percent and helping push the division's operating income up 43 percent year over year. That was largely due to third-party sales, as first-party sales actually fell a bit. Sony has only released one first-party game so far this year with key titles like Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Y\u014dtei still to come.\n\nSony doesn't expect this growth to continue, though. The company is predicting a \u00a5100 billion ($700 million) hit to sales next year due to tariffs, given that most of its sales occur in the US \u2014 and the company had already forecast flat revenue for 2025. Another key blow was the delay of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto VI launch that was just pushed back to May 2026.\n\nDuring its earnings call, Sony said that it was considering \"passing on\" tariff hikes to consumers, though it didn't mention the PS5 or US specifically. The company has already raised the price of the console in other territories including Europe, but US increases are extremely rare. Sony CEO HIroki Totoki also brought up the possibility of building the PlayStation 5 in the US, saying it's something that \"has to be considered going forward.\"",

I can't see Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo pulling the same numbers next time. Big shift to PC gaming especially as steam deck and clones get better and cheaper.",

Consumer perception is a curious beast, and depends on how the actions of a platform holder hit customers. As for game exclusivity, MS has spent literal billions to achieve exclusivity before realizing that selling games to customers is more lucrative than Game pass, and noticing a ready made consumer base who own PlayStation 5.\n\nThe Switch 2 is costly enough that Nintendo may actually threaten their perception as a game console for everyone, and depending on games releases could be a competition with PlayStation.",
