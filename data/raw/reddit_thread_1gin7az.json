But even setting aside the fact that an entirely new user interface paradigm needs to be worked out and refined in order to make switching between various third party applications intuitive and seamless (some of which Apple has already done with VisionOS but from what I\u2019ve seen their current system is pretty simplistic and needs to be expanded quite a bit) there\u2019s the problem that serious software would need to be ported not just to a new OS but to a radically different and unprecedented interface concept that would need way more effort put into it than 2D user interfaces that already exist.\n\nTo me the obvious answer is to port iMovie and GarageBand, and to make them have radically new UI/UX concepts that really sell the idea of what they call \u201cspatial computing\u201d. It needs to be the kind of thing where it offers genuine benefits over traditional screen-based workflows, which is easy enough to imagine but difficult, expensive, and time consuming to implement, but they\u2019re the only ones who should be expected to expend that effort if they want their multi-billion dollar investment to pay off. Then have versions of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro ready at the same time, so that after people try the new interface and want to do more serious work they have an option, which should lead to other competitors to start development on porting their own software.\n\nI think Apple was expecting something similar to iOS 2 allowing third-party iPhone apps, or the iPad allowing companies to bridge the gap between iPhone apps and desktop apps, or later Apple Watch apps and complications. In all of those cases Apple didn\u2019t really put that much effort into it apart from saying \u201chere are the tools, have at it\u201d. But those were very simple and easy to accomplish, consisting of little more than porting existing software ideas to new hardware, rather than needing to invent totally new ways to interact with software.\n\nThe Vision line is much more like the original Macintosh, where for a while software developers were at a loss for how to translate existing software to a GUI and the platform gained a reputation as a technical marvel with a lack of software until desktop publishing took off and the rest of the industry figured out how to make GUI software. But it could be argued that this time it\u2019s going to be even more of a challenge, even transitioning from command-line text-only interfaces to GUIs wasn\u2019t quite as big of a jump as the transition from GUIs to fully immersive VR workflows will be.\n\nApple has a reputation of being one of the only computer companies big enough to invest the kind of time and money needed to prove new technologies that others see the potential in but are hesitant to invest in. This is no different, if they don\u2019t put the effort in nobody else will, and the only ones they would have to blame are themselves.",

The quest 3 has some AR features but they are very subpar. I'm interested to see what the next iteration will hold for AR. One of them will get to it first, I'm sure Facebook is trying to one up them before this releases in 2027.",

                  "body": "My personal wildcard is the Valve Deckard. Supposedly they\u2019re still working on it, a PC VR standalone headset based on beefed-up Steam Deck hardware and software, that can run PC VR software via Steam VR without needing a computer or Windows. The PC VR platform has the most potential and flexibility compared to the walled garden approach of Apple or Meta or PSVR, but the whole industry feels like it has been on life support ever since it went mainstream a decade ago. The PC side has the best hardware hands down, but it\u2019s generally far too expensive and finicky for the general public and the software side has been lacking as there has yet to be a true killer app and many big titles get exclusivity deals with Meta and other walled garden VR platforms.\n\nIf (and this is a *big* if) the Valve Deckard comes to market and is a success I think it will have the potential to get people interested in VR on the PC again. It will be expensive, rumors are pointing to somewhere in the range of a thousand dollars minimum, but at launch it will automatically have the largest library of existing VR software and it will likely be competitively priced since unlike any other PC hardware manufacturer Valve is capable of doing the thing that consoles and dedicated devices often do where they sell the hardware at a loss and make back that loss via their cut of Steam game/software sales. And it will pretty much by default be the cheapest and most accessible entry point for consumer PC VR, since even if it costs more than the Valve Index you don\u2019t also need a $1-2000 computer to go alongside it.\n\nAnd if that all plays out like everyone is hoping then another benefit that\u2019s relevant to this discussion is that it will effectively become the most accessible entry point for VR development. Trying to make a VR app for Apple or Meta or some other ecosystem isn\u2019t impossible but it\u2019s not going to be easy or cheap. PC VR, on the other hand, is something that any hobbyist programmer can dabble with and experiment with new ideas. We\u2019ve already seen that before, with PC VR historically having a lot more tech demos and proof of concept software made by small teams or individuals. But PCVR has always been a small and fragmented market, which is why all the developers seem to partner with Meta or one of the other big players to try to achieve success. The Deckard would be a relatively powerful, relatively affordable platform with the openness of being a PC that runs normal PC software, allowing for quicker and easier development by smaller teams with fewer resources. It would be far easier for someone to experiment with ideas and put their work out there and get feedback.\n\nI\u2019m still not confident that it could jump start the Virtual workspace software market the way that something big from a major developer would, but it might at least get us moving in the right direction. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything crazy like a VR DAW or video editing suite, certainly not the more niche and industry-oriented graphic design or 3D modeling/animation/art software that I\u2019ve been wishing for. But it would be the most likely platform for *someone* to develop *something* that shows the kind of potential benefits that a fully virtual workflow could have compared to traditional monitors and mouse/keyboard. And once someone has proved the concept others will want to try their hand at it, which could eventually down the road lead to bigger software developers porting their suites to VR.\n\nAnd I do keep talking about VR as opposed to AR but I think a lot of virtual workspaces don\u2019t necessarily *need* to be AR. They may benefit from it, sure, and others wouldn\u2019t really work that well without AR, but it has to start somewhere and I think there are a lot of potential scenarios where VR is good enough to get people interested and enthusiastic. So while something like the Vision Pro definitely has a lot more potential as a serious virtual workspace platform I still think a purely VR headset that offers a convenient and accessible development platform for experimentation could potentially lead to some major progress in the concept.",

          "body": "The problem even at $1,500 is device fatigue.  People have phones, laptops, tablets, TVs - they all cost roughly $1k-$1,500 or much less for budget versions.  Not only does this eat up money, but it eats up time.  People have only so much free time in a day, and while VR/AR can offer very novel and interesting experiences, it has become harder and harder for people to justify yet another device in their lives with so much already competing for their attention.  \n\nWhile an argument can be made that headsets can replace some of these devices, I don't think it's so simple because being a wearable is a huge shift in how one uses the device.  Sure, I can run iPad apps on a VP, but I'd rather just use my iPad.\n\nI really enjoy VR and there's certain games and apps that totally sucked me in.  But at the same time I've just kind of fallen off of it because there are honestly too many other things to do, and right now the VR/AR space doesn't get a lot of investment.",

Nobody even talks about it anymore except that it looks goofy.\n\nThat's why I also think a cheaper price or \"light\" version isn't going to move the needle. I would also give it five years or more for innovation and improvement. Meta Orion seems the way to go but that's even more expensive and not yet ready for mass production.",

When you see high return rates consistently at one location, it\u2019s usually a strong sign that the same pattern could be happening across other stores. Trends often reveal broader issues, especially with a product as unique and experimental as the Vision Pro. Right now, people are struggling to see enough everyday, practical value in it. They\u2019re hesitant to keep a $4,000+ device that, at the end of the day, currently mostly offers an immersive way to watch movies, play a limited selection of games, or do tasks they can already handle (often more easily) on their laptops or phones. The AVP has potential, sure, but it currently lacks that \u2018killer app\u2019 or practical functionality that makes it indispensable. For most people, that\u2019s just not enough to justify the price, and it's evident in the returns and feedback. People were expecting something revolutionary, but most are finding it doesn\u2019t add much to their daily lives beyond what they already have.\n\nMy roommate has worked at one of the demo stores for 10 years and we actually have a Vision Pro here at home. It was getting tons of use for the first few weeks, but now? It mostly just sits there. The novelty of watching a movie in a virtual theater wears off when you realize you still have all the same options on a regular screen, which is easier and often more comfortable to look at.",

It's that there's literally no support for this device. For someone like myself that WANTS it really really bad and do have the extra cash laying around for something like this, my drawback is the support. I'd use it for sports and watching movies. Quest has xstadium from what I've seen and has roughly 50+ immersive games for nba. Why would I go to apple if they don't even have that yet? I've seen it in the demo but it's not out. \n\nOnce prices start to get between 1500-2000 I might just bite but by then it'll be too late I might have a quest 3 or 4 and I'll wait for the next edition of avp. One reason I'm holding back from the quest is I'm hearing the visual quality is better and touch gestures on the avp. I'm also entirely in the apple ecosystem.",

Engineers wanted plastic because it wouldn\u2019t shatter.

But if they drop and shatter it, they\u2019ll blame themselves. Jobs was right. Customers prefer the glass with a better feel with the trade off that accidents happen.",
