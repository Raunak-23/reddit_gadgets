Apple is fighting tooth and nail against ANY and ALL law enforcement agencies and governments getting control of user data. It's a bad time for those agencies and governments, but for Apple and their customer-base? This is amazing news. A for-profit company doing good stuff to protect user privacy? In an economy built on selling as much information about your customers as possible? That's a damn good job from Apple.\n\nThis is just the latest in the FBI's attempts at forcing Apple to make a backdoor for them into their operating systems. They first tried the legal way, but found that Apple broke no laws. Then they tried to drag their name through the mud as being anti-USA, anti-patriotic, and helping terrorists, but that didn't work. Now they're trying to blame Apple for CSAM.\n\nI'm fine with Apple providing information in court cases where there is legal reason and basis for them to do so, with a signed court order where all due process and careful considerations have been made to protect any and all potentially affected users. That's perfectly fine with me. What I'm not okay with is any law enforcement agency being able to just unlock my stuff and check all my private information and data, because of some made up accusations or suspicions.",

I doubt the FBI is going after apple for hosting organized CSAM traders, it\u2019s likely more of an issue with minors being trafficked or kids sharing way more than they should.\n\nAs for how you guarantee the model doesn\u2019t mess up, I\u2019m not sure. That would be a problem for apple to solve. \n\nI\u2019d say maybe there could be some meet in the middle solution, where if you go to upload content that\u2019s automatically flagged locally, your device would warn you that it breaks ToS, and offer that either you upload the flagged media and have it manually reviewed, or you keep it to yourself. \n\nI\u2019m no expert, I\u2019m just throwing out ideas I guess. But I do think it\u2019s an interesting concept. Privacy and moderation will always be at ends with one another.\n\nEdit: grammar",
