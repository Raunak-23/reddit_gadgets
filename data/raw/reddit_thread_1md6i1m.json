They used it to put a halo around a puck, and red lines followed a hard shot or pass. It was thought that this would help people follow the game better, and it did - at least for new fans. \n\nOlder existing fans had already learned to track the puck (this was way before HD) by looking for the guy with both hands on his stick and his stick on the ice, so they thought it was unnecessary and gimmicky. The players absolutely hated it because the chip wouldn\u2019t function correctly if the puck was frozen, which it usually is in ice hockey, which led to a much bouncier puck that the players had a very hard time adjusting to. \n\nIt only lasted a few years, but fun fact: a variant of the FoxTrax technology is still used to track cars and show interactive labels on them in racing events like NASCAR broadcasts.",

That\u2019s an incredibly large range - 8 +/- 0.5 means it can vary by 6.25% in either direction - and leads one to the reasonable assumption that a deviation of **less than a gram** in a ball that\u2019s supposed to weigh 600 grams would be within the tolerance for a regulation ball.\n\nA 0.16% difference in weight is not going to affect anything when one \u201cregulation\u201d ball could have 13.3% more pressure than another. If the ball absorbs a milliliter of water, its weight will increase by more than it did from the sensor. In other words, if about 20 droplets of sweat are absorbed into the ball, that will impact the weight more than the sensor.\n\nIs that enough info to defend a general statement about the sensor *probably* not impacting the ball\u2019s physics",
