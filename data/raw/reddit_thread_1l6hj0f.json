Likely something you can toggle on and off in the settings as something Windows 11 boots into, or you can manually enter it from the standard Windows 11 desktop.\n\nSo basically the same idea as SteamOS with its Gaming Mode vs. KDE Desktop.\n\nThey claim substantial resource improvements, but I'd take it with a grain of salt. It's likely just an extension of the already-existing Game Mode toggle in Windows, which claims to disable background apps when running a game, but doesn't really have much effect. \n\nThe bigger news is mostly just a fully supported controller-centric UX, whereas currently using controllers to navigate Windows is like pulling teeth.",

SteamOS adds a fancy UI up front, but everything else is standard open source stuff.\n\nSo if the hardware is compatible, SteamOS will run on it just like a Steam Deck. So you can absolutely get the exact same console experience on a compatible mini PC.\n\nI only say this because I already run SteamOS on non-Deck but Linux-compatible hardware, and I can tell you right now, the experience is the same as the Deck.

TOTK is the hardest game to run, 30 to 40 with shader compilation stuttering in the mid 20's looks extremely good when you consider that TOTK is the \"peak\" of the switch.",

Portal is actually a good balance.\u00a0\n\nIf my opinion matters (usually doesn\u2019t) would get an open box Ally X and wait and see what the next gen has.\u00a0\n\nPersonally waiting for OLED HDR VRR, 8inches, RDNA 4/or DLSS, 3+ hour battery life on intensive games like Cyberpunk and easy dockability, greater than 30% improvement on Z1E at 1080 or 1200p (~60fps locked Ray tracing High Cyberpunk with quality upscaling) Under $1000. \u00a0Feel like we\u2019re almost there.\u00a0\n\nFrom seeing what GTA6 can look like on a base PS5, have a feeling that devs will start optimizing for current gen hardware a lot better now to stay competitive, and that may prolong the life of Z1E/Z2E, and can mean that Z3 or Z4 might actually be console replacements, like the switch is for Nintendo.\u00a0\n\nTime will tell.

          "body": "I want to believe in it, but at the same time Microsoft is actively pushing Windows to be worse and worse. I wonder how all those updates will affect this console.\n\nWill it also force update at some point without your consent?\n\nWill the updates break games randomly?\n\nWill the bloat lessen or will it continue to increase? It already has some new co-pilot bloat announced.\n\nI am very sceptical that it will actually stay a good experience. Cause Microsoft sucks at developing towards good experience. I doubt they will remove all the telemetry. Or that spy stuff that will screenshot your screen, analyse it and collect it in a nice easy to find sorted folder for any hacker to get.\n\nThen you have ASUS, some of the worst support given from any company. The amount of handhelds they have pushed out in a short amount of time doesn't really scream, \"We will support these longterm\".",

              "body": "A few things.\n\nFirst, Nintendo is knocking on their door willy-nilly.  Core consoles as epitomized by MS/Sony stopped offering anything over PCs by the end of the Xbox 360 era and have depreciated conspicuously with each gen since.  Nintendo's Switch 2 is now very nearly a competitor in a space Nintendo deliberately abandoned with the advent of the Wii, and this is underscored by the likes of From Software making their next major game exclusive to Nintendo.  The two audiences are officially recombining, thanks entirely to the ever-diminishing relative power of traditional core consoles.\n\nSecond, Microsoft has understood the path forward quite well, and they have been taking advantage of their unique position as the merchants of Windows to establish the only kind of platform that makes sense in a world where consoles can never again catch up with PCs.\n\nThird, \"Sony exclusives\" are increasingly anomalous, and one would have a hard time arguing that a large proportion of console users buy a Playstation specifically and only to play games that are exclusive to the platform.  Capcom and others are leading the charge to the inevitable, and the payoff is obvious, with more than half of Capcom's revenue generated from PC sales.  Within this context, the entire point of \"a non portable console\" unavoidably blurs, and the biggest remaining appeal of anything non-portable is how it stacks up against PCs as a value prospect\u2014which itself gets strained by the reality of how much more can be done on an open platform, including upcoming devices that support SteamOS.\n\nIf Sony were to make another traditional core console without portability, they would realistically have no choice but to allow SteamOS and Gamepass on their device.  On that note, I also fully expect them to establish their own Gamepass clone that works well on Steamdeck and Windows.",

The best path for Sony for the PS6 is to still release the PS6 as a console and then release a companion PSP2/Vita 2.",

I think it will have a _token, theoretical_ advantage, just to avoid looking like they took a step backwards, and that it will instead leverage DLSS-equivalent upscaling and framegen to fill in the otherwise unavoidable performance gap.  That part of it is blatantly obvious, since the audience for console-like hardware, to differentiate from PC purists, have all the patience in the world for the artifacting and latency you get from those techs.  Sony also have the option to use a more advanced process node than 8nm.",
