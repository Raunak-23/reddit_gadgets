                      "body": "Patenting something is super expensive.\n\nPlus, the expensive part isn't the idea. It's doing the R&D to make it real.\n\nNormally medical patents aren't for the idea, it'll be for some key part of it. E.g. in this case the patent would be for a small implantable oxygen sensor. Insulin patents aren't for insulin nowadays, its for the specific method they're using to produce it. \n\nAlthough I'm guessing you having patented the broad strokes would stop someone else innovating on it without your permission, you'd need to check with a patent attorney.\n\nYou've got to design/source a low oxygen sensor small enough to be implanted. Then design the rest of the system to use that sensor to decide when to deploy the narcan. Then design a package for it that can be sterilised and implanted. \n\nThen comes testing. You have to get medical approval which means proving the device will never trigger for anything but an overdose (what if someone is hiking up a mountain? Will it trigger? What if someone drowns? Will it trigger and make the situation worse?). Is the dose right? Can you fit the right dose in your device? Is the right dose small enough to be implanted?\n\nFrom an ethics side would a patient having one of these mean they're more likely to overdose because they know the device will save them, making them less cautious?\n\nThen you've got to convince people to let this get implanted into them.\n\nNone of these problems are impossible to solve, but they're not cheap. A non profit wouldn't be able to afford it.\n\nThe chaotic neutral method is to just publicly publish the idea (which OP already has), you can't patent an idea that's already public so no-one else can patent it. While you avoid the cost of a patent lawyer. Although again they might just patent a key part of the more detailed design, like I mentioned earlier.\n\nAlso *maybe* the idea is unpatentable because it's now public knowledge, you'd need to check with a patent attorney.",
