Some are more flexible than others and some will precipitate/aggregate if you look at them the wrong way. Ugh.",

We're hoping the infusion delivery method is more effective than both the oral Rinvoq and the sub-q version of Cosentyx, which I've already been on. It's worked the best out of all of the meds, it just wore off too soon; it's newly available as an infusion, so that's why I'm trying it again. \n\nI will gladly drag myself to The Cancer Center every month for an IV if I get my life back. I would do it once a week if I could feel 50% of my pre-illness normal. Whatever works.",

Maybe the infusion version of the antibody I\u2019m on is a better method for controlling my disease activity. Ocrevus can be given as an infusion or now, a 10 minute injection. There\u2019s also Briumvi which again, is the same antibody, but with slight modifications (glycosylation) to prevent it from triggering allergic reactions. Right now, I\u2019m on Kesimpta, the once a month injection. \n\nSo far, the injectable form is\u2026not so effective. At least it wasn\u2019t after my first three loading doses and I ended up in the hospital for a week. My neurologist told me to stay the course and check in at 6 months, which reminds me\u2014I need to schedule my MRI.\n\nI hope you\u2019re having a relatively low symptom day.

I mean, it's relatable, I would probably lose track too, but asking that of an 80-something year old patient? Damn near impossible. In the medical community, it is well known that therapy adherence and the number of medications one has to take are practically [inversely correlated](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6919523/).\n\nWe've long diddled with depot medication and the likes, but this might be a game changer - taking your platelet aggregation inhibitors after a myocardial infarction is standard practice, but people ever so often forget about it, especially if there's more medications involved (and with heart attacks, there most definitely are). Plus you don't know if patients are telling the truth about their therapy adherence, who knows if they take their meds 100% of the time or just 60%.\n\nThe diabetes patients with the best HbA1c (long-term blood sugar lab value) I care for are either insanely disciplined or use closed-loop systems (blood sugar sensors that directly communicate with their insulin pumps, effectively emulating the pancreas). This approach has huge potential.",

She\u2019s never taken them as prescribed and has become more and more disabled as a result, particularly with her MS treatments over the years once she finally agreed to start taking them. Combine stubbornness with cognitive decline and you have the perfect recipe for noncompliance and worse outcomes for patients long-term, especially, as you said, the ones who really need those medications in the first place.\n\nUnfortunately, I also have MS and a few other chronic health conditions. I use alarms, reminders, calendars and pill organizers. I take 4 different oral medications, 6 pills a day and then the monthly injection. Technology can make it easier but only if the patient is committed to it.\n\nThank you for what you do. I\u2019m tremendously appreciative for all of the doctors who have helped me.
