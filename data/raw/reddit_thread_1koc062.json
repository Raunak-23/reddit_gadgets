Things like better optics, panel technology, resolution are incremental nice to haves that improve across all products over time.\n\nBut the industry was well formed before apple came to market. They knew what developers liked, what customers liked, and they were like \"naw, future of computing\" and came out with this totally dystopian product, like daddy is going to wear this at his 3yo's birthday to get the 3d recording so he can replay it on loop when he's in elder care.\n\nApple is like the narcissist of all companies, they are trying to re-invent the wheel just so they can be the revolutionaries and founders of the tech.

There will always be an enthusiast niche for stuff like this but for so long as wearables are perceived as equipment having to be anchored to their body, it will remain something in the domain of niche interest. Very few people want to strap a VR head set to their body to play video games despite how interesting the technology may be. Similarly, very few people want to strap a head set to their body to preform functions that their phone can do in a less impressive but more efficient manner.\n\nI remember back in the early 2000s tech reporters were talking a lot about how in the future, video calls would replace phone calls. Instead texts largely replaced phone conversations and I'd imagine the average person who doesn't regularly video call for work has one maybe once a year. In the end, people will adopt the technology that lets them preform the desired basic function with as little complexity as possible. Most wearables only add complexity and abstract the basic function behind layers of additional interface.\n\nThis kind of technology, in my opinion, won't breakthrough to mainstream until its refined down into a package that is indistinguishable from a pair of sun glasses and has an interface that is at least as simple and undisruptive as a phone screen. Until then, it might be cool to watch a movie on something like this, but most people are still going to prefer the firestick remote UI on their TV.",

I.e. the puck, the fact that usage was basically designed to minimize interaction (sit and pinch is boring, and I do not like eye tracking much), and the fact that after I clicked around for 3 minutes or so, I was pretty much done with nothing interesting.\n\nSeeing things like ipad/iphone games actually was kind of a negative. Like it's a really good feature, but it feels very underwhelming, like this is gaming on this thing?\n\nLike I won't lie. The writing on the wall was very obvious. The barrier to entry was super high, a lot of VR devs don't use mac in their development pipeline. They aren't going to spend $10k/seat on mac's and vision pro's to port their titles to a platform that is demanding \"hey, hand tracking only\".\n\nEdit: If apple gets the next one down to <=$1,500 we'll probably see more adoption. They are going to have to drop a lot of that expensive crap and bad decisions though. I.e. no puck, dumb external displays, use some fucking plastic (sorry, metal and glass is shit design choice for a headset) and incorporate motion controllers as an option. VR gaming is better with something in your hand.\n\nApple really forgets that core-thing they deliver is technology, and they waste time on cnc braided straps or milled titanium. Just give me a VR headset that looks like a OG imac. I'm probably using the thing when I'm home alone, why does it need to look that good, and you'll always look dumb with a VR headset on, making it titanium (or whatever they use, I don't care) doesn't make it less dorky.",

Just seems like people would be more apt to making a purchase of a lifetime if they could envision themselves in the space.

The weight is still terrible, the battery is still terrible, and the resolution is almost there. \n\nPeripheral vision is not there at all. The FOV is getting wider, but it is still looking down a tube; an ever shorter tube, but human vision is around 200 degrees, and most headsets are around 100 degrees. \n\nWhat is entirely missing is the killer app. \n\nFor example, I would argue what drove people to windows in the early 90s was better printers. People wanted WYSISYG where they could edit on their screens what was going to come out of the printer. Everything else was more that windows was there, so people used it.\n\nFacebook itself only was really viable when younger people had their own computers. You didn't want to be 15 and using facebook on a common computer. This required a bunch of little tech to all be in place. Wifi, laptops, OK internet, etc. There could not be a facebook in 1989. Snapchat required phones with dataplans. People weren't going to use snapchat type apps on a desktop, nor would they use it without a halfway decent data plan. \n\nThis is the medium is the message. \n\nThese VR/AR headsets are very much a new medium. They are not monitors.\n\nOutside of a few niche markets (like I am in) I do not know what the message is.\n\nIf these new meta glasses actually work (good battery, etc) and they can make them less goofy looking. Then, I can think of 20 solid messages for that medium.\n\nWhen the first iPhone, iPod, iPad, etc came out, people could immediately see themselves using them. When the iPhone came out, it was clear. It was a phone, and it was an iPod. Later, people discovered it was also an app running monster, and after that, a great way to access the internet. But, the instant use case was front and center.\n\nThe problem I have with VR is that, even when I show people what I do, and get a fantastically \"Wow that is so Cool!!!!\" reaction. None of them want to even try it for a second time.\n\n\nI develop for VR and AR. I do not know what the heck the common use case was for the Apple Vision.",

There were solutions to lessen the impact such as tunneling the user\u2019s vision, but ultimately it\u2019s a biological issue that stems from our brain perceiving motion when our body is not. Some ways developers got around this issue was by allowing users to point and click places to teleport to, and I personally found that to be the most elegant solution that felt organic. But of course this has its own limitations especially in action games. \n\nIt\u2019s been at least 5 years since I\u2019ve taken the course, so I have no idea if there\u2019s been any advancements in this area. I suspect that they have founds more ways to mitigate the issues as I see more VR games allowing users to walk around game maps.

I think unfortunately there are 2 things working against it; one, people are lame and insecure about \"looking stupid\" wearing something on their head, and two, people are lazy and don't want to get off the damn couch to be active with their entertainment. At this point I'm fine with it staying niche as long as it doesn't go away completely. Indie developers and modders keep a steady stream of awesome stuff happening for the platform.",

The keyboard isn't even design very well at all because if you typed too fast typewriters would get jammed up lol. These days a lot of communication has become much more visual/digital with memes, emojis, video clips, audio clips, group chats, etc and so I think there is still a pretty big field of new input related technology that could revolutionize how we interact with a digital system",

Apple knew this as well and had no expectation for this to be a big seller. I think where Apple might be disappointed is the lack of developer interest 1.5 years into the platform; this is going to make it harder to justify further investment, though I absolutely believe we will see lower cost variants being released especially as Google/Samsung enter the space.\n\nMeta is still the leader in the VR space with their $500 Quest 3; I expect them to continue to dominate with their lower cost approach. The Vision Pro has incredible immersion but VR is still mostly a gaming device and the Quest 3 is superior there.",

Apple originally was hoping to sell 700,000 to 800,000 units in the first year and usually reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo forecasted that Apple could sell a half-million of the devices.\n\nInstead, Apple only managed to sell 370,000 units in the first three quarters of the year and though the fourth-quarter figures are not yet in, projections had Apple selling a further 50,000 units to bring the year total to 420,000. ... \"",
