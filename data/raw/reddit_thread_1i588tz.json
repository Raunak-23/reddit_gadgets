          "body": "More broadly unless the point of the product itself is to do like 50+ things in one, I don't see how AI integration is useful for almost *any* products delivered to end users. \n\nI remember growing up in my country, dishwashing machines were not common. So when I was a kid and someone said \"dishwashing machine\", I thought of like a pair of robot arms and a camera attached to the backsplash which can do all the scrubbing etc. Then when I found out how real dishwashers work and how effective they are, it was kind of wonderful because the reality was much more simple than I imagined.\n\nSimilarly I remember someone writing about many modern higher end expensive robot vacuums with more sensors (camera, LIDAR etc) vs a cheap Chinese Roomba knockoff which has 3 modes (straight line/follow an edge/go in a little spiral) it varied randomly then when it ran low on battery it retraced its path to the charging base... Apparently the cheap Chinese knockoff got like 95% as effective coverage for like 1/10th the cost.\n\nI think in most practical cases there is just some simple solution available that effectively covers a majority of the bases and makes even the more complex non-AI solutions pointless. Let alone involving AI. I think AI will in the near term be more useful for finding or implementing those kinds of solutions rather than actually being part of them, until we get more general purpose robots.\n\nIt's also kind of fascinating that despite the fact that we already have dishwashers, gross people still let their dishes pile up in the sink. Maybe if someone with a robot from the future came back they could solve that problem by having the robot automatically load the dishwasher for them. But long before that robot will be invented, this problem is already basically solved: you can just rinse and place your dirty dishes directly in the dishwasher rack. That's the kind of problem I see with a lot of AI products, they are like building a sink-to-dishwasher-loading robot. I only want such a thing if loading the dishwasher is one of the 1000 things it can do because there's actually probably something else I'd rather have it do to cut that part out entirely anyway e.g. take my dishes from me at my table and go put them into the dishwasher directly. So that function can be made pointless in a bunch of different ways. Unless they can do that... Just make a better dishwasher and I will load it directly.",

Sensors could determine from a distance if the stray animal was a dog or cat, stop, call out to the animal, and dispense food/extend a water bowl. If it's running low on food, it could call out to humans to please refill it with food...\n\nI could make an app so people could see where it goes. People that are into it could revisit it to restock it with food. The app would allow people to check food/water levels. The bot could snap pictures of animals it encountered and maybe even scan their chip for help with lost animals.",
