The camera and internal specs were so so but again, you aren\u2019t buying a cheap phone like this because you care about camera quality and up to date chips. \n\nMrMobile did a video review on it at the time and summed it up well with \u201cif you want it, you already know you want it, and nothing I say is going to make any difference\u201d - there was just nothing else like it out there. \n\nI\u2019d probably be pledging for this one if they hadn\u2019t removed the headphone jack.
