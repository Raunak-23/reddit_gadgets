I suppose the USA is most common and prices there, are better but in Canada, everything is so expensive.   Anyway, I am budgeting for a $200-ish 2Tb drive so waiting for one to go on sale - however, I'm only looking at a handful of drives:\n\n* Samsung 990 Pro 2tb - $230\n* Crucial T500 - $215\n* Corsair MP600 LPX - $210\n* Kingston KC3000 / Fury Renegade - $200\n* WD SN850X\\* (I was including this in the mix - not sure if I should now) - $213\n* Seagate Firecuda 530R - $215\n\nI don't have the extra cash ATM or I'd probably pick the Kingston now....the Kingston drives seem to be on sale the most often with Corsair (2nd most).",

Believe it or not, but their HD's are in massive demand right now due to explosive data center growth surrounding AI. HD's are still the king when it comes to price per gig and data density per slot. Leaving SSD development to Sandisk just lowered their overhead, and they'll still end up making money off SSD's via their equity ownership as long as Sandisk stays relevant.
