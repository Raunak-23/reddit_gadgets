The first write goes fine there too. The problem comes if you have a drive failure and need to rebuild the array with a replacement drive. Your drives are constantly reading and writing data for days (depending on drive and array size) to do it. It puts a lot of stress on them and can cause other drives in the array to fail. It takes a lot longer for SMR drives to rebuild an array. So there is a higher chance of more drives failing and losing your whole array in the process. Not a chance most people want to take.",

I know RAID5 isn't ideal... that's why I have two of them, identical models, and one is powered off all the time except to update).\n\nI can literally buy a single WD Red Pro drive twice the size of that entire array now.  It's ridiculous.\n\nI was looking at expanding my NAS a little and for the price of the next-drive-up on each of them, I could buy two single drives that each have enough storage to hold the entire array's data.\n\nSo I'm kind of at a crossroads - buy new drives and even a new NAS, or try to keep expanding the current NAS.  I'm not sure it will ever grow enough to justify it (that 12TB isn't full and I can't really see me filling it to the brim before those drives die).\n\nI'm tempted to go for a chassis to build my own NAS but I'm worried that what will actually happen is I'll end up managing it far too much (I do enough IT during my day job, thanks).\n\nOr do I bite the bullet and go for an Asustor NAS with both SATA and NVMe RAID and - again - fight with low capacity drives but arrange them in RAID?  It's tempting, in order to re-use my current drives in a RAID with an NVMe to save having to manually do the data transfer if nothing else.\n\nBut the pace of drives is just ridiculously fast and I'm wondering whether it's time to bite the bullet on spinning disks (even Red Pro) and move to NVMe.  There are literally WD Red NVMe now.  But the 4TB is the biggest they do.\n\nWe're at the point now where large capacity drives are cheap enough to just buy and have entire copies/mirrors of your data on each drive than an equivalent RAID.",
