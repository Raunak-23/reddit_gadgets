We have a 3.2GPx sensor in a phone camera. If the field of view is 90\u00b0, we would require a lens aperture of 2.4cm (around an inch), based on a square sensor (approx 56568 x 56568 pixels) and wavelength of 560nm. That's... Doable?\n\nHowever, phones are thin. The distance from lens to sensor is going to be no more than about 5mm, which means a sensor size of around 1cm\u00b2 and a pixel width of 0.17 microns, which is tiny, and around a sixtieth of the size of current sensors.\n\nGood luck getting any decent light gathering capability with that at any decently short exposure.",
