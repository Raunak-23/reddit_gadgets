You put the car\u2019s make and model and they\u2019ll tell you which systems are compatible and what you would need to keep everything functional. They have fair prices, free super fast shipping, mounting kits and wiring harnesses are either free or super cheap with purchase of a head unit, they also sell more advanced installation equipment like backup cameras and add-on boxes that can retain steering wheel controls, and they have live chat with real employees who know the products they sell and can answer questions before you buy.\n\nThey also offer a lot of \u201cfloating\u201d head units, where the radio itself is a single-DIN chassis like a lot of \u201880s-2000s cars used, but they have the screen on a stalk that sticks out, which means that not only can you fit a touchscreen in a car that doesn\u2019t have enough room for a normal touchscreen but you can also fit larger touchscreens like you get in modern cars, they have a lot of 10\u201d models and recently I saw they even have a 12\u201d model. Which is definitely overkill but the bigger the screen the easier GPS is to read at a glance and the easier the buttons are to press so I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t tempted. You do need to measure the distance around your radio to make sure larger screens won\u2019t block air vents and climate controls, though, so bigger screens aren\u2019t always better.\n\nThat being said if you have a newer car where the head unit is heavily integrated into the car\u2019s computer system and is a non-standard size that requires special installation then their selection doesn\u2019t appear that great and the prices are going to be very high. For anything up to 2010 or so (maybe up to 2015 if it\u2019s a really basic car that didn\u2019t have a touch screen) they\u2019re great and you should definitely be able to find something that works and retains factory features like steering wheel controls for a fair price, but anything newer or more complex will probably require a vehicle-specific upgrade solution that would cost a lot more and you\u2019d have to search them out and do your own research.\n\nAlthough lately I\u2019ve been shopping for a new CarPlay head unit for another car and some of the new ones seem to offer much more integration with features like climate controls and infotainment systems. I don\u2019t have a car new enough to have those kinds of integrations so I haven\u2019t really looked into it, but we might finally be reaching the point where even cars with heavy touchscreen integration that prevented upgrades in the past can now use more standardized aftermarket head units.",

      "body": "From the article: Spotify\u2019s Car Thing officially has expired. Long live Spotify\u2019s Car Thing. Yesterday was the last day to enjoy the Car Thing as Spotify had intended, as a stand-in to grabbing playlists and podcasts for those of us with old cars without a head unit. But that\u2019s not stopping tinkerers from keeping the dream of Spotify\u2019s Car Thing alive.\n\nFolks in the official Car Thing subreddit and elsewhere on the internet have figured out how to get around the annoying launch screen that locks them out of a once-operational device they spent $80-$120 on not too long ago. Since the expiration date, some Car Thing devices have been rendered unusable, forcing users to a [splash screen](https://www.reddit.com/r/CarThing/comments/1haaywe/car_thing_is_officially_dead/) with a long goodbye. There are a few ways to get beyond the splash screen or avoid it altogether to keep the dying device on life support. It all depends on how much you\u2019re willing to work to resuscitate it.\n\n[Android Authority](https://www.androidauthority.com/spotify-car-thing-dead-community-workarounds-3507315/) found that some users could get through the discontinuation screen by canceling the update to their device. Remember the Car Thing I reviewed three years ago? I dug it out of the closet for this story and can still use the interface as if things were viable. Even the Spotify voice service offered aid a few times. Other folks have been able to jump the splash screen by holding the settings button, back button, and the first preset button while booting.",
