                                  "body": "Depending on your intentions, there are cases where protectionism via tariffs can work. If you have a domestic manufacturing or ressource sector, and you value having that more than overall lower prices, then it can make sense to introduce tariffs to make the domestic option the overall more attractive choice. \n\nBut that approach is targeted and deliberate. For example, you're mining iron and coal, and have a well developed steel industry. Along comes the international market and offers that steel at lower prices. Now, a long term consequence would probably be your steel industry shrinking and eventually going under if they can't compete with those prices, and your iron and coal mining might follow, because the domestic demand for those will drop off along with that. So you might introduce tariffs on foreign steel, just enough to keep your industry (domestically!) competitive and going. Now, you won't dominate the world market with that strategy, but you'll preserve jobs in those sectors, and you might want a steel industry around for strategic reasons. In that case, it can make sense. But you have to keep in mind that you're essentially taxing all your domestic steel users extra money to make that happen. \n\nThe danger is that other countries might reciprocate to fuck with your exports, which endangers other industries. So you're facing a choice: how important is domestic coal, iron and steel to you? Are you willing to let your, say, textile industry take a hit to keep them around? So - depending on what you want to achieve, targeted tariffs can make sense.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense is saying \"free markets are for losers, we'll hit everyone and everything\" when you have neither the ressource base nor the manufacturing base, and then hope that desperation will make those things appear in sufficient quantity to make up for the shortfall.",

The average Americans has more disposable income compared to the average European and that shows across pretty much every economic metric. If you take out London for example the rest of the UK is worse off than the poorest US state. California alone is almost comparable to Germany which is by far the wealthiest country in the EU.

I'd say the average American has more disposable income because the super rich Americans skew the balance, on the other hand there are way less people in the EU living in the abject poverty that a large group of people in the US face. The people in the EU with little disposable income are fine when it comes to facing temporary unemployment or medical issues while for the American with the same amount of disposable income it's a financial and sometimes practical death sentence.",

If you take the smallest member of the EU which is Malta their GDP is less than the smallest state in the US which is Wyoming. If you take the median European adult their net worth is $28k and the median American is $110k. So the American is much better off than the European and this is the median individual which means if you lined up every single person by net worth and chose the one in the middle. Second I would argue if you are living in abject poverty your life sucks no matter where you live so that's not really relevant and most people also don't live in abject poverty. Yes it's probably true that most EU member states have more generous welfare policies but that doesn't make up for the difference where everyone is much poorer in general. Also, the US poverty rate is 11% while the EU poverty rate is anywhere between 16-23% now these metrics are not exactly apples to apples since the metrics are not the same but saying our poor are better than your poor is not something to really gloat about. The fact of the matter is that since 2008 Europeans have either been stagnating or they have actually been getting poorer. None of these are good things.",

I will use Germany as an example as it is considered the wealthiest EU member nation. German poverty line is about 15k euros an average Californian makes about 60k a year.

But the flip side of every equation is that the Europe also exports a lot of cars to the US which will now not be sold because they are too expensive. This will inevitably also lead to job losses in Europe and European automakers will now have to make a decision on whether to move production to the US to placate Trump or accept the loss in sales and consequences of such. This economic war that he has unleashed on the world has no winners but the reason it is causing a global shockwave is because the US is still the world's preeminent economic superpower and can't be easily replaced.",

His initial resistance to skipping school embodies a learned fear of transgressing dominant class boundaries. However, his eventual participation and the Ferrari's destruction signify a rebellion against this internalized oppression and a step towards self-liberation.\n\nFerris, as a potential manifestation of Cameron's uninhibited id, embodies a secular humanist drive for self-determination and a rejection of societal constraints. His manipulation of authority figures and his ability to charm others into joining his escapade symbolize a desire to dismantle hierarchical structures. The parade sequence, where Ferris unites the crowd in joyous defiance, represents a fleeting empowerment against societal norms, a fantasy of liberation from everyday constraints.\n\nThe film subtly critiques institutions like the school system, personified by Principal Rooney, as mechanisms maintaining class divisions. Ferris's constant evasion highlights the vulnerabilities of these systems. The contrast in wealth between the Bueller and Frye households further underscores underlying class dynamics.\n\nFerris Bueller's Day Off is 100% a socialist parable.",

We were steered towards going to college, developing skills such as computers, and very much geared towards white collar industries. And while I understand that not everyone is fortunate to have a white collar job right now, among those of us who do, I can't imagine many of us would have interest in giving that up to work in an industrial plant.\n\nI grew up with my grandfather who worked in the steel industry his entire life. I witnessed the physical toll his career took on him, as well as all the lost time, because his work schedule had him on alternating 10 and 12 hour shifts, with a 14 hour shift every 2 weeks.

But no never should you do blanket tariffs. The only time it would be smart is for stuff that we already are producing and competition against it is fierce for American consumers/consumers of American goods.\n\nExample: say we make cars here for 20k and cars from country X makes cars for 16k and sells it here for 18k. We decide we can\u2019t get our costs down so the best method then would be to impose tariffs on country X\u2019s cars to put them more in line with American cars like a 15-20% one. This way you don\u2019t destroy the competition completely but you lessen the likeliness that cost is the factor that keeps customers loyal to that brand over an American one. Competition is good for the consumer that\u2019s why monopolies are supposed to be illegal.",

In addition to that, many U.S. made products aren't the same abroad, because there are restrictions on U.S. products being made from certain ingredients.\n\nTake Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, for example. In the U.S., it's made with Yellow 5. In the EU, that's illegal to use, so it doesn't contain it. So not only does Kraft need to have a separate product to sell to the EU that meets their regulatory standards, which is more expensive, they're also tariffed, so a pack of 5 that runs about $5 here in the U.S., is about \u20ac16 in the EU (that's almost $18 USD). Why would anyone bother paying more than 3x the price when they can buy a European alternative (Knorr K\u00e4se-Sahne/Kr\u00e4uter being the more common options at just under \u20ac2 a pack)?",

Also, as part of that coalition, it's not that easy? Canada is the only country that will recognize a US law degree without getting additional educational credentials. That's going to create a huge barrier to emigration for attorneys, because even the ones willing to go back to school for a supplemental degree (just to qualify to even sit for the licensure exams) would have to contend with losing income during that period, visa arrangements for any spouse/kids, etc.\n\nDoctors also have similar hurdles with licensure abroad. Dentists, accountants, etc. - every regulated career, which includes all of the ones requiring professional degrees, is going to have a lot of very expensive, time consuming obstacles precluding people from emigrating.\n\nI would also be surprised if a lot of a countries don't cut back on visas and residency authorizations for American applicants. At some point they will do this as a retaliatory measure if the policies in the US don't change.\n\nYou're also perpetuating the conservative lie that all democrats are college-educated wealthy professionals, while republicans are all dumb blue collar workers. We have the data to know that's not true. Yes, you're more likely to be liberal if you have attained higher education, but there are PLENTY of democrats that don't have higher education achievements. The country has over 300,000,000 people and less than a decade ago only about 7% had doctoral-level degrees. Fewer than 40% of Americans have a degree beyond a high school diploma (and this /includes/ post-grad degrees). Not all of those 40% are democrats, either.\n\nYour take is both defeatist and very skewed in a concerning way - anyone reading it that doesn't know relevant statistics might take it at face value and believe it, perpetuating the idea that there's nothing to be done. Very much what a lot of the bots are doing on social media right now to perpetuate disinformation and convince people it's not worth pushing back against what's happening.\n\nPlainly speaking, the data and demographics of the country just doesn't support your conclusion. Sure, SOME Americans will relocate - certainly it's more likely to be a large amount that if the election had gone the other way - but it'll be far from the volume you seem to believe it will be.\n\nAlso worth noting that the constitutional right to travel is limited to travel among the 50 states. There's no constitutional right to travel abroad. If too many professionals that comprise the wealthier portion of the \"middle class\" tried to emigrate, I can guarantee there would be some lame EO banning international travel or implementing some ridiculous restriction on it because that will be the only segment of the middle class that can continue spending when the lower-income population has been outpriced by the market.",

It takes 5+ years to get producing.  And that's assuming you've got an available *trained* labour base.   Typically speaking workers are a net *disadvantage* to the company for upwards of a year while they build their skillsets, because mistakes and failures are *extremely* expensive in terms of broken equipment and failed manufacturing runs.  \n\nThose workers don't exist.  The machines they'll operate likely don't exist and will themselves have to be manufactured themselves to order.  \n\nWhile long term futures I won't guess at, for Trump's term there will be no appreciable increase in manufacturing.  It *can't* happen that fast, even putting side the myriad of reasons why it won't.  Not least of which: why invest that money in making an uncompetitive manufacturing company that will go bankrupt the moment a new administration axes tariffs.  Even though that last isn't technically guaranteed, the uncertainty makes that scale of investment frankly stupid.",

      "body": "From the article: If you were wondering how President Trump\u2019s tariffs may impact gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches, there\u2019s some bad, and perhaps slightly less-bad news. Unless something changes, Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers. But it will likely take some time before that actually happens.\n\nModern gadgets generally aren\u2019t made or assembled solely in the U.S. anymore. Device makers big and small source components from all over the world, and often have them assembled overseas before importing the final product into the country. Given that Trump has levied tariffs on every single country, it means that the cost to make all our devices will inevitably go up.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing right now is going to be the inflationary impact,\u201d says Jason Miller, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University. \u201cIf they stay in place for several months, we\u2019ll start to see those effects by mid-summer and certainly back-to-school season.\u201d\n\nMiller notes goods shipped from China to the U.S. will face a whopping 54 percent tariffs, including most gadgets. Vietnam, where Apple has shifted some of its manufacturing, also has a high tariff rate at 46 percent.\n\n\u201cIf [companies] absorb the extra cost and don\u2019t pass it on, their profits are going to plunge and their capital investment will drop,\u201d says Miller. \u201cOr, they\u2019ll pass a good share of it onto the downstream buyer, which in many instances is the consumer.\u201d\n\nBarring any new exemptions or changes, you can expect every single device category to be negatively impacted, says Ryan Reith, group vice president of worldwide device trackers at IDC. But devices will be impacted differently. Smartphones, says Reith, have more wiggle room than TVs or PCs as they have a \u201cwell-established monthly hardware payment dependence.\u201d\n\nMiller agrees, noting that it\u2019s not likely that a smartphone will suddenly be 50 percent more expensive. A more reasonable expectation would be a roughly 20 percent bump.",

A more reasonable expectation would be a roughly 20 percent bump.\n\nThis will only be true for very low margin products. I am surprised how few people understand how tariffs actually play out. Yes, it's a form of a tax, but not a direct tax. A 50% tariff could meant anything from 1% to 50% consumer tax.\n\nAnd this is not in defense of current administration actions whatsoever. People should be informed though. \n\nI am already hearing back from construction product vendors that I deal with who have various levels of manufacturing in Canada and Mexico. The 20% tariff so far is playing out to be about a 2 to 5% price increase, depending on various factors. \n\nHere is my best eli5\n\nTV show \"Shark tank\". A wannabe entrepreneur is looking for investment in his miracle product called \"Butt plunger 2000\". \n\n\"How much does each unit sell for and how much does it cost to make?\"\n\n\"It retails for $19.99, and the landed cost is $2. It used to cost $5 before we moved the production overseas\".\n\nThe 50% tariff will be applied to that $2. So now landed costs are $3. Retail price will now go up to $20.99, a 5% increase. \n\nIf the landed costs were $10, then retail price would have to go up to $24.99, a 25% increase. But this would be a terrible cost-to-retail ratio, at least for advanced electronics makers. \n\nFor companies like Apple, the raw cost of the device is going to be extremely small. Like 8 to 10x CRR ratio. You can expect a sub 5% increase, even if that. Global multinationals will know how the play this game, and device manufactured in China is now being imported from a 20% tariff place. Retail hike is now under 2%. \n\nIt is the low margin items like FOOD that you should be really worried about. Things like imported seasonal produce will skyrocket in price. \n\nThe only type of enterprise that will receive full tariff to tax will be direct to consumer foreign companies like Temu. Your order will be taxed at exactly the 56% tariff.",

              "body": "This is laughably disconnected from reality of how pricing really works.\n\nA tech product like a laptop or cellphone is lucky to get a 35-40% margin on landed cost. So your 20$ product would have a landed cost of 12$ and an adder of ~6$, so a 30% increase.\n\nBut you are also wrong on how companies price items.  Established tech company valuations are largely influenced by margin, not just absolute revenue.  So the starting point is to take the tariff and increase the price change to maintain the product margin.  So the 6$ tariff would start with a price increase of about 10$ so that the margin stays the same.   Now we are at a 50% increase.  \n\nNow the company has a harder time selling a high end phone that went from $1000 to $1500 dollars compared to a budget phone that went from $500 to 750$.  So they have to cut the price to compete to say to $1200.  \n\nNow they have to make up that $300 per phone somewhere else to keep their operating margin in control, so they have to cut expenses elsewhere in the company.  Manufacturing costs are already squeezed mercilessly, so there is little blood from that stone.  So they end up laying off mostly customer service, janitorial, warehouse employees, HR,  retail, accounting, and other functions that don't directly generate new products.  Unemployment goes up in these lower earning sectors, so the wages stagnate.\n\nIn the end the cost of the device goes up, and the buying power of the middle class and lower earners goes down.  So the device that used to require 25 hours of middle class labor now requires 35-40 hours of labor.  Since people can't manufacture more hours, their standard of living has to go down either through less buying or 2nd job to make up for the real cost of the tariff.\n\nMeanwhile back in China they still sell each phone for the same price and make the same margin and the buyers pay the tariff.",

He did that almost certainly for no better reason than it was Biden who signed it.\n\nBut OK, we're pretending. So if American industry started **right this moment** to rebuild US manufacturing, it would take *at least* 2-3 years and an initial outlay of tens--maybe hundreds--of billions to get to the point where goods START to come off the line. You need to buy land, build or renovate factories, buy or design equipment, hire workers all across the spectrum from unskilled to expert, plus management. That takes time. Gee, it sure is a good thing that all these companies who will have to do that are in real good shape, with their stocks all robust and....oh. Wait...\n\nHis [feigned opposition to foreign goods](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/thousands-of-trump-bibles-were-printed-in-china-as-he-campaigned-against-trade-practices)\n is nothing more than a dog whistle to his white nationalist base.",

All of this is intentional to harm the economy in order for the wealthy class to benefit. You think them paying $1500 instead of $1000 for an iPhone is going to hurt their bottom line? This is literal pennies to that class. Shit, I would imagine a lot of them don't even pay for phones and they're just given to them in swag bag sort of ways. And even for any gadget, the price of these things isn't even taken into consideration. Build the best, most ridiculous gaming PC and you could approach $10K if you tried. That is still literal pennies to this class, but you need to budget a significant portion of your annual salary for something like that.\n\nThey're making these decisions with a complete disconnect from middle class society since they can't fathom having to worry about an actual paycheck. Their aspirations are much larger than a weekly income. They make daily decisions for their wealth on a financial scale that is larger than your annual salary by multiple orders of magnitude.\n\nSo these decisions are done with specific intent to increase their own wealth. If it's at the expense of the middle class...well they barely know you exist outside of being a leach depending on public programs they're hacking and slashing so they can squeeze more out of the economy for themselves. They are hardly clueless unless you're referring to the fact you even exist in the first place. And he's most definitely not senile. Sure, just like everyone else he'll have senior moments, but his actions have been done with decisiveness and purpose -- to benefit him and others like him.",

If it was, Trump wouldn't have agreed to these trade deals his first term.\n\nThe US has the biggest economy in the world. Trump telling people that the nation is broke and struggling and we need to start a global trade war to fix everything is a con. The only ones it benefits are already at the top. Everyone else gets screwed.\n\n>Do you really not want better trade agreements just to stick to the orange man, because thats what it seems like, like folks would rather Trump fail at all cost than to actually get a better deal on things.\n\nCould be people think he has bad ideas because a lot of his ideas have had terrible outcomes.
