              "body": "It also isn't really competing with either of the current R cameras - this weighs 498g, the a7cr weighs 515g, and the a7r v weighs 723g, and for the latter two, you still need to add on a lens. Even compared to the smaller and lights a7cr, that is going to weigh likely 300 grams more and be much larger by the time you add an equivalent lens. \n\nThis is a lifestyle camera, I don't imagine any professionals would pick this over an interchangeable lens alternative, so value is less important than desirability. This is competing in a much smaller market, with consumers willing to spend a lot of money on luxury products to get the best - only really the similarly priced gfx100rf, and the leica q3 which costs almost $7k compete directly, and this looks to be pretty competitive with both on paper. There is also a lot of brand loyalty in the segment, so Sony probably knows they can charge whatever without losing customers - ironically even without considering a \"lens ecosystem\".\n\nThere are definitely major compromises to get it to the size and weight, no ibis and fixed screen are a miss, and a ~2mp evf is criminal in 2025, but given the cult status the prior gen had, I think this will have fans among the very small market segment it's targeting.",
