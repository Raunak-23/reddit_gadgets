I'm disabled and use Google Home. It really is a great accessibility tool. My apartment doesn't have a main central light except in the kitchen and bathroom. I have to use lamps in the living room and bedroom if I want light in those rooms. I have smart bulbs. There are times Google doesn't even do the commands I've programmed and used for years. I constantly have to repeat myself. \n\nI also had to change the names of every Chromecast/Google TV/light if the names include the room they're in. I have a lamp in the kitchen with a smart bulb and named it Kitchen Lamp. I used to be able to turn it on just fine. Now, Google tries to turn on everything in the kitchen instead of just the light. It's frustrating. I shouldn't have to do workarounds to get the devices working that have been working fine for years.",

You just have to know how to set up your prompt.  And I would agree that there is a minor amount of trial-and-error to work out some kinks, but those were absolutely trivial to deal with.\n\nYes, if you just use a general LLM and expect \"The kitchen is too bright\" to just work out of the can, you are going to be disappointed.  Load up the prompt with enough information that limits what the LLM will consider, and it is very accurate to the point of not really mattering anymore.\n\nAbout the only weird thing I can really report is that the LLM insists on sometimes leaving out the final } in the json it produces.  But that is easy enough to deal with once you figure it out.  \n\nNow getting IR to work with home automation: \\*that\\* is a real pain to develop yourself, at least time wise.  Getting the LLM to work was trivial by comparison.",

These encode not only semantic, but relational and logical associations. They *do* in fact encode increasingly complex and often very accurate representations of the world based on the data they are trained on.  \nThus the basis of your argument is invalid.",

I also started a phd program working 80+ hours a week so didn't have the time to mess with it if something broke as I knew it would just drive my girlfriend mad. I will do it again once I have my own place. it does look like they offer more friendly plug-in play alternatives now but when I was in the rabbit hole (5 years ago) it was very much shit breaks, go to the forums and troubleshoot with other people. Looks like they've ironed out a lot of the kinks and offer stand-alone boards/cloud services if you want but can still run everything independent/local if you have the know how (there are plenty of guides - I learned 3d modeling, json, jnode, networking pretty easily but I would say I have a higher learning capacity than most people so might not be as friendly as I'm making it out to be)",

Thread already uses the same 2.4GHz chips that Zigbee uses (also 2.4GHz). So, IKEA is implementing Matter as a issue of survival for their software and hardware, but since Matter / Thread use the same antennae as Zigbee they are good to go, they just have to work through the atrocious Matter implementation.    \n    \nZigbee is a protocol and a specific communications chip (2.4GHz). Thread is a communications protocol that exists primarily to use the 2.4GHz range chips, but can also be used for other wavelengths (I'm unaware of any Thread devices that use other wavelengths yet tho). Matter with Thread is meant to be (more or less) chip and software agnostic. Matter is the comm/protocol layer that, at least in theory, can communicate to all the various technologies; Zwave (915MHz in US), Zigbee (2.4GHz), Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.    \nUsing the Thread technology.     \n     \nTry explaining all this to someone and then trying to explain why a home controller/HUB is always better than trusting some corporation to provide secure access to all 50+ SH devices all day through your router.    \nHoly shit, that's like cutting yourself all over and jumping into the Hudson.   \n  \nFurthermore, most people greatly underestimate the number of light switches and SH items they would have in their home.",

But that doesn't make me in any way dependent on that corporation. That corporation can not make any decision that makes my light switch change its behavior or that makes it stop functioning. The corporation can go under, and I can still use the light switch for decades without any change in functionality. For that matter, I have no idea what the corporation that made the light switches in my house is up to, or if they even still exist. That's how non-attached my house is to that corporation.\n\nAnd if a light switch ever were to fail, it still doesn't matter. There are plenty of corporations that produce light switches, and I could just buy one from any one of them to replace the broken one. I wouldn't have to replace all light switches, I wouldn't have to replace cables, I wouldn't have to replace lamps, ... just a new switch from whatever corporation. That's how non-attached my house is to that corporation.\n\nAnd basically the same thing is true for local-only smart home stuff with open protocols and projects like home assistant. If the organisation behind HA were to go under, you could still at the very least keep using your existing setup. And if the hardware of your HA installation failed for some reason, you could buy just about any small computer as replacement, from just about any manufacturer, and restore a backup on there and still keep using it.\n\nAnd also, with HA being Free Software, you can even still extend and improve the software if the organization were to go under or decided to abandon the project. And if there were sufficiently many interested parties, they also could just found a new organization to take over development. Which is to say: The organization behind HA does not have the power to unilaterally decide to end the project, at most they can stop contributing.\n\nWhich is to say: You are not dependent on that corporation in a way even remotely comparable to how, if Google decides to change their product in a way that makes it dysfunctional for you but improves their profits, you can only live with it or throw it all out, which in turn makes them do these things in the first place, because they know you have no other options.",

Or, it will only hear PART of what Ive said, and do one of two things. Either give me a run down on some part of the conversation it's heard (No, I don't want a history lesson on the invention of 'Air conditioning'), *or* it will do the complete OPPOSITE of what I want (case-in-point, the other day I asked it to turn off the heatpump in my son's bedroom...instead it turned ON all of the heatpump units in the home - which is a similar situations with the lights).\n\nIt's like one isn't talking to the other, yet they're both Google devices.
