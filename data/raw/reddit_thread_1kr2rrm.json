It was such a huge problem for the industry that they were suing rental places to try to get them out of the market. Our legal right to backup our games and emulate also comes from this era of corporate assholery.\n\nFurthermore, the consoles themselves oftentimes dropped in price significantly a year or two after launch, which is when mass adoption happened. It wasn't like today where a lot of the userbase gets it on day one.\n\nNowadays, I'm not aware of any rental market for games and the resell market is being swallowed up by the greedy switch to digital-only--a model where you don't own the games you buy. Nintendo games also NEVER drop in price now, which was not the case in the 90s.\n\nIt's greed and price gouging. That's it. For me, the only reason to buy a Nintendo console now is the fact that they're always easily hackable, which enables me to get the overpriced games (many of which are ports of Wii U games that they want to sell again for $60) that only last for like 20 hours for free. My Switch sat unopened in its box for like 9 months before the first custom firmware came out. They will never get me to pay for their shitty overpriced internet package when I'm *already paying for internet*, so not being able to go online doesn't phase me. Fuck em.",

Yet, we're getting 5 year old tech for $450+, and games that run on that tech that will be older than Switch 1's tech on release, for up to $80+, while also allowing publishers to abuse the Key Card system which negates the Switch's plug and play aspect it has over all other platforms, and alianiates users who might be in rural areas, or just in areas that still to this day don't have good internet access. While also including the new, hardly used, and EXPENSIVE SD Express Card that even the company themselves that created it, think it's unnecessary for today's use for the time being.\n\nThen you have the Nintendo president who even admits the hardware is pricey, and you have investors asking many questions about pricing, and other concerns. Nintendo has basically defied their history of being affordable, and innovative with this generation.\n\nYou're right either way with your final statement. They really don't need to concern themselves with bleeding edge tech.\n\nEdit: I should have clarified in the final statement of mine about you being right either way. I should have said, you're not wrong about anything either, just in case it wasn't clear enough. I can be blunt sometimes to the detriment of myself lol.",

TSMC could upgrade existing 7nm production to 6nm, and 6nm was design-compatible, so AMD barely had to do any work on their end to make things work.\n\nSamsung 8nm is a very different situation, since it doesn't have any real upgrade path. Samsung switched to EUV with 7nm, so the tooling doesn't have any upgrade path on their end, and newer nodes are not design-compatible, so it would require significant work from Nvidia to port it to a newer node. Making matters worse, the Nintendo+Nvidia partnership is Samsung's only major customer on 8nm, which means that Samsung is highly incentivized to offer extremely competitive pricing to keep them as a customer.\n\nThe only reason I wouldn't straight-up rule it out is that it happened with the Switch 1 with the jump from 20nm to 14nm, which had many of the same technical challenges, but even then, there were some pretty unique circumstances there, with TSMC really wanting to get out of the 20nm node due to severe issues with the node, and likely cutting aggressive deals to customers to offer fab space on better nodes to get rid of any obligation to keep it going for many more years.",

Add to that how modern shareholders are driving every company into the ground (in terms of product quality, not profits of course) in the most short sighted way possible.. it's a problem, gaming is just affected more than others because for everyone who actually cares there's like 50 squeakers that buy every shit they get advertised into buying.",
