There\u2019s a lot of fantastic content out there now, and I\u2019m so glad I made it a priority for mu free time again. Once I cut out other time wasters (scrolling for 10 minutes here and there really adds up) it\u2019s amazing how fast you can put together an hour a day for gaming. \n\nMore to your point, though, I\u2019m also an advocate for console over PC gaming for the simple reason that \u201cit just works\u201d. Sure you\u2019re not getting \u201cabsolute maximum cutting edge resolution and FPS\u201d, but it\u2019s a minor sacrifice. Console is less expensive by far, games are intentionally optimized for that standard equipment, and I don\u2019t have to spend hours and hours fine tuning everything, downloading driver updates, etc. \n\nI\u2019m really looking forward to ps6.

Performance gains at this point are mostly minuscule. The PS5 Pro isn\u2019t really even that convincing IMO, unless you have an outrageously good TV.\n\nOtherwise, I can\u2019t imagine much better than what the PS5 offers at this point either in terms of a home console aside from a smaller form factor.",

The Dual Sense and it's haptics are huge, but it's turned off by half the people who use it, and some games don't even take advantage of it. \n\nNew lighting, higher resolution, better frame rates. All noticeable improvements, but a PS5 into PS6 will just be improvements on existing at this point. The tech is limited at this point to just improve those things. Better facial/motion capture, more realistic foliage, etc., isn't something a console can bring forward. So until AR improves to the point of being a solid gaming experience, I don't see any \"new\" gaming method in the next decade or so.

Bend and Bluepoint were the only studios that were formerly not GaaS studios working on them. \n\nEven with that said Bluepoint was the remake studio not an original IP studio and has spent time as a support studio during all this. Bend was the only \"true original IP\" studio put into GaaS exclusively.\n \nThe reality is, the PS5 is going to have essentially the same output as the PS4 by the end of its life cycle when it comes to SP games. PS4 had an insane last 3-4 years where every 6 months there was a new 9+/10 but before that it was in a worse spot than the PS5 with them relying on basically 1 game a year. \n\nI think the fact that their first few big titles this generation were cross gen, sequels or 3rd party exclusives messes with the perception people have. 4 of their biggest exclusives last gen have already had their sequels come out (Horizon, GoW, Spiderman, FF Remake) and a 5th is this year with Ghosts.\n\nThere is a larger gap as it was more front loaded and then COVID happened setting everything back a year or two. But PS5 will probably have a similar library to the PS4 when all is said and done. Which is a pretty good \"floor\" for a generation to have tbh.\n\nNow if the argument someone wants to make is that they should have instead invested the GaaS money  into even more single player games that we've come to expect from them then I agree completely. But all I'm saying is they didn't just abandon what they were doing and were known for to chase GaaS. It was a bad additional investment strategy to try something new when they could have doubled down on what they know works.",

Microsoft\u2019s \u201cThis is an Xbox\u201d branding is a clear sign of that. The Xbox Ally X feels like a preview of where they\u2019re going, and I\u2019d be genuinely surprised if the next Xbox doesn\u2019t ship with the exact same OS that runs on that handheld. Some will say, \u201cBut then it\u2019s not a console, it\u2019s just a PC,\u201d to which I say: *yes, that\u2019s the point.*\n\nIf I had to place my bets, we\u2019re heading toward a future where Valve and Microsoft are the main contenders, Xbox vs. Steam, Windows vs. Linux. Nintendo will keep doing its own thing, making toys that just so happen to play video games. Apple will continue dominating the mobile space. And Sony? They\u2019ll be the dinosaur, too slow to adapt to a shifting market ecosystem.\n\n*Maybe that\u2019s a hot take, but I\u2019d be genuinely suprised if that\u2019s not what it looks like in a decade from now.*",

This is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but a notable observation to make nonetheless. \n\nThe only PS5 exclusives I can think of that are unique and contribute best to making the PS5 distinct is Ratchet and Clank, then Astro Bot. Silent Hill 2 is kind of a hit or miss. Honorary mention to Returnal.\n\nThe following is a list of absolute critical blockbusters, but I feel are still strongly rooted in the PS4 idiom.\n\nGOW:Ragnarok is not really groundbreaking imo, it's more of what we've seen in GOW4 (PS4) without changing too much of the formula or having a massive upgrade in style. In this sense, GOW4 is ahead of its time. \n\nTLOU2 is cross platform.\n\nSpider Man 2 is a continuation of what we saw in Spider Man 1 and Miles Morales. \n\nAs much as I love Gran Turismo 7 and its investment from Sony as a flagship Playstation title with great heritage, the jump from GT Sport to 7 isn't really that amazing. I would liken it to the jump from Gran Turismo 3 to Gran Turismo 4, both belonging to the PS2. \n\nHonorary mention to Death Stranding. \n\nI feel this list more so highlights the craftsmanship and artistry in design when it comes to the release of these games. Not only did the developers create their games with a mature understanding of the PS4 platform, but they also did so with confidence (and SDK in hand, in likelihood) that the PS5 was going to have similar hardware, and therefore, could be ported to look even better. In some sense, it's like looking at the visual jump between Perfect Dark on the N64 to GTA3, or the early MoH/CoD games on PS2. \n\nHere's looking to Death Stranding 2 and Ghost of Yotei. Expecting more of the aforementioned jumps of Perfect Dark to GTA 3, and not necessarily the jump from FF8 to FF10.",

I expect 16GB of GDDR7 memory coupled with DDR7 main system memory.\n\nThey're going to push for FSR4 or FSR5 hard though so they can talk about how all the games run at 4K 60FPS. Depends on where AMD is on that tech.\n\nI don't expect great things with the next gen consoles. What we really need are more efficient ray-tracing/path-tracing algorithms and a much more optimized Unreal Engine since everyone wants to use it and it's clunky.\n\nAnd I don't expect the console to be less than $750 with $80 games like Nintendo is doing. The whole market is going to price itself into irrelevance.",

I have a lot of fun gaming on what could be considered somewhat lower end hardware. My CPU is newer, but only because I recently upgraded from something that was 10 years old. I don't really have much desire to spend a ton of money to upgrade to get 4k or framerates above 100 FPS because to me it just doesn't seem like it would actually make games more enjoyable. \n\nEventually I'll have to upgrade to a better graphics card, but the upgrade path is much slower than it used to be. Gone are the days where we used to upgrade our machines every year or two to get better graphics because things were getting so much better at a very fast rate. Now it just seems like the differences just don't matter as much.",

Killzone Shadowfall, Infamous Second Son, The Order, Bloodborne and Uncharted 4 were what we had the first several years of PS4. Bloodborne is a masterpiece for a niche audience and uncharted 4 was really good but the rest of that list doesn't hold a candle to what we've had on PS5 so far.",

Kratos' facial polygons went from 1200 on PS2 to 32,000 on PS4. Meanwhile, Crash Bandicoot's entire character model on PS1 was 512 polygons. The PS5's hardware can support 11 billion polygons on screen a second, which is amazing, but shows the kind of visual detail that's expected.\n\nPlus character textures in PS3 games were usually only 256x256 or 512x512. Environment textures in older games could be as small as 128x128. With 4K being the standard so many textures have to be a much higher resolution as well, usually making each from scratch. That means when corporate goes \"Hey we need this in the game right now\" or \"You need to make this work in this other game engine that isn't compatible with anything you've made so far,\" that's a ton of new elements to make or do over.\n\nI feel like this is a major part of why the Switch was able to get so many games on it and had quick sequels for certain IPs. Only needing 1080P and leaning heavily on stylization instead of realism means everything can be made much quicker and cheaper. It's also why the Yakuza games still come out pretty much once a year, they reuse sooooo many elements and animations from game to game. Many games have the exact same map, and alot of animations have been carried over from the first game on PS2. Meanwhile you have people who were mad Marvel's Spider-Man 2 had the same New York map as the first game and figured Insomniac would completely redo it.",

I don't care how good the infrastructure is... the idea that you can be playing a game, get a random lag spike at an inopportune time and die or something because of it, is unacceptable to me.  Input lag because your inputs and shit have to travel to a server and then the outcome has to travel back to your machine, is unacceptable to me.  Regular input lag from modern televisions bothers me enough as it is... I can't imagine the lag from playing something on the cloud on top of that.  I'm fine with it being a section of the industry, but the idea of consoles going bye bye because of cloud... nah.  Would sooner quit gaming than partake in that.",

The company said the future of the platform is \"top of mind,\" and it is exploring a \"new and enhanced way for players\" to engage with games.\n\nThe news comes from Sony Interactive Entertainment's new president and CEO, Hideaki Nishino, who took part in an investor-focused interview published on Sony's corporate website.\n\nNishino was asked a question that has been appearing with increasing regularity these days: as cloud gaming becomes increasingly advanced and more of the world gains access to faster internet connections, is future console hardware being made obsolete by cloud gaming?\n\nNishino said that despite cloud gaming's increasing popularity, and the fact Sony has supported it since the PlayStation 3, its physical consoles aren't going away as most people want \"local execution\" (local hardware) that doesn't depend on internet speed and stability. The CEO added that the PS5 and PS5 Pro have proved this is the case.\n\nWith confirmation that PlayStations aren't being replaced by cloud services, Nishino moved on to the subject of the PlayStation 6 and whether the next-gen machine was currently in development.",

At least to me. Maybe I'm just aging out of gaming. The console hasn't even been pushed to its limit yet.  In my opinion this product run needs to go on at least another 5 years. GTA 6, Elder Scrolls 6, Ghost of Yotei, Horizon 3, Resident Evil 9 all need to come out before they even start talking PS6.",

Sony also need to put some work in for the actual fans and not have them sitting on the fence while all the dirty scabs buy all the stock. Both sides in that matter are respectively scum!",
