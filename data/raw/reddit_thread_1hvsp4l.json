It has a higher resolution, better cameras, a faster CPU, and more. And it was half the price. Compared to the Pro the Quest 3 is missing the face and eye tracking, mini LED backlight, self-tracking on controllers, and a few other things, but they\u2019re mostly minor things. The positioning of the Pro vs. the Quest 3 never really made much sense to me. Even when it first launched (before the Quest 3 was available) the Pro was a bit weird\u2014they positioned it as an AR powerhouse and then equipped it with the world\u2019s worst cameras.",

The sandbox got old after a while and even though I'm pretty fit, the parkour shit was exhausting and frustrating! Maybe I didn't get far enough, but I really didn't get into it. Vail has some promise as a competitive first person shooter, but by far the greatest VR coop experience was Firewall: Zero Hour on the original PSVR... Wow what a game! And Moss, Super Hot, Astro Bot, and Statik Institute of Retention (fucking brilliant!!) deserve honorable mentions as well. Those are old games and not much on the PC really comes close... It's depressing. \n\nOh I just remembered! Resident Evil 4 is another one worth playing especially if you're nostalgic for the original which is 100% but in pretty thrilling VR. Oh and definitely check out Compound!! Man that game is fun as hell. Stylized, 8-bit-ish 90's vibe first person roguelite shooter. I still play it when I'm feeling the itch.",

Especially if you\u2019re using apps like Youtube which lets you view the screen like a cinema and stuff. The 360\u00b0 videos are also fire. Motion tracking/controls are fine, a bit like the Wii but actually more functional. \n\nThere are some negatives however:\n\nBattery life sucks; this isn\u2019t the fault of the system though because of how it works. But you will notice that it will eat away after 30-mins to an hour.\n\nMeta-Horizon can be a cesspool of shitty worlds full of screaming children and trolls.\n\nMotion sickness happens especially when you\u2019re standing.\n\nThe app store feels somewhat empty with A lot of garbage shovelware you\u2019d expect from your IOS app.\n\nOh and obviously you can\u2019t use it outside, not only is it dangerous since apps will obscure your vision, but the sun can also cause screen damage. There are work arounds, but there is not real reason to in the first place.\n\nI do have to give Meta credit however for the innovation of actually making something functional regardless of their questionable reputation.",
