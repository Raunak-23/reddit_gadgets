Mines here in Europe has started doing fully automated trucks, because it's safer and it's impossible to find truck drivers. The shortage is insane and expected to rise, in few years shortage of truckers is estimated to be more than truckers currently working. Automation is needed to not stop everything due to none wanting to drive a truck.\n\n>Full automation only works if we live in a world where work is optional and people are given money and resources to live.

There still needs to be about 5 people involved for every leg of a trip for each truck if you take the driver out of the equation.  And those 5 people are going to have to come from the manpower of companies who aren\u2019t directly liable for and won\u2019t easily accept liability for trucks and freight that aren\u2019t theirs.\n\nWhen Waymo (Google) pulled the plug on their autonomous trucking aspirations, I think that was the canary in the coal mine for \u201cthis isn\u2019t cost effective\u201d.

Ideally they would as automation is used to secure more businesses with the lower prices netting more clients.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nLook at spending compared to salary. Everything is going down constantly (some small hiccups and regional differences do exist of course).\u00a0\n\n\nPeople have more disposable income than ever before. Housing and food is taking up less and less of people costs and it's just going down.\u00a0\n\n\nEverything we need is just getting cheaper and more available, like damn most people today don't even know how to farm or hunt. Everyone knew how to do it just 50-100 years ago. We have gone from \"I hope the potato harvest is good this year so we don't starve\" to \"my delivery driver is five minutes late, where is my damn food?!\" in just one to two generations.",

So you end up with two data sources, and they have to be balanced in some way.  For example, if you use insurance data, then accidents will be underreported.  And even if you have one data source, there could be unavoidable biases in the data.\n\nAlso, studies cost money.  Until the government pays for a self-driving car study, which I think they absolutely should, the study will probably be funded by the company itself.  While this does, and should, cast some doubt, I don't think it makes the study invalid.  Instead, I think people should look for flaws in the study itself, and make judgments from there. \n\nSo, if people want to say, no matter what, you can't compare or use the data, then we should stop here.  If instead, making appropriate adjustments, we decide that at least the data can give an idea, even if not exact, then we have something to work with.\n\nWaymo is under a ton of scrutiny.  Any at fault crash will make the news somewhere.  They also have hundreds of cars running every day.  I feel like the crash rate might be low, since not much comes up when you do searches.  Of course, we need actual data, though.\n\nSo, with all that said, there is this study.\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380786#abstract\n\nAnd this one goes with the above one and goes into more detail on the data benchmarks.  \n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15389588.2024.2380522?needAccess=true\n\nOnce again, consumers should not be guessing, or trying to understand studies, the government should give clear data similar to how crash testing is done.  Why don't they?  TBC, they do a tiny bit in this area.  But it is nowhere close to something like this car/brand gets a five-star rating for crashes.\n\nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/automated-vehicle-test-tracking-tool\n\n(Ah, I knew I would get downvotes.  I assume this is just from people that hate Waymo, or self-driving cars.  And, silly me, I thought this might open a discussion of the data issues, or if a study is completely wrong simply because a company funded it, or what the government should do in this area.)",

For instance, if a company like US Steel comes up with a new alloy to bring to the market, they'll submit samples to organizations like ASME and provide funding for material properties analysis and validation.  \n\nSo in that regard any new metallurgical analysis you see published in an ASME journal or included in ASME code was paid for by the manufacturer, but it's *ASME's* study, their findings, and their determination of acceptable use for given applications--not the manufacturer.\n\nCue the study you linked.  The authors are all employed by Waymo, and from your comment I'm sure you see the concern there.  It's less Big Tobacco funding a bunch of studies into the effects of smoking and more the industry taking AT&T at its word regarding the expense and technology required for international and cell phone infrastructure until governmental anti-trust suits broke up their near monopoly.\n\nI'm not saying Waymo's employees would stoop to something that insidious, mind, but without independent analysis we simply can't assume an unbiased analysis.\n\nThat said, at least the study you linked shows their methodology, which is head and shoulders above the veritable parade of press releases from the earlier commenter's link.",

This creates a best case scenario.  But since it is pulling the same area for data on humans, it is best case for them as well.\n\nAnd since they are pulling police incidents for both groups, it is like for like.  But there could be bias as more people might report a Waymo accident hoping to get a case settlement.  Maybe there is more selection bias there that I am not thinking of.\n\nOverall, these cases don't seem like they would contribute to a major difference.  If the results were close, then I would put it down to this error factor.  But the results were significantly different.\n\nLastly, this is only one study, so more are needed.",

This was afterclass, talking with a teacher after showing him a project in his office, we were heading to the lab.\n\nAnyhow, the conversation takes a spin and we were talking trucks moving steel beams, which then lead to a \"whats the worst that could happen/how would you as a driver be responsible\" of your truck ignoring safety standards and being stopped by the police, or ignoring safety standards and then having an accident in your truck load.\n\nSo the teacher is like, it wouldnt really matter. And I am like, why? Because you would not have the responsabilities of doctors due to some weird legal system vaccuum?\n\nAnd he tells me that, you would be super dead. He then tells me about a truck with a gas tank or something misshandled his cargo and blew up some decades ago and made it to the news.\n\nI am like did he die? And he is like, yeah, instantly. A whole holiday camp/beach nearby too, all the people ended up dead.\n\nAnd I was like, oh like, they went camping near a gas leak and they unknowingly died from cancer from the chemical effects or something after some years.\n\nAnd he is like, no. Gas tanks explode. The driver got vaporized. The people camping got an instant death from the conflagration cloud, like, lungs and insides instantly burnt just from breathing. People on the beach got instantly boiled to death while most of the surface water vaporized.\n\n... so, yeah depending on the cargo it can be absolutely atrocious. You can never have enough safety in certain matters.",

          "body": "I disagree.\n\nHeavily loaded semis don't drive in dense urban environments, they drive on interstates over the road. The warehouses they drop and pick up at are generally located pretty close to a major highway and access is built to accommodate those vehicles. These routes can be easily mapped out and use a mixture of AI self-driving and deterministic systems that preexist AI and machine learning based on static info.\n\nThey can also be governed to drive pretty slow. Instead of being limited to driving only half the time because of laws limiting how many hours drivers can work, they'll be able to go probably 22+ hours a day when they're in the field. The only way to achieve this with human drivers is to shift drive, which requires paying two drivers.\n\nOne question I have is whether the fleets will be electric or gas. If gas, they'll probably have more downtime for maintenance and fill ups, while electric trucks would have much simpler drive trains and battery swaps can happen quickly (if they're required at all, it's also possible to just put a bunch of battery packs under the trailer and do entire trips without stopping, depending on how the economics works out).\n\nI expect that these self driving trucks will be suuuuper cautious and initially be loaded with insurance, but as they prove themselves and the rough edges get polished out, costs will drop and the number of nines delivered will far surpass what humans can do.",

I think it more likely in the next 10 years that we start to see driverless trucks that latch on to and follow a truck in front of them.  So imagine a truck driver driving his truck down the road, but having 5 driverless trucks following him.  That way, the driver will be responsible for the route, for filling with fuel, responsible for blown tires, etc, and (unfortunately) will be held legally liable when things go really wrong.  At this point, it wouldn't be replacing all drivers, but greatly decreasing the total numbers.\n\nThere may also start to have the option for trailers to drop off to charge in case of electric, and the driver picking up freshly charged ones along their route, or have automated switching out at certain hubs to create more complex routes with multiple drivers having taken it for part of the journey.\n\nI think the legal liability is honestly the thing that will hold up mainstream adoption at the moment.  The truck company, the software company, and the rest will try to limit their own liability as much as possible, and having a driver accountable will be the best legal stop gap until the laws catch upto where they need to be to hold driverless technology accountable.\n\nAnd to those who say \"why not just use a train then?\" it's the exact same reasons as to why plenty of trucking routes exist where a train route already also exists.

          "body": "The only reason driverless trucks will never work is not the tech, its because conpanies will always need someone to hold responsible when it goes south. Truckers are constantly getting thrown under the bus everyday at work with the shit these companies pull. I know cuz i used to be a truck driver. There will never not be someone in the driver seat with a camera pointed on them unless its a \"test\" in a semi controlled environment. The tech is already there and the auto braking system is whats gonna cause the first accident. The problem is the same with cars just on a larger scale. Many cars have an auto braking system to prevent accidents which is great, and trucks have them too. The problem is its alot more complicated to calculate because lets say for example you have frozen meat. They keep that on a \"sled\" that can be pulled off the truck. Those loads are prone to sliding. A false brake would make the whole load slide forward and now the weights of the truck are off. So do AI driven trucks get a pass? They need to change laws and the ways trucks run and are loaded in order to pull this off. Its not as simple as just getting it to drive. You can teach a monkey to drive. Trucking is about getting the load there safely from point A to point B so you can see your family next month (or 3). Anyway im interested to see what adjustments are made. Im also betting this is gone drive consumer prices through the roof. How much money does someone have to pay you to be strapped inside an AI death trap thats gonna kill you or kill someone else. We lost alot of truckers when they switched to automatics lol.",
