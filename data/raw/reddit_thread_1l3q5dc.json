It was driving me insane.\n\nSure, my TV speakers don't have as nice drivers or the level of power, but try to give an open sound, even if it has limitations.",

Sony and Samsung have better technologies like Acoustic Surface or Object Tracking.\n\nIt was  a Samsung Q900C if you're interested. It was a horrible product TBH. So sharp, sibilant, limited EQ ability, bass felt disconnected ,and the \"calibration\" literally did nothing. And add on top of all that, it sounded like it was coming from a tiny box under the TV.",
