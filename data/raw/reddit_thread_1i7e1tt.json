If you have two identically equipped devices and one is thicker, just because the battery lasts longer, will look less futuristic and impressive to most consumers. That part sucks but the push to make components smaller and more efficient is quite useful in the long run.  \n\nAlso, smaller devices means less material used. Might be a tiny amount per device but multiply that by tens of millions of devices and the company could be saving a big chunk of cash on raw materials.  \n\nNot saying I agree with this direction fully but these are some of the big reasons. With how phones have been perceived lately, I think releasing a skinnier phone actually could bring some excitement back to users even if it\u2019s all superficial.",

Or if they actually don\u2019t want to make it thicker then they should at least try to make the camera smaller and not an eyesore. Honestly the camera quality is already good enough for a phone and most of the quality comes from the post processing anyways. No need to include bigger optics.
