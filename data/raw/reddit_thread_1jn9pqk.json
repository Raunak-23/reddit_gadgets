              "body": "That big blow up is because people spread misinformation and speculation. There is nothing they're locking down in regards to functionality. They want to introduce safety features by limiting direct access to the printer from non-signed applications. In doing that though, they provided a middle man application so that users can continue using other slicers to prep their files, they just won't be able to talk directly to the printer anymore. At least that was the case before they backpedaled a little and added Developer mode options, but made it clear that it's on the user if something goes wrong.\n\nIn other words, they don't want potential malicious actors to have unrestricted access to someones printer anymore. If you think people can govern themselves accordingly, watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kr6SHYour3E) of a guy downloading Orca slicer from a non-affiliated site and connect it directly to his printer, thinking he was doing things correctly. The whole point of his video was to act in defiance to the coming, optional, firmware update. Even trying to show others how to do it. All the while he acted as the perfect example as to why they'd want to do these changes to begin with. The average person does not know how to protect themselves or their tech.\n\nThere's more to it with a change in their TOS verbiage, but it's literally them saying they'll be doing what most other hardware companies do when installing firmware updates. We see it all the time, but people suddenly forgot how their other tech works. People that don't understand, or simply want to hate on the company, tried to spin it into something that it never was.\n\nIf you want an example of what could go wrong, here's a post of someone that recently [lost their home](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1jnuju1/rqiditech3d_permanently_banned_me_for_warning/) due to faulty components.",

Your phone OS should certainly be updated to the latest security updates and it should serve as the watch's gateway to the internet. Any app that connects from your phone to the watch should be properly sandboxed to protect it from exploits.\n\nSecurity updates on a watch connected like this are not likely to be necessary in any major way. I'm sure they can serve as vectors for attacks but they are likely to be minor concerns compared to the bigger targets such as phones and computers.\n\nAs usual, you have to evaluate each device and judge the risks accordingly. It's like traveling, each mode of transportation has its risks and benefits. Do you use a roll cage, three point harness, helmet, protective gear, and such when you're driving your car to work? Sure, it's safer but it's overkill. On the other hand, if you work as a Formula 1 driver then it makes total sense.",

But, most Garmin Watch users I\u2019ve spoken with did tout it as a superior product for people who are into fitness, outdoors, etc.\n\nPlease accept my adjacent, dispassionate take, everyone in the thread.",

If the *best* wearable exclusively works with their own phones, you\u2019re more likely to get an iPhone if you want a smart watch. If you get an iPhone they get any ad and/or purchase revenue you generate in apps on your phone. So Apple does not care if you get Fitness+ as much as say Samsung or now Garmin care if you get their subs. \n\nAnd I can tell you firsthand this works. After trying many different wearables on android I ended up switching to the iPhone so I could have an Apple Watch because I was very interested in trying what was generally regarded as the best wearable.  And I am now relatively locked into their ecosystem.",

Now they would increase it again and blame the wages.\n\nEveryone against capitalism always say it \"the revenues need to grow each year\". Pretty easy, either you cut costs or you increase the price.\n\nEarly on, subscriptions were even fine. Nobody could afford Photoshop before, so wither you stole it or you made without. Subs helped a lot of people to amortize the cost.\n\nStreaming services make sense, even if they increase the price all the time, they are still 20-30% of the price of cable (where I live, for the full 4k no ads). \n\nFor Garmin... eh. I really cannot think of what more I could need that they could hide behind a paywall... unless they want to compete against Strava or something (which I would also never pay for).\n\nI'll.give the the benefit of the doubt for now (already have a watch, not much I can do). As long as they keep the paywall for useless AI features and badges, good for them and whoever thinks it's worth it. If they release a new flagship watch and you have to pay for anything that is currently free, I will not buy it, simple as that.",

Tapes weren't very dense, so CDs as an upgrade made sense (and you didn't really have to replace your tape player immediately, since tape players remained in cars till like the mid '00s). MP3 players were *absurdly* more dense and could hold your whole library in one device, plus you could add your music from your tapes/CDs to them pretty easily. Streaming services reduced the hassle of transferring/downloading songs and organizing your library, plus the upfront cost was gone. If you add at least 1/2 a CD's worth of music to your library per month, you come out ahead by using a music streaming service.\n\nWhat we're seeing currently with much of the tech world is a complete *worsening* of their product with practically no upside.

I started with a trainer for my actual road bike, but eventually I got a used 'spin class' type bike for $250 which is a bit better (quieter and doesn't put wear on my road bike).  Then I picked up two adjustable dumbells and that's all I use.  But just as often I do the pilates classes and they're only mat based.  At first you had to have an apple watch but they changed it, so now my wife uses my account with her phone and does classes too.",

It could be the one everyone ends up wanting on the used market down the road, who knows. Hollow words, ultimately, because the hope was that, though paying a high premium and forgoing the seamless integration of Apple devices, she was buying into an ecosystem that she could be happy with now and in the future.  \n\nReally hate what the world is becoming.",

This creates a machine built on systems of inputs that eventually become self fulfilling. It\u2019s how we got the Industrial Revolution and later capitalism.

This effected everything from intervals.icu to Runalyze to Sauce for Strava to Elevate for Strava, and many more.\n\nIt's natural that Garmin -- as the *source* of the majority of this data -- would want to be in the game themselves.  I would have hoped, as long time Garmin customer (I believe my second watch was a Forerunner 620, and I no longer remember what it replaced), that they'd just invest in improvements to Connect, but although they *did* complete their wholesale Connect revamping last year, they didn't actually make *any* improvements on the data analysis front.  That was a huge miss.  Athletes care far less about UI/UX (see Golden Cheetah or WKO for example!) than about insights, and by locking future functionality behind a paywall, Garmin is going to miss out on more than they gain.\n\nI'll continue to use Garmin for activity recording and health metrics, Strava for social activity tracking + segment performance, and Intervals.icu for the actually important performance metrics.",

Only use Google Maps or an alternative.\n\nBut I do use a Garmin dog tracker. I live on a farm and let my dog roam free but I want to know where he is in case he gets too close to the road (about 250M from the house in the closest direction). This means I use a collar, an Alpha 10, an app, and my watch. The Alpha 10 does not allow me to set a geofence (as near as I can tell) but constantly warns me he has exited the geofence. Even though it is set to keep only the last few minutes of tracking, the app will frequently (every few minutes) explode with all tracking information since I last installed it a few weeks ago. Because of spurious \"warnings\" I cannot disable (dog has treed quarry, etc), the watch will alert constantly and drain the battery in about a day unless I disable all the alerts.\n\nGarmin support is useless as well.",

Plus actual GPS and not just phone triangulation. \n\nNow I\u2019m gonna have to figure out how to download 8 years of data from them in case they decide to paywall it.",

It's one of the great things I love about it and one of the reasons I bought it. \n\nChances are, any new updates will be paid only. \n\nAlso, the app UX will 100% change. It will pivot to pushing these features down your throat and trying to entice you to subscribe instead of just showing you your stats. That'll be shit. \n\nAnd I'm on Garmin #3. Every one is rock solid, buy once, enjoy til it dies, buy a new Garmin. Yes, you're right - the feature set of my current Garmin will probably* remain. But there won't be a new Garmin for me. And that sucks, because for more than a decade they've been rock solid with a user friendly business model. \n\nSure, there is no reason to be *entitled* to a new feature that's released. Your base set of features is all you're *entitled* to. But a company that previously went above and beyond deciding to scale that back and do the bare minimum is still reason to be sad, especially when you're deep in their ecosystem.\n\n*^(Companies that do this also have a real history of saying that everything you currently have is staying, but somehow you find yourself three years later and that's not quite true and you're not quite sure how you got there)",
