Brother has also now resorted to blocking black and white/grayscale printing if the color cartridges are empty (even if you have a full black ink cartridge).\n\n\n\nEdit: here is a reply by Brother's CSR.\n\n\n> I understand that you are getting a Replace Ink error. Thanks for letting me know. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I\u2019ll try my best to further assist you so we can get the machine back up and running and improve your day.\nSadly, since the error message is Replace Ink, you should replace the missing color cartridge. You can't manually place your machine into B&W only mode.\n The machine will use a small amount of ink from each cartridge during regular cleanings to maintain optimal print quality. Your printer is designed to stop ALL printing operations when any of the ink cartridges have reached their end-of-life. This is to ensure the life of the printhead and to maintain premium print quality. Some ink from all the ink cartridges is used in periodic cleaning cycles. This helps to prevent issues such as printhead clogs and poor print quality. There is no way to bypass this feature.\nI apologize for the inconvenience this has caused.\n\n\nSo there's no solution or bypass. In the past I was able to select both in the brother iprint software to print only in black and white or press a button on the printer to bypass the warning that the color ink was out.",

Every print takes an average of 4 attempts, with a 'strong' automatic cleaning between each attempt which must waste a lot of ink. I don't print that often, so I can see a cleaning being needed after a few months, but this can happen after a few weeks of no use. And the thing wakes up to clean itself randomly every once in a while, so you'd think you wouldn't have to worry about it being ready to go when needed. And then the updates that break the WiFi connection and need a full reinstall of the software to fix.\n\nLast time I wanted to print a single black and white page it took over 30 minutes.",

While most printers accept various formats of drawing commands from their drivers, basically all of them\u00a0(including brother) *also* accept post processed raw-image formats that they don't touch\n\nSo disconnect your machine from the network (so it can't possible communicate with the printer to determine if the ink is genuine), generate a raw datastream format that the printer accepts, copy it to the printer.\n\nReconnect machine to network, reprint.\n\nTry again with a non-raw image format.\n\nIf you see differences, maybe the software is doing something.\n\nAgain, this is just not that hard to test.\n\nMy guess: You will discover brother is doing literally nothing, and some slightly different property of the third party ink accounts for all perceived difference.",

                      "body": "This is really only possible in certain modes.\nIt's also a *lot* harder than one would think to implement something like this.\n\nThe reason is that Microsoft has multiple print APIs, and most if not all are still in use.\n\nBy print API, let me try to give a not-too-incorrect version of what happens when you click print:\n\n1. You click print button\n2. Depending on print API used (GDI, XPS, OpenXPS, etc), a set of drawing commands is issued to the printer driver, *or* a raw image is handed to the printer driver.\n3. The driver then translates these into some printer language it sends the printer.\n4. It gets transported to printer and printer processes the commands.  \n\nA few things:\n\n1. As things became more complex, printers actually do less and less of the rasterization work on device because it's too intensive, and too easy to get wrong if, for example, you want fonts to look the same way on the screen and the device.    In the case of raw image print modes, it basically just splats pixels directly (and hence, affecting this sort of mode would be *really* hard).\n\n2. Non-raw formats like GDI, XPS, etc getting sent to the driver are *completely* different sets of drawing commands and what have you.  Which one gets used is not just selected by *windows*, but by the *app*.  So for example, Google Chrome still uses EMF->GDI printing.\nWhile Microsoft word prints in XPS.  XPS in turn queries the printer driver to understand which sorts of things it understands.\n\n\n\n\n3. Degrading image quality while not making it completely unusable is not trivial either (if it was, we wouldn't have dithering/etc algorithms).\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, because of all of this, making the software degrade image quality would actually be *a lot* of work.  That's true even if you don't, for example, try to degrade it consistently the same way in XPS vs GDI vs etc.\n\nIt is very hard to believe anyone would undertake the development effort required to degrade image quality in the driver, across all supported modes.  It would also be very easy to discover through reverse engineering.\n\nOn top of that, it's one of those things where you actually *want* the user to know it's happening.  If someone only ever used third party ink, how would they ever know it was lower quality printing without someone telling them?\n\nIn the end:\n\n1. It's dramatically easier, safer, and saner to just refuse to work properly when third party ink is detected, if that is what someone wants to do.  It isn't illegal in the vast majority of cases, and as we see here, users assume all printer companies are both assholes, and doing it, so ....\n\n2. Building and maintaining support for consistently degrading image quality inside the software is hard, and it's hard to imagine anyone would bother over just doing #1.  If they did bother, i also don't see why they'd try to hide it from the user. -  if you want people to buy your ink, at some point you have to tell them they should buy your ink to get better quality prints.",

This is to ensure the life of the print head and maintain premium print quality. If the unit were to continue printing, print jobs and cleaning cycles would suck air from the empty cartridge and damage the print head.\n\n\nThird party ink doesn't have the chip so brother can't see ink levels. So the printer will also refuse to print.",

Be aware of everything your devices do, what their microchips and circuit boards do, force background processes to show themselves and don't let even one data packet out of your sight if it can be helped, because companies can & will use whatever means they deem necessary to abuse you, the end-user, for their own enrichment, or even to be petty.  If they can break a device you purchased just to force you to buy another one, they will without a second thought, and care little for the aftermath.\n\nTo the above ends, there's videos on how to physically disable many things, from cameras to microphones and gps chips, but for software also you can learn how to equip your computer & router with a redirect/\"blocker\" called a \"hosts\" file, here's a guide on how to do that: https://archive.ph/GImk2 and, this is one of the best ones out there: https://archive.ph/saC7w along with https://archive.ph/3ftbp  Fo course you can use any text editor you like to go through the files and customize them as you like, you can also use a packet watcher/\"sniffer\" to see where bits of data go with websites you frequent to find out where ad etc. domains are, what they're called, and then add them to your hosts file for redirecting.  This of course can be added to a computer and to a router as well to add an additional layer of redirection protection, its not a perfect solve, but it helps.",
