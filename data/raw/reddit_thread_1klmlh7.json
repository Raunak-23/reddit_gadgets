Certain parts of AVP were engineered excellently (to be expected on a $3500 product) but other parts showed some boneheaded decision-making. The default ski-goggle strap was a travesty (especially for such a heavy headset) and the lack of controllers was a misstep that any VR user saw coming a mile away.",
