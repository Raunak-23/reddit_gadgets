      "body": "From the article: Mini PC brand Aoostar has launched the G-Flip 370, a palm-sized mini PC that, aside from its cool display, also packs some serious power under the hood. That's thanks to AMD's Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 APU at its heart, which boasts 12 Zen 5 cores and Radeon 890M integrated graphics. Aoostar says this setup can handle mainstream AAA games with ease. Gentler titles like League of Legends can even hit 90 fps at 4K.\n\nBut let's talk about the star of the show: that flip-up screen. At a modest 5 inches, the screen isn't exactly a cinematic experience, but it has a full-HD 1080p resolution and supports touch input. Aoostar touts it as perfect for system monitoring, quick tasks, or even catching up on your favorite shows. The screen is mounted on an aluminum alloy hinge, allowing it to tilt up to 65 degrees.\n\nIt's a clever addition, especially for a mini PC where space is all-important, since the goal is to cut down on the dimensions as much as possible. Screens are not typically a priority for PC makers when designing such compact devices.\n\nThat said, the integrated screen isn't the only way to experience the G-Flip 370's capabilities. Five inches just doesn't cut it for tasks like gaming, so the mini PC also comes equipped with HDMI 2.1 and Oculink ports for connecting to more impressive displays. At the same time, dual 2.5G Ethernet ports and Wi-Fi 7 support ensure lightning-fast connectivity, while a fingerprint scanner next to the flip-up screen adds a touch of convenience for quick logins.\n\nCooling is handled by a large vapor chamber and a single bottom-mounted fan, which should keep things running smoothly. And for those who like to tinker, the G-Flip 370 offers removable memory and two M.2 PCIe 4.0 slots for storage.\n\nAoostar hasn't announced pricing yet, but if past models are any indication, the G-Flip 370 could land around the $700 mark. Whether that's a steal or a stretch will depend on how much you value portability and that unique screen.",

I am on call 24/7, 365, for critical infrastructure and I hate carrying around my damn laptop everywhere I go. I wish I had a more portable device I could have in my day bag or jacket pocket that would let me vpn/remote into my environment and begin troubleshooting if I am remote. \nSo far the closest thing I have is.....the steam deck lol. Not exactly a perfect solution!\n\nThis little guy would be great, provided I had a portable keyboard or something. A little beefier than I need, of course.",

Phones are not meant to be used on a table they\u2019re meant to be held. Laying your phone down on a table is not as good as a screen that pops up on a hinge. \n\nThe screen is small and not meant as the primary form factor. This is meant to be connected to a screen so ports unless you\u2019re going to be using wireless screen tech which is not common. \n\nOnce again it\u2019s meant to be hooked up to a screen and a keyboard/mouse. Sure you can use Bluetooth but it\u2019s still going to need a screen. A brick with a flat screen misses the mark way more than this does. Your device creates more issues with no gain.
