The unit doesn't matter, say it's feet, meters or barleycorn for all that matters. It's dimension is 1 on each side.\n\nTo double it's size, you first place an identical cube to it's side, now the whole has the dimensions of two wide, one high, one long.\n\nNext you make it two lonh as well, meaning both the cubes you have get copied behind them, now you have a total of 4 cubes. Two wide, one high, two long.\n\nFinally, stack a copy of those four on top of each other. Now there are two blocks up in any direction, two wide and two blocks long. You have a total of 8 cubes from doubling 1 cube. Furthermore, each \"Side\" is made up of four cubes each.\n\nFor every doubling of a three dimensional object, it's surface area increases by a factor of four and it's weight by a factor of eight. For every material there is a point where it does no longer support itself because it's strength to hold itself or propel itself grows slower than it's weight.\n\nThis also has implication for waste heat, both for batteries and for life forms. Because the surface area only increases by a factor of four while total material increases by a factor of eight, the heat it can radiate out is proportionally less compared to the heat it generates.",

That's insanely low.\n\nComparing that to what you charge at, you only charge 60 kW in 8 hours. That's not enough to fill up most EVs. It's enough to do 20% to 80% on something with 100kWh capacity, and it'll do 20-50% on the hummer.\n\nOh and let's not forget that it does 0-60 in 3.5 seconds and your chevy is like 6.5 seconds. There's no reason to have an under powered EV. You get BETTER efficiency when you can regen more.\n\nThe hummer is a fantastic EV SUV/Truck. It does all the truck stuff without sacrificing the EV stuff. It does all the EV stuff without sacrificing the truck stuff. There aren't a lot of options for an EV truck, but you would be hard pressed to find one that's better than the hummer.",

I as a tree-hugging-we-should-all-pedal-or-bike hippie would like to point out a lot of the country 5 miles wouldn't even get you to a convenience store or gas station. Further the roads in these places often could in kind terms be described as rugged and challenging. We need small autos that can handle these roads. Small energy efficient vehicles that can handle ate up roads tend to be blocked by regulations.\n\nPeople say safety but I bet a k-truck or an old S-10 style small body truck probably is still safer than an e-bike for most people. I'd like to get the hurdles small auto and e-bikes removed.",

As much as the US acts like everybody here lives in the sticks and has to bulldoze dozens of bears out of the way during their monthly 200-mile pilgrimage to Costco, the fact of the matter is that most people live in urban or suburban areas. These places could easily support other kinds of transportation if they could face up to the wild inefficiencies of car-only transportation approaches.\n\nLike, when we\u2019re talking about transportation, the important thing is where people *are*, not where they aren\u2019t.

This means if you have to drive anywhere over 100 miles, you will have to stop and recharge.\n\nDon\u2019t get me started on recharging\u2026If you plug the Hummer into a 110 V it adds 2 miles per hour of charging. It takes a week to get to 80%.\n\nIf you plug the Hummer into 220 V, it charges 8 miles an hour and still takes 24 hours to fully charge. This means if you need to drive over 100 miles, you have to charge for 24 hours minimum.",

Typically it takes 40 minutes to go from 20->80% and the Bolt is a notoriously slow charger on the faster chargers.\n\nWe have gone from LA to SF multiple times with it, and recently to Monterrey.

The only road trip we had trouble with was to Vegas, where most of the chargers were broken, or we couldn\u2019t find them. The one we eventually found had a long line.

I didn't get a Ford Lightning cause the HummerEV is much roomier and more comfortable for trips with the family.

The switch to 220V is a no-brainer and I wouldn't hesitate to get an EV if my garage/home simply has 220V access. Just plug it in when you get home and you'll never need to pay for external chargers aside from road trips.

If you have an efficient EV (i.e. not a giant truck) and/or your commute is on the shorter side (30mi or less), 110v is probably fine for your needs. \n\n  \nThe math isn't difficult to figure out, either. 110v chargers generally supply about 1.2-1.7 kwh per hour, multiply that by the number of miles your EV can go per kilowatt (usually 3 to 4) and you get the amount of miles a 110v outlet will get you every hour, usually about 4-5mi each hour. If your plug your car in for 12 hours every day, that's 50-60mi of range every day. There's a lot of people that drive less than that on a daily basis.",

After you drive 30mi you still have hundreds of miles of range left. And if you're only driving 30mi a day you don't need to start every day with 100% battery, if you have a big day and the car gets down to 30%, next morning it's only at 50%, it doesn't really matter because you're only going to use a couple percent doing your normal commute. \n\nAnd if shit really hits the fan and you need to drive hundreds of miles several days in a row, there's always DC fast charging as a backup.\n\nIt's not a perfect system but it's workable for many people. I just think it's going too far to say that every EV owner *needs* level 2 when many light drivers or sporadic drivers could easily get away with level 1.",

AND if you need to charge faster, like on a trip, you can charge like 30x faster than that at public chargers.\n\nAssuming the numbers they gave are real (even though they aren't even internally consistent), let's use 8 miles of range per hour of charging. Many people could charge 10 hours/day, which would be 80 miles/day and cover an absolutely massive number of use cases, even if technically it would take 24 hours to charge from empty to full.\n\nIf you were completely out of range, which means you're in an outlier situation where you probably just returned from a trip AND on top of that you need to drive more than 80 miles the next day, you just stop at a FAR faster charger before you end your trip. The Hummer can charge at \\~300kW, which is about 30x faster than the \\~10kW home charger that \\*supposedly\\* only adds 8 miles of range per hour. So, for a brief time, it could add \\~240 miles of range per hour and you could get \\~100 miles of range in 15-20 minutes if you just returned from a trip and need to do another trip in the morning.",

It\u2019s completely dependent on the charger and how it was wired and or/what\u2019s available where it was installed. 8 miles of range in an hour puts that particular charger at about 4000w, very near the very bottom of L2  charging.

          "body": "So I was reading the article and I was like \u201cthere\u2019s no way it\u2019s that bad\u201d because I have a 2023 KIA EV6 GT that non-GT drivers like to shit on for having terrible range compared to the lower power models. So I did some math, using my EV6 as a reference.\n\nThe 24 hours seems to be 100% accurate with a battery size of 245kWh(I know it\u2019s actually 246, but 245 is cleaner math) and a 40a/240v charger (a pretty typical Level 2 home charger, mine goes up to 50a). It is generally bad practice to be driving to \u201dempty\u201d, you should be charging for about\\~30% at a time up to 80-90% capacity, unless you plan on needing the full 100% for a trip. I30% of a Hummer battery capacity is still 73.5kWh, or about the same electricity a 3 bedroom, 4 person household will use in 3 days. It would still take 7.5-8 hours to charge with the same 40a/240V charger.\n\nIMO that is the ABSOLUTE MINIMUM of practical, if the real world range was decent. The Hummer EV sees\\~2.5km/kWh or about 183km mixed driving (113 in freedom units) with the same 30% charge. If your daily commute is within that round trip or you can charge at work, I can see that working for some but not many. My daily commute is 70km each way and I would be getting very anxious if I had to run errands and stuff or had a busy weekend for sure.\n\nThe Hummer can also fast charge at a maximum of 350kw, so going from something like 20%-80%, or about  350-375km of range, while driving further will take about an hour. Again, right along the lines of practical. Like you\u2019re not doing a cross country expedition through the mountains, but it\u2019s manageable if you have to drive out to the in-laws for Thanksgiving and want to flex on your father-in-law kind of thing.\n\nWhat I will say is, if you had to charge a Hummer 30% every day, and you have a L2 charger at home, it\u2019s about $5.60 CAD  to charge during off-peak hours (overnight) in my area. Let\u2019s say you drive to work 5 days a week, that\u2019s about $112 CAD a month. Keeping in mind the cost to fill a H2 with regular gas ONCE is about the same, depending on gas prices.\n\nSo I do think the writer is being a bit overdramatic, but anyone who buys an Hummer EV as a commuter or daily driver might actually just have brain damage anyways. .",

      "body": "I own a Hummer EV. It\u2019s easily my favorite vehicle I\u2019ve ever owned. Some of the author\u2019s claims are spot on, especially around charging. But his range claim is ridiculous unless he\u2019s flooring it everywhere he goes, which is both stupid and incredibly dangerous in that vehicle. Towing my 8000lb boat I can still get over the 100 miles he\u2019s claiming.\n\nYesterday was the longest driving I\u2019ve done in a while. It was 118 miles total. I used 40% of my battery. That\u2019s shy of the stated range by about 20-30 miles but nothing as bad as the author is claiming. I plugged it in when I got home last night on my 16a level 2 charger and it has half that range back already. I\u2019m not driving much today so it\u2019ll be caught up by tomorrow. \n\nIf I needed more range before that I\u2019ll just go supercharge somewhere. Going from almost 0% to 80% takes about 40 minutes at a fast charger. That\u2019s a lot more than other EVs but it\u2019s also not something I do often.\n\nI get that this vehicle is showy and ostentatious. But it\u2019s the only EV available in the US with a removable top. It can also tow my boat. It\u2019s more efficient for me to own than a small convertible and a separate dedicated tow vehicle. And while crab walk is a gimmicky party trick, 4 wheel steering is a true game changer on a vehicle this size.",

Whereas charging at home is nowhere near 30 or 60 cents per kwh. I imagine 99% of time someone purchasing a $100,000 EV has a home to charge it.

If I wasn't on a lease I would change out the rear shocks for the Rally ones like people on the forum have done.\n\nEverything else is minor. Heated seats get too hot on the highest setting. I don't like the dial shifter. Door cup holders are too small. The rear spoiler keeps the rear windows wet when going through drive-thru car washes.\n\nBut in terms of range, power, handling, value, seat comfort, build quality, reliability; stuff that actually matters?

Is inefficient.\n\n- The Hummer always has been an unpractical vehicle and the EV is no different. \n\n- Fast chargers are plentiful and nav systems take the guesswork out of long trips and eliminate range anxiety.\n\nI drive a Ford Lightning and it\u2019s a fantastic truck. Drives great, handles bad weather perfectly, and is a bit less than a quarter of the per mile cost to drive where I live. I don\u2019t do much towing but that\u2019s a downside if you\u2019re driving far. Towing kills range and charging while hitched is a pain.",

      "body": "I think the problem is that we haven't socialized the idea of an EV's *efficiency* to the same consistency we have with gas cars. Everyone from eco/green hippy to redneck can estimate the mileage that a car will get be it a gas guzzler at 12 mpg, to a Prius at 45 mpg - or an RV at 8 mph. We all know the unit, and we all know how to read it on a window sticker, and how to compute it. It's simple and agreed upon. Oh and we know that lower is crappier.\n\n\nSadly when it comes to EVs the world has not agreed upon such a simple metric that even moves in the same direction as mpg. Let's start with the fundamental unit of energy for EV's (analogous to the \"gallon of gas\" for gas cars). For some reason marketers thought the kWh would word for consumers for a unit of energy. It's atrociously stupid. First, no one can even write it correctly (the Watt part should always be capitalized in SI since it's named after a person), yet people will often write \"kwh\" (yes I'm nitpicking here). But also it mixes the \"hour\" which is a stupid unit to begin with and not even part of the SI. WTF is with that. \n\nThe Joule is the correct unit of energy except it's just way too fucking small to use on its own, since there are 3,600,000 J in one kWh (noticed it's not even a power of 10 since that stupid hour is in there). No problem, why just decide on the mega-Joule - the \"MJ\". In my opinion the MJ should be the *only* unit of energy we use for cars. A fully charged Tesla MYP has 270 MJ of energy. Simple.\n\nNow let's get back to full economy. The dipshits building EVs decided to **invert** the convention we've had for decades around mpg. Why not stick with mpg but swap out the g with MJ? That way we stick with the same idea where lower is crummier and bigger is better (just like with mpg).\n\nFor example a Tesla MYP can go 320 miles on a full \"tank\" so that's 320/270 = 1.2  MPMJs. The Hummer on the other hand the Hummer has a 882 MJ tank and can only for 100 mi according to this author. That's 0.1 MPMJ!s 10x crappier than the Tesla. \n\nWhy aren't these number pasted on the windows and socialized on every EV? That's the only number you need. The \"Range\" is far less important. No one discusses how big their gas tank is, they talk about their MPG. \n\nIf you saw a Tesla has a full economy of 1.2 and the Hummer is 0.1 which one would you buy?\n\nThat's like seeing 45 MPG vs 4.5 MPG.",

That's classic Hummer right there. The weight alone, including the whopping 3k LB battery bank, is going to chew through tires and require lengthy recharge periods. Then there's the laughable energy consumption - eating up 3 miles for each half mile driven, who the heck was doing the mileage calibration? Topping it off, the charging time is a nightmare; you'd need a full day to recharge if you fancy a jaunt over a 100 miles. Seriously, anyone who's not delusional would've seen these issues coming a mile away.",
