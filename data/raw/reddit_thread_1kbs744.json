      "body": "Im surprised they were having selective solder issues at all, its pretty straight forward with proper preheat and flux, especially on an established product like this. I wouldn\u2019t even announce this if I were them because it comes off as kind of embarrassing. SMD headers at these pin counts would have also been suitably strong, I personally have never seen a 3 pin SMD header ripped off.\n\nWhile not new or terribly difficult, paste in hole is the most difficult of the three options. I find all of this a bit strange.\n\nEliminating selective solder process would be a significant cost savings, however. But they arent spinning the story that way.\n\nEdit: I see they also mention the ethernet and USB.  Sometimes connector vendors will cheap out and matte tin the pins prior to trimming them so you get poor wetting on two sides, but I dont think that would improve with PiH. There are likely a shield though that could be grounded, and if that through hole wasnt given a proper pattern to the ground plane than that would wick heat away excessively and cause more wetting issues. Possibly reflow gave better overall heating to overcome that. But if so, than the layout would be to blame. My 2 cents",
