                              "body": "To add to this, here's a rundown of much of the bad design choices in old controllers:\n\n* Magnavox Odyssey, Coleco Telstar, & all Pong consoles: just a pair of knobs. Not cut out for anything not Pong-like.\n* RCA Studio2, Intellivision, and ColecoVision: All face buttons are set up like a phone number pad. Not even close to ergonomic or intuitive, and games often didn't even use all the buttons. The disc for movement on Intellivision and ColecoVision was just a variant of the Pong knob.\n* Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800, Emerson Arcadia, Sega SG-1000: Joystick on top, button on side, resulting in weird underhand grip needed to press the buttons. The 5200 & Arcadia also had a number pad on top, making it so you need to move one hand around and to the back to press them.\n* Famicom/NES: Finally we get ergonomic design, right? The sharp corners and blister-causing buttons (coining the phrase [Nintendo thumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_thumb)) said otherwise.\n* Sega Master System: Weird D-pad shape causes N-thumb plus less comfort before it even settles in.\n* Atari Jaguar: Launched with 17 face buttons, most on *another number pad* below D-pad level. Later got a Pro controller with 3 more face buttons and 2 shoulder buttons, looking like if a 5200 controller got rammed up the bottom of a Saturn controller.\n* Sony Playstation: Remember N-thumb? It's back, and now the D-pad is disjointed enough to make fighting game motions harder to pull off, so you'll put more pressure into getting that N-thumb.\n* Apple Pippin: People hated Apple in the 90s for a reason. Trackball in the dead center of the controller, face buttons spaced too far from each other, 3 buttons on *the underside* (no controller puts them there for a reason), and D-pad is basically a circle.\n* Nintendo 64: 3-prong shape makes it so you probably won't use the D-pad or L button much, if ever.\n* Sega Dreamcast: Wire awkwardly comes out the bottom so that 2 Memcard slots can be on the top. D-pad is slightly off to the side, making fighting game motions harder when circling to the left.\n* Bandia Wonderswan: How about instead of more than 2 face buttons, we just put another D-pad above the D-pad? That'll let you play games vertically while only gripping the very left side of the system (good luck not dropping it).\n* X-box: The Duke reigns supreme in size, weight, and intimidation (although the Saturn Analog controller competes okay). Its B&W face buttons are tiny and awkwardly placed.\n* Gamecube & Wii: Great for Smash. Great for first-party games. Awkward for anything third-party, especially fighting games.\n* Nokia N-gage: Nobody missed the number pad except Nokia. Nobody else thought to push them as close to each other as possible either.",

Even the New 3DS XL (the last big beefy DS) had a small enough form factor that I could use it while standing on packed buses or trains. But the Switch is too bulky for that, I can only really play it if I'm seated. And I can't justify spending for a Switch Lite.\n\nAs a home console, using it docked doesn't feel like you're playing on a proper console. It feels exactly like I've connected a handheld to a tv. Modern consoles double as media systems, but the Switch doesn't have the same catalogue of apps (only youtube and hulu I think?)\n\nIt's not about the games, it's about how Nintendo clearly didn't know what they were aiming for with the product. They started with a handheld that could be a home console, threw ideas out until some stuff stuck, marketed it really well and then took any criticisms as inspiration for the newer models: Want a bigger screen? Get the OLED Switch. Want a smaller form-factor pure handheld? Get the Switch Lite.\n\nI get that people worldwide love the Switch but for me, as someone who carried my DS's, and later on 3DS's, with me anywhere I went, the Switch missed the mark quite badly.",
