Quite literally it is very uncomfortable. And then respond by taking insulin. You would need to be given glucagon daily, with no insulin for several weeks or months to actually die, which would **never** get to that point in the first place. \n\nPlease don\u2019t try and spread fear kk getting misinformation.

That's a small amount of glucagon, and I'm assuming it's actually glucagon- the same stuff we Type 1 diabetics get in the powder and saline syringes. \n\nA four week wear-life is also much too short to be really worth it for the vast majority of diabetics. I haven't used a glucagon in 10 years, for example, though this might be geared more towards less stable diabetics: I don't know how specific their proposed use case got. \n\nThere's also the risk of it just breaking: \"3D printed polymer\" is really troubling. That's just cheaply made plastic, with unknown toxicity.\n\nIs it a resin print? In which case how can they guarantee the plastic has no uncured resin? (You mostly can't). Is it the more common layer by layer FDM print? How can you be sure it won't snap in half? Or degrade? What plastic did they use? PLA is very fragile, ABS not so much, also not so agreeable to the body (though it doesn't seem to be an injectable capsule).\n\nA step in the \"neat\" direction, like the purportedly  inaccurate year-long eversence CGM, but not really a significant aid for the vast majority of diabetics out there.",

Glucagon that we carried in the ambulance needed to be reconstituted in saline before administration because the powder was supposed to have a longer shelf life. Maybe they have a more shelf stable liquid form now, I'm seeing Google results say 18-36 months.\n\n\nHowever, this medication would essentially be stored at body temperature, likely reducing it's shelf life.\n\n\nAs for the 3D print aspect, you raise valid concerns, but professional grade 3D printing is probably pretty safe for this type of application. They'd use appropriately studied materials and have a QA process. Or at least, under a competent FDA they would have to.\u00a0",
