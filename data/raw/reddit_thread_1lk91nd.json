Margins on big ticket hardware items are (at least were, my knowledge of retail is out of date by nearly 20 years now) next to nothing because that's what brings people in the door.  This is also why they push the extended warranties and add-on skus so hard...that's where all the money is.  \n\nThe extended warranties are almost 100% profit, for every person that actually makes use of it after they buy, there are 4 or more that don't, so that's literally free money right there, which is why they *really* lean on those in big box electronic stores.  But all that incidental stuff that people would buy around a major hardware purchase, that's where they got their money.  Someone wants a new $300 printer?  Better add on the $25 USB cable (cost $1.17), a full set of ink cartridges for $35 bucks each (cost $7.46), a couple $4.99 reams of paper (cost .87 cents), maybe some really fancy high end $30 for 20 sheets of photo paper (cost $9.47)...and of course the exceptional value of the $69.99, 3-year extended service plan that you probably will forget you even bought when it dies a year and a half from now.\n\nOnline shopping is a much bigger player these days than it was then of course so things may not be the same as they used to be back then, but while the margin might not be as crazy as it was back in those days due to the increase in competition, Im positive they're still making more profit as a percentage on the dinky shit than they ever were on the big ticket items.",

In which case, you\u2019re going to check the spec sheet to see what the bandwidth actually is. \n\nYour average person is just going to see HDMI, and plug that in. They don\u2019t particularly care.\n\nIt\u2019s not like USB-C where you might have a ton of cables lying around and a load of devices that support it, plus you only really buy a new cable if one breaks of whatever else. \n\nMost people just buy a HDMI cable when they need it or just use the one that comes in the box for a certain product and the odds of it breaking are incredibly low because people aren\u2019t constantly unplugging and replugging a HDMI cable.",

And at very high motion like a dragonball game, things might look a little odd, sorta like the smoothing effect some televisions have. sometimes it confuses things like the cross hair, or very close parallel lines like a shipping crate or fence, But in 90 percent of use cases, as long as its around 60fps and no lower than 35fps, it usually comes out pretty great. 72 to 144 usually comes out fantastic. If you have a card that can handle 4k 60-72fps stable with a bit of overhead left for FG, you'll get good results out of the box. bear in mind though, if a game has dlss and you're on a Nvidia card, that will just objectively work better overall. LS is good for literally any video content or program that doesn't have fg features, though it's results come pretty close just eyeballing it.",

      "body": "From the article: Following the standard's debut at CES 2025, HDMI 2.2 has now been finalized by the HDMI Forum. The full spec confirms much of what we heard six months ago, including doubling the maximum bandwidth of HDMI 2.1 to 96 Gbps \u2013 more than DisplayPort.\n\nWhile using HDMI 2.2 does not require a new connector, taking advantage of all its best features requires a new Ultra96 cable \u2013 a reference to its maximum bandwidth. 96Gbps is double the 48Gbps max bandwidth of HDMI 2.1 and is more than the 80Gbps supported by DisplayPort 2.1.\n\nThat amount of bandwidth will allow for some monstrous resolution and refresh rate combinations, including 4K at up to 240Hz and 8K at up to 60Hz in 4:4:4 format at up to 12-bit color depth. It also supports 12K@120Hz and 16K@60Hz with DSC (Display Stream Compression).\n\nFollowing the issue of HDMI 2.1-branded cables not meeting the standard's spec, the Ultra96 cables themselves will clearly be labeled with the name, and manufacturers will be required to test each one individually. The cables will also be certified by the HDMI Forum.\n\nBuyers of an Ultra96 Certified Cable can use the HDMI Forum's labelling program to confirm it's the real thing by scanning the QR code on the box.\n\nHDMI 2.2 also introduces Latency Indication Protocol (LIP). This improves audio and video synchronization, especially for multi-device systems such as those with AV receivers or a soundbar. LIP could be especially useful to those whose systems can't seem to precisely synchronize the dialogue being heard with the actors' mouth movements.\n\nHDMI 2.2 is backward compatible, so the cables will work with anything featuring an older HDMI port.\n\nThe first HDMI 2.2 devices are expected to arrive during the final quarter of 2025. AMD is rumored to support the standard in the next Radeon UDNA GPUs, though they might be limited to a maximum of 80Gbps, according to prolific leaker Kepler.",

To get to his number, Dr. Clark assumed optimal visual acuity across the field of view; that is, it assumes that your eyes are moving around the scene before you. But in a single snapshot-length glance, the resolution drops to a fraction of that: around 5\u201315 megapixels.\n\nSo, if you can scan your eye around a little then you get close to that theoretical maximum. However, a quick glance is more like 10 megapixels.\n\nAlso:\n\n> While 4K resolutions provide a very detailed image for average viewers, 16K resolutions exceed the detail the human eye can perceive at typical viewing distances. Therefore, most people may not notice significant improvements with higher resolutions like 16K.",
