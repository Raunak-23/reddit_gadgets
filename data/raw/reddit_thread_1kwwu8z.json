They purchase things with bots, then sell them on local marketplaces, but unlike e.g. concert or football matches tickets there is no pressure for them to sell it, if nobody buys a console or a gpu they just return it, get a full refund and buy it again and can repeat so indefinitely. It would maybe work if absolutely nobody purchased from them, but that is never going to be the case. And getting few thousand dollars even from 200-300k investment with no chance of losing money will always be considered good",

A good example is the whole $90 debacle or the \"all games being a download key\", people currently have such a hatred for Nintendo that any article containing any sort of negativity surrounding it will get latched on immediately and spread.\n\nThe same thing wouldn't happen with the PS5 since that just won't get the same amount of clicks, so journalists don't bother reporting on it. At least that's my take on the whole situation.",

I thought that was the deal. \n\n^^^^^^.\n\nThe way I understand it, the problem was that nintendo simply wants to have total control over the game market. They have 0% control over physical copies that are 100% self contained on the physical medium they are distributed with, and they wanted to change that. If you already sell a box in the store, there is no reason for it not to have all of the game files on it. Adding requirement for download or even just a server connection, makes you now dependant on nintendo and lets them control second hand/used market. \n\n^^^^^^.\n\nNegativity towards nintendo comes from such practices and overall nintendo pettiness I believe, lawsuits and all, they seem to be the gaming equivalent of disney.\n\nSure it is a business, but so is valve for example, they also make a ton of money and their approach to consumer/customer is completely different even though they do also have 100% total controll over games that they sell, but their case is different because they only have digital distribution, and they do massive sales. Nintendo wants to do both, have games be $60 indefinitely, no sales, and also have them be digital and dependant on their will to let you play them.",

Like I asked before - why would it matter which ones are which?\n\nYou had an incorrect preconceived idea (Nintendo are forcing downloads), started off you post with that, then went on about to about how it's because Nintendo is all about 100% control, and you are dependent on their servers and you have to download it they somehow have control over the 2nd hand market.\n\nThen when I pointed out this was not the case and especially not for Nintendo, you double down and say it doesn't matter what Nintendo are doing?\n\nClearly, 3rd party publishers can choose how they distribute their games, just as they do on Xbox or PS5. Fully on disc, disc/card with download required (they are calling it a key card) or code in a box (ew). All platforms have this except PC which don't really do much retail distribution at all.\n\nMS and Sony all have the same options. You can sell a full game or a card/disc with a download required and you cannot sell a code in a box as it's a single use code and just about everyone thinks it's pretty shit.\n\nSeems like Sony and MS are the ones after more control, they have both sold devices that don't take physical media at all, either full stop or require another purchase.\n\nSo in the end, I don't understand your point at all as there is nothing here that Sony and MS are not already doing.",

Apple makes plenty of money from the app store, and yet they still don't charge $60 for an app, not even their own crucial apps.  They could easily charge $99 for calls, $59 for imessage, $99 for photo app, $59 for navigation, etc. \n\nWith phones there are free apps, sales, dollar apps, and the device comes fully functional with all required apps for its hardware, where with nintendo the hardware comes naked with nothing useful, and nintendo wants to charge you for a freakin' tutorial. \n\n^^^^^^.\n\n>it's not usual to have consoles on a 2-3 year upgrade cycle, whilst apple would try to have you ever 12 months if they could, Nintendo is likely only charging you once or twice a decade for the hardware\n\nIt's not like they sell you once per decade, and have to charge more so that the hardware can \"last\" a decade.  They charge you once a decade and you end up with decade old hardware, so that hardly seems unfair. It's even worse than that because given that nintendo is never on the bleeding edge of tech, it's more like charging once a decade for already 3 year old tech. \n\nYou can also easily buy an iPhone and not buy another for 10 year period, so that doesn't really make a difference from hardware perspective in this comparison. \n\n\n^^^^^^.\n\nConsoles are in the ink printer business. You charge 0 or minimal margin for hardware and recoup on consumables (software in case of nintendo). That is why it shouldn't be compared to something like an iPhone where they make most of the money selling the hardware, and they can't rely on software sales because a lot of people don't even need to buy software to use the hardware, because like I've said iPhone comes preloaded and additional apps are free in lot of cases.",
