An EKG tells us very little about how well the heart is mechanically functioning.",

He was refereed to a Cardiologist, who prescribed an EKG (ECG) later that day at the hospital. It took 1 full day. EKG showed signs that suggested a possible blockage. He went back early the next morning for a Cardiac CT Angiography procedure. Later that day he was in the Cath lab where the Doctor implanted a coronary stent.   Total time was 2 full days.",

A hospital might have *one* machine for echocardiograms and it could take up to an hour per patient.\n\nEKGs are great for helping to diagnose *emergent* heart issues, like a myocardial infarction that would require a trip to the cath lab.  Echocardiograms are good for diagnosing some less immediately life-threatening heart issues that don't always show up on an initial cardiac workup.\n\nI agree it shouldn't take months to schedule an outpatient echocardiogram, but that's an entirely separate issue from how quick it is to do an EKG.  And if you're having any cardiac symptoms like chest pain or difficulty breathing, you shouldn't be scheduling an outpatient echo to begin with, you should be going to an ER.  At that point, if the initial cardiac workup (EKG, bloodwork, chest X-ray) doesn't show anything emergent but your symptoms and risk factors warrant further investigation, you should be getting an echocardiogram and/or a stress test no later than the next day.",
