Memory card format is limited to 64GB without modding. Charging port is not micro usb. They shut down PSV services years ago. The price was about equal to PS4 at some point. The titles released for PSV were nothing like stuff from PSP. AAA games just never got ported like they used to in the previous generation. There are some good exclusives. Besides all those complaints the hardware is amazing and thanks to dedicated community you can jailbreak it and do soooooo much with it, it\u2019s bonkers.",

              "body": "It\u2019s not HDR though. Not even close.\n\nIt\u2019s *technically* HDR in the sense that the circuitry can \u201cspeak\u201d HDR, it can receive the signal and display it without any errors, but that\u2019s true of every TV and computer monitor from the past 6-8 years, it doesn\u2019t mean it can *display* HDR. So it\u2019s the kind of false advertising where they aren\u2019t going to be legally accountable for lying because HDR is such a meaningless term and it\u2019s capable of deciding the HDR data stream. But a low-contrast LCD with no active backlight and a 400 nit brightness is simply not capable of displaying an HDR image in high dynamic range even if it can technically decode the data.\n\nIt\u2019s such a shame because, like I said, most TVs and computer monitors do the same false advertising, claiming they\u2019re HDR when they\u2019re not, so unless you\u2019re spending a lot on a really nice TV (and as far as computer monitors go ones that can actually *display* HDR are almost nonexistent) there\u2019s a good chance most Switch 2 buyers have never experienced real HDR. It could have been such a great way to introduce a new audience to HDR, and encourage developers to actually implement HDR because they could be confident that people would be playing on a real HDR display, but Nintendo had to be Nintendo and cheap out. Even the Steam Deck OLED has a true HDR display, and there are like three PC games on Steam that support HDR natively. But those three games look amazing on the Steam Deck. This screen is going to be very disappointing to anyone who is coming from an OLED Switch, because even an SDR OLED looks a million times better and has significantly higher dynamic range than an HDR LCD.\n\nThe 120fps screen is neat I guess, although most Switch 2 games will be struggling to hit 60 so I don\u2019t really see the point. I think it was probably just something they chose to distract people from the choice to go with a cheap low-quality LCD. And just like HDR the technical capability to display 120fps is meaningless. Just look at the 120hz ProMotion display on the MacBook Pro, technically it\u2019s 120fps but it\u2019s such a \u201cslow\u201d display in terms of refresh and response time that it\u2019s not really any better than a 60hz display. In the Mac\u2019s case it doesn\u2019t really matter because they just did it to make the UI feel a bit smoother and color quality/accuracy and resolution is much more important than frame rate, but the Switch is meant for gaming so hopefully it\u2019s a very \u201cfast\u201d 120hz screen. I won\u2019t be holding my breath considering the lies about HDR, but I guess I won\u2019t know for sure until tomorrow.\n\n***\n\nEdit: well it\u2019s not quite as bad as I was expecting.\n\nLike I thought no local dimming, and it has the terrible contrast, off-angle color/contrast issues, and severe backlight bleed of an LCD. But that being said it\u2019s a *good* LCD. By LCD standards the contrast and vibrancy is decent, not enough to make up for the lack of local dimming but tolerable. Brightness-wise it seems around the same but maybe slightly brighter than my OLED model at full brightness, at least when looking at the home menu because I don\u2019t have two copies of any games to compare. People were suspecting this was a 400 nit display and I read somewhere that the OLED was 350 (though some sources said 400) so that tracks. The OLED of course has much higher dynamic range in terms of contrast, and the colors are still a bit more vibrant and saturated, but the LCD doesn\u2019t look as bad as I was expecting. It seems on par with a good midrange computer monitor rather than the bargain basement LCD used on the original Switch.\n\nBut when booting up Mario Kart World I noticed something: the backlight bleed suddenly got noticeably worse. On HDR displays a common trick (mostly a gimmick to make them seem more impressive rather than any technical reason) is to have two separate brightness ratings, one for normal content and one for when it detects HDR content. For example the Steam Deck OLED has a normal brightness of 600 nits but HDR content boosts that to 1000 nits, and iPhones have brightness of 1000 nit and can get to 1600 for HDR, or even 2000 when outdoors for better sunlight readability. But that last example is proof that it\u2019s a gimmick because it will reach higher than its HDR brightness when viewing SDR content if it detects direct sunlight. If you have a smartphone with an HD-capable display and you\u2019ve ever noticed that scrolling through videos online one of them seems like it turns your brightness up, that\u2019s HDR.\n\nSo my best guess is that like a \u201creal\u201d HDR display it\u2019s increasing its maximum brightness when viewing HDR content, which I wasn\u2019t expecting it to do. I have no way to test this but anecdotally it doesn\u2019t seem anywhere near as bright as a Steam Deck OLED or an iPhone in non-HDR mode, so definitely not the industry standard of 1000 nits. My best guess is maybe like the 500-700 range. Or maybe I\u2019m just fooling myself and what I saw wasn\u2019t actually the brightness changing when launching the game, and all I\u2019m seeing is the slight increase in base brightness compared to the OLED Switch.\n\nBut for me, someone who has had very pessimistic expectations about the screen since the first rumors that it would be LCD, it\u2019s better than I had expected. Still not HDR in the way that most people mean when they use the term, just in the way that they can\u2019t get sued over it, but I was expecting the absolute worst and got mediocre, so that\u2019s an improvement. I was expecting something on par with the Sony PlayStation Portal, a decent screen that gets the job done but not one that has very impressive specs or image quality. It definitely seems noticeably better than that display (though how much of that is because it\u2019s not streaming compressed video like the Portal I don\u2019t know). And if you\u2019re coming from an original Switch or an LCD Steam Deck it goes without saying it\u2019s far better than those displays. But in terms of contrast and vibrance it\u2019s definitely a downgrade from the Switch OLED, offset slightly by its better brightness.",

                      "body": "I haven\u2019t seen one in person yet, but based on what little information Nintendo has released and hands-on reports from reviewers/news sites it sounds like a normal edge-lit LCD with 400 nits of brightness, no local dimming and no HDR-level brightness. Which makes sense because if it had local dimming there\u2019s no way Nintendo wouldn\u2019t be advertising it to combat the bad press from not using OLED, even though OLED is better few would have complained about an LCD with local dimming.\n\nMy understanding is that local dimming is only really cost effective at very large screen sizes where OLED is still prohibitively expensive, or in specific scenarios where super high maximum brightness or static UI elements (like on computers and tablets) would make OLED less desirable. But even in those cases OLED has made some huge improvements over the past decade, they can get super bright (albeit not quite as bright as the best mini LED) and burn in is basically a non-issue. Small high-resolution OLED displays are so cheap now that an LCD with local dimming probably would have been a far more expensive option than OLED.",

The AGS-001 and the AGS-101.\n\n\nThe 001 has a front lit screen, which is fine and a huge upgrade over the older gameboys. But when I was a kid I got my toys later, when they got cheap, and nintendo quietly released the 101 in the US about a year before the DS came out. That's the one I got for christmas... and honestly it was a great deal because GBA games went on sale when the DS came out.\n\n\nThe 101 wasn't sold for long before it was replaced with a new console, so not as many of them are still around, but it has a backlit screen and is the best looking gameboy in my opinion.\n\n\nAbout 15 years ago I got one on ebay that was all beat to hell but the screen was flawless, no dead pixels or scratches. Swapped it into a neon orange shell, a color they never sold it in, so it's harder for someone to steal and it looks beautiful.\n\n\nI got that and an EZ-Flash IV cart, takes a microSD card. Did you know, every GBA game released in north america is less than 5GB total? Also the cart lets me play homebrew or modded games, like pokemon randomizer on real hardware.",

Nintendo is estimating 2-6.5 hrs playtime, let's say that playing Cyberpunk 2077 it lasts a solid 1 hour, that would mean the draw is like 22.5W .\n\nFor comparison max power draw of the Switch is 18W even though it can accept up to 40W charging. An M1 MacBook Air at max load draws like 29W even though it can charge at up to 45W. \n\nLet's say it's 23W for Switch 2. Well e.g. the Icemag 1 is 10000mAh and can provide up to 30W charging and itself charges in like 1.5 hrs. Meaning you could play-and-charge on it, charge the power bank and put it back in when the internal battery gets low, like infinite portable time.",
