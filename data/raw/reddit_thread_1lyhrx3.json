The Commodore Corporation's acquisition seems to be in the bag, but worryingly, funding doesn\u2019t seem to be complete, yet, for the \u201clow seven-figure\u201d deal to be finalized.\n\nI'd love for this to go well, but I worry it'll be like other attempts at resurrecting the past or creating spiritual successors like Star Citizen (Chris Roberts), Shroud of the Avatar (Richard Garriott), Intellivision Amico (Tommy Tallarico), etc.\n\nI love the C64 as it was my second computer and I was heavily into the retrocomputing scene in 2000s/2010s.  There's a lots of great software and hardware that have been built around it by enthusiasts.  It's a very niche market though.  It's hard to envision building a viable large scale business based on the Commodore IP.  What's been developed in the past 25 years hasn't really needed or used the IP, it's hobbiests building their own new things around it.",

I guess they could aim at becoming just another PC peripherals manufacturer, among thousands of others. But I think they're right in being careful with introducing new tech, because that can easily disrupt any nostalgic vibes. And it's hard to get away from the fact that nostalgia is the brand's biggest strength at this point in time.\n\nThe cost savings versions have already been done (e.g. the C64 Mini), plus you can build your own custom one with a Raspberry Pi. The market for that is probably saturated as it is. Most of the potential customers have more money than ever before anyway. \n\nIn my opinion it makes sense to focus on style, quality of life, and tickling that nostalgia neuron as best as they can. Anything else, others can do better, and I think they'll be wise to recognize that.",

Hell, for that matter I only ever saw an Atari home computer in the wild once as well, an Atari ST that by that time was a relic.\n\nI had NO nostalgia for the C64, in my mind, it was barely a step above the Atari 2600.  It wasn't until COVID and I started getting into repairing old consoles and watching Adrian's Digital Basement that I realized what an amazing piece of tech the C64 was, nor that development for it was still very much alive and well.  \n\nI just picked up my first C64 the other day, an NTSC C64C.

          "body": "According to the listing it ships with \"50+ full games including licensed classics\". But beyond that, is it really all that expensive relative to what it is? Let's say you were going to put this together yourself. A new C64 bread bin style case will set you back ~$150 US (https://www.ami64.com/product-page/c64-breadbin-replacement-case-choice-of-colours). Assume you're up for using software emulation instead of an FPGA, so you pick up a raspberry pi, a 64GB sd card and the power adapter and cables. Based on Cana Kit's pricing, let's call it ~$100. Now you also need a 75% mechanical keyboard from somewhere. Let's assume you're going to hack it up and so don't care much for build quality and call it $50. Just in that, you're at the $300 price point, but rather than a complete system you have a collection of parts that you still need to hack apart and re-assemble into a completed product, and said completed product still wouldn't be compatible with original cartridges, disk drives or joysticks if you had any you wanted to use.\n\nSo lets say you instead just want to go the \"buy an original\" route. A \"tested\" C64 with disk drive on ebay can be had for about $175 and another $10 for the composite to HDMI adapter from Amazon. The C64 power supplies are notorious for going bad, and there's a thriving industry of after market ones, so $50 if you floppy drive has an internal supply and doesn't need one, or $100 if you need one for that too. So $235 - $285 for the OG experience. Of course, now you have the opposite problem of the emulated one, you have compatibility with all the old hardware, but no ability to use modern creature comforts like USB, SD cards or modern networking.\n\nHardware is expensive, it always has been. $300 isn't impulse purchase money, but it's also hardly a crazy amount of money to spend on even low end computer hardware these days.",
