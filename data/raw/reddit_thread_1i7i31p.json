Apple isn\u2019t perfect but honestly I left Android for nonsensical reasons and I don\u2019t have time to \u201cfix\u201d my phone anymore. \n\nMy 13 Pro Max that came out on launch day gets all day battery still with ~7 hours screen on and if I pushed it about a day and a half battery. \n\nApple is frustrating but goodness. Android is so open sometimes I feel like it\u2019s closed unless you have tons of time",

I mean to me, if you bought the mini, that wasn\u2019t an all day battery from day 1. RIP if any Mini owner hasn\u2019t changed out a 5 year old battery. \n\nI personally never understood the Mini as a phone and the reason for buying the Pro Max was purely just battery size and more ram. \n\nBut still. Comparing the 4a having a ~30% larger battery than the Mini is oranges and bowling balls no matter the company. \n\nOh yeah. I\u2019m with you. I like Apple but not to a fan boy level by any means. They do wrong as does Google. I guess I\u2019ve just had way way better luck with Apple even if the stuff is way more expensive up front.",

It was the best quality camera I had ever had on a phone and the speaker was the loudest and clearest speaker of any phone I've ever had. \n\nI moved to the current Pixel after and than the 7 and hated them both.  Moved back to a regular pixel 3a and hated it as well.  It was just the XL.\n\nSo I can't give you many definitive answers on why it was better to me besides the camera and speaker and the OS just seemed to run smoother.  The battery also lasted a long time.",

Yes there is an info message on startup which says \"Loading a custom operating system\", but it does not require any interaction or so.\n\nYou need to unlock it temporarily for installation, but that's kind of the point of the lock, and it's fully supported by the device (no hacks necessary, the official OS has a button in the settings).",

I was able to RMA it the first time to get a second one, but that eventually had the same problem (since it was a fundamental flaw with the phone... and fairly common, it turned out). Not at all surprised that Google keeps messing up their phones.\n\nApple has also goofed a software update where music would just randomly stop playing. It affected both my (relatively recent) phone and my rather ancient iPad. The iPad became basically unusable for music, *using Apple's own music service that I paid for a subscription to*, and it still doesn't work at pre-patch levels today (though it's now usable). I wouldn't recommend putting them on a pedestal either. That said, it seemed to be more likely due to poor quality control across all devices receiving the update and not some kind of malicious intent.",

I hold on to my phones forever and it was definitely a problem I experienced prior to the update, especially since I live in a colder climate. It\u2019s possible that Apple took advantage of the problem or that it conveniently pushed people to replace their phones earlier (though battery replacement *will* reset the speed), but the basis for the change is legitimate. I\u2019d rather have my phone be a little slow than crash randomly when I\u2019m in a bind.",
