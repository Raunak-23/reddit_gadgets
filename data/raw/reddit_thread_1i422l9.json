However, the app sells subscriptions to pay for development. Now the app store doesn't make money unless it also collects on those subscriptions.\n\nThere are lots of ways to try to stop this kind of skirting of the rules, for example you could charge a flat amount for selling an app on the service. That would punish smaller companies that are selling simple and small apps and give larger ones a nearly-free ride. So we end up with the current solution. It's not perfect but every solution is going to cause some issue, this is large companies pointing fingers at each other and generating rage in their users to the company's benefit.",

It's the price of doing business.\n\nNow, perhaps we should look at that practice but I'm not sure that it can be changed. Yes, it might be good to cut down profit margins and lower prices but that will only go so far. At some point people need to get paid for their work, it's just a matter of how much is fair.\n\nSo what's a justifiable cut for creating API, developing tools, running an online store, vetting products on it, and so on? I can't say. A lot of times the fees drop down to 15% for those stores, so it can be done, but how low can it drop before it becomes unprofitable to run them?\n\nThe old models of individuals selling software without a combined storefront had its costs too, ones that severely punished the smaller players. A Microsoft can create an online store and sell their stuff through it at a very discounted cost, an independent developer would have to spend a ton of their time and money on running one. So it can be a very good thing to have a Steam or similar, it allows smaller developers to sell their stuff without the large overhead of a store.\n\nSo, what's a fair fee for that sort of thing? I'm not just talking about a guess at the amount, I'm talking about a detailed analysis of what's fair. For all we know, 30% might be fair. After all, back in the day of physical stores they might sell a product to a retailer for $10 and the retailer would resell it for $20. That's a 100% cut! A 30% cut, when it first came out, was looked at as an incredible value by many independent developers.",

Although both have a commission for paid apps, and in-game purchases.\n\nBut the amount of apps with expensive subscriptions is way too high on iOS compared to Android. You\u2019ll have to install like 10 apps if you\u2019re looking for something basic like an alarm that plays a song or Spotify, and 9/10 apps come with an expensive subscription.\n\nOn the plus side iOS preinstalled stock apps are usually slightly better than their Android version. I mean you\u2019ll have to pay a premium, and I hope some of that was spent on additional app development, and usability studies. So those apps might be enough for many users.\n\nI don\u2019t mind paying 3-5 \u20ac once for a good app that I use almost daily. But something like 9.99 $ a month is ridiculous. Even MS Office charges less a month for the complete package. Although I get it that a onetime purchase might not cover a reoccurring, yearly fee for apps with a small user base.\n\nI don\u2019t get people who rather sit through multiple ads per day, or the ones who permanently take 1/4 of the bottom screen. Especially, if it\u2019s a onetime payment for no ads that\u2019s less than 5 \u20ac, and they use the app daily. Just buy one less Kebab or Starbucks Coffee, and you\u2019re good.\n\nI know there\u2019s a rather complicated workaround to use Spotify as your alarm but that shouldn\u2019t be necessary. Just make it part of the alarm tone selection. Even Apple Music would be sufficient.",
