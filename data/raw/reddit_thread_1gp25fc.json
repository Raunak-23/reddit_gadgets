An issue which persisted for multiple releases, then was silently fixed, all while Apple vehemently denied any wrongdoing on their part.\n\nAnd make sure wherever you open it up at has zero humidity, because they spent a gajillion bajiliion dollars on R&D that has shown the most effective way to place a pin that connects to the 40V power line is next to a 5V power line pin that powers your display assembly so that it fries immediately.",

I think Apple indulges in a certain amount of wishcasting, in which they design for \"if we lived in a perfect world in which everything always behaved like it is supposed to,\" and that is amplified by an additional level of \"if Macs just behaved exactly like iPhones and iPads.\"\n\nThat latter has presumably informed design decisions like having all your windows reopen when you restart your system by default (and always after a software-induced restart like a macOS update), regardless of quantity and startup lag that might entail; a laptop with only a single USB-C port; and having a few years of no startup chime for laptops, leaving you with no way of knowing whether the computer had turned on or not during its pre-start tests. And possibly this decision, too.",

Also, it's generally colder where I live so that power isn't wasted since it's offsetting how much my furnace needs to run (even though my furnace runs on natural gas and it's more efficient).\n\nI would be shocked if the real cost was more than $50/year.

As they changed the direction of the main cavity machining op from the back->front to bottom->top, the only place where there is plastic is on the bottom of the device.\n\nThe new Mac mini enclosure is probably a *lot* faster to machine now. Its a pretty deep cavity to machine from the back on the old Mac Minis with another op for the assembly/base cutout.\n\nThis new one is basically a single op for the main cavity, and then 4-5 cuts for the ports.\n\nIts likely much easier to assemble as well. Instead of needing to install the cooling system after the installation of the main \"cassette\", you can basically install everything stacked into the shell.\n\nTaking a look at photos of the shell itself, the floating standoffs are wild. Thats some really cool tooling work to do those undercuts at scale. Most companies would just add reliefs to their PCBs and skip the undercut.\n\n8 years later and im *still* scratching my head to how these holes were machined on the iPhone 7.

When you do an extruded aluminum shape doing cutouts like this is difficult, and requires extra machine time after the fact to finish them (costing $$$). If they had put it on the front or back as part of the case then this would have increased the cost of making the case by a few $ in machine time.   Putting it on the bottom plastic is much cheaper.",

You can like Apple and yet admit they make some mistakes. And if their excuse is cost to change it just makes them worse. \n\nFor instance. I have a Gpro from Logitech that I really like for editing, gaming, browsing. The battery last forever, I only charge it every few weeks. But the thing that I think is absolute dog shit is that it takes a micro usb, and even their revision does and I\u2019m still not sure if the latest one is on usb c yet. Everyone hates that about that mouse pretty much and the revisions are pretty shitty to not have usb c. I don\u2019t have any other device that takes micro usb and so it\u2019s annoying to have one taking up usb space on top of that.",
