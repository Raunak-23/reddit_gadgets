Nintendo has sued on the basis of a ton of patent violations (not trademark violations), based on a slew of patents they filed only after Palworld had been released for over a year. Included in these absolutely ridiculous patent claims are mechanics such as: \"Aiming and capturing characters,\" \"Smoothly switching riding objects in a virtual environment,\" and \"Initiating conflict via launching one creature at another.\" If those sound incredibly broad and commonplace, that's because they are. Nintendo is using the patent system to try and shut down competition that is (rightfully) highlighting the inadequacy of their own titles.\n\nI say again: Fuck Nintendo.",

They were definitely hit and miss with including pack in games, and is definitely greed at this point. $450 for 5 year old tech, and trying to charge for a glorified interactive manual is WILD. There might be a couple of others that might have came with games, but my memory isn't perfect lol.\n\nHaving that extra free game packed in gets people's attention, and makes it easier to get them to be part of the ecosystem of the platform. Now, it's a SIGNIFICANTLY harder pill to swallow when trying to charge $80+ for a Mario Kart game, that will more than likely have DLC if it does well, making it cost that much more.\n\nI wouldn't mind having a Switch 2, but with prices and other anti consumer practices they're trying to pull, along with software rising in price ranges above $70, and companies that will abuse the Game Key Card function that nullifies Nintendo's plug in play aspect of the Switch, despite physical games for Switch still sell VERY well compared to other platforms, but it's hard to swallow that pill. It seems so weird to alinate so many of the users of the past console, while making it unaffordable for others during a horrible economic time, and requiring SD Express that's barely used, and very expensive, along with 20% price hikes on all accessories around using similar and removed tech from the Switch 1, and the new tech being used has been around of over 20 years.\n\nIt's just too much for those who don't make a whole lot.",

The N64 did cost $400 in today\u2018s prices.\n\nNeither.\n\nIssue is those games cost as much as they did because they required specialized, expensive, and licensed Cartridges from Nintendo. Same goes for the SNES and NES. Nintendo used to always discount their hardware after a few years as well. They don't do this anymore, same with their games via \"Player's Choice\" and stopped that too.\n\nTrying to compare prices to modern games today doesn't exactly work since the price varied on the cartridge to begin with (or potential helper chips added too), and was so expensive for publishers, it could nearly bankrupt them. It really doesn't cost that much for  Switch carts compared to the N64 or the SNES. Switch carts should be much cheaper than specialized carts for the SNES or N64 with helper chips even, and digital releases are an option now too, which makes these price points further make no sense.\n\nNot to mention a majority of price increases have been because of greed. Especially with Xbox's case. There is no universe that anyone is ever going to convince me that Mario Kart World is worth more than $60. These companies keep making profit, and record profit when prices keep going up. That should tell people something.\n\nEdit: Yes, downvote instead of refute. Next thing I know, you'll be using the the price of Neo Geo AES/MVS games to try justifying these greedy price increases for modern games. There's a reason why they cost as much as they did, but let's ignore that to think there's a pointless point to be made...",

Also all games were a cartridge that was mine forever I could sell it, or in my case I still have it and can still play it.  I am extremely skeptical if digital copies of games will work in 30 years, likely the service/server/company may no longer exist or have revoked your license due to some technicality or TOC condition.  \n\n\n\nOh and that $100 N64 controller would work FOREVER, my originals are all fine.

I was aware of this issue, but I would much rather play multiplatform games on my PC which outperforms the switch 2 by quite a bit. To me the Switch and now Switch 2 are just Nintendo machines basically.",

Advanced majority of time spent in games is in a fairly short list of very popular titles and on the switch it\u2019s primarily Nintendo titles which all seem to be okay with some peripheral requiring exceptions. There are also some third-party titles but I think most of them will at least get an update to function on the new console even if they don\u2019t get a boost.",

Should I go over the AMD comparable specs to show how old the performance tech they are using is??????\n\nShows you how clueless you are here on true performance, Spec wise it's lower than a Series S, a lot lower (like by 1/3), and that is a $300 at retail console, the Switch 2 should be no more than $350 based on specs, performance, display and upgrade over the last console.\n\nAnd in Japan, they will be selling the Switch 2 for $330 (converted into to USD), about what it should be sold for....\n\nSure, it's faster than the Switch 1, it costs almost as much as a PS5 and Series X (if you include a game, it's the same price) and is not even in the same ballpark in performance numbers, not even 2/10ths of the performance.\n\nYour post shows you how much of a Nintendo fanboy you are, this console could be $700 and you would still justify it some way or another.\n\nI will stand by my statement; Nintendo is over charging for this console.... There are a lot of facts to back this up...\n\nSwitch 1 was a gloried cell phone processor that was 3-4 years old when released, the Switch 2 is following the same path.\n\nI like Nintendo games but, as a company, I hate them.  I am a true numbers guy, and performance is key, the Switch 2 is a joke for a release in 2025....\n\nDown vote away clueless fanboys...",

Then on top of that chip Nintendo still needs to pay for everything else...\n\nStuff costs what it costs, just because you can't think any further than a benchmark score does not in \"fact\" mean the price should be lower. \n\n>  Down vote away clueless fanboys... \n\nHaving some self-awareness wouldn't hurt.",

      "body": "I was around seven years old, probably in 2006, when I first experienced the internet. I had just started learning to write in school. My older brother already understood how computers worked, but I had no clue. One day, the internet guy came to our house to set it up. I just watched him quietly as he did his work. When he finished, he opened a browser. It was a blank white page with a search bar. He said, \u201cIt works now, you can search for anything,\u201d and then left.\n\nI had no idea what that meant, but I was excited. My mom was sitting next to me. She also did not really know how to use a computer, but she helped set it up for us. I decided to try it out. I was really into Spider-Man at the time, like most kids, so I typed \u201cSpider-Man\u201d into the search bar. Nothing happened. I did not know I needed to add \u201cwww\u201d and \u201c.com\u201d at the end.\n\nLater, my mom spoke on the phone with some people from her village. They told her about a website for their community that started with \u201cwww\u201d and ended with \u201c.com\u201d and had the community name in the middle. She typed it in, and it worked. I was shocked. So I tried \u201cwww.spiderman.com\u201d and it actually opened. The site had pictures and info from the movie company. I could not believe it. I started typing other things like \u201cspider\u201d or \u201cschool\u201d with different endings just to see what would happen.\n\nThen my brother came and typed \u201cGoogle.\u201d That changed everything. Suddenly, we could search anything. Wikipedia came up. We learned so much. We also installed MSN Messenger and started doing video calls. That day felt magical. It was like a new world had opened right in front of me. This tool could answer anything. It felt unreal.\n\nAnd honestly, I feel that same excitement now with AI. The first time I used ChatGPT, I was amazed. It gave me the same feeling I had when I first saw the internet. Of course, ChatGPT back then was much simpler compared to now. But that sense of wonder, the feeling that this would change everything, was exactly the same. It still feels unbelievable what technology can do and make you feel wonder.",
