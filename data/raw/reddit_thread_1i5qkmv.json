Same as with pots. Probably across millions of units there will be some thousands of defective units which do inevitably end up going out, across either type of stick.\n\nBut on potentiometer sticks most people who do receive a defective one will never notice they didn't get a perfect analogue stick vs they will notice if the analogue stick is nonfunctional... vs on Hall Effect sticks the people with defective sticks actually will notice because they will have zero tracking.\n\nThat's why pots were the better choice for the scale that consoles and their pack in controllers are moving on.",

How could you possibly know that?\n\nIt is just a hilariously contrived explanation for all companies supposedly undermining their own products in tandem when the obviously straightforward explanation for why they all do it is readily available.\n\nE.g. if that was their priority, why would Nintendo switch to (pun intended) Hall Effect sticks as per these rumors? They just decide to stop making phat bank on selling new controllers because the bad PR was hurting the Switch (the best selling system) so much or it was too legally risky? \n\n> This is kind of assuming both of them fail at similar rates isnt it? Again, how do you know that?\n\nThe industry standard for electronics is around 2.5% across the board, the reason has nothing to do withinherent robustness of the technologies involved always happens to be the same by chance or that it's impossible to ship e.g. potentiometer sticks with near 0% failure... it's because that is an efficient threshold items commonly converge to due to the way batch testing is conducted statistically, it becomes more expensive with more and more complex items down the chain where these error rates compound and design margins get smaller. Due to supply chain complexity, process variations/yield rates almost never being 100%, basic scale QA testing strategy and engineering markups at every step this is just a general effective threshold most items converge to for mass manufacturing. Fun side point: this kind of QA thresholding is also the exact reason behind the \"$1000 mil-spec screwdriver\" meme.\n\n> And if nintendo can opt for hall effect sticks then clearly it shows that these arent unsuitable for large scale rollouts.\n\nI was only discussing why it has been the case so far, we don't even know for sure if Nintendo is using HE sticks let alone what might have changed their mind on that e.g. maybe they decided that spending more money on HE sticks + more WA is worth it because the PR hit really is worth it anyway since there are no counterbalancing benefits of selling a bunch of pot sticks controllers on degrading pot controllers being considered.

And I am highly impressed with everything 8bitdo. And Ive been kicking myself ever since because there are a few of their models that are were only like $5 more with HE... but I got stuck on wanting  \"smaller\".\n\nMeanwhile I only got my Gamesir X2s like a week ago. This thing is pretty impressive so far. If you are looking for a discount Backbone, this thing is great. Half the price of a Backbone, w/HE joysticks and triggers.\n\nAnd the only reason I got the X2s was because the 8bitdo Backbone-style troller is (for some reason) only for Android (so far). I really like 8bitdo products lol.\n\nIVe heard great things about their SN30, Pro 2, and Ultimate lines of trollers. Just gotta make sure you grab a hall effect version when you are shopping. They have a lot of very similar models, that each have their own little differences.",

On older systems you might have to move the stick a lot more for the same change.\n\nThe problem with higher precision is that if you get a bad reading that is also picked up more easily. That is where the stickdrift issue comes from. Theoretically you can solve that in software enough to at least make these issues manageable but for some reason the industry decided to dumb down the controller interface so hard that at most you get a sensitivity slider.  \nPeopel see these controllers as plug and play hardware you just put in and they have to work without settng up, maintenance or anyy customisation but that is jsut not how precision hardware works.  \nYou sometimes need to set new parameters so that the hardware keeps working perfectly.  \nIt's not difficult to include a short sticks setup guide in your system software. We had that. Not even that long ago i think i saw something like that on the xbox one.\n\nNowadays on the ps5 you can decide how bright the light on the controller is....",

This decrease in accuracy and reliability is dubbed joystick drift, stick drift, or simply drift.\n\nThe \"Hall Effect\" was discovered by a physicist named Hall, who proved that a conductor placed between 2 magnets will produce an electrical current. The important fact here is that none of these components need to touch each other in order to work. Joysticks based on this \"Hall Effect\" technology suffer no stick drift because there is nothing to wear down.\n\nThe only downside? They are more expensive to make (and I believe slightly heavier, but that is very marginal at most. Don't quote me on this.)",

Hall Effect is commonly used in industrial machines and robotic equipment (think anywhere a servo motor exists) to track or index (\u201ccenter\u201d) motor movements. Magnets attached to moving parts (on a wheel, gear, or belt) are used as reference points, which are used to calculate distance, angle, or to calibrate center as they pass over or by the Hall sensor.\n\nIn the case of the new Switch, I\u2019m imagining that there are one or two (at 90\u00b0 to each other) magnets attached to the bottom of the joystick, and two or four (for error correction or redundancy) Hall sensors very close to those magnets to detect the position of the joystick. The magnets induce a varying electrical field in the sensor as they move near it, so in this way, as the joystick is moved around, the position can be calculated by combining the X- and Y-offsets.",

      "body": "Nintendo and broken joysticks. Name a more iconic duo. \n\nI'll believe the problem is solved when I see it. \n\nI had joycon drift with my switch earlier in the lifecycle of the console and they wouldn't fix it and I had to buy new controllers. Then a year later they were fixing them for free, but by then I had already thrown away the old ones and paid full price for new ones. \n\nAs it is, I expect those idiotically designed connectors on the switch 2 to break early and often. But that's not a flaw, that's a feature to force users to have to buy more consoles.",

They have the same issue, and even try to profit off of it, charging 200 bucks for a controller where being able to easily replace the joysticks is a major feature.\n\nMicrosoft isn't any better either, same parts, same plastic, I've cracked open both PlayStation and Xbox controllers and they are pretty much identical in terms of the joysticks.  First party controllers are cheap shit these days and you are better off going third party and making sure they use good hardware, or get good at replacing them with better stuff yourself (the route I went with, funnily enough after the second PS5 controller).  Or at the very least make sure they have a good replacement plan, for all their faults at least Nintendo will fix their controllers for free, Sony and Microsoft will charge you an arm and a leg if it's past their warranty (1 year for Sony,and only *90 days* for Microsoft...)",
