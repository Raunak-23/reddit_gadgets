Something like 95% of PC gaming is done on Microsoft. Xbox One was a sales disappointment for Microsoft, and in all reality, if the 360 wasn't the massive hit it turned into, Microsoft would have already killed it off years ago. Even the most recent generation of Xbox has underperformed and why the talk of killing Xbox off is being floated again. Hell, even talk like this hurts a brand because of the history of Microsoft has concerning products. Why buy another Xbox is Microsoft is just going to kill it in a year or two.",

Even Xbox has been on the chopping block as recently as the current gen, as with the Xbox One underperforming, there was talk of exiting the market. It was talked about after the Xbox, and if the 360 hadn't been the hit it was, Microsoft would have killed it then. They have the money, resources, and talent but never want to give the products time to grow or be found by the consumer. I've been a big pixel fan since the OG, and Google took its time and learned from each generation. Imagine if they had just given up after the first or second gen.",

I definitely still run VM's for that reason. \n\nLiek why tf can't they get Windows management right. Especially full screen. Still misses me off at times. Same for connecting monitors. Windows just randomly disappear for me or resolution may be weird. I have to use third party apps just to try and get basic shit to flow better. With the new windows laptops, I'm tempted to try both and only didn't get both, because windows is a spyware piece of shit with that flashback feature ir wtf they calll it where they spy on your shit.\n\nI don't trust that. There are plenty of reasons still folks may want a windows laptop. My sister hates apple and isn't tech literate. Windows is familiar and has came up in those areas you mentioned.

          "body": "tl;dr: Windows lifecycle support is historically *longer* than macOS. Win11 requirements change things a bit, M1 might change things, but still in the same ballpark for now.\n\n---\n\nM1 was only released in 2020. Remains to be seen how long the support for it will be, since they do own more of the hardware stack than previously.\n\nHistorically, we're looking at maybe 8-10 years support for macOS on older hardware. As in, right now in 2024 the oldest supported hardware is from 2017. Anything older is unsupported. And even the 2017 hardware is only supported on previous versions of macOS that will EoL in 2025 or 2026, it's already been dropped from latest.\n\nWindows, well. Windows 10/11 is a bit of an outlier, since historically you've been able to upgrade just the OS side for well over a decade but the upgrade also wasn't free. Win10 made the upgrade free but then Win11 introduced the first *recent*(ish) processor limits in forever. The support for a single OS version is 10 years from OS release date (which is not tied to hardware, so support for specific hardware ends up varying).\n\nWhat does that look like? Win11 supports processors from 2018 onwards, so those will be good through at least 2031 (10 years from Win11 release). Win10 is EoL in 2025 and the last supported version for 2017 and older processors. So also 8 years for Win10 with 2016/2017 CPUs, 13 years minimum expected for Win11 with 2018 CPUs, and easily over 20 years if you look back at the *oldest* CPUs Win10 supported. All over the shop, but let's go with 8 as a minimum - about the same as current macOS, plus or minus a year.\n\nIn all cases I'm considering latest supported version of the OS for that hardware, upgrades included. Because if we're talking about excluding supported upgrades (like people who insist on staying on Win10 despite Win11 being supported on their hardware), well, you kinda have to apply the same idea to macOS - which is only supported for 3 years per version. So say you insist on staying on macOS 14 despite knowing it'll EoL in 2 years, and refuse to install macOS 15... that's kinda self-inflicted, no?",

It\u2019s just that after multiple Surface products (still have a Surface Book 2)\u2026 I realized I was spending more time tinkering with OS hiccups and a lack of ease of use compared to a MBP + iPad Pro combo. Throw in AirDrop, and it\u2019s painfully obvious that Microsoft only now cares about profits over the customers like me who wanted anything BUT Apple, until I finally caved. I\u2019ve never been happier with a PC like my MacBook M2 Pro and it\u2019s just mind blowing how Microsoft never learned.\n\nDon\u2019t even get me started on trying to fix a Surface product, while I can just walk into an Apple Store and be done with any hardware issues within the day.",

Not to mention the intellimouse basically being a gaming mouse *before* gaming mice were a thing. \n\nI dunno, seems like they want to win over the \"it just works\" apple crowd, when everyone I know that likes microsoft are basically tinkerers and builders, that generally don't like all-in-ones.",
