(Not counting Surfaces as a PC) for awareness to grow.\n\nI think people overestimate how hard it is to cross-compile for Windows on Arm. It\u2019s literally just a couple extra linker and compiler flags and maybe some extra work for remapping your SIMD (for which there are several MIT-licensed [open source projects](https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde) making it dead easy) for an instant 20% CPU lift. Don\u2019t want to port all the middle-ware? Ok just compile for Arm64EC instead. Any competent dev can do it in a couple days on their project (yes, that includes software as complex as AAA games).",

Targeting for Switch means you have ported your SSE/AVX SIMD instructions (used all over a AAA engine for animation, occlusion culling, vector math libraries) into NEON intrinsics. This also happens to be 99% of the pain in x86 -> Arm game ports. This makes the added effort for compiling native Windows on Arm very small, just a couple of MSVC compiler and linker flags and tweaks to build system. There are also instruction mapping libraries like SIMDe which simplify this process greatly. \n\nAdditionally Windows has the Arm64EC binary type which is interoperable with emulated x64, making the porting process even easier in case some proprietary middleware your game depends on has not published Arm libs.\n\nIf you want an example of ported Arm middleware for games just look at the Cyberpunk Switch 2 port. They have a splash screen on game load of all their licensed middleware. For commercial engines you can just pull latest UE5 or Unity and see Windows Arm64 build targets right there.\n\nI will not answer your questions on market adoption or ports, just check back in a year and you\u2019ll see. The effort-to-perf ratio of acquiring 15-20% free CPU perf and better battery is too attractive to pass up.",

This has resulted in us speaking past each other. If you actually care about this topic and want to know more, you can keep reading.  \n  \nx86 has had a 45 year monopoly on personal computing, yes. That can be expected to happen when MS-DOS is written with x86 Assembly. An entire developer ecosystem naturally forms around it too.  \n  \nArm on the other hand has taken a stranger path over the same length of time. As far as Windows goes, it began with Embedded Compact in 2007, graduated to tablets and phones with Windows 8 RT in 2012 (with several iterations over the next decade), and now to the laptop form factor in 2024 with Windows 11.   \n  \nWindows 11 introduced 64-bit Arm as a first class citizen to the operating system. It also added MSVC Arm 64-bit compilers for developers to easily build for the native runtime. Additionally, the complementary x64 emulation layer enables the decades of published software for the platform, which will become less and less needed as more developers target native. Considering all of that, plus remote debuggers, integrating support for it into a AAA game build system is as simple as doing so for other platforms like PS5 or Xbox (which I have also done).\n\nAll of this is to say that there are forces more powerful than current markets, there is also the force of a 10+ year compounding momentum of technological progress coming at the market like a tsunami. The advantages of RISC-based architectures for battery life and performance are clear; we already know NVIDIA is working on one too which is going to be huge and only further accelerate all of this. \n\nAdditionally, pointing out low market adoption while using a Macbook as a superior example does not make any sense, when OSX has less than 2% of usage in the Steam Hardware Survey. \n\nI am also an engineer in this industry, have been writing high-performance low-level software for 15+ years, and work on things directly concerned with this topic. I don't really care whether you believe me or not, because I can tell that you are someone that cares more about being right on the internet rather than having good-faith discussions. I can simply go into work tomorrow and push things a little further along, and know you will believe me in the end once the next generations of hardware come out and all the games run on them fast as fuck.",

You haven't demonstrated one thing.\n\nI can see your attacks are immature, so you have resorted to name calling because you don't have a leg to stand on.  It's so funny you keep bringing up the macbook.  You must be really butt hurt about mac's. I said it was better than the qualcom.  That's it. You said you would bet against that, which shows you don't know anything. You still have a reading comprehension issue and so you make stuff up to attack.  Arm servers have nothing to do with Mac, but yet you are trying desperately to make a correlation to attack me. Logical thinking and reading comprehension are not your forte bud.\n\nPoor liitle gamerz boy got his ego hurt because he can't prove anything.  Keep moving the goal posts. Lets see what bs you can add to the conversation next.\n\nWhat product reviews, or did you just make something up again? Seems so, but if you want me to show you products reviews stomping the Surface I can.\n\nSense you are a gamerz dude, show me the superior arm gaming machine I can buy right now, fool.  Games are the most surgically optimized form of software?  Wow, that the most asinine thing I've ever heard. Did you really come up with that yourself, or are you relying on your chatgpt buddy.\n\nThe point is- you have nothing to show that is superior in any form that I can buy right now.  No Sht something in future will be more performant.  Everything will be.  If that's all you have to go on, is something made up in the future, then have fun in la la land.",
