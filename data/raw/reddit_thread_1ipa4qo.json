And the form factor when folded is way more useful than a dual fold. Like movies don't really work with the dual fold's aspect ratio, there's still large black bars.\n\nThat being said, this is probably gonna cost like $2200+ considering the fold costs like $1800. I wouldn't even be surprised if it was closer to $2500.",
