          "body": "Theres more than just this problem.\n\nI claim that the strict OS and bootloader controls Meta uses on their headsets is against right to repair- I have 2 quest 2 headsets with different bricks (not from the recent update and out of warranty; one of them I got for cheap in an attempt to repair and replace the other). The headset doesn't allow downgrades or complete reinstalls, one has a \"black screen of death\" and the other remains stuck on boot. Both headsets are broken in terms of software (or firmware, but its not exactly a hardware fix)\n\nCompanies like meta, Samsung, apple, Microsoft, should be forced to allow at minimum downgradability and complete reinstalls of device firmware and operating systems, under the right to repair. \n\nTaken a step further, I believe when I purchase the hardware, I now own that hardware (not the software or its design)- the manufacturer can stop or control me from using their software all they want, but if I want to replace their software (which is a hardware level function) I should have the right to, in the name of FOSS and reducing planned obsolescence. The reason they dont let you do thst is security, sometimes to protect the device owner but often to protect the software from hacks and exploits, which can be difficult stop per case, but locking bootloaders is a broad fix at the cost of blocking low level device functions.",
