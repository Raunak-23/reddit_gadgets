Logitech used to be decent but over the last ~10 years every product I bought from them failed and most of them within the warranty period (2 years in the EU). When my last keyboard died I switched to another brand and when my mouse dies I'll be switching away from Logitech altogether. Forever products would be ideal but looking to Logitech to provide them seems foolish.",

Then I put the new switches into the holes, usually having to heat things up to make room in the hole and add a little fresh solder. There were teardowns and instructions from others to help guide what model to seek out for switches.\n\nSome folks have a solder-less method that involves prying so switch case clips open up and then swapping out the internal leaf spring thing and re-assembly.

You can't just swap out a micro USB and USB C connector. That requires a board redesign, and potentially a shell redesign. Modern PCB manufacturering is rarely completely custom these days. A board will be designed to work with a ton of different products for maximum output. That means they only need slim margins to make a profit, and in turn means a much lower cost for the consumer.\n\nWhile the connector prices may not be that much difference in price, it's a lot more work, and that costs money.",

I'm convinced they do it on purpose, I since switched to a Razer Basilisk V3 Pro and while it hasn't quite been 2 years just yet, it's very obvious that it's holding up just fine under daily heavy use in a way that the Logitech mice I've owned in the past 12 years never did. I don't like Razer as a company in general but I've been forced to buy their peripherals twice now and haven't exactly been disappointed. Well, except for their mechanical keyboard switches, but I kind of expected that going in and planned to replace them in short order regardless.",

Got a replacement, which was fine for just under two years before the scroll wheel stopped working again. Logitech's warranty was excellent, though\u2014they let me pick a new mouse up to a value of around \u00a3120 (not sure why they did this but I didn't complain).\n\n**Logitech MX Master** \u2013 I admittedly went for the most expensive one I could find without giving it much thought. After less than a year of use, the side buttons snapped into the mouse.\n\n**Logitech G502 Lightspeed** \u2013 No issues here. Still have it, and it works to this day. The rubber on the sides has worn away over six years of use, but that\u2019s expected.\n\n**Logitech Pro X Superlight 2 Dex** \u2013 I wanted the lightest mouse possible, and this fit the bill. Only had it for a short time so far, but it's an amazing mouse. Highly repairable, too\u2014the rubber sides are replaceable adhesive, and the feet are made of a solid material that\u2019s smooth on my mousepad and doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll need replacing anytime soon.\n\n**Logitech Powerplay** \u2013 Excellent device that removes the need to ever think about charging my wireless mouse. My only criticism is the mouse mat that sits on top of it\u2014there\u2019s no way to stick it down, so once every few months I have to realign it. Minor issue, though.",

In the end, logitech has been the most reliable by far.  I'm sure they have some duds, but they seem to be better than their competitors.",

I also have a skin condition that causes the skin on my fingertips and palms to sweat a lot and shed frequently and my mousepad is dirty so I basically have the worst case scenario for mice.\n\nI can't say anything about the other mice in their line but the G502 series (all of them, I had a Gen1 and now I have a wireless G502 X) hasn't given me problems and I've owned 3 or 4 versions.

Because modern mice now use 3.3v logic, it is easier to just run the switches with 3.3v instead of adding complexity to use 5v. The current is also an order or magnitude lower than what the switches are designed for.\n\nA *very* long video about it here, but the most thorough analysis I've seen on the issue: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BhECVlKJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BhECVlKJA)\n\nTL;DR, the switches are being used out of spec and mouse manufacturers are too tight with money to want to design the circuits properly.",
