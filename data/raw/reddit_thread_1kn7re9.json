Things got better with Ryzen but it still took multiple generations for them to become really popular / first choice for gamers. Personally i was choosing between i7-9700k and R7 2700x in 2018 but because i had used intel in my previous build it felt like the safer choice with no other major differences present.\n\nFor GPUs nvidia has really not delivered for the 40- and 50-series, so there's absolutely an opportunity for intel to get their foot in the door through the budget market if the B770 can offer 5060 ti 16GB like performance at a lower price. Im really excited to see what their next gen will look like now that their designs have had 2 generations time to mature. More competition on the GPU market is a win for everyone (except nvidia).",

Which is exactly my point too, it took multiple generations of Ryzen to become the main choice, despite earlier gens already being competitive.\n\nImo when speaking about the PC gaming \"community\" (for lack of a better word), i think it's fine to use the term enthusiast for anyone building their own PCs and doing a bit of extra research about all parts and maximizing for their budget, not only the people buying the most expensive parts. \n\nThe \"fanbois\" are a very small but vocal minority online. There are massive amounts of people who buy prebuilds and can't remember what parts they have outside of \"intel+nvidia\". They had something that worked and they keep buying newer models of the same stuff. That's a common trait among consumers across all markets. And something like 5-10% better value for money isn't gonna make them break their pattern.",

In fps per dollar and value sure, amd wins all day, but in actual features, raster performance, and especially in productivity, it's not even close.\n\n\nIn CPUs, you have a point. Amd is objectively better than Intel right now, although you can argue Intel is better value. In gaming, amd CPUs are all kinda the same. Very little difference from 9600x, 9700x, 9900x and 9950x. The x3ds of course smoke the normal processors, but the difference between 9800x3d, 9900x3d, and 9950x3d isn't huge, and the last two are way out of most peoples budget.\n\n\nJust a few generations ago, I'd argue Intel was still better. Bluescreening and overheating aside, 14900k is probably a better buy than say 7950x3d. But then the quality issues happened, and Intel completely dropped the ball with core ultra and lga 1851 which is already dead. It's really only the last generation or two amd became better, and it's more so due to Intel and Nvidia messing up than amd actually becoming better.",

That being said, there\u2019s a pretty big hole in the $400-600 price range, with the 5060ti and 5070 being pretty underwhelming for the price they ask, and the 9070 series costing $200-300 more, effectively putting them at $750-900. If Intel put something somewhere inbetween, with decent vram capacity and possibly close to 5070 performance, they could easily win the low-midrange market.\n\nMy issue is that we\u2019re 5 months in to this generation, yet we have next to no info regarding higher end battlemage gpus.
