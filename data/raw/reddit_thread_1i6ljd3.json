It would be entirely feasible too make a reasonably priced phone with performance equivalent to that of five years ago, but the kind of battery life your talking about.\n\nYou could also make a similar phone that has virtually infinite battery longevity (i.e., the capacity doesn't drain over time so you never need to replace it) by using a modern battery, but preventing it from ever charging above 75% or discharging below 25%.  It would need to be recharged daily since you're only actually using half of the stored charge, but it wouldn't degrade over time.",

Many are lying around as touch controls for various applications, and when one of them finally does die I have to replace it. If my regular phone is getting older, I'll often buy a new phone so I can retire the current one to whatever needs replacement.",

And my point was that if, for whatever reason, you want to buy a new phone, wouldn't you like to be able to choose from a current roster?\n\nTo be clear, I think what the author of the article is proposing is myopic and stupid (he suggests going back to the tick tock cadence Apple used to use, where big number changes happen every two years, and we get an S model in between). It results in the same thing for the consumer. He's complaining as a journalist (I think?) that he has to cover a major launch every year, even though the changes are incremental at best.",

She'll be getting credits every month on her bill for 24 months or 36! Months, but if she cancels, she'll owe what's left. \n\nIt's fine if you know what you're getting into, but so many people would be better off not doing an installment plan with premium service. It's normalized, but for sure, it is predatory. They'll take the hit and give cheap phones because the amount they get from the service cost more than makes that up. \n\nYou can definitely go on a pre-paid plan and get the phone thru samsung or apple programs for less than the cost of service at the big 3. Additionally, you'll pay the sale tax of the whole cost of the device. If you have a flagship that's only 1-2 years old, you do not need to upgrade, and it's a total luxury waste. The upgrade incentives are there to lock you into expensive service plans and keep you there. If you can and want to, by all means, go for it. I would recommend trading in thru samsung and apple themselves rather than a carrier if possible.",

Think about how much more factory capacity you need, for example, to ramp up to resupply all of your customers at once, versus 1/4-1/2 of them every year. Think about the risk you need to take if, for example, your phone burns up on an airplane and everyone decides not to buy \\*that\\* model. \n\nAlso, and this is a hardware thing more than software: adding new features is often easier to do as a sequence of small changes rather than one big change. There's a trade off between frequency and test overhead, but harware development tends to prefer these yearly cycles.\n\n  \nBottom line, don't worry about it. Buy a new phone when you need it. MFG's will figure out the ROI and react. Marketing will of course continue to insist you need to update every millisecond.",

Different manufacturers were experimenting with different form factors-- slide out keyboards, pivoting screens, flip open laptop type phones, etc.  It was great.  \n\nThen for years a drought- phones became boring identical carbon copy clones, losing the few distinctive features they previously had (IR transmitters, I/O ports, extra storage, etc).  \n\nSorry guys but *I'm bored.*  There's nothing EXCITING coming out!  And I'm sorry but AI is NOT exciting- the only thing I need to know about AI is how to turn it off.  \n\nBendable screens have given us a *little* innovation- flip-open phones are the first actual innovation we've had in a while.  And I've seen a few cool concept prototypes that probably won't actually get made.  \n\nI'd love to have something like the [Global Link from Earth: Final Conflict](https://www.therpf.com/forums/threads/earth-final-conflict-global-link.268850/)- it was a handheld pod-type device, the side would pop out on an accordion arm and pull a rollable screen behind it.  The screen could be pulled out more or less depending on what functionality was needed.",

The processing speed on phones are capable of doing what a phone should be able to; any more would be specific for gaming, which not everyone needs.\n\nThe only real improvements we've seen are in the cameras and batteries. It'd also be nice if repairability was improved, and thankfully, all the brands are moving in the right direction there.\n\nBut other than that, what else are phones supposed to innovate on? I feel that every flagship is just a new shiny incremental upgrade on the previous model that is wholly overpriced. A phone a few years ago would still work perfectly fine for most people today; they've become more of a symbol than anything else.\n\nI'd rather they improve on their mid-tier range phone offerings. Reduce the number of models they have to streamline its production to increase the overall quality of that mid-tier, and make that their primary product. Most people don't need the fancy new shiny stuff; they need something that works and is affordable.",

It undermines everything that preceded it and makes the article feel like propaganda to support the idea of pushing even more useless updates every 6 months.\n\nIf the hardware isn't advancing, and the companies still fail to deliver software updates along with new hardware, then what the hell are they selling us? The promise of shelling out a few hundred bucks every time you feel FOMO?\n\nA real conclusion to this issue would be to call out the \"Steve Jobs\" tech cycle for the massive social, economic, and environmental catastrophe that it is: bad; and then to call for regulation from government, becuase we clearly can't trust these big corporations to make good choices for the well-being of the people, society, and the world.\n\nFor example: a law that makes businesses liable for handling the waste they create. For most things that means a buy-back program tied to a clean recycling system(don't keep shipping chips overseas for poor children to get sick dismantling). If they want to save money after that, they would need to redesign some parts to be recycled, but until then they would need to reduce the amount of old devices being bought back, which means longer life cycles and longer customer support and more easily available repair services.\n\nThis is late-stage capitalism destroying everything that it relies on to survive. What happens when people stop buying phones every year if the buisness is designed around that? Collapse. \n\nGreed is bad capitalsim.",

Every year, I get excited for the newest releases.\n\nI've spent time with the S22 Ultra, S23 Ultra, and have used the S24 Ultra for the last 8 months or so. It might sound crazy to say this, but each was actually a pretty big upgrade from the last.\n\nI had the lowest storage variant of the S22 Ultra which had less RAM than the others. It could get bogged down in app switching and DEX. Switching to the S23 Ultra meant getting better cameras, battery, and performance. It actually felt kinda worth it. \n\nCrazy as it sounds, the S24 Ultra has been my favorite upgrade ever. The new Gorilla Glass with built in anti-glare and flat edges is such a huge quality of life feature. The battery is truly \"I never think about battery life\" good. The software has been rock solid and has gotten better. It was worth it.\n\nThe S25 Ultra doesn't look worth it. The camera setup seems like a downgrade (I like the 10X lens). The S-Pen losing Bluetooth is super obnoxious if you've ever used it as a camera shutter or anything else. It looks like it may be a bit chunkier, even if rounded edges are better. This one probably doesn't need to exist.",

Phones advance fast enough what more do you want?
