Someone might spend a decade trying to model suturing, Krieger said. And that\u2019s suturing for just one type of surgery.\n\nI wonder how good it can recover from things going wrong.

But even with a million videos, if none of those includes the specific mistake or unexpected problem, the robot won't be able to learn to recover from it.\n\nRecovering from a suture point moving to an unexpected spot is one thing, because all it has to do to recover is just find the string again and perform the same operation it was performing in the first place, but suppose something happens like a foreign object falls in, an object that was never in the training data. Does the robot know it has to remove it from the patient? Can it distinguish it's a sponge/piece of the ceiling/insect/broken instrumental that has to be picked up or thrown out, and tell it apart from something like a tumoral growth that it must not touch?\n\nThere are probably solutions to training for these, but it's quite more complex than just \"make it watch more videos\". AI can imitate humans, but unless we finally develop AGI, the AI will be limited in understanding based on it's training, and not be able to handle complex creative situations a human could device on the spot.\n\nThe good thing is that these types of robots don't need to be completely perfect to be useful, and can be implemented in low-risk surgeries with human supervision, while the technology continues to be perfected.",

While that alone is, admittedly, pretty impressive by itself, keep in mind that surgeons often let med students do that, and mostly unsupervised too. This is, by comparison, not a big deal compared to the actual surgery and you have perfectly well-trained medical staff around you if something really, *really* goes wrong (surgeon typing the report, anaesthesist keeping the patient sedated, nurses cleaning up instruments - all in the immediate vicinity); like if you puncture a big artery or something, and this rarely ever happens during stitching up. That's only 'surgery' in the broadest sense from a physician's point of view. It's (relatively) trivial, even a decades-long psychiatrist should be able to remember basic stitching techniques from med school.\n\nPoint is: The robot has been taught the most basic surgical task. It's a first step and it looks promising, but there's still a LONG way to go before I would even trust it with just removing my gall bladder (already a rather trivial task for visceral surgeons).",
