I don't give a fuck what your politics are, companies are not people.  A person can own their creation for their entire life, and they can give it to their great grandchildren to own, and they can pass it on indefinitely for all I care.  But a company is not a person; it has no thoughts, creativity, nor desires; and it should have restrictions on it's ability to profit on any such things.\n\nIf there is unreleased music from Michael Jackson, Prince, or any other virtuoso, and their catalog is owned by their family, then that is still a human being who has creative control over their creation.  It's theirs to hold, share, or profit off of at their whim.  If it's owned by a company then it should absolutely be vulnerable to use-it-or-lose-it.",

In 14 years that comic book enters public domain and now your competitors can use your characters which creates confusion since then there will be different books with different plots and stories that do not interact with each other. That's like if there are 12 different Supermans all having same background and premise but entirely different execution. \n\n\nIf you want creative competition. Encourage people to make Ultraman. Not make Superman go public domain near instantly. I am not a fan when companies gate keep old stuff but this is a case where I agree and think that intelligent property should not go public domain just because.

I think it should maybe be longer, like maybe 25 years. Nothing I've said denies that. Your point is pointless. Indefinitely timed ownership of intellectual property stifles creativity, both by the owner and by new artists. Disney buying and leaning into established IPs has seriously hamstrung their ability to create new and innovative stories. It's cheaper easier and safer economically to pump out the same thing over and over. I'm tired of sequels to sequels of sequels. Give me Atlantis or Treasure Planet, not Star Wars Episode 69 or Avengers: Rehashed Basic Slop. Locking those IPs away from new artists indefinitely also drastically limits the pool of ideas they can draw from. They certainly weren't all good, but look at the incredible stories that came out of the Star Wars EU when George Lucas was in control and allowed for that? Imagine the incredible stories we could have now if Star Wars has gone public domain instead of being bought out by Disney. Theoretically, anybody could write whatever stories they wanted in the established universe, including wild crossovers, medieval Jedi, whatever they wanted. Then, Lucas and/or his estate could determine what is canon and not, what fits into the Main story, simply through the power of respect as the original artist. I feel this would encourage him to write new characters and stories. He would own the new stories/characters, and profit off them, without owning the old characters and stories. Or, better yet, create a new and original IP instead.",

In one novel Luke has children and in a second one he doesn't. Say what you want about new canon but one thing that Disney did right is keep canon consistent. \n\n\nAnd this leads to my main point. When something hits public domain, the franchise can be considered dead since then you'll have different branches of non canonical bs that will be very hard for anyone to follow.  \n\n\nI love Star Wars and Avengers. I'd rather have them hire better writers than make these stories public domain and sit through reddit to see what is worth reading and what isn't because I don't have the time to sit through and consume every single Avengers story where Ant Man goes inside Thanos' asshole and uses fork to kill him. If I want to read cheesy sequels, I'll open Wattpad. \n\n\n On the other hand. Gatekeeping characters from Star Wars/Avengers makes people create their own characters which can be inspired by the source material but often times it develops into its own thing (Invincible and The Boys). This is even better as people will literally be forced to make brand new IPs instead of relying on the public's love for Iron Man to sell \"Iron Man and Sonichu\".",

We played it, loved it, and I had the courage to ask him for it. He gave me the \"we'll see\". \n\nI'd go to my grandpa's house and pester him to ask my Uncle Charles for it and he'd too go \"we'll see\". A year went past and I all but gave up hope but still asked during the Fall as shit, he gotta be swinging through one day to drop this thing off!!!!\n\n.....AND HE DID! Got it like a week before Christmas. I missed him personally but I got the console in a paper bag. I just felt this well of emotion. I finally had it. Had it w/the Mario game I was hammering that day, too! I went home feeling like a king.\n\n.....And to add a fun twist to this story, I then got a PS1 that just came out for Christmas as well. My grandma didn't anticipate my Uncle Charles actually doing it and bought the PS1 off QVC on launch day. So now we had TWO consoles and that rental store was booming for a while :)\n\nIt is for this reason when my cousin asked me for my DS a decade ago I went \"we'll see\" and gave it to him for his birthday a few months later. I couldn't hold back my excitement",

In the early 2000s, some emulator developers found that certain late-era SNES games don't run correctly when the emulator's Digital Signal Processor (DSP) sample rate is set to the Nintendo-specified value of precisely 32,000 Hz (a number derived from the speed of the APU clock). Developers tested actual hardware at the time and found that the DSP was actually running at 32,040 Hz and that setting the emulated DSP to run at that specific rate suddenly fixed the misbehaving commercial games.\n\nDevelopers intentionally wrote their code expecting a higher clock speed than the spec. While it doesn't confirm it outright, there's a good chance it was due to the heating issue.",

If it is not detectable by the user and doesn\u2019t prevent the usability of the device, it\u2019s not unreliable. An unreliable console would be one that doesn\u2019t startup consistently. Or one that resets/powers-off randomly. That\u2019s not the SNES and nobody in the article made that argument. \n\nYou can purposely misinterpret and bend the meaning of reliable/unreliable all you want. You can lie and say they *directly said it was an unreliable console** then paste quotes where they didn\u2019t say \u2018unreliable\u2019 and then argue that their words are \u2018interpreted\u2019 as unreliable, all you want.
